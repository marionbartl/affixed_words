Stowed aboard Discovery during the STS - 119 launch on March 15 , 2009 , the moon rock inside its case was in turn packaged inside a padded container labeled " Apollo 11 sample " .
Thisstory was updated at 3:23 p.m. EDT .
Forty yearsto the day after it was found and collected by Neil Armstrong , a moon rock ishelping NASA mark the anniversary of the first lunar landing from onboard a perchthat is closer than any Apollo - returned lunar sample has ever come to itsoriginal home in decades .
Aswas learned exclusivelyby collectSPACE.com , the moon rock was secretly launched aboard a March2009 space shuttle mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , where onMonday night it will be revealed during a NASA 40 thanniversary celebration of the Apollo program at the National Air and SpaceMuseum in Washington , DC .
The 21 gram ( 0.7 oz ) moon rock is only the second out of the 842 pounds ( 382 kg ) of lunarsamples collected by the Apolloastronauts between 1969 and 1972 to be launched back into space .
And thoughits journey is planned as a round trip - it will return to Earth as it camewith a future shuttle mission - the rock 's return to space symbolizes in partNASA 's current effort to return astronauts to the Moon .
Notquite " Operation Moon Rock " but still a secret
To keep themoon rock 's launch a secret , NASA limited the number of people who were in theknow , including within the special laboratory where the agency keeps and preparesthe moon rocks for scientific study , educational display and the occasionaltrip into space .
The agencydid not however , circumvent its established system for readying items to go toorbit .
" Thiswas not a deeply organized ' Operation Moon Rock ' project , " explained BobJacobs , NASA 's acting assistant administrator for public affairs , in an e-mailinterview with collectSPACE.com .
" It is not unusual for us tomanifest items for various education and outreach purposes .
We followed thesame procedures . "
Indeed , aspre- launch photos obtained by collectSPACE.com reveal , the rock wasprepared and packaged alongside other supplies heading to the station aboardspace shuttle Discovery 's STS - 119 mission .
In one photo , a package of cherry licoricecandy intended for a station crew member is lying by the moon rock carrier ' sside .
Pickinga " return sample " to return to space
Althoughprocedures existed to launch items to the space station , the same could not besaid for how to prepare - or pick - a moon rock to go back to space .
The ideawas first put forward by the few among NASA 's public affairs staff who wereaware of the project to Dr. Gary Lofgren , a senior planetary scientist and theLunar Curator at the LunarReceiving Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Lofgrenrecounted what his first reactions were of the idea to collectSPACE.com .
" Ooh , that 's an interesting idea .
I wonder if we should do that ?
Hmm ... well , thatmight be good publicity , " recalled Lofgren .
It was n' thowever , his decision to make .
" Wehave a charter committee of scientists that reviews all the requests for lunarsamples from a scientific point of view .
If they do n't approve of it , itdoes n't happen , " he explained .
" In the end , they decided to go aheadand do it . "
Lofgren did choose the rock to be used .

You often hear designers say , “ Good designers copy .
Great designers steal . ”
Well , anyone who says this is one of three types of designers :
One who copies , one who steals or one who admits that not copying and stealing is hard but still tries not to anyway .
For some reason , a lot of web designers believe that there ’s nothing truly unique left to create and that there is no such thing as originality .
I disagree , or at least I do n’t want to accept that notion .
You should n’t either .
Designers who copy
These people are at the bottom of the design pyramid , which is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
You have to start somewhere .
Designers who copy are novices who have n’t yet grasped what makes a great design great , and so they imitate .
They frequent web galleries , pick a site they like and find a way to recreate and adapt it to the project at hand .
This is how anyone learns anything .
In fact , this is how we learn to , among other things , walk and talk as babies .
We imitate to build a foundation of experience .
My very first website was a fan site for the anime Dragon Ball Z , which I loved as a kid .
In the process of creating this site , I taught myself HTML by copying the code from another Dragon Ball Z site that I liked .
I literally copied and pasted all of the code , but then I went through it line by line , learning what each tag did .
By the time I designed my next site , I was able not only to understand code but to create my own code from scratch .
Designers who steal
These are , of course , the people who say , “ Good designers copy .
Great designers steal . ”
Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch once said :
“ Nothing is original .
Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination .
Devour old films , new films , music , books , paintings , photographs , poems , dreams , random conversations , architecture , bridges , street signs , trees , clouds , bodies of water , light , and shadows .
Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul .
If you do this , your work ( and theft ) will be authentic .
Authenticity is invaluable ; originality is non-existent .
And do n’t bother concealing your thievery ; celebrate it if you feel like it . ”
This sums up these burglars well .
Once a designer has copied another ’s design and feel they have a grasp of what makes a great design great , their natural inclination is to go and create their own great and unique design .
But they soon discover that doing that is not as easy as the other designer made it seem .
They learn that the dirty secret of many great designers is that they steal .
In design , to steal is to take inspiration from other people ’s work .
Designers who steal may frequent online design galleries , like designers who copy , but they know how to hide their sources .
“ The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources . ” — Albert Einstein
They take only pieces of sites or just the overall concept or theme of something .
In 2003 , designer Cameron Moll wrote an article titled “ Good Designers Copy , Great Designers Steal ” in which he shows the source of a logo he created .
Moll explains :
“ The chances of someone else having used this particular piece of clip art were very slim .
And the chances of the intended audience — or anyone else , for that matter — being familiar with such a piece were even slimmer .
Translation ?
A perfect source for stealing . ”
Designers who try not to copy or steal
It ’s a fact that we ca n’t help but be influenced by our surroundings .
Designers steal all the time without realizing it .
A designer may look at the curvy lines of Moll ’s logo above and months later may create a logo very similar to it without actually recalling where they got the idea from .
Designers in this category are aware of this habit .
They know that creating something truly unique is almost impossible , but they try anyway .
To try , they may start by looking at online print galleries , instead of web galleries .
They may also begin looking at package design , architecture , photography , nature — anything but web design — in an attempt to be authentically inspired rather than simply steal .
They look not just for design that works but rather for ways to make designs better .
After walking around a park in search of inspiration for a blog on nature , a designer may find him or herself using images of grass and soil to dress up the footer of the site to look like ground .
They might add some birds to the header .
Or , after sitting on a bench and noticing the relationship between foreground and background , they might play around with the user ’s sense of perception .
The further a designer who seeks inspiration moves away from web design , the more likely their designs will turn out truly original .
To sum up …
The pursuit of originality on the web is not a lost cause .
The web industry is still young , and some things have yet to be attempted .
Once you understand the basics of design , try to think outside the box , and try new and different things .
Be atypical and unique .
Experiment .
Do n’t be afraid to design from the heart .
But keep this in mind :
“ Things which are different in order to be different are seldom better , but that which is made to be better is almost always different . ”
— Dieter Rams
In our striving to be unique and original , trying different things for their own sake is okay because they could potentially lead to better things .
It ’s a lot like throwing darts at a target blindfolded .
You may never hit the target , but you just might learn something in the process .
But do try hard to make something better than just different .
Not too long ago , people thought the Earth was flat and the center of the universe .
Not too long ago , either , designers used the < blink > tag and used tables to build websites .
Theories and conventions are always being questioned , challenged and broken , and they should .
If you believe a better way is possible , you will often find your way to it .
“ The most innovative designers consciously reject the standard option box and cultivate an appetite for thinking wrong . ” — Marty Neumeier

The Twitter Revolution has changed the blogging world .
Some of my most favorite blogs have changed and become mere tweets .
Â
In some ways blogs were bound to be replaced like any king of the mountain business .
Just ask Mark Cuban .
For those not in the know …
Â
Twitter is a service by which messages are sent in 140 character segments .
It seems to be a new fad amongst the techies .
I have been slow to jump on the Twitter band wagon but over the last 6 months I have been using it .
Some simple observations are that twitter is a cool tool to communicate and stay abreast of new information by those whom you follow .
The problem is if you follow more than about 10 people who tweet often it becomes a full time job .
Reading 140 characters about others becomes a monster to keep up with especially in a busy world .
I have tried to use software to make it better .
Things like twirl and tweetdeck .
Â
While they both made it easier to tweet than going to twitter.com it still was overwhelming .
Â I needed something to condense the task .
Â I stumbled upon Twitterforbusypeople.com .
I find that it ’s easier to browse through tweets and read what ’s important to me .
Twitterforsbusypeople gives you three views , last hour , last day and more than 1 day ago .
I find that helpful in that who cares about last week ’s tweets .
If you use twitter as a tool , I suggest that you give it a try .

Today ’s article is brought to us by guest writer , Justin Maxwell .
Justin will explain the technique he fine tuned for Mint.com to ellipsis text using just CSS .
For more information about Justin see the end of this article .
---
In contemporary web application interfaces , areas for single - line , user - defined labels ( strings ) are common .
For example , Mint.com allows customers to edit transaction descriptions and account names .
Other popular web applications allow customization of photo titles , folder names , sections , and much more .
A designer ’s primary objective should be providing appropriate , optimal space for the expected content .
The secondary objective should be elegantly handling the longer strings .
Truncation on the server - side is unnecessary , complicated , and usually confusing to the user .
Luckily , CSS offers a combination of properties to truncate strings and add ellipsis ( … ) on the client - side , without JavaScript .
Example 1 . Starting with the text
< p >
With no width restrictions , and no ellipsis , this paragraph ( tag ) displays as one would expect … a big block of text .
We ’ve given it a some visual treatment to distinguish it as an interface element in these examples :
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipisicing elit , sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua .
Ut enim ad minim veniam , quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat .
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur .
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident , sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum .
But that ’s not what we want .
We ’re looking for a single line , the sizing of which we can control in our interface .
Example 2 . Prevent line wrap and bring on the ellipsis !
< p >
. ellipsis { white - space : nowrap ; overflow : hidden ; text - overflow : ellipsis ; } p.block { width : 300 px ; }
We ’ll start by adding a class " .ellipsis " to thetag and building it by example .
Add , to limit the paragraph to a single line , andkeeps it from making the browser window wider .
We then addto limit the size ( IE6 needs a width defined , even if it ’s 100 % ) and begin constructing our label .
Also , first recommended for CSS3 back in 2003 , the CSS Text Module includes support for .
So putting that all together :
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipisicing elit , sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua .
Ut enim ad minim veniam , quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat .
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur .
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident , sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum .
And if it were as simple as that , this article would n’t be necessary .
While the text - overflow : ellipsis property is supported in Internet Explorers 6 & 7 , Safari 3 & 4 , Chrome 1 &2 , it requires special handling for IE 8 Standards Mode , Opera , and FireFox . [ 2 ]
Example 3 . text - overflow in Opera and IE 8
. ellipsis { white - space : nowrap ; overflow : hidden ; text - overflow : ellipsis ; -o - text - overflow : ellipsis ; - ms - text - overflow : ellipsis ; }
Opera ’s developers recognize that theproperty is n’t part of the official spec yet , and distinguishes it as a proprietary property through the use of theprefix .
Microsoft introduced something similar in IE 8 with theprefix .
So let ’s add that :
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipisicing elit , sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua .
Ut enim ad minim veniam , quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat .
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur .
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident , sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum .
Alright , alright , no more teasing .
On to the goods .
Let ’s deal with the 400 lb. fox in the room .
Example 4 . Making it work in FireFox
While implementation of the text - overflow property in FireFox is in development , it has been " in development " for a long time .
But FireFox does support XUL , Mozilla ’s XML User Interface Language .
While it may be the first time you ’ve heard about it , many of the popular FireFox add - ons are written in , or rely on , XUL .
XUL has aproperty for the description element , which specifies " An ellipsis will be used in place of the cropped text "
And this is where Rikkert Koppes , a developer in The Netherlands , figured out how to put it all together [ 6 ] .
Firefox ’s support for XBL ( XML Binding Language ) allows us to " associate elements in a document with script , event handlers , CSS , and more complex content models , which can be stored in another document " [ 7 ] .
So in this case , the other document is going to be our XUL description element with tail truncation ( crop ) , which by default in XUL will have ellipsis , and the association will be through FireFox ’s support of XBL bindings in CSS .
First , we ’ll create the XUL , which should be saved as ellipsis.xml :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< bindings xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/xbl " xmlns:xbl= " http://www.mozilla.org/xbl " xmlns:xul= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " > < binding id =" ellipsis " > < content > < xul:window > < xul:description crop=" end " xbl:inherits=" value=xbl:text " >< children/></xul:description > </xul:window > </ content > </ binding > </ bindings >
At Mint.com , we store this alongside our CSS directory in a folder named xml .
You may wish to do the same .
Then we tell our FireFox - only ( - moz prefix ) CSS to bind the .ellipsis class to the XUL : Description element ’s described behavior , referenced by a unique ID ( that binding id =" ellipsis " ) in the XML code above :
. ellipsis { white - space : nowrap ; overflow : hidden ; text - overflow : ellipsis ; -o- text - overflow : ellipsis ; - moz - binding : url ( assets/xml/ellipsis.xml#ellipsis ) ; }
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipisicing elit , sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua .
Ut enim ad minim veniam , quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat .
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur .
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident , sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum .
Success !
If you do n’t see it working on your site , double - check your path to the XML document in the CSS declaration .
That ’s it , and some notes
CSS - based truncation offers much more flexibility to the designers , less work for the developers , and better information display for the user / customer .
While we ’d like to see native support for text - overflow in FireFox , even with a - moz prefix if needed , the XUL binding allows us to simulate it effectively with minor accessibility drawbacks .
Some notes :
Text selection in FireFox
You ca n’t select text that has had the XUL behavior bound to it .
Theproperty should allow this , but I have n’t had success with it , even inside the XUL as a style attribute .
Nested content in FireFox
You can nest a child node inside the cropped parent node as long as you bind the XUL behavior to it as well .
Do n’t go deeper than one child within the truncated node , and do n’t use mixed content :
This is ok .
This is ok .
This is ok .
This is ok .
This is ok .
This is also ok .
This is also ok .
This is also ok .
This is also ok .
This is not .
This is not .
This is not .
This is not .
In the third example above , the node will not display in FireFox .

The last update of the W3C Working Draft for CSS
Text states that " many sections intended for this module are not yet represented in this draft .
In particular , the , other properties have not yet been evaluated " ( emphasis added locally ) .
So keep in mind you ’re using a widely - supported but not officially recommended property ; its future remains uncertain .

As many as 5,000 footballers have gathered in Finland for the annual swamp football world championship .
Some 325 teams took part in an estimated 1,000 matches in knee - deep mud for the chance to be crowned winners of the two - day event .
* Opponents had put cost at $ 3,100
* Cut emissions largely through cap and trade program
* Vote could be put off until sometime next month
WASHINGTON , June 22 ( Reuters ) - Climate change legislation pending in Congress would cost U.S. households only about $ 175 annually in higher energy and consumer prices , far less than the $ 3,100 " burden " opponents have claimed would result , according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate .
" The net annual economywide cost of the cap and trade program in 2020 would be $ 22 billion , or about $ 175 per household , " the CBO , which gives Congress nonpartisan advice about the impact of legislation under consideration , said in an analysis delivered to Congress late on Friday .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee last month approved a lengthy bill that aims to lower industry emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases associated with global warming .
It would do so largely through the cap and trade program , which would lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 , from 2005 levels .
During a long transition period , the government would give away most of the required pollution permits .
Companies that emit less than their permits allowed could sell , or trade , some of their permits to others struggling to meet environmental requirements .
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives had hoped to debate and pass the legislation this week , but with farm - state lawmakers still holding out for more changes that they say will benefit rural areas , the vote might be put off until sometime in July .
FEAR OF HIGHER ENERGY PRICES
With the U.S. economy deep in recession , many lawmakers are nervous about voting for legislation that could raise energy prices as utilities , manufacturers and other companies move away from dirty fossil fuels like coal and toward more expensive alternatives such as wind and solar .
As recently as last month , House Republican leader John Boehner warned against legislation that he sees " saddling " consumers " with an additional $ 3,100 burden per family each year . "
But the CBO came to a much different conclusion .
Low - income households would see an average net benefit of $ 40 , mostly through rebates and other aid , while high - income families could see added net costs of $ 245 per year in 2020 .
CBO said its analysis focused on the effect of the legislation in the year 2020 , at which time cap and trade would have been in effect for eight years and the economy would have had time to adjust to the program .
House Republicans pointed out that the CBO estimated annual gross costs averaging $ 770 and as high as $ 1,380 for the wealthiest .
A spokesman for Representative Dave Camp acknowledged that those figures do not factor in rebates , tax credits and aid to specific industries included in the legislation .
But the spokesman added that CBO did not factor in some potential ramifications , such as job losses stemming from the legislation .
Daniel Weiss and Andrew Jakabovics of the liberal Center for American Progress said of the CBO analysis : " The lowest - income households would actually gain under the bill .
The second - lowest income households would face average daily costs of only 11 cents .
And energy efficiency measures alone would save the average household nearly as much money as the pollution reduction programs would cost under this bill . "
" THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW " The Witnesses Of The Resurrection ( 28:1-10 ) INTRODUCTION 1 .
If the resurrection of Jesus Christ really took place , it has great significance ... a .
For those who have yet to believe in Christ b.
For those who are Christians --
Which we examined in another lesson 2 .
Upon what basis should one believe Jesus actually rose from the dead ?
a .
The evidence presented in the New Testament involves eyewitness testimony b.
Ten distinct resurrection appearances of Christ are recorded in the New Testament c .
One such case is that found in Mt 28:1 - 10 3 .
It is clear from the Scriptures that our faith in Jesus is based upon such testimony ... a .
As Jesus intimated in His prayer , and John in his gospel - Jn 17 : 20 ; 20:30 - 31 b. Jesus expected His apostles to be His witnesses - Jn 15:27 ; Ac 1:8 c. Especially concerning His resurrection - Ac 1:22 ; 2:32 ; 3:15 ; 4:33 ; 10:39 - 41 ; 13:31 4 .
Since our faith rests upon the testimony of these witnesses ... a .
Were they credible witnesses , that we should take them seriously ?
b.
How strong is their testimony ?
c.
How do we know they did not make it up , or were simply deluded ?
[ As with any event alleged to have occurred , there are a number of factors to consider before we accept the event as a historical fact .
One such factor is ...]
I. THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES A. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT ...
1 . The strength or weakness of any testimony is affected by the number of witnesses 2 .
The Law of Moses required at least two or three witnesses - Deut 17:6 3 .
Today , the number of witnesses also plays a crucial role in our justice system --
The more witnesses you have , the stronger your evidence !
B. THERE WERE MANY WITNESSES OF THE RESURRECTION ...
1 . Paul lists many of these witnesses in 1Co 15:3 - 8 a. Jesus was seen by Cephas ( Simon Peter ) - Lk 24:34 b. Jesus was seen by the twelve ( apostles ) - Lk 24:36 - 43 ; Ac 1:2-3 c.
He was seen by five hundred people at one time ( probably in Galilee ) - cf. Mt 28:10,16 - 17 d.
He was seen by James , the Lord 's brother e .
He was seen by Paul , on the road to Damascus - Ac 22:6-10 2 .
Other appearances are recorded in the Scriptures a .
To Mary Magdalene - Mk 16:9 ; Jn 20:14 b.
To other women returning from the tomb - Mt 28:9,10 c .
To two disciples on the road to Emmaus - Lk 24:13 - 33 d.
To the apostles , Thomas absent - Jn 20:19 - 24 e .
To the apostles , Thomas present - Jn 20:26 - 29 f.
To seven disciples by the Lake of Tiberias ( Sea of Galilee ) - Jn 21:1 - 23 g .
To the apostles at the ascension - Ac 1:3-12 [ So for a period of forty days ( Ac 1:3 ) , over 500 people had ample opportunity to see Jesus , and determine for themselves if He was really raised from the dead .
They were convinced , but are they reliable witnesses ?
How do we know they were not simply gullible , believing whatever they wanted to believe ?
This leads us to consider another factor important to accepting the testimony of witnesses ...]
II .
THE CHARACTER OF THE WITNESSES A. SOME HAD NOT BELIEVED IN JESUS ...
1 . Like His brothers in the flesh - Jn 7:3-5 2 .
They even thought Him crazy - Mk 3:21 -- But seeing Him after
His resurrection , they became His disciples !
- Ac 1:14 B. SOME WERE SKEPTICAL AFTER JESUS ' DEATH ... 1 . Thomas would not accept the words of others - Jn 20:24-25 2 .
Not until he had empirical evidence would he believe - Jn 20 : 26-28 3 .
This demonstrates witnesses who were not gullible or easily deceived a .
Which is why the Lord appeared to select witnesses - Ac 10 : 40 - 41 b. Witnesses qualified to know if it really were Jesus C. ONE WAS EVEN A FORMER ENEMY ...
1 . Saul of Tarsus , who later became known as Paul the apostle - Ac 9:1 - 2 2 .
Until he saw Jesus raised from the dead , he believed it to be God 's will to oppose Jesus and His followers - Ac 26:9 - 11 [ These were not gullible witnesses , ready to believe any hint that Jesus had risen .
They required overwhelming evidence to convince them that Jesus was truly raised from the dead .
Now let 's consider ...]
III .
THE STRENGTH OF THEIR WITNESS A. DEMONSTRATED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR TESTIMONY ...
1 . Their testimony appealed to empirical evidence a .
Evidence derived from experiment and observation rather than theory b.
For forty days they were given infallible proofs - Ac 1:3 c . They ate and drank with Jesus - Ac 10:41 d. They saw , heard , and touched Him - Jn 20:24 - 28 ; 1Jn 1:1-2 2 .
There is no way they could have been deceived or deluded a .
If all they had were individual dreams , visions , or hallucinations ... perhaps b.
But they testified that Jesus appeared to them in groups as well as to individuals B. DEMONSTRATED BY THEIR TRANSFORMATION ...
1 . Prior to the resurrection , Jesus ' disciples were afraid and without hope a .
They fled at his arrest - Mk 14:50 b. Peter cowardly denied
Him three times - Mk 14:66 - 72 c.
The women mourned His crucifixion - Lk 23:27 d. After
His death , the disciples were sad - Lk 24:13 - 17 e. After
His death , the disciples hid behind closed doors , for fear of the Jews - Jn 20:19 2 .
But after the resurrection , they fearlessly praised God and proclaimed Jesus ! a. Praising God in the temple - Lk 24:52 - 53 b. Proclaiming Christ , despite persecution - Ac 5:28-32,41-42 3 .
This transformation in their lives is strong evidence for the resurrection , as admitted by one Orthodox Jewish scholar : a .
" If the disciples were totally disappointed and on the verge of desperate flight because of the very real reason of the crucifixion , it took another very real reason in order to transform them from a band of disheartened and dejected Jews into the most self - confident missionary society in world history . "
- Pinchas Lapide , former Chairman of the Applied Linguistics Department at Israel 's Bar - Iland University ( TIME , May 7 , 1979 ) b.
He concluded that a bodily resurrection could possibly have been that reason !
C. DEMONSTRATED BY THEIR HIGH MORAL STANDARD ...
1 . They taught others to live holy lives - 1Th 4:1- 7 ; Ep 4:25 2 .
They lived their own lives in unimpeachable way - 1Th 2:3-12 --
Does this sound like people who propagate lies when they know better ?
D. DEMONSTRATED BY THE PRICE THEY PAID ...
1 . The apostles endured much suffering because of their testimony - 1Co 4:9-13 2 .
All but one died a martyr 's death because of their testimony 3 . Even Jesus ' brother , James , was thrown off the temple and then clubbed to death for his testimony --
There was no motive for them to persistently lie about Jesus ' resurrection !
CONCLUSION 1 .
The nature of their witness does not allow for the option that they were simply deceived or deluded ... a .
Again , they professed empirical evidence b.
They claimed to eat and drink with Him , touch Him , see Him 2 .
If Jesus was not raised from the dead , there is only one alternative ... a .
These witnesses were liars , deceivers b. Even Paul admits this is the only alternative - 1Co 15:14 - 15 3 .
Is it reasonable to believe they successfully propagated a lie ?
a .
Too many people attested to the same fact b.
They were not the kind of people to fabricate such a falsehood c .
They lived noble lives , and were ALL willing to suffer and die for their testimony !
When we carefully examine the lives and testimony of " The Witnesses Of The Resurrection " , the only reasonable conclusion to draw is that they really saw what they claimed : Jesus is risen !
And His resurrection from the dead is assurance from God that Judgment is coming and we must repent : " Truly , these times of ignorance God overlooked , but now commands all men everywhere to repent , because
He has appointed a day on which
He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained .
He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead . "

It is with heavy hearts that we today report that HP has shattered its own excessive packaging world record - set last year when it managed to expend 17 cardboard boxes in dispatching 32 sheets of A4 paper to a shaken customer .
Of course , the competition was n't going to take this lying down , and Dell subsequently weighed in with a commendable contribution to the destruction of Mother Earth .
However , HP had already consolidated its hold on the title by sending someone a mouse strapped to a pallet , and it looked unlikely that such excesses could ever be topped .
Until now , that is , as you 'll see .

In a medical advance inspired by recessionary thinking , researchers from the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City announced last month that they ’ve developed an effective and supremely cheap treatment for chronic tennis elbow .
Huddling a while back to brainstorm about inexpensive methods for combating the injury , the scientists glanced around their offices and noticed a homely , low - tech rubber bar , about 8 inches long , which , at the time , was being used for general physical therapy programs .
The researchers wondered whether the ribbed , pliable bars , available for less than $ 20 , might be re-purposed to treat tennis elbow .
The answer , it soon become clear , was a resounding yes .
To arrive at that conclusion , the researchers recruited 21 people with chronic , debilitating elbow pain .
Ten of them were assigned to standard physical therapy treatment for tennis elbow ; this was the control group .
The other 11 also received physical therapy , but in addition were taught a choreographed exercise using the rubber bar that they practiced at home .
After less than two months of treatment , the researchers terminated the experiment .
The early results had been too unfair .
The control group had showed little or no improvement .
But the rubber - bar - using group effectively had been cured .
Those patients reported an 81 percent improvement in their elbow pain and a 72 percent improvement in strength .
“ We could n’t believe ” how fast and well the therapy worked , says Timothy Tyler , PT , ATC , a clinical research associate at the Nicholas Institute and one of the authors of the study .
“ We were seeing improvements in five weeks , even three .
It was crazy . ”
Tennis elbow , characterized by pain , weakness and inflammation or degeneration of the wrist - extensor tendon that connects to the elbow , is one of those intractable overuse injures that , until recently , yielded very reluctantly to treatment .
By most estimates , about half of all competitive tennis players will be afflicted , a statistic that must resonate , painfully , with the pros gathering for next week ’s US Open .
Tennis is n’t the only predisposing activity , either .
Golfers get tennis elbow , as do plumbers , painters , gardeners and accountants .
( Heavy briefcases can strain the tendon . )
Treatments range from acupuncture to corticosteroids to surgery , usually with limited — if any — long - term success .
But in the past two or three years , doctors and researchers have begun focusing on a particular kind of exercise that has shown promise against other achy tendons , especially the Achilles .
The program involves eccentric exercises , which are n’t oddball moves but those in which the muscle lengthens as it tenses .
Think of a biceps curl .
When you raise the dumbbell , your bicep shortens and tightens .
That ’s a concentric contraction .
When you lower the weight , the muscle lengthens , straining against the force of the weight .
That ’s eccentric .
“ There ’s a growing body of research showing that eccentric exercises are quite effective in treating Achilles tendonosis ” and other tendon problems , Tyler says .
One of those studies was a well - designed 2007 experiment centered on tennis elbow .
Conducted in Belgium , it found that eccentric exercises provided considerable relief .
But the exercises had to be performed on expensive machines under medical supervision during repeated office visits .
“ We looked at those results and thought , there has to be an easier , more cost - effective way , ” Tyler says .
Which is how they arrived at the rubber bar technique .
He and his colleagues realized that a single , unhurried exercise using a tensile bar that looks like an oversized licorice stick could create an eccentric contraction all along the forearm .
In the exercise , a person holds the bar upright at his or her side using the hand connected to the sore elbow , then grasps it near the top with the good hand .
The top hand twists as the bar is brought around in front of the body and positioned perpendicular to the ground ; the sore hand then takes over , slowly untwisting the bar by flexing the wrist .
“ Afterward , you should be sore , ” Tyler says .
“ That ’s how we know it ’s effective . ”
Timothy Tyler
Eccentric contractions require the muscle to work against a force , in this case the coiled bar .
“ You can load a tendon so much more eccentrically ” than with concentric exercises , Tyler says .
“ So we think the process may be remodeling the tendon . ”
Ultrasound studies by other researchers , including the group in Belgium , have shown that damaged tendons typically become less thick , indicating they are less damaged , after a course of strenuous eccentric exercise .
Tyler reported his findings at the July annual meeting of the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine and has been deluged ever since with requests from doctors , physical therapists and patients for more information about how to perform the exercise and where to buy the bar .
( Called the Thera - Band Flexbar , it ’s available on Amazon.com ; the manufacturer donated products for the study , but did n’t otherwise fund it ;
Tyler is not affiliated with the company . )
“ It ’s not a difficult exercise but it is unique , so I would advise people to be taught by a physical therapist , if possible , ” Tyler says .
If not , proceed on your own — after , of course , an examination by a doctor ; elbow pain can have many causes , not just tennis elbow .
“ In my opinion , you ’re not going to hurt yourself , ” Tyler continues , although you should be prepared for a commitment .
His patients did three sets of fifteen repetitions every day .
Beginners should start with three sets of five repetitions , adding more as the repetitions get easier , Tyler says .
After his study was halted , the members of the control group , still ailing , were offered rubber bars and training .
Most of the people in both groups continue to use the bars whenever their elbows twinge , Tyler has heard .
Meanwhile , they ’ve returned to tennis ( or , golf or weight training , which several blamed for their tennis elbow ) .
“ I feel strongly that this is making people better , ” Tyler says .
We all know the SEC blew it on Bernie Madoff .
But was it because of young staffers awed by the firm 's name and offices ?
That 's what happened according to a former Madoff secretary , as quoted in a new book by Andrew Kirtzman , " Betrayal : The Life and Lies of Bernie Madoff . "
The New York Post reports :
" The youthful SEC staffers were so dazzled to be at Madoff headquarters that they occasionally inquired about job openings at the company , " Kirtzman writes .
[ Secretary ] Solomon said , " They would say , ' Can we get jobs -- can we give you our resumes ? '
We 'd say , ' Send them through to our offices .
A couple of them dropped resumes off . ' "
When SEC probers showed up at Madoff 's office after his arrest to begin going through paperwork to trace his fraud 's tentacles , Solomon recognized one of them from a prior visit years ago .
" If you had done your [ bleep ] ing job in the first place , we would n't be in this position now ! "
Solomon yelled at him . "
Fine , young regulators are inexperienced and impressionable .
But was whistleblower Harry Markopolos really that hard to understand when he said in 2005 that Madoff was " running the world 's largest Ponzi Scheme " ?
Come on .
If anything , this emphasizes what 's so bad about the private sector / regulator revolving door .
It 's not obvious how you get anyone to crack heads when they 're angling for jobs after doing their stints in Washington .
Kenya is planning to erect thousands of miles of electric fencing around its key national parks and to double the number of armed guards to protect water sources and stop impoverished people felling trees , as the effects of climate change become more serious .
A drought that has left more than five million people without food this year , combined with changing weather patterns and rapid population growth , threatens a triple catastrophe within 10 years , according to Julius Kipng'etich , director of the Kenya Wildlife Service , the government 's paramilitary organisation responsible for managing 26 national parks and their wildlife .
" The long rains have failed for the first time .
The implications for food security and water scarcity and energy are profound .
Kenya will face these three crises in the next 10 years without a doubt .
If we carry on the way we are going , in 20 years the consequences will be horrific " , Kipng 'etich told the Observer .
Five of Kenya 's national parks provide drinking water and hydroelectric power for almost 80 % of the country as well as being major centres of wildlife .
But several have been invaded by squatters after the former president , Daniel arap Moi , gave politicians land in forested parks in the 1980s .
The 15,000 people who now live illegally in the heavily forested 400,000 hectares ( 999,600 acres ) of Mau park in the west of Kenya have cut down nearly 104,000 hectares of trees in 15 years .
The government has pledged to evict them , but has so far failed to take action .
Other parks have been invaded by people taking cattle to graze or by charcoal industries .
The Mau is the largest forest in Kenya , and is considered critical for safeguarding water supplies there as well as in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda .
Millions of people depend upon the 12 rivers that flow from the mountainous area , and which provide water for the tea , livestock and energy industries .
Other forested parks provide water for the capital , Nairobi , and hydroelectric power stations .
Trees are an essential part of the water cycle as they promote the formation of clouds – cutting them down inevitably leads to lower rainfall .
Last week the wildlife service said it planned to double the number of armed guards in Kenyan parks over the next five years and was studying whether to put electric fences around Mount Kenya , the Mau forest , Mount Elgon and the Cherangani hills .
The model would be a 250 - mile fence which has almost been completed around the Aberdare mountain range by the Kenya - based conservation group Rhino Ark .
" Kenya is destroying itself .
The population has reached an unsustainable level .
We are killing ourselves slowly by destroying the forests and settling there .
Destruction of the Mau is like dancing with death .
We should see environmental destruction as a greater threat than anything else , " said Kipng 'etich .
Environmentalists foresee a vicious circle where human and wildlife conflicts will escalate with climate change as east African rains fail and people are forced to enter protected areas in search of food for animals and water .
Destruction of the forests will devastate wildlife and further reduce water supplies to Kenya 's cities .
" Once you have people in the forest , you cannot control what they do .
Kenya depends on these forests .
You cannot solve the problems of food and water by allowing poor people to go into the forest .
People are undermining the future of Kenya by growing food in the forest , " said the Kenyan environmentalist and winner of the Nobel peace prize , Wangari Maathai .
Britons fund nearly 50 % of the wildlife service through park entry fees paid by 300,000 visitors a year .
Britain will now be asked to contribute to a € 100 m ( £ 90 m ) European commission fund to help Kenya adapt to climate change .
The income from the fund is intended to be used to help communities prepare for expected water shortages and extremes of weather .

Statement by the Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network ( AVSN )
July 1 , 2009 -- The Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network ( AVSN ) strongly condemns the undemocratic coup conducted by a small group of military , members of the oligarchy and their political agents in Honduras .
The violent kidnapping and expulsion to Costa Rica of democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya is a ruthless attack on the rights of the Honduran people to freely elect their own leaders , and decide their own political future .
The pretext for the coup was no more than the president 's plan for a non-binding national poll to determine support for a future referendum on the convening of a Constituent Assembly to recommend changes to the undemocratic Honduran constitution , which was imposed on the country during the US Reagan administration 's puppet regime in Honduras in 1982 .
Now the congressman who organised the poll has reportedly been assassinated by the military .
The assault on the Venezuelan , Cuban and Nicaraguan ambassadors , who were trying to protect the foreign minister of Honduras from arrest by the military , is a further threat to the international Bolivarian movement for unity and social change throughout Latin America .
AVSN declares that an attack on any progressive Latin American government -- especially a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for Latin America ( ALBA ) , as Honduras is -- is a danger to all people 's governments in the region .
This return to the era of military coups is a throwback to the dark past of Latin America of decades ago , and must be firmly rejected by all the peoples and governments of the world .
In particular , we call on the governments of the United States , Europe and Australia to resolutely condemn this coup , to refuse any recognition to the new , fraudulent regime in Honduras , and to cut off all military , economic and political ties with the Honduran junta .
We salute Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez when he warned of CIA involvement in the Honduran events , and when he called on US President Barrack Obama to " reject the coup right from the marrow " .
We also fully support the moves by the nine governments of ALBA to prepare a plan of action to combat the coup .
We also note the vigorous condemnation of the Honduran coup by the Organization of American States .
Moreover , we call on the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to condemn the coup and completely isolate the coup plotters internationally until President Zelaya is returned to his rightful presidential office , all Honduran military forces are sent back to their barracks and the coup plotters arrested and put on trial for their crimes .
We pledge the full solidarity of the AVSN and the Latin American solidarity movement in Australia until the coup is overturned and democratic rights reinstalled in Honduras .
ALBA declaration on Honduras coup d'etat
By the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA )
Proclamation of the Extraordinary Presidential Council
Managua , Republic of Nicaragua , June 29 , 2009 -- On Sunday the 28th of June in early hours of the morning , when the Honduran people were getting ready to exercise their democratic will through a poll with a consultative character , promoted by the President of the Republic Manuel Zelaya Rosales to deepen participative democracy , a group of hooded soldiers , who affirmed they had received orders from the High Command of the Armed Forces , assaulted the residence of President Zelaya , in order to kidnap him , disappear him for a number of hours and later expel him violently from his homeland .
Immediately , the people of Honduras reacted like the noble heirs of the legacy of Francisco Morazán [ 1 ] , in the streets of the cities and towns of Honduras .
From the early hours of the morning hundreds of electoral booths received thousands of men and women who attended to exercise their right to vote , and on being informed of the kidnapping of their president , spilled out onto the streets to protest the coup d'etat , giving an example of heroism , to confront , unarmed , the guns and tanks .
Through the screens of Telesur , they managed to break the national and international silence that the dictatorship wanted to impose through closing the state television channel and cutting the electricity supply , aiming to conceal and justify the coup d'etat against their people and the international community - demonstrating an attitude that recalls the worst epoch of the dictatorships experienced in the 20th century in our continent .
With one single voice , the governments and peoples of the continent reacted condemning the coup d'etat , making clear that in Honduras there is only one President and one government : that of President Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
At the same time , we salute the declarations of condemnation , that from very early , other governments of the world began to issue .
In the face of the urgency of the situation , the governments of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America immediately convoke an Extraordinary Presidential Council , with the objective of agreeing on forceful actions to defeat the coup d'etat in Honduras , to support the heroic people of Morazán and to unconditionally re-establish the President Manuel Zelaya Rosales in his legitimate duties .
After analyzing the circumstances which have produced this coup d'etat , in the face of the gravity of the violations of International Law , the multilateral agreements and the accords of our countries with the Republic of Honduras , and in view of the categorical rejection that the international community has manifested in front of the dictatorial government that is trying to impose itself , the member countries of ALBA have decided to withdraw our Ambassadors and leave a minimum expression of our diplomatic representation in Tegucigalpa until the legitimate government of President Manuel Zelaya Rosales is reinstated in its duties .
Likewise we recognise as the only diplomatic representatives of Honduras in our countries , the personnel designated by President Zelaya .
Under no circumstances will we accredit personnel designated by the usurpers .
Equally , as full members of the various systems of integration of the continent , we insist that our brother countries of UNASUR , SICA , CARICOM , the Rio Group , the UN and the OAS proceed in the same way in the face of the assailants of the Honduran people .
On the other hand , we have agreed to declare ourselves in permanent alert in order to accompany the valiant people of Honduras in the actions of struggle that they have convoked , and we invoke the content of Articles 2 and 3 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Honduras :
Art. 2 : Sovereignty corresponds to the People from which emanate all the Powers of the State that are exercised through representation .
The Sovereignty of the People can also be exercised in a direct manner through a Plebiscite or Referendum .
The supplanting of popular Sovereignty and the usurpation of the constituted powers are classified as crimes of Treason against the Fatherland .
The responsibility in these cases is imprescriptible and can be deduced to the role or petition of any citizen .
Art. 3 : No one has to obey neither a usurper government nor those who assume functions or public employment through the force of arms or using measures or procedures that break or fail to recognise that which the Constitution and the laws establish .
The acts verified by such authorities are invalid .
The people have the right to resort to insurrection in defense of constitutional order .
As well as the principles of International Law respect the acts of resistance and rebellion of the people confronting the attempts at domination .
To the teachers , workers , women , youth , peasants , indigenous peoples , honest business people , intellectuals and other actors of Honduran society , we assure that together we will win a great victory against the coup plotters that aim to impose themselves on the brave people of Francisco Morazán .
Invoking the spirit and though of Francisco Morazán , together with him , we proclaim to the coup plotters : Men , you who have abused the rights of the people for a sordid and stingy interest !
With you I speak , enemies of independence and liberty .
If our actions , aimed at acquiring a homeland , can suffer a parallel to those Central Americans that you have persecuted and exiled , I challenge you to present them .
Those same people , who have been humiliated , insulted , debased and betrayed so many times , that today are the arbiters of their destiny and ask for our advice , those people will be your judge .
Those who are leading the coup d'etat must know that it will be impossible to prevail and to make fun of international justice , to which sooner or later they will be subjected .
We call on the officials and the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Honduras to rectify and to put their weapons at the service of the people of Honduras and their general commander , President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
The member countries of ALBA , in consultation with the governments of the continent and with various institutions that guarantee the fulfilment of International Law , we are bringing forward measures so that the grave violations and the crimes that are being committed are n't gotten away with .
The only path that remains for the coup makers to abandon their attitude and to guarantee immediately , unconditionally , and definitely , the return of President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales to his constitutional functions .
The Republic of Honduras is a full member of ALBA , and likewise of other regional integration and multilateral organisations , whose membership demand respect of the sovereignty of the people and the constitution .
These fundamental conditions , having been violated by the coup makers , the governments of ALBA have decided to maintain all the cooperation programs that we have pre-empted with Honduras through President Zelaya .
Likewise , we propose that punitive measures are applied by all the multilateral integration organisations and mechanisms , which would help to enforce the immediate return to constitutional order in Honduras and would bring about the principles of action that Jose Marti referred to when he said , " Each person does their duty , and nothing can defeat us . "
The governments of ALBA declare ourselves in a permanent consultation session , with all the governments of the continent , in order to evaluate further joint actions that enable us to accompany the Honduran people in the re-establishment of legality and the restitution of the President Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
Two hundreds years since the historic gesture that our peoples have developed throughout the continent , following the timeless example of the General of free men Augusto Cesar Sandino , of Francisco Morazan and faithful to the word of The Liberator Simon Bolivar , we put our hope with the people of Honduras and the peoples of the world for the sureness of victory , as , " all the peoples of the world who have wrestled for freedom have , in the end , exterminated their tyrants .

Raul Castro : Cuba strongly condemns the coup in Honduras
HAVANA , Cuba , June 29 ( acn )
On behalf of the Cuban people , President Raul Castro strongly condemned on Monday the brutal coup d’état perpetrated early on Sunday against the constitutional Government and President of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya .
Speaking during a meeting of the Rio Group in Nicaragua , the Cuban leader sent a message of solidarity to the Honduran people .
Raul recalled the aggression by the military against President Zelaya and Honduran Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas along with the ambassadors of Venezuela , and Cuba and he added that this attack against the political constitutionality of the Central American nation has to be unanimously and strongly condemned by the Rio Group .
As President Chavez said last night , it is a moment to act according to our principles and to immediately expose those who condemn but , under the table , applaud , as has happened so many times in the past , Raul said . <
In Honduras , there is and there can only be one President , Jose Manuel Zelaya , who must unconditionally be reinstated , he added .
There can not be any negotiations with the coup supporters and no demands or conditions can be imposed on the legitimate government of President Zelaya .
The Cuban head of state recalled that the confrontation in Honduras is between the people ’s aspirations to a better future and the interests of the oligarchic sectors that seek to perpetuate an unjust and unsustainable order .
Raul stressed that this conflict goes beyond the Honduran borders and is an expression of the danger of returning to the past , when military dictatorships , with the support of the United States , terrorised Latin America , particularly , the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean .
Recalling past coup attempts in Bolivia and Venezuela , Raul wondered if it is a coincidence that these two countries , plus Honduras are all members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas ( ALBA ) , a regional integration and cooperation bloc .
These three examples show that the oligarchies and their forces have many means to resort to in order to hold back the course of history .
Raul Castro affirmed that the fascist coup against President Zelaya is an insult to all the nations and governments of Latin America and the Caribbean and cannot remain unpunished .
Its perpetrators will have to accept the consequences of their crimes in the sister nation of Honduras , he said .
The Cuban leader praised the work of Telesur television network and criticised media outlets that have worked in favour of those who staged the coup in order to misinform the people .
Finally , after saying he believes in the sincerity of US President Barack Obama and its State Secretary Hillary Clinton , he urged them to act in accordance with their statements .
But they have to prove it with facts , not only with words , he stressed .
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Ministry of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs statement
Caracas , June 28 , 2009 --
The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela condemns the coup d’état that the Honduran oligarchy is attempting to perpetrate against the constitutional government of President Manuel Zelaya Rosales and the people of Honduras .
President Manuel Zelaya Rosales was kidnapped , removed from his home by force , rendered incommunicado for several hours , and violently expelled from his country by a group of unpatriotic , coup - mongering soldiers .
The hooded soldiers kidnapped Chancellor Patricia Rodas and also arbitrarily detained and beat the Ambassadors of Cuba , Nicaragua , and Venezuela .
These shameless soldiers are responsible before national and international laws for the crimes that they are committing and for the violation of the constitution and its laws .
The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela strongly urges the international community to condemn this situation and urges that the necessary measures be taken by us to defeat this coup d’état in Honduras and to reestablish the legitimate government of President Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
We will not be silent or humiliated !
By the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras ( COPINH )
June 28 , 2009 --
The COPINH condemns the cowardly and dirty coup d'tat against the Constitutional President of the Republic Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
We denounce the fascist and terrorist role of the armed forces , of the national congress headed by Roberto Michelleti Bain , of the communications media of sectors of the ultra- right , and the rest of the institutions submissive to the interests of the oligarchy and imperialism that this morning kidnapped the president , prior to the initiation of the popular consultation .
The people are still participating in the non-binding referendum -- even faced with repression , even as the campaign of fear continues , and even when confronted with the butt of soldiers ' rifles .
There is practically a state of siege in the capital and the rest of the country ; electricity is cut off , they have a list of leaders to be captured , and Hondurans who are bravely demonstrating in front of the presidential residence are surrounded by tanks and helicopters .
Even so they have installed the polls and are exercising their right to participate in the consultation as a form of rebellion .
The Honduran people are mobilizing .
Since early morning , our organization is calling out its members and has already begun the journey with representatives of the Lenca People on the way to Tegucigalpa .
We tell everyone that the Honduran people are carrying out large demonstrations , actions in their communities , in the municipalities ; there are occupations of bridges , and a protest in front of the presidential residence , among others .
From the lands of Lempira , Morazán and Visitación Padilla , we call on the Honduran people in general to demonstrate in defense of their rights and of real and direct democracy for the people , to the fascists we say that they will NOT silence us , that this cowardly act will turn back on them , with great force .
We state that we do not recognize any " substitute " and WE WILL STRUGGLE FOR OUR PEOPLE , FOR OUR RIGHT TO DREAM OF A COUNTRY WITH JUSTICE , EQUITY , LIBERTY AND LIFE .
With the ancestral force of Iselaca and Lempira we raise our voices for life , justice , liberty , dignity and peace .
Restore democracy in Honduras !
Statement by the Socialist Alliance , Australia
July 2 , 2009 --
The Socialist Alliance strongly condemns the June 28 coup d’etat by the military , members of the oligarchy and their political agents in Honduras .
The violent kidnapping and expulsion to Costa Rica of democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya Rosales is an attempt to deny the people of Honduras their fundamental human rights to determine their own government and political future .
The coup took place as millions of Hondurans were preparing to exercise their right to vote for the first time in a consultative referendum on the future convening of a constitutional assembly to reform Honduras ' constitution .
The Zelaya government 's proposal to draft a new constitution is the culmination of other measures under his presidency that have come under attack by conservative forces , including a significant increase in the minimum wage , measures to renationalise energy generation plants and telecommunications , signing a bill to greatly improve labour conditions for teachers , joining the Venezuelan Petrocaribe program , and delaying recognition of the new United States ambassador after the Bolivian government implicated the US embassy in supporting paramilitary groups destabilising Bolivia .
The Socialist Alliance also condemns the June 28 assassination by the armed forces of Honduran congressperson Cesar Ham , the organiser of the consultative referendum on a new constitution , and the abduction of Honduran foreign minister Patricia Rodas .
The assault and attempted kidnapping on the Venezuelan , Cuban and Nicaraguan ambassadors in Honduras , who were trying to protect Rodas was a direct attack on the Bolivarian movement for unity and progressive change in Latin America .
The Socialist Alliance is very concerned for the safety of the human rights organisations that have supported the president and the efforts for constitutional reform .
Reports of the military pursuing civil society leaders in the street and of leaders of the National Council of Indigenous Peoples being forced into hiding must be responded to by all who support freedom .
We applaud and stand in solidarity with the thousands of brave Hondurans who have mobilised to defend democracy by demonstrating in the streets and attempting to exercise their right to participate in the referendum despite intimidation and assault by the armed forces .
We also solidarise with the Honduran trade unions and social movements calling for a general strike in support of their ousted president .
The Socialist Alliance congratulates the nine governments of ALBA , the Organization of American States and the UN General Assembly president Miguel D’Escoto for their immediate condemnation of the coup and support for Zelaya as the only legitimate president of Honduras .
We note that the European Union and numerous governments have condemned the coup , and call on the Australian government to :
Refuse to recognise the congressional appointed ``de facto '' government of Roberto Michelletti ;
Demand the immediate , safe return of the President Zelaya and foreign minister Rodas , and the reconstitution of the elected government ;
Demand the immediate release of all political and social movement organisation leaders who have been detained by the military ;

COSATU condemns the coup in Honduras
By Patrick Craven
July 2 , 2009 -- The Congress of South African Trade Unions calls on all democrats , workers and revolutionaries to condemn the coup in Honduras which has overthrown leftist President , Manuel Zelaya .
He was abducted from his official residence by the Honduran army and forcibly taken to Costa Rica on Sunday morning .
It followed a growing controversy over a vote over term limits between the President and General Romeo Vasquez , who is reportedly in charge of the armed forces that abducted the President .
According to the US - based Institute for Southern Studies ( ISS ) , " At least two leaders of the coup launched in Honduras on June 28 were apparently trained at a controversial Department of Defence school based at Fort Benning , Georgia , infamous for producing graduates linked to torture , death squads and other human rights abuses . "
Also at stake is the life of Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas , whose whereabouts are unknown .
She was with the ambassadors of Cuba , Venezuela and Nicaragua in Honduras when 15 soldiers wearing ski masks broke into their meeting place .
The soldiers pushed and beat then , stole their cell phones and took them to an air base .
These cruel acts are reminiscent of past dictators in Latin America , such as Pinochet , who were in the active service of US imperialism .
These brutal dictatorships were used against to attack and kill communists and other revolutionary activists who were defending the people 's natural resources and democratic rights .
This is a dastardly act of cowardice against a democratically elected leader of the Honduran people , who have chosen to follow the path of Cuba , Venezuela and other countries that have opted out of the clutches of neo-colonial imperialism supervised by the US .
This coup has lessons for Africa , where we also struggle daily with the reality of underdevelopment , neo - colonial plunder of our natural resources and destabilisation through proxy forces killing our people .
We call on the global trade union movement to condemn this act , and defend democracy and the right of the Honduran people to choose their own leaders freely .

Labor Party Pakistan flays coup in Honduras
By Farooq Tariq
July 2 , 2009 -- The Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) condemns the military takeover in Honduras .
The LPP considers the coup an attack on democratic values not only in the country but all over the world .
The LPP is in solidarity with those peasants and workers in Honduras who are struggling to overthrow the generals and sacrificing their lives .
It calls on all the progressive forces to unite for the restoration of the democracy .
The LPP thinks the ruling classes along with country 's Supreme Court joined hands to put an end to pro-people reforms that President Manual Zelaya was implementing .
The coup is a response by anti-democratic forces to changes benefiting the working classes .
The efforts of the President Zelaya to amend the constitution was a right step in a right direction .
The current constitution , written in 1982 during the height of the US administration 's dirty war in Central America , was designed to fortify ruling classes .
Those in control of economic and political power do not want even a little interference by the masses .
President Zelaya 's proposal for a referendum on the issue was his constitutional right .
The support lent by a majority of labour unions and social movements in the country shows that his move had widespread support among the people .
The LPP condemns the fact that the military takeover in Honduras has not been mentioned very much in the mainstream media in Pakistan .
The government has not issued any statement to condemn this takeover .
The LPP demands the Pakistan government , led by Pakistan Peoples Party , condemn the coup and side with the forces striving to reverse the military takeover .
The LPP also condemns the American imperialism for its hidden support to the coup plotters and demands an immediate stop to violence against the pro-democracy activists taking to streets to agitate for the cause of democracy .
No to martial law !
Reinstate President Zelaya !
The anti-coup mass movement must be supported
Statement by the Partido Lakas ng Masa , Philippines
July 2 , 2009 -- The Partido Lakas ng Masa , Philippines , adds its voice in strong condemnation of the coup attempt by the Honduran military hierarchy , the elite and other vested interests , to oust the legitimately elected President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras .
We also condemn the attack on democratic and human rights by the coup leaders , including the killing , arrests and intimidation of our Honduran comrades leading the mass movements and social movements against elite interests , now protesting in the streets against the coup leaders .
We are extremely concerned about reports that the coup government in Honduras has passed a decree indefinitely suspending all constitutional rights in the country .
We understand that this means the coup forces can enter homes without warrants , detain anyone with no notice or justification , prohibit all public gatherings , such as marches , rallies , protests or meetings , and maintain censorship of independent media .
This is the declaration and imposition of martial law in Honduras .
The imposition of martial law further confirms that the coup is anti-people and was engineered by elite interests in Honduras .
The coup took place as the Honduran people were preparing to exercise their right to vote for the first time in a consultative referendum on the future convening of a constitutional assembly to reform Honduras ' constitution , a process similar to that which took place in Venezuela , paving the way for the Bolivarian revolution in that country .
It was also in response to several progressive measures taken by the Zelaya government , such as a significant increase in the minimum wage , measures to renationalise energy generation plants and telecommunications , signing a bill to greatly improve labour conditions for teachers and joining the regional formation ALBA spearheaded by Venezuela , Cuba and Bolivia .
The coup also represents a desperate attempt to stop the rise of the revolutionary and progressive movements in Latin America , a trend that US imperialism has been desperately trying to reverse .
A coup against the Zelaya government can only serve elite and US imperialist interests in the region .
We applaud the solidarity demonstrated by the governments of Latin America , such as Venezuela , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , El Salvador and others , who have mobilised against the coup , demanding the reinstatement of President Zelaya .
The Venezuelan revolution has shown the way of how to defeat elite - managed , pro-imperialist coups , when the masses mobilised and reinstated Hugo Chavez in a matter of 48 hours .
The Honduran masses know this lesson well and have taken to the streets in defence of their rights .
We stand as one with this mass movement in the streets , demanding the reinstatement of President Zelaya .
We demand the immediate lifting of martial law imposed by the coup regime , an end to the violation of human rights and the release of all political prisoners .
The coup leaders and plotters must also be brought to trial for crimes against the people .
Only the masses , mobilised and united , can defeat the coup plotters .
Urgent call
In solidarity with the organisations of Via Campesina and the people of Honduras
International Coordinating Committee ( CCI ) of Vía Campesina
Mali , Africa -- June 28 , 2009 --
With the objective of deepening democracy and achieving broader democratic participation , for several months the social organisations of Honduras along with President Manuel Zelaya Rosales have promoted holding a survey ( non-binding referendum ) this June 28 , 2009 .
To our great surprise , today at 5 am , the armed forces carried out a coup d'etat against President Zelaya , blocking in this way , the democratic aspirations of the population that was preparing to carry out the popular consultation .
On hearing this news , the social organisations of of Honduras , including those of Via Campesina , have gone out into the streets to repudiate this deed and demand the return of President Zelaya to that functions that they law mandates .
The government of President Zelaya has been characterized by its defense of workers and campesinos , it is a defender of the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas ( ALBA ) , and during his administration it has promoted actions that benefit Honduran campesinos .
We believe that these deeds are the desperate acts of the national oligarchy and the hardcore right to preserve the interests of capital , and in particular , of the large transnational corporations .
To that end , that have made use of the military forces and the institutions of the country such as the parliament , ministers , neoliberal press and others .
Faced with this unacceptable situation , Via Campesina International demands :
1. Re-establishment of the constitutional order , without bloodshed .
2 . We call on the army not to repress the population of Honduras that demands a return to democracy .
3 . That the physical integrity of social leaders , including Rafael Alegria -- international leader of Via Campesina -- is respected .
4 . We demand the return of President Zelaya to his functions in Honduras .
5 . That the authorities guarantee the full democratic exercise of the popular consultation , which is clearly a form of free expression .
From Via Campesina International , we are concerned for the safety of our leaders and organisations of Via Campesina , as well as what could happen to the people of Honduras , in these difficult times .
We also call on campesino organizations and other social movements to protest in front of the Honduran embassies and send letters rejecting the coup d'etat to the embassies in each of their countries .
We express our solidarity with our campesino organisations in Honduras .
Globalise the struggle !
Globalise hope !
Socialist Party of Malaysia :
No to coup in Honduras !
Restore demoracy !
Reinstate the democratically elected president !
June 30 , 2009 -- The Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) strongly condemns the coup d’etat organised by military and right - wing political elite in Honduras on June 28 , 2009 , which ousted the democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya .
The coup took place just hours before the people of Honduras go out to vote on a consultative referendum concerning whether to rewrite the constitution .
The current Honduran constitution , which was written in 1982 during the height of the US administration ’s dirty war in Central America , was designed to ensure the ruling elite who have closed ties with the imperialist US to consolidate their powers with little interference from the ordinary people .
The consultative referendum proposed by President Manuel Zelaya is merely an opinion poll for the Hondurans to determine whether they are prepared to enter into a democratic process to modify their constitution .
The referendum though is a not - binding vote , has been viewed by many unions and peasant groups as a necessary precursor to economic reforms favoring Honduras 's poor majority .
Yet , the right - wing political elites are threatened by it and used every mean to stop the people of Honduras to determine their future by themselves .
President Manuel Zelaya , elected in 2005 , has increasingly come under attack by the right - wing forces in Honduras for his growing relationship with the ALBA countries .
The coup is clearly a cowardice act by the right - wing political elite and US - backed economic interests which in fear of losing their grip on this Central American country when it move closer with countries which are now undergoing revolutionary process like Venezuela .
The PSM demands :
1 ) Restore democracy in Honduras
2 ) Immediately reinstate the democratically elected President Zelaya
3 ) People of Honduras have their right to determine whether to re-write the out - dated imperialist influenced constitution in order to restructure its society for the benefit of ordinary vast majority .
No to coup !
Power to the People !

Venezuela Solidarity Campaign ( Britain ) statement on military coup in Honduras
By Francisco Dominguez , secretary Venezuela Solidarity Campaign
Today ( Sunday , June 29 , 2009 ) there was to be non-binding national consultation as to whether the people of Honduras agreed to hold referenda at the end of the year for a new Constitional Assembly and for a new constitution .
Just on Saturday June 28 , President Zelaya was meeting international observers regarding details of today 's referendum .
Early this morning -- June 29 -- ( about 5:45 am Honduran time ) heavily armed units of the military ( according to eyewitnesses , about 200 soldiers ) occupied the presidential palace , arrested democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya in his personal residence , kidnapped him , taking him to an unknown destination .
Eyewitnesses inform that President Zelaya 's personal residence is surrounded by soldiers .
Telesur report that President Zelaya confirmed by phone that he is in Costa Rica .
The military then proceeded to close down Channel 8 , the state TV channel to prevent it from informing the population .
President Manuel Zelaya 's supporters are congregating in the streets of the capital and are moving to surround the presidential palace to demand the return of their president .
We totally and absolutely condemn the coup against democratically - elected President Manuel Zelaya and demand his immediate and unconditional release as well as the immediater release of anybody else that might have been arrested by the plotters .
We demand :
1 . The immediate restitution of the constitutional order interrupted by the military coup underway in Honduras .
2 . No violence of any kind to be unleashed against the civilian population , or any of the those arrested by those carrying out the coup d'etat .
There are worrying reports emerging from Tegucigalpa -- Honduras ' capital city -- of military violence against civilians .
3 . We also urge the UK government to unequivocally condemn the coup and demand the release of President Zelaya , and the immediate return to the constitutional order .
4 . We also call upon President Barack Obama to demonstrate with acts his expressed desire to inaugurate a new period of respectful relations with the republics in Latin America , by also unreservedly condemning the coup d'etat , stating that the US will not recognise any other government in Honduras except that of the democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya .
Ken Livingstone , the former Mayor of London , and president of the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign , has condemned the military coup in Honduras and demanded the release of the democratically elected President of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya .
Ken Livingstone said : ``I totally condemn the military coup and kidnapping of the democratically elected President of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya .
President Zelaya was working to free his country from decades hunger and poverty .
This military coup is an illegal attempt to use armed force to overturn the course of democracy and social progress chosen by the Honduran people at the polls .
The world should unite to stop this attempt to return Latin America to the bloody past of military coups to block the will of the people .
``I call particularly upon the British government to unreservedly condemn this military coup and to demand the immediate release of President Zelaya and to urge President Obama , who has promised a new era of relations between the US and South America , to do everything in his power to support the release of President Zelaya and restoration of democracy in Honduras . ''
Bolivarian Circle of the Netherlands statement
www.circulobolivariano -- July 1 , 2009 --
The Bolivarian Circle of the Netherlands joins the solidarity with the people of Honduras and the democratic and legitimate government formed by President Manuel Zelaya .
We openly reject the kidnapping of the president of Honduras , as well as the agression against the embassadors of Cuba , Nicaragua and Venezuela .
We condemn the kidnapping of the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Patricia Rodas , and we empathise with the pain the coup has caused for the family of the victims .
We call out for the international organisations to demand freedom of speech and mobility for the people of Honduras .
We request the democratic countries not to acknowledge the temporary government that has been installed by the ones who inflicted the coup and to demand the return of democracy .
We strongly support the unity of the ALBA countries ; this Bolivarian unity , which is a regional proposal for integration with a new economic moral , with the aim of banishing poverty .
These fraternally united countries today take their responsibility and support the democratically chosen president Zelaya and his people who mobilise at this moment to save their president and the Democracy .
The noble ideals of President Zelaya we see today being limited with brutal effort by a powerful , social sector from the army , a sector of the legal power and a group within the government , that wants to give a false impression of the constitutional state .
We call up the soldiers of Honduras not to shoot at its own people .
We summon the international community not to be deceived , the military coup is illegal and antidemocratic .
We show our deep concern for the prisoners and the persecuted .
We condemn the killings which have been caused by the fascistic oppression of the unarmed people .
The people of Honduras and their president Manuel Zelaya are not alone .
Our rejection of this coup d'etat corresponds to the demand for justice expressed all over the world .
The peace of Latin America is in danger .
It is legitimate and justified to break with the economic dependance .
The capitalistic crisis manifests itself in new ways , let us not accept the fact that the unprotected people have to pay the bill of the capitalistic system .
Yes to participative democracy , to the right of the Honduran people to be consulted .
For the sake of democracy and peace .
Let us condemn the injustice going on in Honduras .
Well , at least this time -- unlike the last -- no one got hurt :
A woman who police said had an XM - 15 assault rifle , a shotgun , and 500 rounds of ammunition in her car was arrested and charged with trespassing after officials at the Air National Guard Base at Gabreski Airport called the Suffolk County Sheriff ’s office to report that she was taking photographs on base property in Westhampton Thursday night .
Nancy Genovese , 49 , of Lakewood Avenue in Quogue was charged with criminal trespass in the third degree , arraigned in Southampton Town Justice Court on Friday and is being held at the Suffolk County Correctional Facility in Riverhead on $ 50,000 bail .
This was n’t the first time Ms. Genovese was observed taking pictures of the base , according to the sheriff ’s department .
When Deputy Sheriff Robert Carlock arrived at the scene Thursday night , he was told by members of the Air National Guard that she had been warned for several weeks to stay off of the airport property .
She had reportedly been seen several times taking pictures along the perimeter of the base .
An off - duty Southampton Town Police officer recognized Ms. Genovese when she returned to the base Thursday night .
If you go to Genovese 's MySpace page , you 'll see that it features the nice woman at right and the declaration " Μολών Λaβέ " -- or " Molon labe " which is Greek for " Come and get them . "
This , as I 've described previously , is a favorite theme or code word among the new militias organizing out there ; they are declaring that Obama will take their guns away only by deadly force .
As Wikipedia notes , it 's the sentimental equivalent of " Over my dead body . "
Genovese 's MySpace blog declares , among other things , her utter admiration for Glenn Beck :
... we the people .
I just saw GlennBeck tell it like it is !
Yes , he was firm and he is talking to congress , for all of us .
... we the people .
I just saw Glenn Becks show , now on the 2 am show , missed it at 5 PM today .
United we stand , divided we fall .
Please do re post this video .
He is mad as hell and so are we .
He is right and so are we .
He says a copy of the letter he is speaking of , from a grandmother , is on his site GlennBeck.com , if you want to add a comment or sign it .
God Bless all of you my friends .
She is also obsessed with FEMA and ardently believes that concentration camps are being built :
He got me by surprise on his first call .
I was n't ready for him .
I just called his direct line , and spent about 10 minuets on the phone with questions I wanted to ask him , being from DHS .
He says there is no way right now , marshal law will be imposed in the USA .
He told me it would have to be dyer situation for the President to make such a declaration .
I presented a scenario of dyer straits to him , like , the dollar goes down to the predicted 15.7 cent in value , swine flu is killing people and they have a few million dead bodies to deal with , people have no homes , no food , looting is going on .
Um , yes , martial law would be something the country would need .
He did insist Americans would never put up with being put in any camp and stopped me when I even mentioned the word camp .
He told me FEMA owns NO camps .
None .
I asked , " you must see the info on the internet regarding these camps ? "
He told me he ... " works all day and had no time to research the videos " and docs proving FEMA owns these camps .
I have the feeling his job title may be damage control .
I 'm sure Beck will deny he had anything to do with this , too .
Maybe she 's just another liberal out to make conservatives look nutty .
No doubt he 'll point out that he actually debunked the FEMA camps story .
This is true .
Unfortunately , as we also noted , it followed on three weeks ' worth of Beck telling his audience he " could n't debunk " the camps story .

As does Martin Hill at OpEd News .
[ In the first part of a new analysis , high - end game audio veteran Rob Bridgett ( Scarface , 50 Cent : Blood In The Sand ) examines Skywalker Sound 's mixing on the remastered Ghost In The Shell movie , then extrapolates to ask - is real - time mixing of sound effects , music and dialog in games an important part of the future of AAA game audio ? ]
Over the last five or so years , interactive mixing has developed considerably .
From basic dialogue ducking systems to full blown interactive mixer snapshots and side - chain style auto - ducking systems , there is currently a wide variety of mixing technologies , techniques and applications within the game development environment .
The majority of these systems are in their infancy ; however , some are already building on several successful iterations and improving on usability and quality .
I have believed for some time now that mixing is the single remaining area in video game audio that will allow game sound to articulate itself as fully as the sound design in motion - pictures .
As you 'll see later in the article , I recently had the chance to sit in on a motion - picture final mix at Skywalker Ranch with Randy Thom ( FX Mixer ) and Tom Myers ( Music and Foley Mixer ) on a remix project for the original ' Ghost in the Shell ' animated feature for a new theatrical release .
I was able to observe first - hand the work - flow and established processes of film mixing and I attempted to try and translate some of them over into the video game mixing process .
The comparison and the possibilities for game audio is especially true now that we are able to play back samples at the same resolution as film and are able to have hundreds of simultaneous sounds playing at the same time .
The current shortfall in terms of mixing technology and techniques has lead to games not being able to develop and mature in areas of artistic application and expression .
While examples in film audio give games a starting point at which to aim , it certainly is only a starting point , as many film mixing techniques can only translate so far once mapped onto the interactive real - time world of games .
Interactive mixing offers up a completely different set of challenges from those of mixing movies , allowing for the tuning of many more parameters per sound , or group of sounds , than just volume and panning .
Not only this , but due to the unpredictable interactive nature of the medium , it is entirely possible to have many different mixer events ( moments ) all occurring at the same time , fighting for priority and affecting the sound in unpredictable and emergent ways .
There are a whole variety of techniques required to get around these challenges , but in the end , and looking beyond all the technical differences in the two media , it all comes back to being able to achieve the same artistic finesse that is achieved in a motion picture sound mix .
Film Standard Features
To begin , I have chosen to highlight some of the techniques and concepts used in linear film mixing so we can quickly see what is useful to game sound mixing and how each area translates over to the interactive realm .
But first , I should clarify a few simple mixer concepts that often get confused .
Fader -
A software or hardware slider that is used to control the volume of a sound .
- A software or hardware slider that is used to control the volume of a sound .
Channel -
A single channel , representing the volume and parameters of a single sound , usually manifested by a fader , sometimes called a ' channel strip ' when including other functionality above the fader such as auxiliary sends or EQ trim pots .
( Not to be confused with a ' speaker channel ' , a term used to describe the source of a sound from a particular speaker , Left , Right , Centre , left Surround etc )
- A single channel , representing the volume and parameters of a single sound , usually manifested by a fader , sometimes called a ' channel strip ' when including other functionality above the fader such as auxiliary sends or EQ trim pots .
( Not to be confused with a ' speaker channel ' , a term used to describe the source of a sound from a particular speaker , Left , Right , Centre , left Surround etc ) Bus / Group -
This is the concept of a parent channel which has global control over the values of other child channels as a collective group .
This is also usually represented by a fader in either software and / or mirrored in hardware .
- This is the concept of a parent channel which has global control over the values of other child channels as a collective group .
This is also usually represented by a fader in either software and / or mirrored in hardware .
Mixer Snapshots - A ' snapshot ' of all the volume and parameter positions and settings of an entire set of channels and buses , like a photograph of the mixing board capturing all its settings at any particular moment .
Blending from one snapshot to another results in automated changes in these parameters over time .
Film Standards : Grouping
Perhaps one of the most basic concepts in mixing , grouping is the ability to assign individual sounds to larger controller groups .
It 's essential in being able to efficiently and quickly mix a movie or a piece of music .
In music , a clear example is that of all the different drum parts that go into making up a drum kit , you have the hi-hats , the kick - drum and so on , all mic'd separately .
All of these individual channels are then pre-mixed and grouped into a single parent bus called ' drums ' - when the ' drums ' bus is made quieter or louder , all of the ' child buses ' belonging to it are attenuated by the same amount .
In film this can be as simple as the channels for each track being routed through a master fader , or belonging to generic parent groups called ' dialogue ' , ' foley ' , or ' music ' .
In terms of video games , having a hierarchical structure with parent and child buses is absolutely essential , and the depths at which sounds can belong to buses often goes far deeper than in film mixes .
For example , a master bus would contain ' music ' , ' sfx ' and ' dialogue ' buses , within the ' sfx ' bus there would be ' weapons ' , ' foley ' , ' explosions ' , ' physics sounds ' etc .
Within the ' weapons ' bus there would be ' player weapons ' and ' non player weapons ' , within ' player weapons ' would be ' handgun ' , ' pistol ' , ' machine gun ' , within ' machine gun ' would be ' AK47 ' , ' Uzi ' , etc. Within ' AK47 ' would be the channels ' shell casings ' , ' gun foley ' , ' dry fire ' , ' shot ' , ' tail ' and so on .
These bus levels need to go much deeper because at any given moment in a mix you could need to control all of the ' sfx ' parameters as a group , or all of the weapons parameters , or just the AK47 , or just a single element of the AK47 such as the shell casings .
In film this is easier to do because you have frame by frame control over the automation of linear ' tracks ' on a time - line , so at any moment you can decide the volume , EQ or pitch of any number of individual sounds on simultaneous tracks .
In games however , we are talking about many individual triggered events , that can occur at any frame in the game .
For a quick hands - on investigation into video game busing , third - party engines such as Audiokinetic 's Wwise feature a very rounded and simple to use example of this ' parent / child ' bus structure and can be quickly used to set up some complex routing allowing a great deal of control over the mix of large scale or very detailed elements .
FMOD also has the concept of Channel Groups which act in much the same way .

The North Carolina State Senate has voted overwhelmingly to ban large wind turbines from the state ’s scenic western ridgelines .
The 42 - 1 vote on Thursday represents the strongest stand against wind turbines taken by lawmakers in any state .
The bill would amend a 1983 “ ridge law ” to allow only turbines that are 100 feet or smaller to be placed on ridgelines above 3,000 feet .
This effectively bars industrial - sized turbines — which can reach several hundred feet in height — from the windy mountaintops .
The bill has been sent to the state ’s House of Representatives for consideration .
However , the House is due to adjourn in a few days , so the debate is likely to resume after the legislature returns next May March , according to Brandon R. Blevins , the wind program coordinator for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy .
If the bill becomes law , it would “ virtually ban two - thirds of the onshore wind resource in N.C. , ” he said in an e-mail message .
The Senate action in North Carolina is the first time a state legislative body has voted to ban turbines , according to Christine Real de Azua , a spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association .
New Jersey had a temporary moratorium on offshore wind projects while the state studied the matter , but now New Jersey is moving ahead with offshore projects , she said .
Around the country , some counties have enacted height limitations on turbines .
Ivan Urlaub , executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association , pointed out that the state legislature just passed a number of other bills that increase renewable energy incentives , including a five - year extension of a generous tax credit that now is on the governor ’s desk .
The potential blanket ban on big turbines “ is very much an issue about do people want to look at wind turbines in the mountains of North Carolina , ” Mr. Urlaub said .
“ It ’s not about the state ’s commitment to renewable energy or lack of commitment . ”
He acknowledged , however , that the vote “ has had the effect of raising concerns about North Carolina ’s commitment to clean energy . ”
The bill passed on Thursday in the Senate would assist the development of wind energy along the North Carolina coast by establishing an environmental permitting process , according to Mr. Urlaub .
U.S. President Barack Obama has now been in office for 167 days , and it 's time for a look back .
Why 167 days ?
Why not - it 's just as arbitrary a number as the usual " 100 days " .
In that time , President Obama has contended with stimulating the U.S. economy , reshaping U.S. policy abroad , and starting work on domestic issues such as health care reform .
As he and his family arrive in Moscow today for an official visit , find here a look back at some of the first 167 days of the Obama administration .

IronRuby was originally announced by Microsoft at MIX'07 and two years later developers are wondering where is version 1.0 .
InfoQ interviewed John Lam My in January of 2008 , where John indicated the team was looking for release in the second half of the year , but that did not materialize .
As developers , we know things always take longer than you think they will .
Jimmy Schementi , Program Manager for Microsoft on the IronRuby project , recently gave a talk titled “ IronRuby 0.9 ” at OSCON 2009 where he outlined the progress Microsoft has made moving toward IronRuby 1.0 .
IronRuby has gone through much development since our talk with John Lam in early 2008 .
There some key updates worth reviewing :
IronRuby 0.6
Released at the beginning of July 2009 it marks a significant milestone in moving the language forward .
Jimmy points out on his blog :
Performance has been a major focus to this release , getting startup time quicker and optimizing built - in types .
There has been more progress with Ruby compatibility ( Cucumber works ! ) and .NET interop .
IronRuby 0.9
The focus of Jimmy ’s OSCON talk was around this release which includes the last set of major features the implementation will see , which he outlined in a recent blog post and includes some key components of IronRuby and what they should mean to developers .
Cross-platform , cross - browser Ruby implementation :
Whenever people hear .NET [ they first think about a top - level domain , but when in the context of “ Microsoft ” ] they immediately think “ Windows ” .
But Miguel and the Mono team have shown that is n’t reality .
They ’ve built a open - source implementation of .NET which runs on Linux , Mac OS , and also Windows .
They are also building a open - source Silverlight 2 implementation , called Moonlight , allowing Silverlight applications to run on Linux browsers supporting Mozilla ’s plug - in architecture ; Silverlight 2 runs on Intel Macs and Windows .
Since IronRuby runs on .NET and Silverlight , it also runs on Mono and Moonlight .
Because IronRuby integrates directly with .
NET , you can use any existing .NET code from IronRuby .
This means that any frameworks , be them Windows Forms , Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) , or GTK ( # ) , can be used from IronRuby because .NET and Mono [ respectively ] have CLI bindings for these frameworks .
Mono even has a Windows Forms implementation that translates to GTK , so the same application can run unmodified on both implementations .
Dynamic and Static language interop :
IronRuby has great integration with the .NET framework APIs , so C# / VB code can be called from IronRuby without it feeling like “ interop ” .
C# can also call IronRuby through the Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) Hosting APIs .
However , in .NET 4.0 dynamic method dispatch is part of C# , so calling IronRuby from C# is just as easy as a C# method call .
Being that IronRuby is built on the DLR , it can interoperate with other DLR languages just as easily , so Python and Ruby play along nicely today , and future DLR languages as well .
Performance improvements are measurable including Ruby on Rails startup time going from 80 + seconds to about 20 seconds .
Also noted is currently where IronRuby fairs running RubySpec test suite :
Compatibility is really good at this point .
We run the RubySpec test suite , passing at ( 85 % ) and the test suites from popular Ruby frameworks , including Rails , Rake , RSpec , and RubyGems , on every check - in , and can run pretty substantial Rails applications .
Increasing compatibility bugs will definitely be the focus of the point releases approaching 1.0 .
Also ,
This upcoming version will boast support for the Win32OLE library , making existing Ruby applications with interact with COM work as they do in MRI , like Watir .
Performance is also being measured against other Ruby implementations , such as MRI :
Performance is also in a very good place .
This past version has pushed on the Ruby benchmark suite , and now we are >= 2 x better than MRI on almost all benchmarks .
Those numbers will be published on http://ironruby.info around the same time IronRuby 0.9 comes out .
IronRuby 1.0
When will IronRuby 1.0 be released ?
It will depend on the community .
Improvements will be made to 0.9 in point releases ( 0.9.1 , 0.9.2 , etc ) until the community decides it is ready to be called , IronRuby 1.0 .
More information about IronRuby , downloading , contributing or finding support can be found on the IronRuby website .

Loyal reader Kathy Davies writes in with a great tip about keeping ice cream fresh .
Avoid those ice crystals that form at the top of your ice cream by placing a piece of plastic wrap right on top of the ice cream .
It keeps the air out and everything stays fresh .
Just make sure to leave a bit of wrap that extends beyond the ice cream so it 's easy to pull off .

Ten human rights and social change organizations in Israel have publicly declared support for the organization " Breaking the Silence " ( Shovrim Shtika ) .
In a letter to the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defense and the Foreign Minister , the organizations protested the Israeli government 's attack on the group , which reached its peak when the government attempted to prevent the group from receiving funding .
“ Indeed , the soldiers ' testimonies that were published by " Breaking the Silence " do not tell the ' official ' story that the government of Israel wants to tell the public .
They place a large question mark over the ' most moral army in the world . ' image .
They call on the Israel public to leave behind its illusions and participate in a meaningful discussion about the character of the society in which they live ” say the organizations .
“ Unfortunately , instead of living up to the challenge set by this report , initiating a real public debate about the significance of the testimonies and holding a thorough investigation of the matter , those in power in the military and government preferred to wage a frontal assault on the organization through the publication of baseless accusations meant to challenge the authenticity of the organization and the report 's findings . "
The organizations called on the Israeli government to participate in the public debate over the issues raised in the document released by " Breaking the Silence , " and to deal with the content of the testimonies in a meaningful way .
" The aggressive pressure employed by the Foreign Ministry and other governmental bodies in order to silence ' Breaking the Silence ' is dangerous and troubling , " said the organizations , who added that the health and proper functioning of democracy are expressed in , among other things , the legitimacy it grants to organizations who criticize the authorities .
Organizations that participated in the statement : The Association for Civil Rights in Israel , Bimkom , B'Tselem , Gisha , Physicians for Human Rights , Adalah , Yesh Din , HaMoked , Center for the Defence of the Individual , Public Committee Against Torture in Israel , Rabbis for Human Rights
WASHINGTON  President Obama has issued signing statements claiming the authority to bypass dozens of provisions of bills enacted into law since he took office , provoking mounting criticism by lawmakers from both parties .
President George W. Bush , citing expansive theories about his constitutional powers , set off a national debate in 2006 over the propriety of signing statements  instructions to executive officials about how to interpret and put in place new laws  after he used them to assert that he could authorize officials to bypass laws like a torture ban and oversight provisions of the USA Patriot Act .
In the presidential campaign , Mr. Obama called Mr. Bush ’s use of signing statements an “ abuse , ” and said he would issue them with greater restraint .
The Obama administration says the signing statements the president has signed so far , challenging portions of five bills , have been based on mainstream interpretations of the Constitution and echo reservations routinely expressed by presidents of both parties .
Still , since taking office , Mr. Obama has relaxed his criteria for what kinds of signing statements are appropriate .
And last month several leading Democrats  including Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and David R. Obey of Wisconsin  sent a letterto Mr. Obama complaining about one of his signing statements .

Its the word of the times , isnt it ?
Right now , as so many organizations go through significant change , the phrase business as usual seems like an oxymoron .
Usual ?
Theres nothing usual about the way
Im doing business in this economy , you Your organization might be going through a merger , expanding or decreasing its employee base , or just operating in a difficult economy .
Whatever the transition , the scenario affects your organizations business processes , sales , and employees .
Whats interesting to me is that when times are tough , when theres an issue with the economy , some businesses do really well and some do not and these are businesses in the same industry !
For many , the economy is like pizza :
When its good , its really good , and even when its bad , its still pretty good .
What I see making a big difference are attitude and belief .
If youre walking around thinking things are tough , thats the mind - set you have .
What you focus your attention on is what your life looks like .
Its the vibe people get from you .
Its going to be the way you present things .
Looking at life through loser - colored glasses can undercut your chances to succeed .
So can you just believe your way to a rosier picture ?
Its not really about thinking positive thoughts and then just watching and waiting as good things come your way .
Thats a simple way to state the premise of Rhonda Byrnes successful book The Secret , but I have to say Im not buying it .
In fact , I think The Secret is definably not the secret .
It makes perfect sense that any book telling you that belief without action will create success is definitely going to be a best - seller .
While I think its important to have a belief system , theres more to success than that .
Most companies and most people who succeed when times are tough make sure they get more focused on the needs of the customer in the moment .
To succeed , we cant be stuck in the long - term needs weve identified over the years .
Thats probably not where the customers head is right now .
Youve got to sharpen your focus on whats really important to customers here and now .
If your customers treading water ( which is nothing more than controlled drowning ) , throw him a life preserver .
You can teach him to swim later .
Once youre past the crisis , theres always time to get customers back on track with what you know will benefit them long - term .
Act in the moment
Attitude and belief can help you through a tough time , but not by flat - out ignoring difficult circumstances or willing them to magically disappear .
You have to first recognize that tough times are temporary and then work quickly to address the needs that arise during difficult conditions .
So dont let the media tell you what your life looks like ; remember that good news does not sell newspapers .
Have you ever noticed that really depressing news stories are often followed by Prozac commercials ?
You cant just will a sluggish economy to pick up instantly , but you can believe that it will bounce back over time it always does .
With that attitude , it makes sense to take action to meet peoples most pressing needs until things bounce back and you can return to business as usual .
Suppose you work for a company thats going through changes and youre afraid your division is about to be cut or your job is in jeopardy .
Thats when you have to figure out what your boss really , truly needs besides a vacation .
You might have to forget for a moment how brilliant you are and how all your grand ideas can push the company in fabulous new directions .
Instead , you need to ask :
Whats a big deal right now ?
You stand to benefit greatly by turning your focus to the companys immediate needs .
If youre doing work thats really important to your employer here and now , then when the chopping block comes down your boss will be looking in the other direction .
Its like if you and co-worker are being chased by a bear you dont have to outrun the bear , just your co-worker .
Critical and even negative thinking can have great strategic benefit , allowing you to spot trouble on the horizon .
But when you insist on looking at life through loser lenses , it prevents you from seeing the effort you need to make .
People and companies that are really successful during times of transition often have to work a little harder , investing more thought , more time , and even more money to do as well as they did before .
But even though they expend more resources to perform as well as last year , theyre not losing ground in a company - wide shake - up or industry - wide slump .
Odds are , theyre still moving forward .
When business picks up again , they will have cemented their usefulness to employers and customers and can resume a better version of business as usual .

It ’s Ripe and well cooked – Windows Mobile 6.5
Yea , older 6.x was n’t good enough .
The UI was sluggish non-smooth .
thanks to shiny gadgets like iPhone , Pre , Android , our expectations have grown exponentially in alst 2 - 3 years .
Recently , Microsoft came with something to surprise us .
One event gave an exclusive demo of the final version of the new Windows Phone operating system , running on a touch screen HTC Touch Diamond2 .
And yes , they renamed it from Windows Mobile 6.5 to Windows Phone OS 6.5 , my o my , why was that done ?
Does n’t it look like iPhone OS , Palm WebOS , Android OS ?
Anyway , there are good things to discuss about .
Graphics & UI – There is a complete Redesign of the OS UI and its Zune look - alike feel , a totally new thing .
I liked Zune HD and windows Phone will feature it .
Graphics have improved – For the first time Windows Phone features 24 - bit colors in menu icons .
though all the devices that I know off supported high colors , Native support from OS was absent .
Other changes include – Icons replace the standard folder view seen after pressing the Start button .
Though I did n’t like part of the UI – SMS app , email app – not much is changed in them and they still ai n’t as - good - as RIM or iPhone / Pre/Android .
App Store aka MarketPlace - The Market Place for Windows Phone is Ready .
It will feature all Apps that will run on Windows Phones , just like world ’s most popular – iPhone ’s App Store .
Syncing – MyPhone synchronisation features of the Windows Phone OS – using which the mobile ’s contents can all be backed - up to the cloud via a Windows Live account .
The My Phone PC client software can also remotely wipe the handset if it is lost or stolen and can download all the SMS , emails and contacts to a replacement mobile .
Now this is something solid – better than what other Phones offer .
i Phone does this but at a cost with MobileME .
Microsoft has plans to make it available for free – Groovy !
Multi-Touch – Unfortunately , Windows
Phone is still generations back here – no multi touch navigation , pinch to zoom in and zoom out – ability of the iPhone .
And the bad news is – It ’s not due to appear until the next Windows Phone OS release .
It ’s hard to use those stylus – multi - touch is a must .
Availability –
As per the news , INQUIRER
The Windows Phone OS will arrive before Christmas , possibly around the same time as the Vole ’s public release of the Windows 7 operating system for PCs on October 22 .
Have a look at the new UI – Source theinquirer

NOW IT APPEARS TO BE THE TURN OF THE
SWEETHEART OF THE FAR , FAR RIGHT
Is it America 's Princess ' turn to watch gasoline being poured on her 2012 campaign ?
New York Daily News political correspondent Michael Saul Vanity Fair :
Sarah Palin trashed by members of John McCain 's campaign team in Vanity Fair
Alaska 's lipstick - wearing pit-bull is a " Little Shop of Horrors . "
That 's how one longtime friend and campaign trail companion of John McCain , the vanquished 2008 GOP presidential nominee , described veep nominee Sarah Palin .
In an expansive story in the August edition of Vanity Fair , a slew of senior members of McCain 's campaign team told reporter Todd S. Purdum that they suffer a kind of survivor 's guilt following the 2008 presidential election .
" They can't quite believe that for two frantic months last fall , caught in a Bermuda Triangle of a campaign , they worked their tails off to try to elect as vice president of the United States someone who , by mid-October , they believed for certain was nowhere near ready for the job , and might never be , " Vanity Fair reports .
During the campaign , there were reports of anonymous McCain aides describing Palin , the governor of Alaska , as a " diva " and a " whack job . "
The Vanity Fair article recounts how strained Palin 's relationship was with the McCain advisers .
She maintained " only the barest level of civil discourse " with Tucker Eskew , the operative assigned to be her chief minder , the magazine reports .
She believed Steve Schmidt , McCain 's top strategist , had lied to her about conducting polling in Alaska - that was a " belief she conveyed to anyone who would listen , " the magazine reported .
As previously reported , Palin was so intent on delivering her own concession speech on Election Night that she would n't accept advisers telling her that McCain had decided he would be the only one to speak .
She took the issue up with McCain himself , discussing it on the walk from his hotel suite to the farewell rally .
Palin did not speak on Election Night .
Only McCain addressed the crowd and the nation .
One McCain aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he " always wanted to tell myself the best - case story about her . "
" I think , as I 've evaluated it , I think some of my worst fears … the after - election events have confirmed that her more negative aspects my have been there … . "
As his voice trailed off , he said , " I saw her as a raw talent .
Raw , but a talent .
I hoped she could become better . "
Palin refused to comment for Vanity Fair .
THERE MAY NOT BE A SANTA CLAUS , BUT
THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A WILLARD ( SIGH )
Here's
“ Seeing this family become healed is our highest priority , ” Romney said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ At the same time , and not commenting particularly on Governor Sanford , … people in public life ought to be held to a higher standard . …
I heard one … former governor say , ‘ Well , everybody makes mistakes . ’
Well , that ’s true .
“ But not all mistakes are the same .
And not everybody is a governor or a senator or a president .
And we expect [ those ] people to live by a higher standard , because what they do is going to be magnified , their families are going to be hurt more by what they do , the things they care about will be hurt , and the culture of the nation and the people who follow them will be hurt . ”
Does the man have a silver tongue , or what ?
" Not everybody is a governor or a senator or a president . "
Check !
Should we perhaps have exact figures on this ?
It seems to be important .
A rough percentage , at least ?
Let 's see , there are 50 governors , and , um , 99 senators ( thanks , Norm Coleman and John Cornyn ! ) , and one president . . . so we add that , and divide by the entire population , and . . .
YOUR TWO - PARTY SYSTEM AT WORK : REP .
JEFF
FLAKE ( R - AZ ) STEPS TO THE PLATE ON ACES
We used the Waxman - Markey " climate " bill as a sort of test case for how the Dems are functioning at midyear 2009 .
How about the R's ?
Let 's consider the case of Jeff Flake ( AZ - 06 ) .
Naturally Congressman Flake , as a Republican , opposes ACES .
“ The last thing a fragile economy needs is a new energy tax , yet that ’s essentially what this cap and trade bill is , ” said Flake .
“ This bill is more about generating revenue for the federal government than it is about addressing climate change . ”
So we know for darn sure that the congressman voted his conscience Friday night , right ?
Um , not exactly .
The website report continues :
Unfortunately , Congressman
Flake was unable to vote on the bill due to a family obligation .
Congressman Flake ’s daughter was Arizona ’s representative in the America ’s Junior Miss scholarship program , and Congressman Flake and his wife were there supporting her .
“ Obviously , it was a tough decision to miss voting against the cap and trade bill .
But I ’ve let my daughter down enough over the years , and I felt I just could n’t let her down again . ”
Had he been able to vote , he would have voted against the bill .
Unless it is changed substantially , Congressman Flake will vote against the cap and trade conference report when it comes back to the House .
Whatta guy !
I 'm sure the fact that the congressman will vote against the bill later was of great assurance to his ideological comrades as they did battle in the vote Friday night .
# [ UPDATE : Governor
Tim says he will indeed sign .
The only thing is , that followed a full - fledged confession from Norm Coleman .
So I 'm not sure how many grains of sanity he gets credit for , considering that at this point he really had no alternative . ]

I 'm sure the fact that the congressman will vote against the bill later was of great assurance to his ideological comrades as they did battle in the vote Friday night .
As we continue our snapshots of our glorious two - part system moving on from the Dems , it 's not entirely clear that the Republicans ought to be included .
Do you call that " work " ?
Here 's what Republicans do now :
Whatever happens , if it comes from a Democrat , they Just Say No. O perhaps I should say they JustNo .
From a certain vantage point , we could just sit back and enjoy the spectacle of the Republicans in the wilderness , after eight years of consolidation of all federal government power in the hands of the Permanent Republican Majority ( pat. pending ) .
Ha ha !
In theory , being out of power should be right up the right - wing loons ' alley .
Opposition is what they 're traditionally good at , probably thething they 're good at .
They 're sure as hell no good at .
If we learned anything in the eight years of the Bush regime -- and mind you , it 's not at all clear that a lot of the countrylearn anything -- it's that turning actualover to these crackpots can be a recipe for catastrophe , especially when the particular crackpots harbor megalomaniacal delusions .
Unfortunately , for the moment the wingnuts seems to have lost their touch .
Oh , they remember the joys of opposition , all right , they 've just come to think " opposition " consists of saying " Fuck no , fuck no " all day long , intermixed with the occasional " yo mama wears sweatsox . "
Now I do n't at all underestimate the disruptive potential of the Republican campaign of nonstop obstruction and obfuscation , all greased with the now - standard policy of " all lies , all the time , " so carefully nurtured during the 2008 presidential campaign .
And people will grow impatient , even though they kept claiming last fall to understand that it would take time to haul the economy out of the deep trench in which the Bush regime buried it .
Still , it 's kind of a limited message , and there are signs that it has n't escaped the country 's notice that the R's have given up any pretense of interest in constructive participation in the governing process .
Meanwhile , somehow they just do n't seem to have regained the flair they exhibited in the Clinton years for nuclear opposition , though they do seem to have become rather good at the meltdown part .
I do n't have the heart to jump ugly any more on poor South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , the conservatives ' conservative .
Besides , apart from the question of whether he will resign , a question he does n't seem much interested in , the principal question under discussion is , who done him in ?
And since the list of his enemies seems to include most everyone in South Carolina , this could take awhile .

The Alaska legislature has overridden former Gov. Sarah Palin ’s veto of stimulus money for energy efficiency .
Ms. Palin had turned down the $ 28 million in financing this spring ; it was the only portion of Alaska ’s stimulus package allotment that she rejected .
At the time , she cited concern that stipulations attached to the funds would obligate Alaska to enact more stringent building codes .
A recent letter from the Department of Energy to an Alaskan legislative aide clarified that Alaska did not need to enact stricter statewide building codes .
Rather , the state must offer assurances that it will “ encourage , promote and assist ” municipalities that adopt their own energy - efficiency codes .
The legislative vote on Monday was 45 - 14 in favor of the override .
Before the vote , in a message on her Facebook page , Ms. Palin wrote of her continuing concern about the conditions attached to the energy funds :
As Governor , I did my utmost to warn our legislators that accepting stimulus funds will further tie Alaska to the federal government and chip away at Alaska ’s right to chart its own course .
Enforcing the federal building code requirements , which Governor Parnell and future governors will be forced to adopt in order to accept these energy funds , will eventually cost the state more than it receives .
There are clear ropes attached , and Alaskans will soon find themselves tied down by codes which will dictate how we build and renovate homes and businesses .
The state has hundreds of millions of dollars already budgeted for conservation , weatherization and renewable energy development .
Legislators do n’t need to play politics as usual and accept these funds and the ropes that come with them .
Advocates of energy efficiency , however , welcomed the vote .
“ It shows Alaska is not going to take a backseat on energy issues and underscores the growing bipartisan commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy in Alaska , the state with coldest climate and some of the highest energy prices in the nation , ” said Chris Rose , the executive director of the Renewable Energy Alaska Project , in an e-mail message to Green Inc .

Most of the tigers at Panna National Park were killed by poachers
One of India 's main tiger parks - Panna National Park - has admitted it no longer has any tigers .
The park , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh , was part of the country 's efforts to save the famous Royal Bengal Tiger from extinction .
State Minister of Forests Rajendra Shukla said that the reserve , which three years ago had 24 tigers , no longer had any .
A special census was conducted in the park by a premier wildlife institute , after the forest authorities reported no sightings of the animals for a long time .
This is the second tiger reserve in India , after Sariska in Rajasthan , where numbers have dwindled to zero .
Warning bells
Officials from the wildlife department say there is no " explicable " reason for the falling number of tigers .
But a report prepared by the central forest ministry says Panna cannot be compared with Sariska because " warning bells were sounded regularly for the last eight years " .
The report says wildlife authorities failed to see the impending disaster despite repeated warnings , and lost most of Panna 's big cats to poaching .
While this controversy rages , there have been reports that another national park in Madhya Pradesh , Sanjay National Park , which was included in the tiger project three years ago , also has no tigers left .
The park had a population of 15 tigers until the late 1990s .
Of the more than 1,400 tigers in the country , 300 dwell in the state of Madhya Pradesh , which is also called the " tiger state of India " .
Best managed But Madhya Pradesh 's forest minister Rajendra Shukla says all the news is not bleak .
" Panna is our only park which has lost on this count , " he says .
" Three of state 's reserve forests - Kanha , Bandhavgarh and Pench - have been adjudged among the best managed tiger reserves in the country . "
Mr Shukla has drawn up a seven - member committee comprising the state 's chief conservator of forests and experts , to ascertain why the tigers have disappeared .
Indian officials regularly carry out tiger censuses in the national parks
The chief conservator , HS Pabla , told the BBC that the report would be submitted some time in August .
He said that tigers from Sanjay National Park " could have strayed to the adjoining area , which is now part of the state of Chattisgarh , created some years ago . "
The authorities have recently transported two female tigers to Panna from another nearby tiger park , and sought permission from the central administration to bring in four more , two of them males .
Project tiger India had 40,000 tigers a century ago , but the numbers dwindled fast because of hunting and poaching .
The country banned tiger hunting and launched an ambitious conservation effort named Project Tiger to increase the population of the endangered species .
A number of forest areas were declared national parks and funds allotted for protecting the tigers .
Though the programme bore fruit initially , with the decline in numbers checked because of a hunting ban , recent years have seen a phenomenal rise in poaching , which is now organised almost along the lines of drug - smuggling .
The authorities have not been able to put a stop to it , owing to the ever - changing techniques used by the cartels , and corruption within .
MK Ranjitsingh , a member of National Wildlife Advisory Board , says the authorities must crack down on the poachers by preventing their activities in the parks , and stopping the export of tiger products .
And they must , he adds , lobby for international pressure on the nations of the Far East , which are the main buyers of such goods .
There have been reports that there is a huge demand for tiger bones , claws and skin in countries like China , Taiwan and Korea .

Consumers learn to deal with debt the American way .
Consumers are mad as hell and they 're not going to take it anymore .
Every day , the bank calls -- demanding to know why the consumer has n't paid his credit card bills .
Every time the consumer skips a payment ( to persuade the bank to cut the interest rate ) , the bank responds by jacking up the interest rate .
And so on .
Now consumers are finally responding by doing what banks do when they can't pay their debts : just walking away .
David Streitfeld , NYT : Those on the front lines of the debt industry say there is a small but increasingly noticeable group of strapped consumers who ... are deciding they will simply stop paying .
After loading up on debt eagerly provided by the card companies during the boom times , these people now find themselves trapped in an endless cycle where they are charged interest on interest and fees upon fees while the lenders get government bailouts ...
Collectors are noticing a shift not only in ability but in willingness to pay .
“ With all the bailouts the government is giving everyone , no one has any personal accountability about their own debts , ” said Roger Knauf , who runs a trade group of debt - buying firms ...
That people would intentionally default on loans they never should have gotten in the first place took lenders by surprise .
“ I ’m astonished that people would walk away from their homes , ” Bank of America chief executive Kenneth Lewis said in late 2007 .
Nineteen months later , walking away from mortgages is widespread if impossible to quantify , and no cause for embarrassment .
Rather the opposite : it shows savviness .
“ I ’ll walk away before I take a loss , ” a Dallas financier recently boasted to Barron ’s magazine about his efforts to sell his $ 6 million vacation estate .

At the turn of the last century , there were only two psychedelic compounds known to man : cannabis and mescaline ( which is what makes peyote so popular with shamans and hippies ) .
By the 1950s , scientists had developed or uncovered LSD , psilocybin ( the active ingredient in " magic mushrooms " ) and about 15 more compounds you 've probably never heard of .
These days , we 're well into the hundreds , thanks in large part to the work of an organic chemist named Dr. Alexander Shulgin and many years ' worth of experimentation ( much of it on himself ) in a tiny lab in his backyard in Northern California .
( Pictured above : Shulgin and his wife , Ann . )
Shulgin is responsible for at least 200 psychedelic compounds ( which were n't illegal when he created them , simply because the DEA had n't yet heard of them ) , is the author of a pair of memoir / cookbooks called PHiKAL and TiHKAL , short for " Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved " and " Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved , " respectively .
But he is certainly most famous for reintroducing the world to a little - known compound called MDMA in 1976 .
It had been patented by Merck in 1914 , but thinking it useless , the drug giant had never done anything with it .
Shulgin resynthesized it , wrote a paper about it in which he noted '' an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones , " and the world had Ecstasy .
You might wonder why Shulgin was never arrested .
From the 50s through the 80s , he had the full support of the DEA -- the DEA 's chief was even married in Shulgin 's backyard -- and frequently gave pharmacology lectures to DEA agents .
He had a DEA - issued Schedule I research license .
That is , until he published PHiKAL in 1993 , which the agency -- deeply engaged in its now - controversial " war on drugs " -- did n't look kindly upon .
The agency turned his back on him , raided his lab and yanked his license .
( He 's still allowed to work in his lab creating new things -- he just can't make or possess anything that 's currently on the DEA 's list of Schedule I drugs , which is most of his life 's work . )
Shlugin views himself as a scientist in the most classical sense : his goal has been the identification and classification of a whole range of brain - altering compounds previously unknown to humankind -- much like a naturalist might name and describe new species of butterflies he discovers .
Reading through the various effects of his discoveries is a bit like reading through a catalog of the many switches in your brain that can be flipped , to various effects .
From the New York Times Magazine :
[ Shulgin discovered ] stimulants , depressants , aphrodisiacs , '' empathogens , '' convulsants , drugs that alter hearing , drugs that slow one 's sense of time , drugs that speed it up , drugs that trigger violent outbursts , drugs that deaden emotion -- in short , a veritable lexicon of tactile and emotional experience .
....
A compound he dubbed Aleph - 1 gave him '' one of the most delicious blends of inflation , paranoia and selfishness that I have ever experienced . ''
Another , Ariadne , was patented and tested under the name Dimoxamine as a drug for '' restoring motivation in senile geriatric patients . ''
Still another , DIPT , created no visual hallucinations but distorted the user 's sense of pitch .
Why did Shulgin choose such an unorthodox field of research ?
He describes a revelatory experience with mescaline in 1960 , after which he realized that everything he saw and thought '' had been brought about by a fraction of a gram of a white solid , but that in no way whatsoever could it be argued that these memories had been contained within the white solid .
. . .
I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit .
We may choose not to find access to it , we may even deny its existence , but it is indeed there inside us , and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability . ''
Here 's a video of " Dr. Ecstacy , " talking science in his backyard lab :
Note !
Mental_floss recommends flossing your brain with trivia , not illegal Schedule - I drug compounds .

HaRe -- The Haskell Refactorer
According to fable , a hare is a quick way to get from one tortoise to another , and back again -- but we probably got the moral wrong ; -) .
If you think about big , lazy , 150 year - old Galapagos tortoises , you 'll agree there 's little similarity to your latest and greatest Haskell projects , and as for our HaRe , it does n't race the full distance yet , and can't deal with all obstacles either .
In Aesop 's original version of the fable , there was only one tortoise ( and instead of indistinguishable members of the tortoise family waiting at start and goal , the hare takes a nap during the race and is overtaken by the slow but steady tortoise ) , but then you could refactor a program to some normal form should you so choose ; and just as the over - confident hare you'd be unlikely to win the race ..
Sorry , where were we ? -)
Ah , yes : refactoring Haskell programs .
Implementation of our HaRe prototype progresses nicely , and HaRe now supports about a dozen small refactorings such as renaming identifiers , moving / introducing / inlining definitions , and so on .
Those refactorings are no longer limited to a single module , but are not yet supported by type analysis .
HaRe can be accessed from either Vim or Emacs , on either Windows ( win98 / xp ) or Unix / XWindows ( Solaris ) .
As planned , we made a first version available in the week after the Haskell workshop 2003 , now followed by an updated version with multi-module support .
You can also read about the current state of things in the paper we presented at that workshop : ' Tool Support for Refactoring Functional Programs ' and in the slides of the presentation , which include a pseudo - demo ( here are some screenshots from the example refactoring we used for the demo - sum to fold ; using GVim ) .
The refactorings supported so far are documented in an initial catalogue .
update 28/06/2010 : An update of HaRe 0.6 ( also known as HaRe 28/06/2010 ) , which is compatible with GHC - 6.12.1 , is now available .
Apart form a number of bug - fixes , a number of new refactorings have been added to HaRe .
Some of these refactorings include : adding and removing fields and constructors to data - type definitions , folding and unfolding against as - patterns , merging and splitting function definitions , converting between let and where constructs , introduce pattern matching , gnerative folding , and a clone detection and elimination too .
snapshot , README .
update
08/07/2009 : An update of HaRe 0.5 which is compatible with GHC - 6.8.2 .
A number of new refactorings have also been added .
These include a number of structural and data - type based refactorings together with a duplicate code analysis and elimination tool .
HaRe 0.5 also releases a new version of the API , extended and maintained by the refactor - fp group .
HaRe 0.5 for ghc - 6.8.2 :
snapshot , README .
update 27/03/2008 : An update of HaRe 0.4 which is now compatible with GHC - 6.6.1 and GHC - 6.8.2 .
A number of new refactorings have also been added .
These include a suite of slicing utilities and some data - type and structural based refactorings .
Hare 0.4 also releases a new version of the API , extended and maintained by the refactor - fp group .
The new API now includes type based anaylses and transformations for type - aware refactorings .
HaRe 0.4 for ghc - 6.6.1 :

update 15/04/2005 : An update of HaRe 0.3 with a couple of bugs fixed . : snapshot , README .
update
11/03/2005 : An update of HaRe 0.3 with a bug fixed . : snapshot , README .
update
03/12/2004 : An update of HaRe 0.3 that includes the support for hierarchical modules and a bug fix .
Adding refactoring command to the editor interface has been simplified .
: snapshot , README .
19/11/2004 : We announced a third release of HaRe , having added a number of module refactorings and data - oriented refactorings , and derived an API ( documented using Haddock ) for program analysis and transformation ( also some bug fixes ) .
THere is also an API available for the typed decorated AST .
HaRe 0.3 is our 19/11/2004 snapshot , available here : snapshot , README .
For those who would like to build their own refactorings or program transformations using HaRe as a framework , we have written and documented two sample refactorings : swapping the first two arguments of a function , and from if - then - else to case expression , you can also find the source code for these two refactorings from the refactorer directory in the release .
The menus for these two sample refactorings are not in the Refactor menu in HaRe 0.3 , however you can add them following the how to add a refactoring to the editor interface .
update 16/09/2004 : An update of HaRe 0.2 that includes a couple bug fixes . : snapshot , README .
update 09/08/2004 :
An update of HaRe 0.2 that includes a new refactoring ' from concrete to abstract data type ' and a couple of bug fixes . : snapshot , README .
update 26/04/2004 :
An update of HaRe 0.2 that includes a batch of new refactorings and another bug fix . : snapshot , README .
update 26/02/2004 :
An update of HaRe 0.2 that includes a workaround for ghc - 6.2 , an elisp interface that should work with both Emacs and XEmacs , and another batch of bug fixes ; it also switches from replace - this occurrence to replace - all - occurrences in " Intro New Def " : snapshot , README .
29/01/2004 :
We have announced a second release of HaRe , having made the refactorings module - aware ( also initial support for literate Haskell , removal of some Emacs issues , and lots of bug fixes ) .
HaRe 0.2 is our 27/01/2004 snapshot , available here : snapshot , README .
The snapshots include most generated sources and patched third - party code to minimize external and tool dependencies ; seen to build and run on Windows ( 98 , XP ) , Solaris , with gvim 6.2 , and with emacs 21.2.1 ( we hope to have an xemacs version soon ) .
Although we do n't yet have confirmations for the current version , previous versions also worked on Linux ( Redhat , Mandrake ) , Mac OS X ( 10.2.6 ) ( please let us know about other platforms ) .
If you want to put HaRe 's refactoring engine through its paces , there is also a test - suite ( undocumented , needs HUnit ; just unpack in the release directory , cd into testing , and run ./UTest.sh ) .
Be warned that this is a snapshot of our current prototype - do not use this on your production code just yet !
The first release of HaRe ( aka HaRe 0.1 ) was in October 2003 , supporting only single - module refactorings .
Please send reports of problems , bugs , or successful installations on new platforms to refactor - fp ( at kent.ac.uk ) .
In honor of the Ben Stiller comedy , Night At the Museum : Battle For The Smithsonian , topping the $ 100 million dollar mark in just its second weekend of release , RadarOnline.com thought we ’d look at some of the 12 strangest museums in the world !
So forget about seeing great art and if you get the chance , indulge yourself with these oddities , selected for us by one of the world ’s foremost travel writers , Terese Loeb Kreuzer .
She shares some of the great bizarre museums she has visited in her travels :
1. Museum of Bad Art : This Massachusetts museum has two galleries , with paintings devoted to portraiture such as “ Peter the Kitty , ” landscape like “ Two Trees in Love ” and a recent acquisition , a dog in a hula skirt juggling bones .
2 . The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices in Minnesota has treasures likes a foot - operated breast enlarger pump and the Battle Creek Vibratory Chair created to relieve constipation .
3 . The Sulabh International Museum of Toilets in New Delhi , India is devoted entirely to — well , crap including a replica of the monogrammed potty of France ’s King Louis XIII , which he kept under his throne in case nature called while duty called .
4. The American International Rattlesnake Museum in Albuquerque , N.M. has nearly 100 snakes .
Live ones .
5 . The Wooden Nickel Historical Museum in San Antonio , Texas has the world ’s oldest wooden nickels ( from December , 1931 ) and the world ’s largest – 13 feet , 4 inches in diameter , weighing 2,500 pounds .
6 . The Tinkertown Museum on the road between Albuquerque and Santa Fe , N.M. has walls made of 50,000 glass bottles and 22 rooms of animated , wooden figures , mostly carved by the late Ross Ward , who said , “ I did all this while you were watching TV . ”
Time well spent , we say .
7. The Trash Museum in Hartford , Conn. is made from recycled trash .
Kids can play “ Where ’s the Rat ? ” as they try to find a rubber rat in the rubbish .
Take that , Chuck E. Cheese !
8. Leila ’s Hair Museum in Independence , Mo. has more than 2,000 pieces of jewelry and 159 wreaths made of human hair , including one made from the hair of two sisters whose heads were shaved when they entered a convent .
9 . The Mutter Museum at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia is drop - dead fabulous .
For real .
It contains a woman who died of yellow fever , a collection of shrunken heads , a tumor removed from the jaw of President Grover Cleveland , skeletons of giants and midgets , and more .
10 . Speaking of jaws , the National Museum of Dentistry in Baltimore has Queen Victoria ’s toothbrush , George Washington ’s ivory dentures , tusks , dental commercials starring Bill Cosby and Farrah Fawcett , and an assortment of pliers once ( painfully ) used for extracting teeth .
11 . The Corn Cob Pipe Museum in Washington , Mo. is part of the Missouri Meerschaum ( Pipe ) Company , whose customers have included President Dwight Eisenhower , Mark Twain and Popeye ( played by Robin Williams in the film ) .
12 . The last museum on our list is , unfortunately , no longer open .
The Museum of Bathroom Tissue in Madison , Wis. , contained 3,000 rolls of toilet paper from Europe , Africa , Australia , Canada and Mexico plus an encyclopedic collection of toilet paper from bars and restaurants located in Madison .
The museum closed in 2000 .
We do n’t know what happened to the collection .
We ’re not sure we want to know .

Consider how the health care debate would be perceived by the guy watching the nightly news if they heard the answers to these questions from every reporter , pundit and guest discussing health care .
Do you have any money invested in medical sector stocks ?
If yes , what percentage of your portfolio is in the health sector ?
Have you accepted campaign contributions or PAC money from medical sector employees or companies ?
If so what percentage of your contributions come from the health sector ?
Do you have health insurance ?
If so is it employer based or an individual policy ?
What percentage of your income goes to pay for your and your family 's health care ?
The answers to those questions would color the debate on health care .
Of course , with television news being what it is today , there would be no time to talk about health care after these disclosures are made , but you get my point .
In the interest of time , I 'd be satisfied if they were asked either question number 3 or 4 .
The answers to these questions would amply explain much of the health care reform rhetoric coming out of Republican mouths these days .
::::
Why can't the media report the progress on health care reform ?
I have no doubts that Andrea Mitchell ( eligible for Medicare in 3 years ) already knows the biases her guests have concerning health care , but why not make sure her viewers know them ?
I already said my piece about Nancy Snyderman , but left out this nugget these nuggets .
I guess she 's more about health care corporate profits and less about health care .
Continuing on with a theme here , can you imagine Lou Dobbs admitting in September 2010 that he qualifies for Medicare and takes CNN as his primary insurance and has Medicare as his Secondary Payer ?
What would happen if Charles Gibson ( BTW , he qualifies for Medicare ) admitted that he pays less than 1 % of his income on health care ?
We already know his main complaint is inconvenient waits for appointments .
How would it change the complexion of the arguments if Maria Bartiromo , Katie Couric or Wolf Blitzer and John King admitted their biases ?
What would happen if these same people admitted they are uninformed about healthcare issues ?
Are there any media personalities other than Ed Schultz , Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann that are educated about health care reform ?
Lord knows Rush Limbaugh is an idiot on the subject .
And could someone explain Dana Bash 's incompetence on health care to me ?
If we required Congressional members to recuse themselves from votes on companies they are invested in , 25 % of our Congressional members would likely not be able to vote on health care .
While I can see the impracticality of a proposal like that , the deceit , lies , medically related bankruptcys and stress are too much .
The uninsured , underinsured and those who live in poverty have death rates that are too high .
These conflicts of interest of media personalities , pundits and politicians need greater exposure and the exposure needs to be repeated regularly .
::::
What does $ 1.4 million a day in lobbying money buy ?
( Please feel free to add your own names and links to my small list here . )
Max Baucus limits access to people willing to pay $ 10,000 to spend some quality time with him .
This is old news and not particularly novel , yet , at the same time it explains why he has a deaf ear to proponents of The Public Option .
Chris Dodd can be offended all he likes , but it is important to realize why he is n't pushing The Public Option as well as he could .
Evan Bayh seems to have the same trouble .
Eric Cantor has a relationship with Eli Lily and insurers .
Who is Chuck Grassley listening to ?
It sure is n't the 56 % of Iowans who want a Public Option .
He 's invested in health care stocks through his Mutual Fund Investments , which may be enough of a step away for some people but he does take quite a bit from insurance companies and the rest of the health care sector .
Apparently , the corporate interests supersede his constituents ' interest .
I wonder if anyone has bothered to send the good people of Iowa a memo on their Senator ?
Grassley 's health care position seems to be framed around political opposition more than around solving problems for his constituents .
" As many as 119 million Americans would shift from private coverage to the government plan , " Grassley wrote in a column for Politico.com .
That migration , Grassley said , would " put America on the path toward a completely government - run health care system .
...
Eventually , the government plan would overtake the entire market . "
Grassley 's logic is that so many Americans would prefer a government - run plan that the private health insurance industry would collapse or become a shadow of its current self .
That , in turn , would lead even more Americans entering the government plan , making private insurance even less viable .
Rarely has an argument more dramatically highlighted the philosophical question of whether in a democracy , the government should represent the people 's interests or an industry's .
::::
So the democratic debate is between money vs. voters .
The majority of Americans overwhelmingly support and want ( 2 to 1 ) health care reform and we want it now .
Health insurers , pharma and many physiciansdon't want meaningful reform because they know they will make less money and will curtail their way of doing business .
Small business owners see that Congress supports a mandate , but not a Public Option and are afraid of losing their businesses .
::::
Dear Senators and Representatives
By choosing to represent corporate interests over that of the individual in need of health care , you make clear who your masters are .
What you forget is that corporations may fund you , but they can't vote .
Health care is very personal .
It may be a game to you , but someone who can't afford to see a doctor or get a drug their child needs because you decided to side with corporate health insurance ( AHIP ) , pharma and the AMA sees you for what you are .
The Public Option is the compromise we are willing to live with .
A co-op keeps private insurers still able to do recission , cherry picking and double premiums every 8 years .
It 's up to you to represent the voters in your district .
Take the pledge to vote against any health care reform proposal that does n't feature a robust Public Option that takes effect the first day of health reform .
Please makes some calls

Scientists studied the impact of cannabis on the bones
Researchers looking at the effects of cannabis on bones have found its impact varies dramatically with age .
The study found that while the drug may reduce bone strength in the young , it could protect against osteoporosis , a weakening of the bones , in later life .
The results were uncovered by a team at the University of Edinburgh who compared the drug 's effects on mice .
Osteoporosis affects up to 30 % of women and about 12 % of men at some point in their lives .
The group found that cannabis can activate a molecule found naturally in the body that is key to the development of osteoporosis .
When the type 1 cannabinoid receptor ( CB1 ) comes into contact with cannabis , it has an impact on bone regeneration .
However , until now , it was not clear whether the drug had a positive or negative effect .
' Early results '
Researchers , funded by the Arthritis Research Campaign , investigated this using mice which lacked the CB1 receptor .
The scientists then used compounds - similar to those in cannabis - that activated the CB1 receptor .
They found that compounds increased the rate at which bone tissue was destroyed in the young .
Despite this , the study also showed that the same compounds decreased bone loss in older mice and prevented the accumulation of fat in the bones , which is known to occur in humans with osteoporosis .
Stuart Ralston , the Arthritis Research Campaign Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Edinburgh , who led the study , said : " This is an exciting step forward , but we must recognise that these are early results and more tests are needed on the effects of cannabis in humans to determine how the effects differ with age in people .
" We plan to conduct further trials soon and hope the results will help to deliver new treatments that will be of value in the fight against osteoporosis . "
The results are published in Cell Metabolism .

South American leaders are due to square off tomorrow over a plan to increase US access to military bases in Colombia , a deal that has damaged Barack Obama 's attempt to mend relations with the region .
A diplomatic firestorm has been ignited , with a summit in Argentina pitting Colombia – which has sought closer co-operation with Washington – against its neighbours who fear the US presence will threaten leftist governments .
Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez , has led the denunciations , claiming US imperialist aggression was blowing " winds of war " .
He has vowed to buy extra Russian tanks to defend his socialist revolution and told his cabinet to prepare for ruptured relations with Bogotá .
Colombia responded with a formal complaint to the Organisation of American States , a pan-regional body , accusing Chávez of " expansionism " and meddling in its internal affairs .
The row has left Bogotá isolated , however .
Bolivia and Ecuador 's socialist leaders have condemned the bases plan and even the more centrist governments of Argentina , Brazil and Chile have expressed unease .
Washington and Bogotá have scrambled to defend the pact , which is close to being finalised , as a mere administrative tweaking of their decade - long military co-operation to combat drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas .
The proposed 10 - year lease will give the US access to at least seven Colombian bases – three air force , two naval and two army – stretching from the Pacific to the Caribbean .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said there was no intention to expand the number of permanent personnel beyond the maximum permitted by Congress : 800 military and 600 civilian contractors .
" Any US activity will have to be mutually agreed upon in advance .
The United States does not have , and does not seek , bases inside Colombia .
Second , there will be no significant permanent increase in the US military presence in Colombia . "
America turned to Colombia after Ecuador refused to renew an agreement giving access to its Manta airbase .
Officials said the pact with Colombia stemmed from a proposed $ 46 m ( £ 28 m ) upgrade of Palanquero base north of Bogota .
Washington did not want to spend that kind of money without a formal deal .
But a region scarred by memories of CIA - backed dictatorships in the 70s and 80s has balked at the prospect of " gringo " boots and aircraft stationed on their continent , notwithstanding goodwill for the new occupant of the White House .
" Washington should not have been surprised by the controversy it generated , " said Michael Shifter , of the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank .
" Obama may be appealing and popular , but there is still a lot of historical baggage and real suspicions about US motives in the region .
" The costs could have been easily avoided with more skillful and sustained diplomatic work by senior US officials . "
Privately , US officials concede Chávez has outmanoeuvred them with hype calculated to tap continental grievances .
Although he has not mobilised troops and his talk of war is widely seen as bombast , some analysts say Colombia 's neighbours have legitimate cause for concern .
Washington has not fully explained its mandate nor the scope and nature of its operations , wrote Adam Isacson , of the Centre for International Policy , which monitors US initiatives in Colombia .
" The United States is creating a new capability in South America , and capabilities often get used . "
Colombia 's US - supported military has won plaudits at home for pushing back Farc guerrillas but has also provoked dismay over its human rights abuses and a cross - border raid into Ecuador last year .
Colombia 's conservative president , Alvaro Uribe , spent last week touring the region trying to soothe neighbours in advance of tomorrow 's Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) summit .
Brazil and Chile , which have stable relations with Washington , were partly mollified , but Brazil 's foreign minister , Celso Amorim , yesterday reiterated his government 's concern .
" The presence of foreign bases in South America awakens sensibilities of a political and even psychological nature that should be taken into account . "
Bolivia 's president , Evo Morales , called for a continent - wide referendum on the plan .
" If the Colombian president wants his bases to be used , I say I want a referendum in South America so the people of Bolivia , Colombia , Peru , Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina all 12 countries can decide , " he said .
The feuding will test Brazil 's hopes of moulding Unasur , which was founded last year , into a vehicle for regional integration along the lines of the EU .
RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil ( CNN ) -- Automated messages sent from Air France Flight 447 just before it crashed Monday indicate the plane 's systems were providing contradictory information about its airspeed , the jet 's manufacturer said on Friday .
Friends and relatives of the 228 people aboard Air France Flight 447 attend a memorial service Thursday in Brazil .
That suggests the pilots may have been flying too fast or too slow through the violent weather they encountered before the crash , officials said .
In addition , investigators have said the plane 's autopilot disengaged , cabin pressure was lost and there was an electrical failure before the disaster .
Airbus confirmed on Friday that in the wake of the crash it sent a Telex to operators of all Airbus models reminding them what to do when speed indicators give conflicting readings .
The spokesman said the notice does not mean there is any major flaw in the aircraft , but is simply a reminder to pilots about what to do in the cockpit if they get conflicting information about air speed .
Message transmissions from the aircraft in the final moments before it crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean show there was an " indicated inconsistency in measured air speeds , " Airbus said .
The company did not elaborate .
Experts said that could mean the pilot 's and co-pilots ' sensors were showing different speeds .
" If they 're malfunctioning , it can give a false read that can be misinterpreted in the cockpit , and a disaster can follow , " said Peter Goeltz , the former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board .
While the pilots themselves sent no distress calls , the aircraft 's computer system relayed about four minutes of automated messages indicating a loss of cabin pressure and an electrical failure , according to investigators .
Airbus said it sent the Telex Thursday night after the action was recommended by the French investigating agency , which plans to hold a news conference Saturday morning in Paris , France .
Watch as experts question whether recovery is possible »
Meanwhile , the hunt for debris continued Friday , a day after a Brazilian air force official said debris plucked from the ocean was not from the Air France jet .
A U.S Navy P - 3 temporarily based in Brazil has flown three missions -- on Wednesday , Thursday and Friday -- in assisting the Brazilian government search for debris , but found nothing connected to the disaster , U.S. Southern Command spokesman Maj.
Darryl Wright said .
Earlier Friday , Goeltz said the search for Flight 447's voice and data recorders is becoming more difficult as ocean currents disperse debris from the crash site .
" The clock 's ticking " in the search for the plane 's recorders , he said .
" The batteries on these locator devices attached to the black boxes have a limited life span -- just 30 days , " he said .
" The longer time goes on , the further away from the actual crash site the debris floats . "
All 228 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus 330 are presumed to have died when the plane disappeared northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands , an archipelago 355 kilometers ( 220 miles ) off the northeast coast of Brazil .
The flight originated in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , and was en route to Paris .
Map of Flight 447's flight path »
While the ocean depth in the area where the plane is thought to have crashed presents a challenge , the challenge may not be insurmountable , Goeltz said .
" We 've recovered boxes as deep as 6 - or 7,000 feet , " he said .
" We 've recovered debris from as much as 10,000 feet . "
Authorities have said the depth of the water in the area ranges from 3,000 meters ( 9,840 feet ) to 7,500 meters ( 24,600 feet ) .
Cmdr . Christophe Prazuck of the French Ministry of Defense said Friday that a French research vessel was expected to arrive this weekend in the search area carrying a deep - diving submersible .
The submersible would try to pinpoint the recorders , but must rely on another vessel to retrieve them , he said .
The submarine helped recover artifacts from the Titanic disaster .
Meanwhile , France 's transportation minister warned that " extreme prudence " should be used in releasing information about why the plane crashed .
It is possible the plane experienced a total electrical failure , officials have said .
Goeltz said it is possible the jet 's speed indicator was faulty .
" That could really be disastrous and it's happened before , " he said , speaking generally .
If it malfunctions , " it can give a false read into the cockpit that can be misinterpreted , " he said .
Investigators also said the autopilot system may have failed .
A Spanish pilot reported seeing an " intense flash " near where the plane is believed to have crashed , the Spanish carrier Air Comet said on Thursday .
The co-pilot and a passenger on the flight from Lima , Peru , to Lisbon , Portugal , also said they saw a light .
Air Comet said the pilot 's report has been sent to Air France , Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority .

Calm on the Lebanese Palestinian border does not necessarily involve good news for Israel , a report published by the Israeli daily Maariv said on Friday .
The report addresses the growing capacity of Hezbollah in Lebanon , three years after the 2006 war .
The journal emphasized that Hezbollah is tremendously magnifying its military capability and compiling new combative techniques in addition to a remarkable increase in the number of its fighters and trainers .
The Maariv report pointed that Hezbollah is seeking to reach a level of capability that would enable it to launch a thousand rockets on “ Israel ” during a 60 - day period of time .
Citing Israeli intelligence assessments , the Israeli daily also estimated that the party was close to reaching this level of capacity as it can today send between 500 and 600 rockets a day to Tel Aviv and surrounding areas .
The report added that unlike the rockets fired during the 2006 war , Hezbollah ’s present rockets are mostly long - range and mid-range missiles and in case a new war breaks out , the daily said , the center of “ Israel ” will be targeted with salvos of such rockets .
Maariv ’s report also said that Hezbollah has spread its rockets in a more complicated manner for Israel to figure out , as most of them are heavier caliber rockets , more precise and longer in range .
The number of trained fighters , the report says , has increased from 5000 to 8000 well trained fighters and that Hezbollah is building fortified garrisons and underground systems to serve an organized deployment of fighters and field commanders between north and south Litani River areas .
Maarvi described Hezbollah ’s formations as a compact defense system that enjoys the ability of ‘ reciprocal coverage ’ , artillery , anti-armor and intelligence capabilities in addition to the ability to deploy special unit forces .
In case a confrontation takes place , the report said , a self - martyrdom unit would be called in to break through the border line and conduct operation against Israeli forces inside occupied territories , including martyrdom operations .
Maariv concluded that Hezbollah assumes that in case of confrontation , the Israeli army will go for a large - scale ground assault .
This is why , it said , Hezbollah is preparing itself for such a scenario with a defensive battle relying on the aforementioned formations and the party ’s goal will be to continue firing rockets deep inside occupied territories for at least two months in a fatal pace , Maariv estimated .

Updated ( November 9 , 2009 ) : Welcome to all the visitors from the home of the “ Patriotic Resistance ” who seem to have just discovered this .
Feel free to leave “ patriotic ” comments about how much America sucks under Obama .
I welcome your hatred .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Chuck Norris has now joined the right - wing campaign to spread lies about health care reform !
Okay , maybe that ’s not all that surprising .
He endorsed Huckabee in the 2008 campaign in the Republican primary ’s best ad .
And he ’s clearly a conservative .
And the guy ’s got a regular column at the generally fair - and - balanced * TownHall.com .
And Norris ’s previous two months of columns involved scaremongering about the government forcing people to get permits to study the Bible , demanding Obama produce his birth certificate , claiming Carter deja vu – you get the idea .
But still , why now , Chuck ?
We know you ’re rich and impervious to pain – but other people need health insurance .
And why lie to your fans ?
Why Chuck ?
Anyway , this is what the guy has to say in his missive describing “ Dirty secret No. 1 in Obamacare “ :
Dirty secret No. 1 in Obamacare is about the government ’s coming into homes and usurping parental rights over child care and development .
That sounds serious .
He cites a particular page of “ the House bill ” ( page 838 for those reading along at home [ pdf . ] )
If you read that section , you find something that sounds somewhat less sinister : A program that would offer grants to states that have – or wish to start – programs providing “ voluntary home visitation for families with young children and families expecting children . ”
The program is explicitly “ voluntary ” – as in these trainees would only come if asked ; and it would not be run by the federal government , but by the states if they wanted to have such a program .
A few pages later , the bill states the program is meant to help communities with high reported incidences of “ child maltreatment ” and “ low - income communities . ”
Specifically these programs are designed to prevent child abuse ( as this Wisconsin program is [ pdf . ] )
Chuck Norris will have none of it .
He speculates that any attempt to prevent child abuse amounts to enforcing a :
… secular - progressive and religiously neutered version of parental values and wisdom …
Responding to the point that any programs granted funding by this would need to be explicitly voluntary , Norris responds :
One government rebuttal is that this program would be “ voluntary . ”
Is that right ?
Does that imply that this agency would just sit back passively until some parent needing parenting skills said , “ I do n’t think I ’ll call my parents , priest or friends or read a plethora of books , but I ’ll go down to the local government offices ” ?
Snap !
Chuck ’s on a roll .
He then points out that this program would focus on grants for communities that have low incomes – which to him means the program is saying that the poor are worse parents .
( Of course , you could also say that the poor are more likely to need subsidized help such as this – but why try to think of a rational explanation when you could think of the most offensive one instead . )
Chuck ’s anger reaches a crescendo as he asks :
How contrary is Obamacare ’s home intrusion and indoctrination family services , in which state agents prioritize houses to enter and enforce their universal values and principles upon the hearts and minds of families across America ?
… Government ’s real motives and rationale are quite simple , though rarely , if ever , stated .
If one wants to control the future ebbs and flows of a country , one must have command over future generations …
It is so simple that any socialist can understand it .
As Josef Stalin once stated , “ Education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed . ”
I mean , whoa .
Health care reform is secretly really about “ Government ” forcing its way into your homes and indoctrinating your children to become socialists !
Death panels , government - mandated abortion , government - sponsored euthanasia , a holocaust of the elderly and disabled – and now “ home intrustions ” and the secret socialist “ indoctrination ” of children .
The question is – what ’s next for Obamacare ?
Will it take away your guns ?
Will it force you to be gay ?
It ’s getting harder and harder to distinguish parodies of what opponents of health care are saying and what they are saying …

US officials today say that in spite of previous claims from a retired Philippine Navy lieutenant , the hundreds of US troops on the ground in the Southern Philippines are not actually involved in combat operations , but are merely there for temporary training of the Philippine soldiers .
Lt. Nancy Gadian told a congressional hearing yesterday that the US troops had been embedded into units being used in combat situation , which might violate the Philippine Constitution ’s prohibition against foreign troops fighting in the nation .
The US has a long history of interference in the Philippines , including a massive anti-insurgency effort after the US occupied the nation in the wake of the Spanish - American War .
That war began when the US ruled that the nation was not “ ready ” for independence and led to a massive and bloody decade - long war which saw massive civilian casualties .
A major US military presence was continued for nearly a century , but eventually came to an end .
Since 2002 , however , the US has been deploying troops to the Philippines in an “ advisory ” role as part of Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines .
There are n’t just fewer jobs in the U.S. recession .
There are fewer babies , too .
U.S. births fell in 2008 , the first full year of the recession , marking the first annual decline in births since the start of the decade and ending an American baby boomlet .
The downturn in the U.S. economy best explains the drop in maternity , some experts believe .
The Great Depression and subsequent recessions all were accompanied by a decline in births , said Carol Hogue , an Emory University professor of maternal and child health and epidemiology .
And the numbers have never rebounded until the economy pulled out of it , she said , calling the 2008 recession the most likely culprit for fewer babies .
It ’s not clear that it ’s the only explanation , however .
Another expert noted a recent decline in immigration to the U.S. may also be a factor .
America recorded about 4,247,000 births last year , down about 68,000 from 2007 , according to a new report from the National Center for Health Statistics .
This recession began in December 2007 , and since then the economy has lost almost 7 million jobs .
Housing foreclosures worsened in 2007 too , and fell into a state of crisis in 2008 .
The largest decline in births were in California and Florida , two states hit hardest by the housing crisis .
” I was n’t surprised , ” Hogue said , of the new numbers , which are not final and will be updated .
But the downturn ’s effect on the public psychology — and families ’ willingness to have babies — may not have really hit until the fall of 2008 , said Stephanie Ventura of the health statistics center , the agency that put out the report .
Of course , 2007 was a year in which more babies were born in the United States than any other year in the nation ’s history .
In the past , a fluctuation of births by 1 or 2 % would not be seen as very significant , especially from such an unusual year .
But the drop seems to break an unusual trend .
Births had been rising since 2002 , and birth rates had been increasing in women of different age groups , said Ventura , chief of the agency ’s reproductive statistics branch .
The new report is an early count of births from each state , and does not contain demographic breakdowns that might more completely explain whether birth declines occurred in some groups , but not others .
While the recession probably played an important role in fewer babies , another factor may be the net decline in recent years in immigration to the United States , said Mark Mather , demographer with the Population Reference Bureau .
” If there are fewer immigrants coming to the U.S. , there are fewer moms and dads , ” said Mather , noting that California and Florida are states with large immigrant populations .
” I do n’t think we have enough data to know for sure what ’s going on , ” he added .
About half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned .
But Hogue , the Emory professor , said the recession likely affected the other half .
The recession also may have cut into the number of unplanned pregnancies that progressed to live births , but it ’s hard to say .
Abortion statistics for 2008 are not yet available , Hogue said .

Pedophilia can sometimes be a taboo topic .
But it 's often in the headlines .
What is pedophilia ?
Who are pedophiles ?
How is it treated by the medical community ?
Here are answers from sexologist Ray Blanchard , PhD , adjunct psychiatry professor at the University of Toronto .
What is a pedophile ?
A pedophile is a person who has a sustained sexual orientation toward children , generally aged 13 or younger , Blanchard says .
Not all pedophiles are child molesters ( or vice versa ) .
" Child molesters are defined by their acts ; pedophiles are defined by their desires , " Blanchard says .
" Some pedophiles refrain from sexually approaching any child for their entire lives . "
But it 's not clear how common that is .
Does the medical community consider pedophilia to be a mental disorder ?
Yes .
The American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) has included pedophilia in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders since 1968 .
In the DSM , which is updated periodically , pedophilia has been grouped with other paraphilias -- which the APA defines as " recurrent , intense sexually arousing fantasies , sexual urges , or behaviors that involve children , nonhuman subjects , or other non-consenting adults , or the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one 's partner . "
But the next edition of the DSM -- the DSM 5 -- may instead refer to " pedophilic disorder . " " [ Pedophiles ] would be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder either if their attractions toward children are causing them guilt , anxiety , alienation , or difficulty in pursuing other personal goals , or else if their urges cause them to approach children for sexual gratification in real life , " Blanchard says .
Can pedophilia be treated ?
Yes .
Although most experts do not think a person 's feelings of pedophilia are curable , therapy may help them manage those feelings and not act on them .
Some patients at high risk of committing sexual offenses may need medications to reduce their sex drive , Blanchard says .
Warner Home Video is releasing new DVDs in cases that contain 20 % less plastic .
As a result of the effort , the company will reduce carbon emissions from its home entertainment division by 31 % –and slash materials and shipping costs in a division with flagging sales .
Warner says that the initiative is driven primarily by environmental concerns , but it certainly helps that the flimsier DVD cases save cash , especially since DVD sales are down 20 to 30 % in some categories .
Other movie studios are also working on lightening DVD cases ’ loads .
Sony Pictures Entertainment reduced the size of its DVD by cases 20 % last month .
Both Sony and 20th Century
Fox are leading the charge on Blu - Ray discs , which come in smaller cases that reduce environmental impact by up to 30 % .
Mainstream DVD distributors still have a long way to go in their quests to cut carbon emissions .
Green living company Gaiam now manufactures its DVDs in plastic - free packaging made with 100 % post - consumer recycled paper and 100 % recyclable materials .

AS Federal Reserve chairman , Ben Bernanke has committed serious sins of commission and omission  and for those many sins , he does not deserve reappointment .
Let me begin with the former .
It is standard practice for a central bank like the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy to combat a recession , and then to tighten it as recovery gets under way .
Mr. Bernanke so far has only had to do the first half , and has conducted a policy of extreme ease .
The Fed ’s Open Market Committee cut the federal funds rate in October to 1 percent from 1.5 percent , and then in December to a range of zero percent to 0.25 percent .
What drove down the funds rate was the Federal Reserve ’s decision to increase its depository bank reserves .
Bank reserves have been rising since Sept. 17 , as the Fed purchased securities and financed loans .
When the Fed committee cut the rate to zero , it was merely ratifying the de facto rate .
Mr. Bernanke seems to know only two amounts : zero and trillions .
Before 2008 there were only moderate increases in the Federal Reserve ’s aggregate balance sheet numbers , but since then the balance sheet has exploded by trillions of dollars .
The increase was spurred by the Fed ’s loans to troubled institutions and purchases of securities .

Natural language processing ( NLP ) researchers and students who want a learn a solid programming tool to help them with their work .
Python programmers who want to find out more about NLP .
Newbies in both Python and NLP who just think the topic sounds cool and those whales on the cover are kinda cute .
There are three kinds of people who might think this book could be useful :
In my opinion , the only kind that will find this book suitable and useful is ( 1 ) .
If you 're familiar with Python and know no NLP it wo n't help you much , because it does n't really teach NLP .
It shows a few domains of this vast field , with nice code examples and all , but you should probably start with some introductory textbook on the subject or a course .
You wo n't really learn NLP here .
The book 's focus is mostly on the NLTK library written in Python by the authors .
This library implements many NLP algorithms and comes with lots of data for testing and training .
Almost no algorithms are implemented in the book - some are explained , and the code always imports the required modules from NLTK and shows their usage .
The Python code is well - written and clean .
To conclude , if you 're a NLP researcher or student , this is a very good book to read .
Especially if you plan to start working with NLTK ( which seems like a mature and powerful tool ) - this book will serve as a great introduction .
If you have other interests , this is probably not the right book .
Ruby has long been criticized in its 1.8 version for its limited Green Thread model .
Luc Castera gave a presentation at RubyNation about Concurrent Programming with Ruby and Tuple Spaces .
After introducing the different threading model in computer world with their various applications : Ruby 1.8 , Ruby 1.9 , JRuby , Erlang , Luc introduces Ruby Multiple Processes ( Image and quote from the presentation ) :
Pros :
No longer sharing memory Take advantage of multiple CPUs ( Performance )
Not all threads are blocked by blocking system calls Scalability Fault Tolerance
Cons : Process creation , execution and cleanup is expensive Uses a lot of memory ( loading Ruby VM for every process )
Need a way for processes to communicate !
There are many options to realize process communication : Database ( as it is the case in cluster of application servers ( Mongrel , Thin ... ) ) , Queues like RabbitMQ ( Nanite 's solution ) , DRB , ActiveMQ , ... and TupleSpaces .
Luc compares two TupleSpaces implementations : Rinda and his own Blackboard .
A tuple space provides a repository of tuples that can be accessed concurrently .
The tuples basically provide 3 access primitives : write ( writes a tuple to the tuple space ) , read ( reads a tuple from the tuple space ) , take ( reads and removes a tuple from the tuple space ) .
Linda is a coordination model which was defined by David Gelernter and Nicholas Carriero to support the concept of global object coordination .
Rinda is the Ruby implementation of Linda , it is a built - in library .
A Rinda Tuple might look like this : t1 = [ : add , 5 , 9 ] , which could be interpreted by clients as a task to add up the given numbers .
The main drawback of Rinda is that it's not persistent , you lose all tuples in the space when it is stopped or when it crashes .
That 's what Luc tried to address by developing Blackboard .
It is a TupleSpace implementation on top of the key - value database Redis , which makes it possible to have persistence .
[ Redis ] is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile , and values can be strings , exactly like in memcached , but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push / pop elements
Here is a sample use of the API :
ts = Blackboard : : TupleSpace.new ts.write [ : calculator , : add , 1 , 2 ] ts. take [ : calculator , : add , nil , nil ]
A benchmark shows the difference between Rinda and Blackboard ( from the presentation ) :
Rinda Blackboard Write ( 1000 ) 0.042749 0.253068
Take ( 500 ) 0.082744 15.844250 Read ( 500 ) 0.020098 20.098478
The current implementation is the first iteration and Luc has plans to move from Redis to a custom based Erlang Blackboard implementation which should be easily called from thirdparty languages like Ruby .

David Cameron was branded a sham yesterday for going to visit a green energy project - in a gas - guzzling helicopter .
The Tory leader travelled from London to Norwich and toured a lab which turned waste into biofuels .
A Green Party spokesman said : " Mr Cameron claims to be committed to working to reduce climate change but the least environmentally friendly travel is helicopter .
" And he was going to a university to discuss the development of environmentally friendly fuels . "
Two years ago the Mirror revealed that as Mr Cameron cycled to work his chauffeur was taking his gear by car .
Mr Cameron , in the city six days before the Norwich North by - election , also upset university staff by refusing to be pictured in a lab coat .
His spokesman did not comment on the white coat but said : " We use different kinds of transport .
The journeys are carbon offset . "

There is no more important issue facing the West than Islamism , Islamofascism or — to use yet another label — radical Islam .
And there is no more necessary precondition to countering that threat than understanding it : where it springs from , how it is expressed and the ways in which it is spreading .
But before we do any of that , we have to agree that the threat exists .
For the United States , the danger so far has taken the form of terror , as 9/11 so clearly demonstrated .
In Europe , terror is real too , but a more insidious problem has now taken hold : many liberals and others on the European left are making common cause with radical Islam and then brazenly and bizarrely denying both the existence of that alliance and in fact the existence of any Islamist threat whatever .
Bruce Bawer ’s “ Surrender : Appeasing Islam , Sacrificing Freedom ” is focused on this phenomenon .
Bawer , an American writer who lives in Norway — the archetype , even the caricature , of the liberal European mind - set — seeks to show , among other things , that the United States is becoming as culpable as Europe , its liberal news media and college campuses willfully refusing to acknowledge the danger posed by radical Islam and opening their pages and seminars to those who seek the undoing of the very tenets that allow liberals — and everyone else — their freedoms .
Bawer devotes much of his book to an attack on The New York Times for refusing to highlight the Islamist threat while swallowing the claims of figures like Tariq Ramadan , a supposed moderate who , Bawer writes , is “ a habitual practitioner of the Islamic art of taqiyya — which essentially means saying one thing in Arabic and another thing in English or French . ”
But it ’s when he turns to Europe that Bawer is able to provide example upon example of how the West is becoming its own worst enemy .
He cites , for instance , the welcome offered by the former mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , to the Muslim cleric Sheik Yusuf al - Qaradawi , who supports suicide bombing and the execution of homosexuals .
Livingstone proudly hugged Qaradawi in public at City Hall .

The call for flagged revisions came from Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
The online encyclopaedia Wikipedia is on the cusp of launching a major revamp to how people contribute to some pages .
The site will require that revisions to pages about living people and some organisations be approved by an editor .
This would be a radical shift for the site , which ostensibly allows anyone to make changes to almost any entry .
The two - month trial , which has proved controversial with some contributors , will start in the next " couple of weeks " , according to a spokesperson .
" I 'm sure it will spark some controversy , " Mike Peel of Wikimedia UK , a chapter of the organisation that operates Wikipedia , told BBC News .
However , he said , the trial had been approved in an an online poll , with 80 % of 259 users in favour of the trial .
" The decision to run this trial was made by the users of the English Wikipedia , rather than being imposed . "
The proposal was first outlined by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales in January this year .
It was met by a storm of protests from Wikipedia users who claimed the system had been poorly thought out or would create extra work .
' Lock down '
The two - month trial will test a system of " flagged revisions " on the English - language Wikipedia site .
This would mean any changes made by a new or unknown user would have to be approved by one of the site 's editors before the changes were published .
Whilst the changes are being mulled over , readers will be directed to earlier versions of the article .
Wikimedia said the system was " essentially a buffer , to reduce the visibility and impact of vandalism on these articles " .
There have been several high - profile edits to pages that have given false or misleading information about a person .
For example , in January this year the page of US Senator Robert Byrd falsely reported that he had died .
If a page has a number of controversial edits or is repeatedly vandalised , editors can lock a page , so that it can not be edited by everyone .
For example , following initial reports of the death of Michael Jackson , editors had to lock down two pages to stop speculation about what had caused his death .
" For these articles , flagged protection will actually make them more open , " said Mr Peel .
The decision had been made to focus on the pages of living people , he said , because they were the " most high - profile pages with the highest probability of causing harm " .
" [ The trial ] may also be extended to organisations which are currently operating , " he added .
The system has already been in operation on the German version of Wikipedia for more than a year .
The changes to the English language site - which now has more than 3 m pages - will be rolled out in the coming weeks , said Mr Peel .
The changes will be discussed in Buenos Aires this week at the annual Wikimania conference .


Superficially seductive calls to scale down the effort until the recession ends or to take time for further deliberations should be ignored .
There has been more than enough debate and the recession will almost certainly be over before the major features of reform kick in several years from now .
Those who fear that a trillion - dollar reform will add to the nation ’s deficit burden should remember that these changes are intended to be deficit - neutral over the next decade .
Delay would be foolish politically .
The Democrats have substantial majorities in the House and the Senate this year .
Next year , as the midterm elections approach , it will be even harder for legislators to take controversial stands .
After the elections , if history is any guide , the Democratic majorities could be smaller .
Mr. Obama should know from sad experience the pitfalls of seeking bipartisan cooperation from a Republican Party that has sloughed off most of its moderates and is dominated by its right wing .
His stimulus package was supported by no Republicans in the House and only three Republicans in the Senate , so - called moderates whose support was won by shrinking the package below the size at which it would have done the most good .
Now the same sort of damaging retreat may be happening in the Senate Finance Committee .
Three committees in the House and one in the Senate have used their Democratic majorities to approve liberal health reform bills .
The only bipartisan negotiations are between a rump group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee who hail from largely rural states with small populations , namely Iowa , Maine , Montana , New Mexico , North Dakota and Wyoming .
Somehow this small , unrepresentative group has emerged as the focal point for bipartisan health care reform .
The six have been working hard to reach agreement , but the concessions demanded by Republicans will most likely make the reform effort weaker and smaller .
They could , for example , reduce the scale of the program and the subsidies for low - income people ; drop the idea of a government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers ; and eliminate a requirement that employers offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty .
Alert to all bloggers !
We have a serious problem :
In an attempt to reduce the numbers of outbound pings a new undocumented ” feature ” was introduced in WordPress 2.8 ( this change is not mentioned in the WP 2.8 release notes ) .
Instead of notifing ping services every time a post is published or edited , pings are now sent once every hour , at the most .
Every time a new post is published , WordPress checks if there is a ping batch queued to be sent within the next hour .
If so , the ping is added to that batch .
If there is nothing in the queue , a ping is sheduled to be sent after 3600 seconds ( one hour ) .
From the Cron View - plugin panel : Ping is not sent instantly .
Instead it is added to the list of scheduled jobs .
This has a huge inpact on the speed of post announcements to services such as Google Reader and is effectively sabotaging the steps towards real time search and initatives such as FeedBurner ’s support for PubSubHubBub .
The solution :
If you want your posts to be announced as soon as possible and do n’t want manually ping services such as Technorati , Twingly or FeedBurner you should install the WordPress plugin MaxBlogPress Ping Optimizer .
It will override the new default behavour .
Not only does it instantly send a ping when a new post is published , it also corrects the initial problem that the new feature in WordPress tries to solve , by not pinging when you publish future posts or edit previously published posts , as WordPress used to do by default .
I learned this while digging in the WordPress code after debugging my FeedBurner connection to FriendFeed .
Big thanks to Brett Slatkin / Google for the initial assistance and Nikke Lindqvist for proof - reading .
Update : Kristoffer Forsgren / Twingly notes that to be able to activate the plugin MaxBlogPress Ping Optimizer you need to sign up on the developers mailing list .
To me , that is not a big problem ( I publish my email adress publicly on this page anyway ) , but if you are paranoid : be warned .
Since the plugin is licensed under GPL , it is possible for whoever got the time to deal with it to ” clean ” the plugin ( drop me a mail if you do and I will link to your version here ) .
Update 2 : If you think that the new setup is flawed , please make yourself heard and leave a comment at the WordPress development ticket system ( thanks Pelle Wessman ! ) .
Update 3 : Denis de Bernardy , the developer who submitted the patch that changed the behaviour of WordPress ’ pinging , has left a comment in which he dismiss my critique as ranting .
Denis says that this change are off less importance , and that it easily can be overridden by third party plugins .
Commenters at Digg and Reddit are saying things like : ” If once per hour is n’t real - time enough for you , maybe you should be using Twitter ! ” and ” If you think the world cannot possibly wait an hour for your next post … you are probably wrong ” .
Clearly these people do n’t value the new web and it ’s rapidness as I do .
I even doubt that we see the same web .
When I look at the blogosphere I see a revolutionary democratization of the media landscape .
In the last decade people all over the world have become their own publishers and have connected themself with other blogs and portals .
In recent years , newspapers has showed inbound links with offsite comments using services like Twingly .
During the last year big players like Google and FriendFeed has worked together and established near real time announcements with PubSubHubBub .
All this communcation between different platforms could not be possible without rapid pingbacks .
Pings simply need to be sent out from blogs as soon as possible .
If the change in WordPress itself is one problem , the lack of information of it is another .
People can not , like Denis suggest , change the behavior of WordPress with a plugin if they do n’t know that they need to .
Since this change was not clearly communicated from the head developers I can only assume that the patch was accepted by a misstake in a stressed situation before the release of WordPress 2.8 .
I would love get some official comments from Automattic ( or some of the ” victims ” like FeedBurner or Twingly ) , but I guess I have to wait until monday for that .
Anyway , Pelle Wessman has submitted a counter - patch that change this behavior , it will be exciting to see how it is recived by the WordPress community .
Update 4 : WordPress core developer Ryan has reverted the code back to the default ” ping often ” behaviour .
It look like everything will be as usual in the 2.8.3 release .
More on this later on …
The Guardian today reveals the identities of scores of public figures whose confidential details were extracted from supposedly secure databases by a network of private investigators working for news organisations .
The victims include politicians , union leaders , a high court judge , sports personalities , showbusiness stars , journalists and thousands of members of the public .
Repeatedly breaking data protection laws , newspapers and magazines commissioned the network to obtain personal information from social security records , the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency , the police national computer , British Telecom and mobile phone companies .
They also conned hotels , banks , prisons , trade unions and the post office into handing over sensitive information .
The victims ' identities are contained in paperwork which has been suppressed since it was seized six years ago from a Hampshire private investigator , Steve Whittamore , during an inquiry known as Operation Motorman , run by the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) .
It has released a statistical summary of the Motorman paperwork but has refused repeatedly to reveal any of the content , with the result that the vast majority of the victims have never been warned that their privacy was compromised .
The Commons select committee on culture , media and sport has sent a strongly worded request to the new information commissioner , Chris Graham , demanding he show them the material and publish a redacted version .
Graham is due to appear before the committee on Wednesday .
Now the Guardian has been given access to the material in which Whittamore kept detailed records of more than 17,500 requests from more than 400 journalists even though access to these databases is a criminal offence unless there is a clear public interest to justify it .
The most common target for their efforts was British Telecom .
The seized records reveal the names of hundreds of people who asked BT for an ex-directory number to protect their privacy , only for the company to be tricked into revealing the number and often the home address .
Victims include comedians Lenny Henry and John Cleese , former footballer David Seaman , Prince Charles ' personal assistant , Tiggy Legge - Bourke , former England cricket captain Michael Atherton , former union leader Arthur Scargill and , in a neat irony , the former editor of the News of the World , Phil Hall .
Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones appears to have had 11 different ex-directory phone numbers handed over for his home in Suffolk .
Among the unwitting victims of security breaches are politicians of all three main parties .
The Labour minister Peter Hain , Liberal Democrat peer Lord Avebury and former Conservative chairman Chris Patten were all targets of attempts to extract information from BT .
The records show repeated attempts to track down details of Peter Mandelson 's home , while Labour MP and former cabinet minister , Peter Kilfoyle , was the target of a successful attempt to find his address in Liverpool .
Kilfoyle said : " I think it 's outrageous this kind of information can be obtained in this way .
I would have thought that the ICO would have let me know .
I was a government minister attached to the Cabinet Office at the time . "
Former union leaders Sir Gavin Laird and Andy Gilchrist were targets along with court of appeal judge Lord Saville , who chaired the inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland .
Journalists including Jeremy Paxman , James Naughtie , Kate Adie and Peter Sissons all had their home addresses and ex-directory phone numbers sold to Fleet Street by the network as did two former BBC director generals , Michael Checkland and Alasdair Milne , and the former publisher of the Daily Express , Lord Hollick .
The material records requests from journalists from the Observer , the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday , the Daily and Sunday Express , the Daily and Sunday Mirror and Sunday People , and The Times , Sunday Times , Sun and News of the World , as well as magazines and broadcasters .
The ICO has made no attempt to prosecute news organisations involved .
Officials said they feared the news companies would break their budget by hiring expensive QCs , forcing the ICO to do the same .
For taking information from the police computer , Whittamore was charged with two former police officers and a civilian police worker .
Before the case came to court , the civilian separately pleaded guilty to stealing police equipment to use in sex games .
He was terminally ill and was given a conditional discharge .
When all four then came to court , the judge could not impose a more serious punishment and gave them conditional discharges .
Mother Nature 's humdingers :
The awesome animals that turn the laws of science upside down
Even by the miraculous standards of the natural world , it ’s a feat almost beyond imagining .
Scientists in California have shown that a small bird known as Anna ’s hummingbird , when attempting to impress a mate , can dive through the air at speeds of around 50 miles per hour .
So far , so what ?
After all , even a humble Ford Fiesta can go at least twice as fast .
Ah , but an Anna ’s hummingbird is only five inches long .
A scientific study , published this week , has shown that if you scaled it up to the size of a Ford Fiesta ( 13 ft ) it would be going at 1,300 miles per hour - almost twice the speed of sound .
Marvel : The Anna's Hummingbird can beat its wings 1,000 times a minute
Indeed , if you calculate speed using body lengths per second ( the number of times an object can travel its own length in one second ) , the figures are even more astonishing .
A fighter jet can travel at 150 bl / sec ; the Space Shuttle at its fastest reaches 207bl / sec ; but when it ’s diving , the Anna ’s hummingbird tops the lot at 383bl /sec .
Awesome indeed .
Especially when you consider how the little creature does it .
To perform its astonishing dive , the hummingbird must whirl its wings at more than 1,000 beats a minute and burn body fuel — derived mainly from nectar — about 400 times faster than a human .
If we metabolised as quickly as they do , we would create such extreme body heat that we ’d roast ourselves alive .
A male Anna 's hummingbird captured caught during a display dive , compiled from high speed video .
Furthermore , Anna ’s hummingbirds can do another incredible aerial stunt — it sticks out its wings when it ’s about to hit the ground and zooms upwards again .
The resulting G - force ( its acceleration relative to freefall ) is about nine times the force of gravity — enough to cause any normal creature , even a trained fighter pilot , to blackout .
All in all , you ’d be forgiven for thinking that this little fellow must rank as one of the most incredible creatures on the planet .
But , in fact , there are many , many members of the animal kingdom whose physical capabilities simply beggar belief — indeed , they seem to defy the laws of physics , and thus of nature itself .
Such miracles can be seen in even the simplest creatures .
When I was at school , we were solemnly taught that no living organism could survive at temperatures much about 40C .
( Birds commonly do operate at about 40 C , but humans prefer a more modest 37C and are feverish at 40C . )
Then scientists in Yosemite National Park in California began looking for bacteria in the hot springs , where the water wells up under pressure at more than 100C — hotter than boiling water at normal atmospheric pressure .
It seemed a ridiculous place to look for living creatures , but sure enough , the scientists found microbes in huge variety .
Do n't suffer the bends : Sperm whales can dive to depths of 3,000 metres
Later , more such thermophiles — heat lovers — turned up in the volcanic hot springs that well up from the beds of the world ’s deepest oceans .
Scientists thought they were very odd — the world ’s most extreme heat specialists .
Now , it seems likely that the very earliest of all earthly creatures were thermophiles .
In other words , it ’s not the hot - spring creatures who are odd .
We are the strange ones : the creatures who have learned to be much cooler than what was once the norm , many millions of years ago .
So , how do the thermpophiles do it ?
After all , all living creatures are made largely of protein — and protein cooks at not much above 40C .
( Hence why , in some extreme cases , marathon runners start damaging their own kidneys as their body overheats . )
The answer is : no one really knows .
It ’s an unfathomable mystery that even the finest scientific minds cannot ( yet ) explain .
Nor is this nature ’s only trick .
Pressures in the deep oceans exceed imagining .
At 700 m — fairly modest depths by ocean standards — the pressure is up to 20 times normal atmospheric conditions .
Keeping warm : Emperor penguins survive - 50C cold by huddling together
In the very deepest oceans , it ’s more than 1,000 atmospheres — enough to crush every bone and organ in our bodies .
Yet still some species of deep sea fish can survive here .
They do so by having no internal body cavities — not even swim bladders , which many fish use to keep them stable underwater — so there is nothing to collapse .
But get this : the sperm whale can dive to depths of nearly three kilometres ( nearly two miles ) where the pressure reaches hundreds of atmospheres — and yet it ’s an airbreather , and so it has lungs .
Why is n’t it crushed ?
The answer is that the sperm whales ’s ribs are highly flexible — and when the lungs collapse as they must , the ribs simply flatten with them .
The oxygen , meantime , is stored in the blood — and the sperm whale can dive for up to 90 minutes at a time without needing to surface for breath .
But there is one more problem .
If human divers rise too fast from depths far more modest than this , they get the bends .
This happens when nitrogen gas dissolved in their blood comes out of solution as the pressure is reduced and so forms bubbles in the bloodstream , which can be fatal .
This ought to happen to whales , too .
But it does n’t .
Again , naturalists are not clear why .
At the other end of the pressure scale , high above the Himalayan mountains , you may encounter skeins of migrating bar - headed geese , happily flying at almost the same height as jumbo jets .
The air is thin — that ’s why human mountaineers at comparable heights need oxygen — and the temperature is colder than Siberian winter .
High - fliers : Bar - headed geese can soar to the level of Jumbo Jets
But the geese revel in it .
The thin air offers less resistance — just as it does to a jumbo jet — and the extreme cold prevents over - heating .
More stoically but equally impressively , male Emperor penguins tough out the Antarctic winter , where temperatures regularly plunge below minus 50C , by standing for weeks in a huddle , the outermost ones forever shuffling to the inside so that everyone takes their share of the furious , cutting winds .
It is a masterclass in tribal cooperation .
Polar fish , meanwhile , produce their own natural anti-freeze — chemical compounds that stop them being frozen stiff in the icy depths .
But often it ’s the behaviour of animals that is even more astounding than their physical characteristics .
You might , for example , think it would be utterly impossible for any creature to catch moths on the wing at night in the pitch dark — but bats do it by echo- location , using highpitched squeaks which bounce off their surroundings to create a ‘ mental picture ’ so detailed that they can even pick out a tiny flying insect .
For good measure , new research shows that the echo - locating bats even listen out for other bats as well , so they do n’t get in each other ’s way .
Spiderman has nothing on bats .
It is equally impossible , you might think , for a baby bird that has done nothing in its brief life but sit in a nest and eat caterpillars to take off — after its parents have quit the scene — and fly from , say , Sussex to southern Africa : over the Channel and the Strait of Gibraltar ; over the Sahara .
But that is what every new generation of swallows does — and then they repeat the feat , both ways , every year , for as long as they live , which could be a decade .
In fact , every autumn , about five billion birds take off from Northern Europe and Asia and head for the south , and about the same number take off from North America and head for Tropical America and beyond .
About 5,500 species — about half of all bird species — undertake some form of migration .
On their first trip , some young birds simply follow their parents , but many , like young swallows , set out unchaperoned .
Yet how do they know where to go ?
Natural protection :
The polar fish can make its own anti-freeze
Again , no one really knows .
Some birds , such as pigeons , seem to read the Earth ’s magnetic signals : they have compounds of iron at the base of the beak that make them hypersensitive to magnetic changes .
Others use sight and smell .
When they get close to their homes , pigeons apparently use their knowledge of the landscape and their sense of smell — first homing in on the general niff of ammonia that emanates from all bird colonies , then recognising the specific smell of their own flock .
Others seem to navigate by the sun — but not , presumably , the many small songbirds and others that prefer to migrate by night , avoiding over - heating by flying when it ’s cool .
Night - flyers apparently navigate by the moon and stars .
Some birds , like the indigo bunting , much favoured by scientists for behavioural research , evidently spend their early weeks in the nest learning the layout of the night sky .
They do not need to be quite so knowledgeable as the ecologist Patrick Moore .
They just need to be able to identify the pole star — the one that all the other stars seem to revolve around .
That , apparently , is enough for orientation .
But still it is astonishing .
What , then , with all these feats to choose from , is the most remarkable creature of all ?
Which one would it be hardest for an engineer to mimic ?
Well , despite the extraordinary competition , there is one familiar creature that could put in the strongest bid to be the most astonishing of all : you .
The most mundane of tasks undertaken by humankind requires truly astonishing skills and computing power .
Never mind the Shakespeares , the Mozarts and the Einsteins — we are , all of us , miracles of nature .
Do n’t believe it ?
Think on this .
We dream that one day sophisticated robots will be invented that could take the grind out of life ’s daily chores .
But a robot that could carry a tray of tea upstairs , while whistling a happy tune and thinking about plans for tomorrow would need an onboard computer that would make the whole of Nasa ’s hardware look like a pocket calculator .
Yet you or I could do it in an instant .
We are more sophisticated , more intelligent , more marvellous than any man-made invention .
But we take such stuff for granted .
Anna ’s hummingbird , and its death - defying flights of fancy , may seem awesome , but in truth , all life is wondrous .
We should appreciate our fellow creatures far more than we do .
Especially ourselves .
Chris 's neck and head were separated by the so - called " hangman 's injury " A Hampshire boy who survived a racing crash which almost severed his head from his neck is back behind the wheel .
Chris Stewart was 12 when his head was left attached to his body by only skin and muscle after the accident .
He had metal pins put into his body .
It took nine months for Chris , now 14 and from Fareham , to learn to speak , eat and walk again and doctors have now said he can get back behind the wheel .
He is thought to be one of just six people to survive a " hangman 's injury " .
His mother Debbie said she would only allow him to race a go - kart .
Chris has been three times this year to a track near his home .
He received the so - called " hangman 's injury " after his skull and neck were separated when he hit a barrier in a junior race in September 2006 .
' Unheard - of recovery '
Doctors reattached his skull to his spine using titanium plates and screws .
Others to have survived the injury have been left paralysed .
His mother Debbie , 43 , said : " The recovery could not be described as anything short of miraculous .
Chris was injured taking part in a junior race in September 2006 " It 's an unheard - of recovery , a complete medical phenomenon to the extent he has gone full circle now and is driving again .
" It 's just nothing we could have contemplated in September 2006 . "
His mother has banned car racing and only allows him to drive a go - kart .
" He is two years from getting behind a car and starting to drive himself , " she said .
" I can't be with him all the time but for now I do n't want him grass track racing .
" I still find it very difficult to comprehend at times and I find it emotional to be around him knowing we are lucky to still have him . "

Steve Steffens at Right Wing Cracker : " Randy Wade is to be complimented as well ; he arranged for security .
There were actually idiots who brought guns ( legally , it seems they had carry permits , but why did they feel they needed them ? ) .
Yes , you read that right , and Randy made them all check in with the Sheriff 's Deputies on hand .
Gordon G via FDL Event Tracker : " Beginning early in the proceedings many attendees who were clearly against health insurance reform began trying to speak ( and shout ) out of turn , at times chanting in unison .
These bullying attempts were contained by the rest of the crowd , who variously applauded speakers supporting reform , demanded that hecklers behave , and engaged thugs one - on - one to keep the peace . " [...]
Tennessee Wisc Dem :
The thing I wish Steve had n’t done was ask any doctors present to speak first .
Did he think doctors would be liberal ?
He thereby gave voice to every right - wing talking point you have heard .
Several times he had to follow a doctor by saying " It ’s not in the bill . "
I remember this especially with care for illegal aliens , but abortion and euthanasia both came up .
The most prominent sign in the room was " do n’t kill my GiGi . "
When Steve specifically said there was nothing in the bill to do this , and praised his family ’s experience with hospice , he was roundly booed .

On his FNC show yesterday , Glenn Beck made the claim that Obama ’s goal is to create a new America to settle old racial scores .
Beck focused on the Office of Minority Health .
He said , “ Let ’s say minorities eat more Doritos , so it there ’s more heart disease .
Would n’t this lead to more lawsuits and litigation against Doritos ? ”
Beck is worried about Doritos instead of healthcare , enough said .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck said , “ Here is what I was worried about , because the Office of Minority Health , I guess you could say , and I do n’t know the stats , but let ’s just say that minorities eat more Doritos , so there ’s more heart disease well would n’t towards lead to more lawsuits and litigation towards Doritos ?
Does n’t this lead to all sorts of things when instead what we should be saying is stop eating so many Doritos . ”
He considers the Office of Minority Heath affirmative action , “ We can eat Doritos , be White , Asian , Black , does n’t matter , but we ’re not studying that , we ’re just studying the minority health . ”
I ’ll bet Glenn did n’t know that the Office of Minority Health was established in 1986 , by the Department of Health and Human Services by that liberal affirmative action champion President Ronald Reagan .
In fact , according to their website , they , “ advise the Secretary and the Office of Public Health and Science ( OPHS ) on public health program activities affecting American Indians and Alaska Natives , Asian Americans , Blacks / African Americans , Hispanics / Latinos , Native Hawaiians , and other Pacific Islanders . ”
This may come as a shock to Beck , but some of their more devious campaigns have included , encouraging minority fatherhood , HIV / AIDS education , pre-natal education , in an attempt to decrease African - American infant mortality .
They do n’t seem to be doing much original data collections as most of their statistics come from HHS and the Census .
If the name of Beck ’s guest sounds familiar , it should .
Before Linda Chavez was a failed Secretary of Labor nominee under George W. Bush , she was the staff director for the US Commission on Civil Rights under Ronald Reagan , and the Chairman of the National Commission on Migrant Education under President George H.W. Bush .
I have a hunch that she knows what the Office of Minority Health really does , but Republicans see good politics in paranoia .
It is interesting that Beck ’s priority is protecting Frito - Lay , which is a division of Pepsi from lawsuits .
This whole segment was pure Glenn Beck fantasy .
As far as I can see , the Office of Minority Health has no official position on Doritos , but my guess is that they probably think that they are pretty tasty when eaten in moderation along with a healthy diet and exercise .
Myself and two compadres , Ryan and Mark , are in Chicago ( each of us for the first time ) to attend Brickworld , the world 's largest Lego convention .
Yes we 're a bunch of dorks .
Yes you totally wish you were here too .
Last night , after seeing Second City improv , we ate at a pleasantly sketchy dive bar in uptown Chicago , where the food was mediocre and the characters were questionable .
I definitely had my iPhone while at our table , and I definitely did NOT have it ( whoops ! ) when we were 100 feet down the street .
I raced back into the bar , not even particularly concerned , but it was gone like baby .
In less than five minutes , with very few people in the small place , my beloved JesusPhone had managed to vanish into a black hole .
Our waitress was sympathetic , and I left a number , but I was immediately glum about my prospects of seeing it again .
So I felt like about zero cents , but then we giddily realized that I had * just * activated the brand - new Find My iPhone service .
Even better , Mark had a Sprint ( yes , ) USB dongle giving him Internet access over 3G on his MacBook Pro. Excited to try it out , we hopped onto me.com and clicked the Find My iPhone link .
Well , crap .
I guess all bets are off if the thieving person has the bright idea to turn the iPhone off .
Oddly the phone still rang when we called it , suggesting itoff ; but , one way or the other , it was unable to broadcast itself to Apple so I could track it down .
We sent a message to the phone - " CALL 512-796-xxxx " - but no luck .
The MobileMe website said it would send me an email when the message had been displayed , but no email arrived .
Dejected , we prowled the bar one more time , but it was n't that big a place and there were n't any places for the phone to be hiding .
Game over .
We went back to the hotel and I was disconsolate .
This morning we checked again with no additional luck , and when Mark tried dialing the phone around noon , it * did * go straight to voicemail .
The odds of ever seeing the phone again were slim to say the least .
After lunch , while at the Lego convention , I checked my email ... Holy crap !
I jumped back to me.com and clicked Find My iPhone again , and to my absolute shock and amazement , it displayed Google Maps and drew a circle around Medill St .
The block was about four or five miles west of the bar .
It was too perfect to be a random glitch .
I sent a second message to the phone , slightly more to the point : " This phone is missing .
Please call 512-796 - xxxx to return it .
$ 50 reward . "
Almost immediately I received a second confirmation email that it had been displayed on the phone .
And yet , the minutes ticked by and no call was coming .
I kept refreshing the location , and though the circle varied in size , it kept floating around that same block , five miles west of the bar .
The Lego convention was drawing to a close and it was time for the closing ceremony .
But I was n't about to spend an hour sitting through awards and Lego - themed thank - you speeches while my poor lost iPhone sat in some random Chicago neighborhood .
So we packed my Lego creations , tossed them in the rental car , and drove from Wheeling back into town .
Mark reestablished his trusty Sprint connection and as we drove , every five minutes , he refreshed the location .
The phone was n't moving .
It appeared to be in a row of buildings on the north side of Medill St. We parked along Medill and hopped out .
It was a Puerto Rican neighborhood .
On the south side of the street , an outdoor birthday fiesta was convening , and some of the participants eyed us three honkeys questioningly .
Now at this point I had no fricking clue how we would find the phone ; did I think I 'd find it under a bush ?
I certainly did n't plan to go door - to - door , nor did I expect the cops to regard a blue circle around the entire block as sufficient cause for a search warrant .
I sent a third message to the phone that I 'd been formulating in my head : " We have tracked the phone to Medill St. and are locating it .
Please call 512 -796 - xxxx to help us and claim a reward . "
Short version : WE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE .
In a burst of inspiration , I took Mark 's computer with me as we walked down the block , figuring the recipient of the message might see us prowling the area with an open laptop and realize we meant business .
I kept refreshing ; the circle kept hovering ; but it still stretched across the entire block , and worse , this included a big apartment building .
Suddenly Mark called my number - the umpteenth time he'd tried - and to our shock , somebody answered !
He immediately passed the phone to me , but by the time I could say hello , the person on the other side had hung up .
DAMMIT !
I knew we were on the trail , but as we walked up and down that block of Medill for the third time , I had no idea how we'd get any closer .
I pictured the possibility of driving away from the neighborhood knowing my iPhone was around .
It was more frustrating than having had no idea where it was .
I pulled up Google Translate , and sent a 4th message to the phone : " Por favor , devuelva el teléfono o nos pondremos en contacto con la policía . "
The email confirmations were arriving immediately in my Inbox , meaning our threats were showing on the phone 's screen in real time .
Then an amazingly lucky thing happened .
I refreshed the iPhone location and the circle , to the corner of the block , and shrunk in size to maybe 100 feet across .
I waited a minute and refreshed again .
The small circle had shifted southward down Washtenaw .
" THAT WAY !
" Us three skinny white guys walked at a rapid pace in the direction of the circle .
We moved past the birthday party , curious if one of the participants might be culpable , but the circle again shifted farther south .
I was ready to break for our car if the phone started moving away faster than we could catch it , but it hovered at the very end of the street , at the corner of Washtenaw and Milwaukee : Ryan and Mark raced ahead , literally making a flanking maneuver to the left and right , as I approached the intersection .
I clicked Refresh .
The circle moved again .
It was directly over the bus stop on the south side of Milwaukee Avenue .
I yelled and pointed .
Now , put yourself in the shoes of the iPhone thiever who will momentarily be entering the story .
You might have told yourself , " Hey , free iPhone ! " the night before .
You might have seen the gently - threatening messages and ignored them , maybe even scoffed .
Then the phone told you it was on Medill St .
It talked to you in Spanish .
And you saw three skinny white guys prowling in the street with a laptop computer open .
So you take off down the road , and to your shock and horror , the honkeys follow you .
You stand at your local bus stop , expecting to lose them .
And they converge on your location from across the intersection , the bald one with the laptop yelling and pointing at you .
You probably think the angels of death have found you .
He sheepishly waved me over .
" Have you got it ? "
I asked as I marched up to the guy , acting far more intimidating than I felt .
Our iPhone - pilfering friend apparently works at the sketchy bar , and as he fished around in his bag , he gave a questionable alibi about having found the phone , intending to return it , but being intimidated by " all these scary - looking messages " that kept popping up on the display .
" Um , yeah , those were from me , " I replied curtly .
He pulled my phone out , totally unharmed , and handed it over .
I resisted the urge to giggle .
I shook his hand - Lord knows why I did that - and the three of us walked off .
We laughed triumphantly , adrenaline racing , feeling like the Jack Bauer trio .
( Disregard the fact that we 'd just left a Lego convention . )
I 'd been amazed that the phone had enough battery life to make it through the night and still beam its location ; the moment its battery was dead , then it would be game over for our little scavenger hunt .
I unlocked my phone and saw almost 20 missed calls .
And then , at that very moment , the iPhone shut down and displayed the " Connect to power " icon .
My phone 's battery literally hung on until the second it was in my hand .
I wuv you , iPhone .
All said and done , it was almost worth losing the phone just for the thrill of finding it like this .
We want to pitch a reality show to the Discovery Channel : " Phone Hunters . "
It certainly felt like we were in one there for a second .
And that , my friends , is why the MobileMe service is worth the damn money .
It 's been around for just over seven years and it FINALLY got a killer feature .
A few thoughts on our successful effort :-
If the man had n't made a break for it down the street , we probably never would have been able to find him .
Oh well , his loss . -
Yes , we sent a real number , not actually 512 - 796 - xxxx .
A few bugs we found with the Find My iPhone process :-
Even though iPhone 's alert notification plays whether it's on vibrate or not , it still obeys the ringer volume - so you can still , regrettably , keep it from playing .
Also it 's a lighter daintier sound effect than we 'd prefer for locating something by sound .
Hell , I 'd prefer it if I could take pictures , play my iTunes library , and tase whoever was holding it . -
There 's no real reason MobileMe should n't push the location to us ; needing to refresh the location repeatedly on the webpage was silly . -
None of this would have been possible without Mark 's 3G USB dongle for his MacBook .
The biggest single problem is that you can't use me.com from the iPhone , meaning you can't find one iPhone using another .
Hopefully Apple realizes this .-
The references to race are for two purposes :
First , to be self - deprecating about how little we actually looked like a bad - ass iPhone tracking team ; Second , to establish how much we stood out in this particular neighborhood .
Besides a bit of self - mockery , I do n't think I said or implied a single negative thing about anyone 's race . -
Yeah , we could have called the cops , and they probably would have yawned .
Granted , in retrospect , chasing after a thief is n't the MOST prudent thing to do , but in the moment we had our adrenaline going and sure as hell were n't just going to watch the little circle recede into the distance .

Obama Administration Adds Renowned Hacker to Homeland Security Advisory Council
Jeff Moss , who you may know as the founder of the hacking conference DefCon , was sworn in yesterday as one of the new members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council .
And we think it ’s a shrewd and thoughtful move .
Moss , also known as Dark Tangent , founded both the DefCon and Black Hat hacker conferences in addition to legit security work — most notably at Ernst and Young , one of those giant corporations that provides auditors , attorneys , brokers , designers , and lots more to other companies .
He ’s a sort of godfather of hackers , a pioneer who uses his underground skills in mostly above - ground ways .
As the Obama administration has been placing a heavier focus on cybersecurity , it ’s an extremely smart move to ask one of the world ’s foremost professional hackers to assist on the Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council .
He ’s got enough expertise to really be able to offer some help , but he ’s also not a dangerous hacker — one analyst called him “ as corporate as hiring someone out of Microsoft , ” meaning that for the hacking world , Moss is hardly a loose cannon .
But that ’s exactly why it ’s also a smart political choice .
Picking a hacker seems like an edgy choice , but Moss is a guy who ’s worked for Fortune 500 companies , not someone who ’s working in his basement to bring down the power grid .
We ’re looking forward to seeing cybersecurity finally advance , and this kind of guy is just what we need to get ourselves back on track .

Libya has been courted by government ministers and Foreign Office mandarins on a dozen or more occasions in pursuit of lucrative oil and gas contracts .
Documents obtained by the Observer show ministers and senior civil servants met Shell to discuss the company 's oil interests in Libya on at least 11 occasions and perhaps as many as 26 times in less than four years .
Foreign secretary David Miliband and the former Labour leader Lord Kinnock were involved in the meetings with Shell about its business in Libya or Egypt .
The revelations , showing that the government invested large amounts of political capital in securing North African oil , lend weight to claims that commercial interest lay behind last week 's decision to release the Lockerbie bomber , Abdelbaset al - Megrahi , from jail in Scotland to receive a hero 's welcome in Libya .
Gordon Brown has insisted that Whitehall had no involvement in the release , but critics of the government say the information obtained by the non-governmental organisation , Platform , via a Freedom of Information Act request , raises fresh questions .
" These documents show the deep and long - term foreign policy backing provided by the British government to Shell in its efforts to break into Libya .
Corporate executives have easy access to the highest level of Whitehall , while democracy advocates and social movements remain shut out on the street , " said Mika Minio - Paluello , a campaigner with Platform .
" Yet again , the Foreign Office has prioritised securing new oil reserves for private corporations over human rights , the environment or democracy .
Foreign policy should represent people 's interests , not corporate interests .
As a first step , the government must open its files and disclose the true level of oil influence on government decision - making . "
Shell was one of the first western oil companies to re-enter Libya – one of the world 's biggest potential oil sources – following the end of United Nations sanctions and a commitment from leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to turn his back on funding terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons .
A deal was signed by Shell on 25 March 2004 covering the establishment of a " long - term strategic partnership " between the oil company and the local state - owned energy group .
It was penned during a ground - breaking visit by the then prime minister , Tony Blair , and was followed up by meetings during July between Shell and foreign minister Baroness Symons and then the foreign secretary at the time , Jack Straw .
In October , Malcolm Brinded , the head of exploration at Shell who signed the deal to explore for oil and redevelop a gas export terminal in Libya , met another foreign minister , Douglas Alexander , with a particular focus on trade .
In February 2005 , Kinnock was involved in a reception at which Shell was present and North African oil interests were raised .
Anthony Layden , the British ambassador to Libya , was engaged in a series of meetings during April of the same year with Shell in Tripoli .
Miliband met with Brinded in October of that year .
Shell said last night it had " no comment " to make on any discussions it had held with British ministers or other government officials about Libya , and the Foreign Office was unable to discuss these meetings .
But a government spokeswoman denied British oil interests played any part in the release of the Lockerbie bomber .
She said : " There is no deal – all decisions relating to Megrahi 's case were exclusively for Scottish ministers , the Crown Office in Scotland and the Scottish judicial authorities .
No deal has been made between the UK government and Libya in relation to Megrahi and any commercial interests in the country . "
Yesterday Megrahi backed calls for a public inquiry into the atrocity .
He said he was determined to clear his name and that an inquiry would help families of the victims know the truth .
Megrahi said he would help Dr Jim Swire , whose 23 - year - old daughter Flora died in the disaster and who has frequently called for a full public inquiry , by handing over all the documents in his possession .

Dimanche 19 juillet , lors de l'ascension vers Verbier , Alberto Contador a établi un record de vitesse : il a parcouru les 8,5 km de montée ( 7,5 % de pente moyenne ) en 20 min 55 .
Jamais un coureur du Tour n'avait grimpé aussi vite .
Comment expliquer une telle performance ?
Selon les dernières données publiées par l'ancien entraîneur de Festina et spécialiste reconnu de la performance , Antoine Vayer , dans Libération , le coureur espagnol aurait eu besoin d'une VO2 max ( consommation maximale d'oxygène ) de 99,5 ml / mn / kg pour produire cet effort .
A ma connaissance , c'est un chiffre qui n'a jamais été atteint par aucun athlète , dans aucun sport .
C'est un peu comme si une belle Mercedes sortant d'un salon automobile s'alignait sur un circuit de Formule 1 et remportait la course .
Il y a quelque chose qui cloche .
Il serait intéressant de savoir ce qu'il y a sous le capot .
Un coureur roulant à l'eau claire peut - il atteindre la vitesse d'ascension et la puissance produite à Verbier ?
Peut - être .
Si les études menées par Antoine Vayer sont correctes , Alberto Contador serait alors le premier être humain à atteindre un tel palier de performance .
En admettant la validité des tests physiologiques de l'effort , de la VO2 max et de diverses équations mathématiques qui traduisent sans état d'âme la valeur sportive , la charge revient alors à Alberto Contador de prouver qu'il est physiquement capable d'accomplir cette prouesse sans recourir à des produits améliorant les performances .
En raison de l'histoire récente de notre sport , le doute est de rigueur .
Et devrait nous conduire à nous interroger sur ces performances extraordinaires .
C'est pourquoi le sceptique que je suis devenu a envie de demander à Alberto Contador de nous convaincre .
DUBITATIFJe voudrais connaître sa réelle référence en matière de VO2 max .
En le sachant , on pourrait alors expliquer ce résultat qui fait de lui le grimpeur le plus rapide de l'histoire du Tour .
L'avenir des contrôles antidopage ne passe pas seulement par des méthodes de détection sanguine et urinaire mais par l'évaluation des paramètres physiologiques de chaque individu .
Pour établir un profil fiable , il faudrait commencer cette évaluation dès les premiers coups de pédale chez les juniors .
A l'instar du passeport sanguin qui permet de suivre dans la durée l'évolution des paramètres hématologiques d'un coureur , elle permettrait de surveiller l'évolution de la VO2 max .
En mesurant la puissance développée par les coureurs et leur VO2 max , on parviendrait à établir l'équivalent des fichiers ADN utilisés pour confondre un criminel .
Je ne connais pas les vraies valeurs d'Alberto Contador comme je ne connais pas les conditions météorologiques ( le vent , notamment ) lors de l'étape de Verbier .
Je ne porterai donc ici aucun jugement sans davantage d'informations .
Lors du procès Festina , en 2000 , à Lille , des témoignages avaient fait valoir que des coureurs avec des VO2 max dans les 70 étaient capables de les porter à environ 90 .
Ce saut de performance a été si important qu'aucun coureur propre n'a pu ensuite rivaliser .
Si on avait utilisé la méthode d'évaluation de la V02 Max , on aurait pu constater l'usage intensif de l'EPO et des transfusions sanguines dans le peloton bien avant que ces pratiques ne soient aussi profondément ancrées dans notre sport .
C'est pourquoi je reste dubitatif face à toute performance qui paraît trop bonne pour être vraie .
Greg LeMond est le premier coureur américain à avoir remporté le Tour de France .
Il s'est imposé en 1986 , 1989 et 1990 .

' Surge in global temps since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean '
Updated : See July 29 , 2009 Technical Note from Co-Authors
A new peer - reviewed climate study is presenting a head on challenge to man-made global warming claims .
The study by three climate researchers appears in the July 23 , 2009 edition of Journal of Geophysical Research .

Nature not man responsible for recent global warming
Three Australasian researchers have shown that natural forces are the dominant influence on climate , in a study just published in the highly - regarded Journal of Geophysical Research .
According to this study little or none of the late 20th century global warming and cooling can be attributed to human activity .
The research , by Chris de Freitas , a climate scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand , John McLean ( Melbourne ) and Bob Carter ( James Cook University ) , finds that the El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) is a key indicator of global atmospheric temperatures seven months later .
As an additional influence , intermittent volcanic activity injects cooling aerosols into the atmosphere and produces significant cooling .
“ The surge in global temperatures since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean that made warming El Niño conditions more likely than they were over the previous 30 years and cooling La Niña conditions less likely ” says corresponding author de Freitas .
“ We have shown that internal global climate - system variability accounts for at least 80 % of the observed global climate variation over the past half - century .
It may even be more if the period of influence of major volcanoes can be more clearly identified and the corresponding data excluded from the analysis . ”
Climate researchers have long been aware that ENSO events influence global temperature , for example causing a high temperature spike in 1998 and a subsequent fall as conditions moved to La Niña .
It is also well known that volcanic activity has a cooling influence , and as is well documented by the effects of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption .
The new paper draws these two strands of climate control together and shows , by demonstrating a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation and lower - atmospheric temperature , that ENSO has been a major temperature influence since continuous measurement of lower - atmospheric temperature first began in 1958 .
According to the three researchers , ENSO - related warming during El Niño conditions is caused by a stronger Hadley Cell circulation moving warm tropical air into the mid-latitudes .
During La Niña conditions the Pacific Ocean is cooler and the Walker circulation , west to east in the upper atmosphere along the equator , dominates .
“ When climate models failed to retrospectively produce the temperatures since 1950 the modellers added some estimated influences of carbon dioxide to make up the shortfall , ” says McLean .
“ The IPCC acknowledges in its 4th Assessment Report that ENSO conditions cannot be predicted more than about 12 months ahead , so the output of climate models that could not predict ENSO conditions were being compared to temperatures during a period that was dominated by those influences .
It ’s no wonder that model outputs have been so inaccurate , and it is clear that future modelling must incorporate the ENSO effect if it is to be meaningful . ”
Bob Carter , one of four scientists who has recently questioned the justification for the proposed Australian emissions trading scheme , says that this paper has significant consequences for public climate policy .
“ The close relationship between ENSO and global temperature , as described in the paper , leaves little room for any warming driven by human carbon dioxide emissions .
The available data indicate that future global temperatures will continue to change primarily in response to ENSO cycling , volcanic activity and solar changes . ”
“ Our paper confirms what many scientists already know : which is that no scientific justification exists for emissions regulation , and that , irrespective of the severity of the cuts proposed , ETS ( emission trading scheme ) will exert no measurable effect on future climate . ”

This figure from the McLean et al ( 2009 ) research shows that mean monthly global temperature ( MSU GTTA ) corresponds in general terms with the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) of seven months earlier .
The SOI is a rough indicator of general atmospheric circulation and thus global climate change .
The possible influence of the Rabaul volcanic eruption is shown .
Excerpted Abstract of the Paper appearing in the Journal of Geophysical Research :
Time series for the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) and global tropospheric temperature anomalies ( GTTA ) are compared for the 1958−2008 period .
GTTA are represented by data from satellite microwave sensing units ( MSU ) for the period 1980 – 2008 and from radiosondes ( RATPAC ) for 1958 –2008 .
After the removal from the data set of short periods of temperature perturbation that relate to near - equator volcanic eruption , we use derivatives to document the presence of a 5 - to 7 - month delayed close relationship between SOI and GTTA .
Change in SOI accounts for 72 % of the variance in GTTA for the 29 - year - long MSU record and 68 % of the variance in GTTA for the longer 50 - year RATPAC record .
Because El Niño−Southern Oscillation is known to exercise a particularly strong influence in the tropics , we also compared the SOI with tropical temperature anomalies between 20 °S and 20°N .
The results showed that SOI accounted for 81 % of the variance in tropospheric temperature anomalies in the tropics .
Overall the results suggest that the Southern Oscillation exercises a consistently dominant influence on mean global temperature , with a maximum effect in the tropics , except for periods when equatorial volcanism causes ad hoc cooling .
That mean global tropospheric temperature has for the last 50 years fallen and risen in close accord with the SOI of 5 – 7 months earlier shows the potential of natural forcing mechanisms to account for most of the temperature variation .

Technical Note from co-authors of study – July 29 , 2009
Not surprisingly , a storm has broken out over research saying human activities are not the main factor behind climate change .
In an attempt to denigrate the work , claims have been made that the research fails to effectively detect trends in MGT .
This is misleading and causes confusion , especially among those people who have not read the paper .
The paper by McLean et al does not analyse trends in MGT ; rather , it examines the extent to which ENSO accounts for variation in MGT .
The research concludes that MGT has for the last 50 years fallen and risen in close accord with the SOI of 5 - 7 months earlier and shows the potential of natural mechanisms to account for most of the temperature variation .
It is evident in this paper that ENSO ( ocean - atmosphere heat exchange ) is the primary driver of MGT ( i.e. El Niños cause global warming and La Niñas cause global cooling ) .
All other mechanisms are small in comparison .
The reason may be due to Hadley circulation which is itself linked to changes in sea surface temperature ( ocean heat supply ) and the Walker Circulation , that is , ENSO .
Hadley circulation is the main mechanism for moving the surplus of energy at near the equator to high latitudes and plays a key role in the general circulation of the atmosphere .
Changes in Hadley circulation affects convection and thus atmospheric moisture content and cloud cover which may in turn affect net solar heating as well as the transfer of heat from Earth to space .
Those who claim correlation using derivatives ( differences ) removes a linear trend miss the point .
McLean et al use this method to construct Figures 5 and 6 .
It should be noted that detrended data was used purely to establish the time lag between the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) and MGT in Figures 5 and 6 .
This time lag was then used in Figure 7 to show that close correlation between trends in temperature and changes in the Southern Oscillation Index seven months previously .
Figure 7 presents the data in its original form ; namely , data that is not detrended , but with the time shift in SOI obtained from the detrended data .
If an underlying trend existed , it would have shown up in Figure 7 .
One would see the temperature line rising away from the SOI line if , for example , rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations had a significant influence .
There is little or no sign of this .
The results in Figure 7 clearly show that the SOI related variability in MGT is the major contribution to any trends that might exist , although the McLean et al study did not look for this .
The key conclusion of the paper , therefore , is that MGT is determined in most part by atmospheric processes related to the Southern Oscillation .
For more on trends , recent work by Compo and Sardeshmukh ( Climate Dynamics , 32:33 -342 , 2009 ) is illuminating .
The abstract includes the statement : “ Evidence is presented that the recent worldwide land warming has occurred largely in response to a worldwide warming of the oceans rather than as a direct response to increasing greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) over land . ”

Microsoft announced a couple of weeks ago that some retail stores would be opening " right next door to Apple stores " this fall .
At the time it was n't clear if this was a deliberate strategy or merely a coincidence .
That said , Microsoft has announced the locations for its first two retail stores : one will be located in The Shops at Mission Viejo , California and the other in Fashion Square in Scottsdale , Arizona .
The California location already has an Apple store , though with two floors and more than a million square feet of store space in the mall , the Microsoft outlet wo n't necessarily be a close neighbor .
( Source : dailytech.com )
MS Acquires Real Estate Strategy
Microsoft recently hired former Gap executive George Blankenship as a consultant .
He 'd also previously worked as Apple 's head of real estate and helped develop the firm 's chain of retail outlets .
While at Apple , Blankenship bucked the conventional wisdom of picking stores with low or mid-price rents and were located near tech - related outlets .
Instead , he targeted premises in busy areas visited by relatively well - heeled consumers : while rents were higher , he felt this was outweighed by the greater potential for passing trade .
Now it appears he 's adopting similar tactics at Microsoft , which will inevitably mean there will be instances when the firm picks locations near existing Apple stores .
Third - Party Products
It 's also emerged that while the stores will concentrate mainly on software and Microsoft 's own hardware ( such as the Xbox 360 and the Zune ) , the stores will also sell laptops .
It will be interesting to see which brands the firm picks to stock and whether there are any associated deals with manufacturers in return for the exposure .

There are also currently unconfirmed rumors that the stores may include facilities for teaching computer skills .

Goldman and Barclays are out touting old structured credit technology , apparently collateralized debt obligations , and claim they have been tamed and repurposed and are now virtuous .
I am skeptical of these assertions , and welcome informed reader comment .
CDOs in particular were leverage on leverage vehicles , and indeed , that seems again to be the reason for turning to a variant on that theme again , to minimize equity requirements .
The amusing bit is these news structures are argued to be “ transparent . ”
If you buy that , I have a bridge I ’d like to sell you .
If you have a dog ’s breakfast of assets , some of them tranches from other deals , and then you tranche that , what good does transparency do ?
It ’s a complicated mess to analyze .
Opening the hood does not make it any more comprehensible to anyone other than an industry expert equipped with specialiazed software and access to sources that help him come up with default and loss probabilities .
Most investors and all regulators will find them impenetrable .
Which is precisely the point .
I wonder if the assertion of transparency is Emperor ’s new clothes in action , designed to cow those who ca n’t fully grasp the workings of these vehicles .
But the cheery sales talk is just breathtaking .
You ’d think it was spring 2007 all over again .
Maybe that ’s the objective .
From the Financial Times :
Investment banks , including Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital , are inventing schemes to reduce the capital cost of risky assets on banks ’ balance sheets , in the latest sign that financial market innovation is far from dead .
The schemes , which Goldman insiders refer to as “ insurance ” and BarCap calls “ smart securitisation ” , use different mechanisms to achieve the same goal : cutting capital costs by up to half in some cases , at the same time as regulators are threatening to force banks to increase their capital requirements .
Yves here .
You gotta love the attempt at rebranding established technology .
Back to the story :
BarCap ’s structures involve the pooling of assets from several clients into a secured financial product that can be sold on to other investors and rated by a credit rating agency , potentially reducing the capital allocated against the assets by between 10 per cent and 50 per cent .
These new mechanisms are in some respects similar to the discredited structured products , which were widely blamed for fuelling the financial crisis .
But the schemes ’ backers argue there are two significant differences .
First , they involve the securitisation of banks ’ existing assets , rather than of new lending .
Second , bankers argue that the new products do not disguise the transfer of risk … .
However , some regulators may be wary of the invention of new pooled asset derivatives , especially if they are perceived as a way to avoid regulatory capital requirements .
Some rival bankers also view the schemes with scepticism .
“ This is a system of capital arbitrage , ” said one senior banker at another investment bank .
“ The need for capital just miraculously disappears . ”
BarCap has worked on portfolios worth hundreds of billions of pounds in recent months , including those of the Barclays ’ parent company .
Investors in the securitised products typically include the original banks , plus third parties , such as hedge funds and private equity firms , as well as BarCap itself .
Separately , Goldman is working on what bankers said was a private - sector version of the UK government ’s asset protection scheme .
The goal would be similar – to reduce the capital that would need to be held against the assets – although Goldman has yet to find a balance between the risks and rewards that would be attractive to investors .
Yves here .
That is code for “ Goldman is spinning its wheels . ”
I ’m surprised they ’d noise this up with the media if they had n’t come up with a viable solution .
Hhm , are we back to the MLEC problem , which no one can ever solve , that no matter how much lipstick you put on these pigs , there is an unsolvable price gap between what bank owners of the paper are willing to sell it for and what buyers are willing to pay ?
Back to the story :
Investment banks do not believe they can compete with the government - sponsored APS , mainly due to scale .
RBS and Lloyds between them are putting £ 560 bn ( $ 914bn ) into the scheme .
Under Goldman ’s idea , it would sell an insurance product to a bank with a toxic portfolio , effectively shifting the risk of the underlying assets off the balance sheet .
The insurance would require far less capital to be carried against it than the original assets .
Deutsche Bank engineered a comparable structure to facilitate the dismantling of risk at failed insurer AIG , although bankers close to that transaction said without government involvement the cost of such a structure would be commercially unfeasible .

It 's 200 years since Lord Byron quit the UK to make his name abroad - becoming a national hero in Greece .
The poet also achieved fame in his homeland , but there is a select band of Britons whose talents today are most warmly appreciated outside their home country .
Debbie Travis , Rawdon Christie and Chris Birchall .
Know who they are ?
When they come home to the UK , they can walk down the street without anyone batting an eyelid .
But in Canada , New Zealand and Trinidad respectively , life for them is quite different .
The trail of modern British celebrities could arguably be traced back to Lord Byron , whose wife Annabella described the hysteria that followed him as " Byromania " .
SEND US YOUR SUGGESTIONS
In response to this article , you sent us suggestions of other Britons famous abroad Read a selection of your nominations here
The poet - currently the subject of a documentary series on Channel 4 - first went overseas 200 years ago , and he went on to achieve great fame in Greece , which has a national day devoted to him .
He spent much of his life abroad , and even turned his back on Britain in later life .
Today , a select band of Britons have achieved success in their adopted homelands , yet remain relatively unknown in the UK .
CANADA - DEBBIE TRAVIS
The host of Debbie Travis ' Facelift and Debbie Travis ' Painted House has become a star in Canada , where she has lived since the mid-1980s .
Travis has been endorsed by Oprah
As well as the television programmes , the Travis empire includes her own line in paint products , several newspaper columns and eight books , mostly on home decorating .
" She can do things with paint that you 've never seen before , " said Oprah Winfrey , when Travis appeared on her show .
Travis was born in Blackburn and after studying at art college , followed by six years of modelling , she entered the television industry as a freelance editor and producer .
Her career took off after moving to Montreal with her husband , where her paint decorating business attracted media attention .
Return to link GERMANY - FREDDIE FRINTON
Every New Year 's Eve , half of Germany sits down to watch an English comedy sketch starring a comedian that few in the UK would recognise .
It 's one of those historical accidents that somehow become part of the national character
Simon Green
Aston Centre for Europe
The 18 - minute sketch , called Dinner For One , features a masterful comic performance by the late actor Freddie Frinton , who plays James , butler to an elderly upper- class English woman called Miss Sophie .
She is celebrating her 90th birthday by hosting a dinner for her close friends .
Because she has outlived them all , James impersonates each guest , getting more drunk with each toast .
Originally written in the 1920s , it was recorded in 1963 by a German television station , and has since become embedded in the country 's New Year ritual .
Simon Green , co-director of the Aston Centre for Europe , says : " He 's part of the ritual of New Year 's Eve , which is much bigger in Germany than in the UK .
" A lot of people watch it , like the Queen 's Speech in Britain .
In that sense , it 's a real element of German culture .
" It 's on in the early evening , at about six or seven o'clock , so people will watch it while they 're having a drink and before they have their dinner . "
James the butler gets more drunk as the sketch progresses
The reason why this programme has such appeal is a bit of a mystery , says Professor Green , although farce is popular in Germany and its appeal is helped by the fact that a good knowledge of English is not required ( it 's not dubbed ) .
" It 's one of those historical accidents that somehow become part of the national character .
It 's just chance that in September in Britain , there 's this fantastic evening of national sentiment , the Last Night of the Proms . "
Its catchphrase , " The same procedure as every year " , is often referred to in German culture .
The sketch has not been shown in the UK for 30 years , although it is still popular in Australia and Scandinavia .
Frinton found some belated fame in the UK in 1964 as a plumber in the sitcom Meet The Wife , but four years later he died suddenly , aged 59 , unaware of how famous he would become .
Return to link SPAIN - MICHAEL ROBINSON Liverpool supporters would remember Robinson
One of the biggest names in Spanish television , Robinson was for more than a decade the equivalent of Des Lynam .
But he was n't just the front man .
El Dia Despues ( The Day After ) , which dissects Spanish football , was written , directed and presented by him .
His foreign language fluency - uncharacteristic for an English footballer - certainly has n't harmed his ambitions to be big in Spain .
His Spanish adventure began in 1987 when he joined Osasuna following a playing career in England that bagged him a league championship and European Cup with Liverpool .
But the striking pair of Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish meant he was usually on the substitutes ' bench .
Although English - born , he was capped 24 times by the Republic of Ireland .
Return to link NEW ZEALAND - RAWDON CHRISTIE
After six years reporting and presenting on New Zealand television news , the London - born journalist and broadcaster has added another string to his bow as an entertainment host .
" Presenting Dragons '
Den was when a lot of people started stopping me in the street and recently I did a stint on the news breakfast programme , which means you get a totally different audience , " says Christie .
The face of Dragon 's Den " In the summer I fronted the six o'clock news , so that gave me another profile .
In the stable of news , I 'm probably the number four male presenter in the pecking order .
" I do n't mind being spotted , but it depends how I 'm approached .
Doing Dragons '
Den , people come up to me and give me a direct opinion on one of the dragons , and it's often quite a negative one , to which I answer ' Do n't shoot the messenger ' . "
Christie worked for the BBC's Look East before he moved to New Zealand , where he lives with his wife and three children .
Although settled in Auckland , a trip to Lord 's in London last month to watch Andrew Flintoff take five wickets in the Ashes had him dreaming of moving home again .
" I was watching the news and thinking : ' I 'd like to have a piece of that again ' , but this is a pretty wonderful place to bring up small children . "
Christie also used to front the Sunday morning political programme , Agenda , which is TVNZ 's equivalent of the BBC's Andrew Marr programme , and the half - hour primetime news programme , Close - Up. Return to link AFGHANISTAN - LATIF NANGARHARAY
A nation inspired by his voice
He works eight hours a day in the London Underground , making sure the trains run on time .
But Latif Nangarharay 's voice can be heard on radios on street market stalls in Kabul and his face glimpsed on television screens across Afghanistan .
His music has made him one of the most influential figures in Afghanistan , where his lyrics about peace and reconciliation , offer hope to a country wracked by 30 years of war .
Ten years ago , Mr Nangarharay fled the Taliban and settled in London , but his songs draw on the country 's history to send a personal message to fellow Afghans not to lose faith .

Born in east London to a Turkish Cypriot mother and an Antiguan father , Kazim - Richards began his football career 2,000 miles from Istanbul in Bury in 2004 .
Four years later , he scored against Chelsea and became a hero among the fanatical supporters of Fenerbahce .
In the same year , he was a member of Turkey 's Euro 2008 squad , playing in all five matches as the side reached the semi-finals .
" He has very good technical capacity and I 'm trying to give him confidence and strength , " said Zico , his former club manager and one of Brazil 's all - time great players .

When writer Paul Johnson , 81 , recently received the highest civilian medal in the US , from President George W Bush , he shared a stage with blues singer BB King , such is the lofty reputation he enjoys stateside .
Readers of the Spectator will know him well from his 28 years of writing for the magazine .
He also edited The New Statesman for five years in the 1960s , and later wrote columns in UK newspapers , including the Daily Mail .
But his Catholic conservativism has won him many admirers on the other side of the Atlantic , where he has written in The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Commentary , and the National Review .
Return to link TRINIDAD & TOBAGO - CHRIS BIRCHALL
The first white player in the Trinidad & Tobago side for 60 years , Chris Birchall cemented his hero status on the islands when he scored in the World Cup play - off in Bahrain in 2005 .
It helped propel the national team to their first World Cup and the supporters made up a rap song in his honour .
" The place has gone crazy , " he said at the time .
Birchall was eligible to play for Trinidad and Tobago because his grandparents moved to the islands to work and his mother , Jennifer , was born in Port of Spain .
He was selected when the team 's Dutch coach , Leo Beenhakker , learned of his eligiblity .
The Stafford - born midfielder was playing for Port Vale at the time , but the attention he drew during the World Cup - especially in the build - up to playing England in the group stages - helped him seal a move to Coventry .
He has now joined LA Galaxy and he replaced someone called David Beckham when he made his debut in May .
Return to link FRANCE - CHARLIE WINSTON
" If I never make it big in England it does n't matter , " says Winston , who has become an overnight sensation in France , where he has topped the single and album charts .
Winston has outsold Coldplay and U2 in France
The singer - songwriter and former busker recently played to 55,000 people at France 's biggest music festival , with the crowd singing along to every word .
His profile in France means he has to travel with a security team , but he could walk down any street in the UK quite freely , especially if he took off his trademark battered trilby .
He spent 10 years playing to tiny audiences in British pubs and clubs , but became fed up with the London music scene .
Rarely could a move abroad - to Paris at the end of 2008 - been better judged .
But music pundits think the days when Winston could walk the streets of London unnoticed are numbered .
A buzz about the 30 - year - old Cornishman is now starting to build on this side of the Channel .

The Rochdale - born musician has a career spanning more than 30 years and his political activism combined with his commercial success has made him a very significant figure in African music .
He says his band of black and white musicians , Juluka , broke the law by performing during the apartheid era , and annoyed the authorities with its mixture of Zulu and English influences .
The man nicknamed the " White Zulu " wrote election anthems for the ANC and performed at Nelson Mandela 's inauguration in 1994 .
He has enjoyed international success , with a Grammy nomination for his band Savuka , and a million - selling album in France .

President Barack Obama has defended his plans for health reform in a news conference broadcast live in the US .
Mr Obama pledged to push through a reform package by the end of the year that would reduce health costs , increase choice and widen coverage .
Congress is currently debating various proposals , and lawmakers are struggling to reach agreement .
Mr Obama said he now saw " broad agreement " on passing a reform , but a few issues still needed working out .
The president has made passing a healthcare reform bill the top priority of his first year in the White House .
In the past 10 days , he has embarked on an aggressive push to promote his plans , as members of Congress argue over the details of reform .
The BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington says this is the first big test of Mr Obama 's political strength and a measure of how far he is prepared to bend to achieve his agenda .
Any failure will be seen by his opponents as a major personal defeat , she says .
' Not a game '
In his opening remarks at Wednesday 's press conference , the president said Americans were looking to Congress for leadership .
" This debate is not a game , " he said .
" This is n't about me - I have great health insurance and so does every member of Congress . "
I 'm rushed because I get letters every day from families that are being clobbered by health care costs
US President Barack Obama Rather , he said , it was about ordinary Americans who had been forced to " shoulder the burden of a problem that Washington has failed to solve for decades . "
" We will pass reform that lowers cost , promotes choice and provides coverage that every American can count on , " he said .
" And we will do it this year . "
" I 'm rushed because I get letters every day from families that are being clobbered by health care costs , and they ask me can you help , " Mr Obama said .
HAVE YOUR SAY Obama will struggle because the US has had 75 odd years of anti-socialist propaganda to the point where an idea that might be described as socialist is automatically condemned Darkseid Jones
The president said he would not rule out any ideas proposed in Congress , except any proposal that was " primarily funded through taxing middle class families " .
He also said reshaping America 's health care system was crucial to helping the broader economy , and that any reform would reduce rather than add to the US deficit .
Talking about the general economy , Mr Obama said the US had been " on the verge of a complete financial meltdown " , but there was now " stabilisation " .
" We 've stepped away from the brink , " he said , adding that " things would be even worse " without the government 's financial bailout package .
Timetable risk
Five congressional committees are currently working on healthcare bills , and although there is consensus on some aspects of reform , lawmakers are divided on whether to set up a public health insurance scheme for Americans without employer - sponsored coverage .
There is also much disagreement about how to raise revenue to fund the proposed expansion of healthcare coverage .
HEALTHCARE IN THE US 47 million uninsured , 25 million under- insured Healthcare costs represent 16 % of GDP , almost twice OECD average Reform plans would require all Americans to get insurance Some propose public insurance option to compete with private insurers
Q&A : US healthcare reform US readers ' views on health reform Some 47 million Americans do not currently have health insurance , and rising healthcare costs are a major contributing factor to America 's spiralling budget deficit .
Mr Obama has called on both chambers of Congress to pass healthcare reform bills by the end of the first week in August , so he will be in a position to sign a final , combined , bill in October .
One Senate committee has passed a bill , and three House of Representatives committees have published a joint proposal .
Both of these bills would require all Americans to take out health insurance , and would provide subsidies to help make coverage affordable .
They would also give Americans without employer - provided coverage the option to join a public insurance scheme .

But the powerful Senate Finance Committee has yet to complete its version of the bill , amid calls from prominent moderate senators for a delay while a bipartisan compromise is reached .
The speaker of the House of Representatives , Democrat Nancy Pelosi , said on Wednesday that her party had the votes needed to pass the reform there .
" It will take some time , " she said .
" But we are going to do it right . "
House Republican Leader John Boehner called on Mr Obama to scrap the bill and start again " in a bipartisan way " .
" If they try to fix our healthcare system like they 've tried to rescue our economy , I think we 're in really , really big trouble , " he said .
Some opinion polls show that barely half of Americans now approve of the way Mr Obama is handling healthcare reform .
If the president 's timetable begins to slip , correspondents say his push for healthcare reform could be in jeopardy .

It Can Be So Much Worse Than Jimmy Carter ( 1 )
… or not .
About 20 years ago , I attended a summer program at RUTCOR ( the OR center at Rutgers ) called , I believe , ARIDAM ( Advanced Research Institute in Discrete Applied Mathematics ?
Something like that ) .
It was a great few weeks : I learned a lot and met a number of people for the first time who I know to this day .
If my memory holds , it was at that conference that we heard about work by a University of Guelph professor named Ted Swart that purported to prove that P=NP .
In his paper , Swart gave a n^5 variable ( or n^7 ) linear programming formulation for the hamiltonian path problem , along with a complicated case - by - case proof that this linear program had a solution if and only if the graph had a hamiltonian cycle .
I remember staying up two nights in a row working through this paper with people like Harvey Greenberg .
At the end , we identified a hole in the proof .
Swart changed things around a bit , and I lost track of where things went : I recall thinking that it was pretty clear that adding a subscript could get around any hole we found , but that any constant number of subscripts would leave ever - more - complicated holes in the proof .
I left it there .
If I had been brilliant , I might have asked the question whether you could prove that this type of formulation cannot work .
I ’m not that brilliant , but Mihalis Yannakakis is , and he proved shortly thereafter that any symmetric formulation for this problem requires exponential size .
Since then , it is stunning how often proofs that P=NP ( or P not equal to NP ) crop up .
Gerhard Woeginger does the field a tremendous service by collecting pointers to papers that try to prove the question one way or the other .
The rate of production for these sorts of results seems to be growing , with 10 papers in 2008 and 2009 .
I very much like Gerhard ’s obsessive neutrality in this .
It is always “ Professor X proves P=NP ” when I would be tempted to write “ Professor X claims to prove P=NP ” , or even “ Professor X has typed some stuff which only he thinks proves P=NP ” .
Having spent hours twenty years ago with one of these types of proofs , I do n’t feel an obligation to work through more of them .
There are always people out there who do work through things , and find the flaws .
The Geomblog has a nice parody of how the process goes , and that does match up nicely with my experience 20 years ago .
And this post is not an invitation to send me your proof of P=NP or P!=NP !
Despite the “ crankiness ” that comes from the P ( ! ) =NP papers , I do think good comes out of this work .
For instance , Swart ’s paper led to Yannikakis ’ very significant result .
And reviewing these papers ( once or twice , anyway ) is great training for doing referee work in our field .
Thanks to @hakmem whose tweet got me looking at these sites again .
Billions of dollars of aid are being invested in programmes to modernise Africa and end poverty .

This baby moose was in distress in a creek .
A man rescued him from the creek ; tried to find the mother & send him on his way , but eventually the moose stumbled back into the creek and had to be rescued again .
The baby moose followed the man home .
The man lives in a very small cabin so he took the moose to another neighbor and she took the baby moose in and took these photos .
The following day they took the moose to a woman who looks after wild animals & she put it in a pen with a rescued fawn where it is doing very well .

LIKE many people in his generation , Louie Psihoyos was a landlubber who grew up watching “ Flipper ” and Jacques Cousteau adventures on television .
After National Geographic magazine hired him straight out of college as a staff photographer , his admiration for the intelligence and beauty of dolphins , and for the oceans as an ecological system , grew as he learned how to dive and began to work underwater .
But none of that quite prepared him for the experience of making “ The Cove , ” an award - winning documentary about the clandestine slaughter of dolphins in Japan that opens July 31 .
The film is the first that Mr. Psihoyos  “ rhymes with sequoias , ” he said  has directed , and everything about it has been a challenge , from having to make the transition from still photography , to the subject matter itself , to the cloak - and - dagger techniques used to obtain images that range , as Mr. Psihoyos put it , “ from the heartbreakingly beautiful to the heartbreakingly sad . ”
“ The Cove , ” in other words , is an unconventional documentary , one that looks very much like a feature film , with the dramatic arcs and suspense one would expect in a James Bond or Hollywood action movie .
And because the film contains graphic images of the mass killing of a species of animal that humans regard fondly , with images as unsettling as those of baby seals being clubbed to death in Canada , it seems destined to generate an emotional and contentious debate .
Which is exactly what Mr. Psihoyos , 52 , had in mind when he began filming “ The Cove ” in 2005 .
“ What I set out to do was not so much make a movie as to create a movement , ” he said by telephone from his office in Boulder , Colo .
“ This movie is a tool to shut this thing down and end the barbarism we saw back there in that cove . ”
I ’m currently involved in the Tracker project and our project will be presented by Ivan Frade at the Desktop Summit this Sunday .
We merged our experimental branch tracker - store to master .
This means that our reachitecture plans for Tracker have mostly been implemented and are being pushed forward into the main development tree .
I will start with a comparison with Tracker ’s 0.6.x series .
Tracker master :
Uses SPARQL as query language
Uses Nepomuk for its base ontologies
Supports SPARQL Update
Supports aggregates COUNT , AVG , SUM , MIN and MAX in SPARQL
Operates for all its storage functionality as a separate binary
Operates all its indexing , crawling and monitoring functionalities in a separately packagable binary
Tracker 0.6.9 x :
Uses RDFQuery as query language
Has its own ontology
Has very limited support for storing your own data
Supports several aggregate functions in its query language
Operates for all its storage functionality in the indexer
Operates for all its query functionality in the permanent daemon
Does file monitoring and crawling in the permanent daemon
Operates all its indexing functionality in a separately packagable binary
Tracker master :
Architecture
The storage service uses the Nepomuk ontologies as schema .
It allows you to both query and insert or delete data .
The fs- miner finds , crawls and monitors file resources .
It also analyses those files and extracts the metadata .
It instructs the storage service to store the metadata .
External applications and other such miners are allowed to both query and insert using the storage service .
Priority is given to queries over stores .
Plugins that run in process of the application can push information into Tracker .
We indeed do n’t try to scan Evolution ’s cache formats , we have a plugin that gets it out of Evolution and into Tracker .
Storage service ’s API and IPC
The storage service gives priority to SELECT queries to ensure that apps in need of metadata get serviced quickly .
INSERT and DELETE calls get queued .
SELECT ones get executed immediately .
For apps that require consistency and / or insertion speed we provide a batch mode that has a commit barrier .
When the commit calls back you know that everything that came before it , is in a consistent shape .
We do n’t support full transactions with rollback .
The standard API operates over DBus .
This means while using it you are subject to DBus ’s performance limitations .
In SPARQL Update it is possible to group a lot of writes .
Due to DBus ’s latency overhead this is recommended when inserting larger sets of data .
We ’re experimenting with a custom IPC system , based on unix sockets , to get increased throughput for apps that want to put a lot of INSERTs onto our queue .
We provide a feature that signals on changes happening to certain types .
You can see this as a poor man ’s live search .
Full live search for SPARQL is fairly complicated .
Maybe in future we ’ll implement something like that .
Ontology
We support the majority of the Nepomuk base ontologies and our so called filesystem miners will store found metadata using Nepomuk ’s ontologies .
We support static custom ontologies right now .
This means that it ’s impossible to dynamically add a new ontology unless you reset the entire database first .
We ’re planning to support dynamically adding and removing ontologies .
The ontology format that we use is Turtle .
Backup and import
Right now we support loading data into our database using either SPARQL Update , an experimental unix - socket based IPC , and by passing us a Turtle file .
We currently have no support for making a backup .
Support for this is on priority planning .
It will write a Turtle file ( which can be loaded afterward ) .
Backup and import of ontology specific metadata
When we introduce support for custom ontologies it ’ll be useful for apps that provided their own custom ontology to get a backup of just the data that has relevance to said ontology .
We plan to provide a method to do that .
Volume support
Having a static custom ontology for volume support , volumes and their status is queryable over SPARQL .
File resources also get linked to said volumes .
This makes it possible to get the availability of a file resource .
For example : return metadata about all photos that are located on a specific camera , although the camera is n’t connected to this device .
Volume support is a work in progress at this moment .
The new head of the UK government 's official green watchdog has strongly criticised moves to build new coal - fired power stations in Britain and condemned the planned expansion of Heathrow .
In his first major interview since taking office , Will Day , the incoming chair of the Sustainable Development Commission ( SDC ) , told the Guardian that construction of new coal stations , such as the planned Eon Kingsnorth facility in Kent , would provide a " lightning rod " for international protest .
He dismissed industry and ministerial claims that new power stations such as Kingsnorth could be operated with limited impact on the environment by trapping and storing the carbon emissions underground .
" Never use the words ' clean coal ' , " he said .
" I do not believe clean coal exists . "
Day also said that :
• It was " not an appropriate time " to build a third runway at Heathrow .
• Flights must be made more expensive to discourage people from flying to foreign holidays .
• Politicians must make unpopular decisions to tackle global warming
Day stressed his views were personal and not those of the SDC , but their uncompromising tone is likely to reassure green campaigners .
Day , the former chief executive of relief and development group Care International , was appointed SDC chair following the departure of Jonathan Porritt , who was a regular and vocal critic of government efforts on the environment .
On new coal power stations , Day said : " Science is unequivocal about the impact of carbon on our environment .
Every time scientists go back to measure ice and water levels and those things it gets worse .
We should not be adding to that problem .
And when someone says " oh no , it will be carbon capture and storage ready " , well show me where it 's working , seriously working .
Show me how it 's going to be implemented on existing stock , let alone new stock . "
He added : " There is no such thing as a free lunch and we 're not going to get a free lunch around coal .
So my view would be if the government wants to provide a lightning rod for public disagreement or dissent around coal , then start building a new coal - fired power station , and the orang - utan costumes will be dusted off from around the planet and people will come and say this is wrong .
And two wrongs do n't make a right .
People say " oh there is one a week opening in China " .
And ?
I do n't think that 's a good enough reason . "
Day said he disagreed with Ed Miliband , climate and energy secretary , on whether mass air travel could be preserved in a low - carbon world .
Miliband told the Guardian last month : " Where I disagree with other people on aviation is if you did 80 % cuts across the board , as some people have called for on aviation , you would go back to 1974 levels of flying .
I do n't want to have a situation where only rich people can afford to fly . "
Day said : " Politicians are there to make the hard decisions .
And there are some really hard decisions coming up .
And they 're hard because they 're not the kind of decisions that individuals particularly want to have taken .
How many short - to medium - haul flight holidays does anyone really need to have a year ?
Ed Miliband interestingly said something like ' do n't worry your holiday flights are safe with me ' .
But we know that we need to be encouraging and supporting , through a combination of stick and carrot , some change to behaviours . "
He added : " Part of the difficult decision is going to be a rebalancing of what things cost .
If we say we must pay the true price of the impact of carbon on the environment .
The hard decision is do you price the impact of an aeroplane flying through the air properly , really properly , and not a kind of £ 1.20 carbon offset .
The objective is to reduce the amount of carbon put into the upper atmosphere by planes by pricing it out . "
He said : [ Flights ] will continue but there will be fewer of them , and they will be properly priced .
And people will be able to make decisions based on their decision to afford .
They 're not being told they cannot go on holiday , they are being told this is what it costs . "
Former Broncos running back Travis Henry walked into a Montana courtroom Wednesday facing a sentence of 10 years in prison with a $ 4 million fine .
He left the courtroom knowing that he could be released in 16 months and would not be fined .
“ We were very happy with the sentence and treatment that both the court and government showed throughout this process , ” Henry ’s attorney Harvey Steinberg said Wednesday in a phone interview from Billings , Mont .
Henry , 30 , was arrested last October for financing a drug ring that moved cocaine to Montana from Colorado .
Henry was caught with six kilos of cocaine by undercover agents and later pled guilty to a single count of trafficking cocaine .
Steinberg sought leniency for Henry by arguing his client turned to drug trafficking out of desperation after his release from the Broncos two months earlier .
U.S. District Judge Richard Cebull sentenced
Henry to three years in a Florida prison and another five years ’ probation .
Cebull also agreed that if Henry completes a 500 - hour drug treatment program while in prison , he would knock 12 months off his sentence .
Steinberg said with good behavior , Henry could get another four months subtracted from his sentence .
Henry was also credited with the two months he already has served in a Montana prison , meaning he has a chance to return to society in November 2010 .
Cebull waived the fine , saying Henry , who according to court documents has fathered 11 children by 10 women , could not afford it .
Henry was arrested by federal drug agents last October — just a few months after he was released by the Broncos one season into a four - year , $ 22.5 million contract .
He was cut after allegations of drug use and a perceived lack of commitment to the team .
Cebull said it was Henry ’s addiction to marijuana that destroyed his career and landed him in jail .
“ This is a unique case in that you ’re a unique individual .
You ’re a heck of a football player , ” Cebull said .
“ You are not unique in this sense : your drug habit . ”
Henry apologized to the court and said his criminal actions did not reflect his true self .
“ If given the chance , I want to tell kids around the world that using drugs and abusing drugs is n’t the way , ” he said .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thaggard argued for a sentence of at least 33 months .
“ Mr. Henry did have it all , in a sense , and he lost it .
That ’s unfortunate , ” Thaggard said .
“ The bottom line is this was a significant conspiracy to move a substantial quantity of drugs . ”

Contrary to the strawman arguments set up and knocked down so easily by people who believe that breaking the DarkPAN is a sin almost as bad as apparent hypocrisy on the Internet , no one wants to change Perl 5 willy - nilly .
Yet many people believe that a few carefully - planned backwards - incompatible changes will allow Perl 5 to evolve into a much more powerful , much cleaner , much more understandable , and even much simpler language suitable not only for maintaining legacy projects but also for creating amazing new projects .
I intended my deconstruction of fear surrounding Perl core language changes to continue a long - standing debate .
If you read Planet Perl Iron Man or Planet Perl , you 've read other people arguing over the desirability of supporting the DarkPAN .
If your code is part of the DarkPAN ( and it likely is n't , as you 're likely a part of the Perl community if you 're reading this ) , you may bristle at the suggestion that some people believe that retaining core language backwards compatibility to support your code is one of the worst ideas in Perl history .
( If you have n't heard that suggestion , let me repeat it : the idea that the Perl community should support hidden and proprietary code of people who are n't part of the community , code that the Perl community can't see let alone test , and code that may or may not even exist is sufficiently ridiculous on its face that it mocks itself . )
Now then .
My previous post suggested that the real problem the Perl community is trying to solve is one of risk management .
If it does n't make sense to push all of the costs to manage the risk that an upgrade might change the way your DarkPAN code behaves to the Perl community ( and it does n't make sense ) , who bears that cost ?
You do .
Do n't panic , yet .
It 's simple to address that risk .
I did n't say it 's easy .
I said it 's simple .
Your Responsibility as a DarkPAN Maintainer
As a DarkPAN maintainer , you need to answer several questions about your code .
Is this software worth maintaining ?
Is this software under active maintenance ?
Does this software need community support for the Perl core and any external dependencies ?
Will this software work unchanged with a newer version of Perl ?
If not , why not ?
What changes are necessary to make this software work with a newer version of Perl ?
Software outside of active maintenance can stay untouched .
Do n't worry about it .
( Of course , if you have to migrate to a new machine or a new architecture or other dependencies , it 's under active maintenance at least for the sake of this argument . )
The other questions are more important .
You need to be able to verify that your code will perform as you expect if you change one or more dependency .
Likely you already need to know this .
You need a comprehensive test suite which can run on any likely candidate machine .
You need a test environment where you can run your software 's test suite against an updated dependency -- a new CPAN distribution , for example , or a new major release of Perl .
You need unambiguous results and comprehensible diagnostics .
In short , you need a sane development environment , just like any serious project worth your time already has .
( You should also have a ten minute build , but if you can verify that your software does what you expect in an hour or less and report the results to the Perl community , you 're well on your way . )
If you 're really good , you can even test your DarkPAN code against bleadperl or maintenance snapshots just to help p5 p understand your expectations ( and to understand potential changes to the language which may require you to revise your expectations , if not your code ) .
Anyone serious about software development should have a comprehensive and useful test suite anyway .
It 's simple .
It 's not always easy ; the Perl community needs to make CPAN distribution installation and versioning easier and cleaner .
That debate is happening .
The solution is n't obvious yet , but a process of iteration and refinement will produce it .
Yet any DarkPAN code of such low importance that its maintainers can't produce a test suite to verify that it works is n't worth p5 p 's time .
Forget that code .
It 's a dead end .
Let 's concentrate instead on refining a language for serious software developers to write new code worth maintaining .

You ’ve probably seen the ads .
Ominous voice - overs warn you about how health care reform “ could put a bureaucrat in charge of your medical decisions , not you . ”
A massive bulldozer with “ government - run insurance plan ” written on the side crushes your health care “ choices . ”
Canadians and Britons relay horror stories of their experiences dealing with health care in those nightmarish socialist dystopias .
The ads are the product of a multimillion - dollar ad campaign designed to derail health care reform — especially what ’s been dubbed the “ public option , ” which would set up a government - run plan to compete with private insurers .
The man behind this ad blitz is the person who might be Public Option Enemy No. 1 : one - time hospital executive and longtime Republican donor Richard Scott .
Back in March , Scott spent $ 5 million of his own money to set up a nonprofit called Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights .
The group aims to be the command center for the right ’s fight against Democratic reform efforts .
With the major interest groups — including hospital companies , pharmaceutical companies , and doctors — that have opposed reform in the past holding their fire this year in order to have a seat at the legislative table , Scott ’s group has filled the anti-reform void .
According to an estimate reported by the Associated Press , around $ 15 million has already been spent on ads favoring the Democrats ’ plan , and $ 4 million has been spent to oppose it .
Much of that $ 4 million has come from Scott and CPR , and he ’s claimed his group will spend as much as $ 20 million .
Scott is n’t foolish enough to say he opposes reform outright .
Instead , his group says it wants to promote health care reform that focuses on “ choice ” ( of doctors ) , “ competition ” ( between private insurers ) , “ accountability ” ( standardized insurance claim forms and tax reform ) , and “ personal responsibility ” ( of patients ) .
Not everyone thinks that ’s real change .
“ What Rick Scott is doing is talking about protecting the status quo , which is bankrupting businesses and bankrupting families , ” says Peter Harbage , a fellow at the Center for American Progress , which supports the public option .
With so many groups — from the hospital industry to the pharmaceutical industry to Wal - Mart — coming together in support of reform , “ it ’s disappointing that [ Scott ] does n’t want to be a constructive part of the conversation , ” Harbage says .
Rep. Jerry Nadler , a New York Democrat , was more blunt : “ Rick Scott pushing health care reform is like Bernie Madoff attempting to regulate the financial industry , ” he told Mother Jones .
Scott certainly is an odd spokesman for the right ’s health care agenda .
The giant hospital company Scott led in the 1980s and 1990s , Columbia / HCA , was the subject of a seven - year federal investigation .
The probe concluded with the company pleading guilty to 14 felony counts of criminal misconduct and paying $ 1.7 billion to settle civil charges relating to overbilling of state and federal governments — the largest settlement of its kind in American history .
Scott , claiming ignorance of what was going on , was booted by his own board in 1997 and received a $ 10 million golden parachute with $ 300 million in stock options for his troubles .
Scott says that his critique of the public option is predicated on his detailed knowledge of the health care industry .
But Stephen Meagher , a lawyer who handled some of the first suits against HCA , points out that Scott ’s expertise is not a straightforward matter .
“ He says , ‘ I was never accused of any wrongdoing , ’ which is technically correct — but his company was accused of tremendous wrongdoing , ” Meagher says .
“ He claims vast experience ” in the health care field “ but no knowledge of his own company . ”
Scott does n’t seem eager to remind visitors to CPR ’s website of his past .
Not surprisingly , the “ Fast Facts about Richard L. Scott ” section contains no mention of the HCA fraud scandal , though it does highlight the fact that HCA “ became the world ’s largest private health care provider ” and was named “ one of the 50 best performing companies of the S&P 500 ” by BusinessWeek .
The bio does mention Scott ’s current venture , a company called Solantic , which “ provides urgent care services , immunizations and other services at 23 locations ” — including some in Wal - Mart stores — ” across Florida . ”
What it does n’t explain is that Solantic makes a lot of its money by catering to the uninsured — giving Scott a direct financial interest in preventing the expansion of health insurance to all Americans .
Eric Burns , the president of liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America , says Scott ’s advocacy is having an impact .
“ Scott is spending an enormous amount of money to influence the debate over health care reform .
He ’s essentially cornered the market on providing false and misleading information on the health care reform debate . ”
Some of Scott ’s ads focus on nightmarish tales of government - run health care in places like Canada and Britain , but President Obama has n’t proposed going to a Canadian - style single - payer system .
And it is not just Media Matters that has criticized the ads — the Annenberg Center ’s FactCheck.org also found the group ’s ad “ very misleading . ”
To disseminate its message , CPR has hired the same public relations company that handled the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
The firm , CRC Public Relations , did not respond to questions for Scott submitted by Mother Jones .
But Burns says CPR ’s ties to CRC are no coincidence .
“ CPR is essentially the conservative Swift Boat operation for the health care reform debate , ” Burns says .
The media have certainly aided Scott ’s efforts to dodge his history and his conflicts of interest .
CNN and Fox News , among others , have interviewed Scott without questioning him about HCA or his new company ’s dependence on the uninsured .
Jacki Schechner , a spokeswoman for Health Care for America Now , which supports the public option , says Scott is a “ nuisance , ” but not an obstacle .
“ He has a long and sordid history , ” she says , adding that his past may actually help pro-public - option advocates .
“ For us he ’s a great face of opposition because he ’s such a shady guy . ”
CPR talks up “ competition , ” but it ’s opposed to forcing private insurers to compete with a government - run plan .
That could be because government - run insurance in other countries has proven to be vastly cheaper and often better than the system of private insurance America relies on .
In the US , there are efficiently run public health care plans : Medicare ’s administrative costs are a fraction of those of the private plans , and Veterans Affairs provides some of the most effective health care in the world to a population that is older and sicker than the general public , Meagher argues .
“ It ’s kind of difficult for me to believe someone who is so ideologically committed to competition and is at the same time worried about competition from a public program , ” he says .
It ’s all about protecting the health care industry ’s bottom line , says Nadler .
“ Scott and his ilk are dead wrong in their opposition to the public option and are particularly suspect in their motivations .
The health care industry does n’t see kids with colds ; they see dollar signs . ”
Scott may be fighting a losing battle .
Most polls show that the public option is very popular , and this week Sen.
Harry Reid , the majority leader , encouraged Sen .
Max Baucus to stop seeking GOP votes on the health care legislation he ’s writing and move forward with a bill with a public option .
The writing ’s on the wall , says Roger Hickey , the codirector of the Campaign for America ’s Future .
“ The public loves the idea that if we get reform , it ’s not just going to be the Rick Scotts of the world that control the health care system , ” Hickey says .
“ It turns out the public loves what he ’s trying to vilify . ”
Right now , the Blue Dog Democrats are on the Energy and Commerce Committee , holding up the passage of health care reform in the House .
This is their list of ransom demands as they 're holding the public option hostage with a gun aimed at the rest of us .
This is what it really is -- about protecting insurance companies in their districts , not their constituents .
We 're going to need you to be making phone calls today to the Democratic leadership , to Speaker Pelosi , to the three committee Chairmen , the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee , and yes , to the White House letting them know what the Blue Dogs are asking are UNACCEPTABLE for us Americans .
We must n't allow them to kill the public option , cut back subsidies for the middle - class , have state - based co-ops , and state - based insurance exchanges .
That would cut down the effectiveness of this bill , and the Blue Dogs know it .
Here are the talking points below :
I 'm calling to thank [ Name of Member ] for supporting the House health care plan , and for supporting the public option and the national insurance exchange .
As an American who 's faced denials of claims and has been facing higher insurance premiums , the public option and the national insurance exchange is NECESSARY to hold down the costs of private insurance and give us the kind of care we need .
Please DO NOT vote for any amendments during the mark - up process that would weaken the public option and the national insurance exchange !
I 've been hearing that the Blue Dog Democrats want to cut back subsidies for my family , that they want a fake state - based co-op plan , and have a trigger on the national insurance exchange by having it as state - based insurance exchanges at first .
What they want is unacceptable for me and my family .
Do n't give into their demands .
I 'm an American who needs the choice of the national insurance exchange and the public option .
CALL Speaker Nancy Pelosi at ( 202 ) 225-4965 and try her local office at ( 415 ) 556-4862 if you can't get through .
CALL House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer at ( 202 ) 225-3130 CALL
House Majority Whip James Clyburn at ( 202 ) 226-3210
Can you please CALL these THREE chairmen in the House of Representatives , with your concerns about the Blue Dog Democrats trying to block health care reform and ask them NOT to listen to the Blue Dogs or give into their demandsl ?
And DON'T FORGET TO CALL THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE with the talking points above .
Also , do n't forget to call the co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and ask them to take a strong stand against the Blue Dogs ' actions by asking the House leadership not to give into their demands to weaken the health care reform bill , and especially the Medicare - like public option in the bill .
CALL Rep . Raul Grijalva , co-chair of the CPC , at 202-225-2435
CALL Rep. Lynn Woolsey , co-chair of the CPC , at 202-225-5161
And do n't forget to CRACK THE WHIP on the rest of the Congressional Progressive Caucus so they stand as a strong voting bloc in opposition to the Blue Dog Democrats !
Right now , we really need you to CALL the White House with the talking points and tell them that the Blue Dog Democrats must UPHOLD the majority view of Americans who need a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , and not to give into their demands to weaken the public option in health care reform !
CALL The White House at 202-456-1111 and E -MAIL THEM with the talking points above , and ask for Congress to stay and work on health care reform instead of going off on vacation !
Can you also please help nyceve , Jane Hamsher , me , and others in this fight for health reform by donating ?
We 're spending day and night in this fight for you all .
Please RECOMMEND this diary so others can see the phone numbers and call today !
Also , let me know how the calls are going today !
Please report back if you can .
ISO / Ansi Standards , Copyright and SQL July 4 , 2009
Imagine the perfect ISO / Ansi standard for a programming language .
It would be concise , precise , 100 % correct and writen in a formal language .
Imagine constructing software that would implement a parser for the programming langauge .
You could simply open the standard at page one and mechanically translate it to your favorite programming language .
One could even construct a computer program to automate the translation from standard into working parser code .
In fact , using a computer program to translate the standard would be best , as it would minimize work and minimize the chance of errors .
Except … except that ISO / Ansi standards are copyrighted and a translation would make your implementation a derivative work , at least as I read the law US Code Title 17 :
A “ derivative work ” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works , such as a translation , musical arrangement , dramatization , fictionalization , motion picture version , sound recording , art reproduction , abridgment , condensation , or any other form in which a work may be recast , transformed , or adapted .
A work consisting of editorial revisions , annotations , elaborations , or other modifications which , as a whole , represent an original work of authorship , is a “ derivative work ” .
( the bold - font is my own )
So what is the point of having a technology standard , if implementors cannot use it , because it is copyrighted ?
Some may argue , that no standard is perfect and large parts of standards are described as English prose , as opposed to formal language .
So my assumption is invalid and therefore my argument is invalid too .
Well true , no standard is perfect , but parts of many standards are written in a concise , precise and formal language .
And the formal part could be translated ( automatically ) to a working implementation .
Except when the formal part is copyrighted …
Others may argue , that standard organizations too have expenses , and thus they need to charge for their standards .
Again true , but what is the point of the standard in the first place , if one cannot use the standard directly to construct technology ?
Second , everything do not have to be free of charge .
The informal English prose could be copyrighted .
And the standards organization could include a license explicitly granting the right to translate the English prose into a working implementation and leave the formal part in the public domain .
Third , they could look for other streams of revenue , like certifying software and individuals .
I am not a lawyer , and thus I am hopeful , that I misunderstand the law or that I overlooking some crucial detail .
Please comment if I am .
Other comments are also welcome .
You may wonder , why the rant ?
I recently considered implementing a SQL parser and considered translating the formal ( BNF ) part of the ISO / Ansi SQL standard automatically , but this let me to consider copyright , which let me to this post .
@font - face — what it is exactly ?
B @font - face is a CSS rule implemented in Firefox 's latest 3.5 browser release .
It allows web designers to reference fonts not installed on end user machines .
( NOTE : John Daggett has written a lovely primer article on @font - face .
It serves as a fine reference into the nitty gritty of @font - face implementation and usage . )
Fine typography has always been one of the stumbling points of web design .
Limited at most to a handful of cross - platform specific fonts , web designers have often found it necessary to hack their way into typographically nuanced territory .
Technologies such as sIFR and Cufon utilize Flash and Javascript techniques to achieve typographic variety , but often at the expense of clumsy technological implementation .
@font - face brings with it the hope of a standard , cross-platform , cross - browser , lightweight method for referencing font - files not found on end users ' computer .
In other words : it allows web designers to store fonts on their server and reference them in CSS , regardless of what fonts the user browsing the page has installed .
Trying to bring taste and skill into a branch of artistic endeavor which had sunk to the lowest possible depths .
Achieving nuanced type with @font - face
D By focusing on the true basics of typography : font - size , line - height , font - variant , column width , and letter - spacing , one can create truly stunning effects using @font - face .
Here 's a list of universally available , fundamental CSS properties upon which great typography can be constructed :
CSS :  text - decoration ( overline / underline )
text - decoration ( overline / underline )  font - size
font - size  font - variant ( small - caps )
font - variant ( small - caps )  text - transform ( uppercase / lowercase )
text - transform ( uppercase / lowercase )  letter - spacing
letter - spacing  font - weight CSS Pseudo Elements :  : first-line
: first - line  : first - letter
This demo page uses these CSS properties in combination with smart @font - face choices to create a nuanced layout .
Some combinations and tricks we find particularly useful include :
Small caps
When applying small - caps via the font - variant property , it 's often more visually appealing to also apply text - transform : lowercase or uppercase to the block .
This ensures uniform visual weight independent of who or what generates the text .
Also , depending on the font in question , you should take time to track the letter - spacing out an appropriate amount .
first - line Pseudo Element
Using small - caps on the first line of a new section is a fairly classic typographic standard .
The above small - caps notes work great in combination with the first - line pseudo selector .
Text Decoration
CSS offers the ability to overline or underline text using the text - decoration property .
Unfortunately there 's no control over the distance between the text and the decoration .
The CSS border attribute allows for more control while achieving a similar decorative result .
When you use border in combination with padding , you can control precisely how close the visual effect is to your text .
By mixing a well - considered selection of fonts with the above CSS properties and thoughtful semantic markup , you can achieve beautiful , nuanced results .
Nothing exceeds like excess .
Most of all it's about taste and restraint .
Great typography is built on choosing the right family of typefaces for the job .

A study of 4,000 “ eco-friendly ” consumer products found on supermarket shelves found that 98 percent of them make false or misleading claims .
The study , presented to Congress earlier this month by the environmental consulting firm TerraChoice , found rampant greenwashing in every product category .
Twenty - two percent of the products it evaluated featured an environmental badge , or “ green label , ” that was actually meaningless .
Congress is now debating better ways clamp down on greenwashing .
The Federal Trade Comission , which is supposed to prevent the practice , has taken almost no enforcement action against greenwashers over the past decade .
Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) is contemplating introducing a bill that would boost federal oversight of eco-marketing , including product lablels .
While one third of conumers rely on labels to decide if a product is environmentally friendly , there is a confusing jumble of 300 competing environmental certification programs that bombards them with competing and misleading claims .
UPDATE : Check out the interview I did on the subject with Green Patriot Radio .
Triage technology comes with a Star Trek twist , at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ’s Science & Technology Directorate ( DHS S&T ) .
Determining who needs medical care at the scene of a disaster is still pretty old - fashioned : emergency responders bent over a victim , checking body temperature , heart rate , and muscle movement .
Up close and personal , the entire process can take 3 - 5 minutes per person .
“ Human nature is to pay attention to those who are screaming and bleeding , but someone with a less obvious internal injury may be the real top priority , ” said Greg Price , Director of S&T ’s Tech Solutions , whose office is managing a new DHS S&T project .
“ In the case of large - scale triage , it is not always the squeaky wheel that needs the grease , ” he says .
In partnership with the Technical Support Working Group ( TSWG ) , Boeing and Washington University ’s School of Medicine in St. Louis , S&T ’s Tech Solutions group is developing the Standoff Patient Triage Tool ( SPTT ) , a device that classic Star Trek fans will recognize for its resemblance to the medical diagnostic tool known as the tricorder .
Because time is the most precious resource in a crisis , every second shaved can be a life - saver .
With this in mind , S&T wants to make a revolutionary leap forward in triage .
Why not 30 seconds per person ?
And why not from a distance ?
" We thought , ‘ Wow , would n’t it be nice if a responder , fully clothed in an emergency suit , could have a technology to take vital signs quickly from 5 to 40 feet away ? ’ ” said Price .
Like the tricorder , SPTT takes key physiological readings necessary to any diagnosis — pulse , body temperature , and respiration .
It ’s triage at twenty paces .
The magic behind SPTT is a technology known as Laser Doppler Vibrometry , which has been used in aircraft and automotive components , acoustic speakers , radar technology , and landmine detection .
When connected to a camera , the vibrometer can measure the velocity and displacement of vibrating objects .
An algorithm then converts those data points into measurements emergency medical responders can use in their rapid assessment of a patient ’s critical medical conditions .
With the help of Washington University , researchers have found that best place to capture strong readings vital signs is on the carotid artery , although strong signals have been obtained from the head , chest , abdomen , even a foot .
Researchers are also testing whether readings could be taken when someone is lying in an awkward position , or wearing multiple layers of clothing .
So far , the results are encouraging .
Despite its promise , the SPTT is not quite as a sophisticated as StarTrek ’s tricorder , which was able to comprehensively diagnose obscure diseases .
The standoff patient triage tool is a quantum leap forward for medical response , but science fiction remains on the big screen for the moment .
The goal is to develop a handheld unit about the size of a legal notebook and as a thick as a ream of paper .
Achieving this will require hardening of the unit , and further testing of optical stabilization technology to make sure the unit can function despite a responder ’s arm and hand movements .
Transition and commercialization could occur sometime mid to late 2010 .
The final frontier for the SPTT , of course , is the first responders themselves .
S&T ’s Tech Solutions wants to put working prototypes in the hands of medical teams this fall for extensive field tests .
From there , everyone is hoping for warp speed ahead .
Laptops are closing the price gap on less - powerful netbooks , with retailers delivering fully equipped systems for under US$ 300 as part of promotional offers .
Wal - Mart will start offering limited quantities of a fully loaded Compaq laptop for $ 298 starting July 26 , according to an entry on Wal - Mart 's Checkoutblog site .
The laptop being offered is a Compaq Presario CQ60 - 419 WM from Hewlett - Packard , which is powered by Advanced Micro Devices ' Sempron SI - 42 processor running at 2.1GHz .
The laptop comes with Windows Vista and includes a 15.6 - inch screen , 3GB of RAM , a 160GB hard drive and Nvidia 's GeForce 8200 M integrated graphics .
It also includes a DVD - RW drive , according to specifications provided by HP .
For such a low price , the laptop is packed with features and could run out of stock quickly .
" We expect this one will be quite popular , " wrote a Wal - Mart official going by the name of Ryan in the blog entry .
Wal - Mart did n't clarify whether the offering would be in - store or online , and the retailer did n't immediately return requests for comment .
The offer follows a move earlier this week by Best Buy to offer an Acer laptop with a 15.6 - inch screen for $ 299 .
The offer was later pulled after Best Buy ran out of stock , according to a report in CNET .
The laptop was powered by a single - core AMD Athlon 64 running at 2.0GHz and ran Windows Vista .
The laptop also included 2GB of RAM and a 160 GB hard drive .
By comparison , the cheapest netbook on Wal - Mart 's online store is available for $ 238 and is less powerful than the Compaq laptop .
The Asus Eee PC900HD includes an 8.9 - inch screen and runs on an Intel Atom N270 at 1.6GHz .
It includes 512MB of RAM and a 160GB hard drive and comes with Windows XP .
Mainstream laptop prices have dipped under the $ 300 mark just a few times , including in 2007 , when Toshiba offered a laptop for $ 299 .
Most of the mainstream laptops listed on Wal - Mart 's site today are priced over $ 350 .
Wal - Mart also plans to add a " very cool Acer laptop " with an eight - hour battery life over the next few days , according to the company .
It also plans to add a HP netbook .

Liberty is the essential public - trust .
Justice is the essential public responsibility .
Liberty is self - governance self arrest of harm .
Justice is arresting harm when threatened and restoring persons to whole when harm has already occurred .
Congruence requires that Liberty and Justice be universal .
Rights are the boundaries of behavior by which Liberty and Justice are measured and realized .
Rights are enumerated proscriptions of behavior which are valid when derivable from the Liberty Principle the supreme moral law .
This and only this is the moral basis for establishment of a moral society and the governmental institutions within a moral society .
The motto of a moral society is Liberty and Justice for All .
Orarchy was coined by Sidis to mean a government founded on the Liberty principle .
Unfortunately Sidis thought experiment on drafting a Constitution was a synthesis of socialism and libertarianism .
As brilliant as he was , this was written before WWI , before the reality of the flaws in socialism had been made manifest , before economic science discovered that the fatal flaw in command economies is information deprivation as well as being a violation of moral law .
Democracy is inherently flawed as a moral principle or as a basis on which to establish government .
When you must decide , and you know you don t know , it is philosophy which determines your decision .
Democracy is a tool for decision making under conditions of uncertainty but it is by nature ungoverned by a rational moral philosophy .
The wishful thinking by those who have faith in democracy , is that the demos IS governed by a rational moral philosophy .
History and an understanding of the current demos shows that we have not yet enculturated a rational moral philosophy .
Thus at best , if a democratic method is to be employed , it should be strictly limited to decision making on issues of short term consequence .
The best system for making collective decisions is a coercion free market .
To the extent fraud can also be arrested in a market it is bettered .
Reply :--
The second paragraph is the only problem here .
Sidis 's constitutions were written well after he had abandoned any interest in Soviet socialism ( see , e.g. , Eichel 's Bio , Social Continuity ) .
Also , the word " orarchy " was not coined by Sidis .
It can be found in some 19th Century dictionaries and means " limited government . "
I wish the writer would send me his name so that I might read more written by him .
His thoughts are brilliant and I think Sidis would agree with much of what he says .

絶賛発売中の日 経Linux最新8月号では， 「 特集1：ついに実現 Linuxで作る地デジ録画サーバー」と題してLinuxで地上デジタル放送を視聴・録画するための手順を徹底紹介している。
記事では ，Linuxで動作させられる（もちろんハックが必要）代表的なデジタル・チューナを使い，Fedora 10や最新のUbuntu9.04で家電顔負けの安定性と便利さを備えた録画サーバーを構築する手順などを解説。USB型チューナさえ用意すればすぐに録画環境を構築できる「簡単導入キット」やオリジナルの録画サーバー・ソフトなども付録DVDに収録しているので，興味のある人はぜひお近くの書店で手にとってみていただきたい。
こうし たLinuxにおける地デジ録画の世界の大きな扉を開くきっかけとなった製品の1つに，アースソフトのデジタル放送波受信ボード「PT1」がある（現在は生産終了）。このPT1のLinux用ドライバ（オープンソース）を作ったのが「石川
智明」氏だ。同氏が開発したドライバは，その後も有志によって改良され続け，関連ソフトウエアも含めてLinuxにおける地デジ視聴・録画分野で欠かせない存在になっている。
惜しまれつつも生産終了となったPT1だが，復活を求める多数の声に押される形で，2009年9月（予定）に「PT2」として復活することが決定している（詳細は8月8日発売の日経Linux9月号で紹介）。そこで，今回は特集公開とPT2発売を記念して，石川氏自らにドライバ開発の経緯などをつづってもらったレポートをここに掲載する。仮想化ソフトをバス・アナライザ代わりに使う話など，この手のハードウエアに興味を持っている人ならとても面白く読めること請け合いである（注：記事内容は，原稿執筆時である2009年春時点の情報に基づいています。一部内容は日経Linux4月号に掲載したものです）。
Say what you will about cookie - cutter culture , IKEA offers affordable furniture that does n’t smell like the 1970’s .
When enjoying your favorite book , it ’s important to be seated properly — or at least in a way that compliments your reading experience .
Here is a guide to what to read , and in what chairs .
—
I .
This is a really expensive leather couch , ideal for books which reflect the opulent lifestyle , like American Psycho and The Great Gatsby .
We learn in literature that money is not good , like all the bad people are rich and all the good people are poor .
I do n’t think this is a healthy attitude — now there ’s some artistic nobility to being unemployed .
I know I ’m not your dad , but “ get a job . ”
If I were the guy in American Psycho , I would not “ freak out ” ( murder , crying into voicemail , etc. ) and just keep my kick - ass job and eat good filet mignon at lunch and have sex with a lot of models .
—
II .
This chair is perfect for either 19th century books authored by women , or books written by homosexual men .
We recommend Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen , Little Women by Louisa May Alcott , Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte , Howard ’s End by E.M. Forster , An Awkward Age by Henry James , Vile Bodies by Evelyn Waugh , and Light Boxes by Shane Jones ( j / k ) .
It ’s funny ( sad ? ) how people still make fun of others by calling them gay .
One time , out of curiosity , I fellated a cucumber to see if I had good technique and suddenly wanted a salad .
Enough gay talk , we all know literature is not gay ( cough ) .
—
III .
This fold - out couch is recommended for intense reading experiences which require reads into the night .
These books are often called “ tombs , ” and generally read by neurotic and / or depressed men .
Typical books of this nature are War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy , Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann , Gravity ’s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon , The Recognitions by William Gaddis , Infinite Jest by D.F. Wallace , Europe Central by William Vollman , and 2666 by Robert Bolano .
When your eyes and brain ca n’t take it anymore , simply use your book as a pillow by inserting your nose into the spine .
The next morning , you will feel 0.02 % smarter .
—
IV .
This is a futurist looking chair which will compliment books about our future : Brave New World , 1984 ( um , that ’s ages ago , but still ) , Fahrenheit 451 , The Road , etc .
All books about the future are dystopian because nobody wants to read a predicable book about the future .
Imagine a book called “ 2010 ” about a guy who goes to work everyday and drinks other people ’s sodas in the fridge and drafts stories veiled in Microsoft Outlook as work - related emails , and craps as much as he can at work in order to deplete toilet paper , to “ get back ” at his employers for the low salary .
That book would be boring , right ?
( Any publishers interested please email me . )

V .
I was surprised to see this third - world type “ lame chair ” in IKEA ’s catalog , but literature has always embraced ventures into the east and west .
When straining your back on this “ lame chair , ” you ’d do well to try out The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles , A Passage to India by E.M. Forster , Waiting for the Barbarians by J.M Coetzee , Life of Pi by Yann Martel , and What is the What by Dave Eggers .
These books all deal with transcultural immersion and “ outward experience ” ; too bad the chairs are sometimes lame .
—
VI .
This chair comes with Jonathan Franzen .
Some important notes while assembling this chair : make sure you do it correctly the first time , no mistakes .
If you screw up , Johathan Franzen will publish an article in The New Yorker about how people in America are dumb , using you as an example .
He also might mention how he had this girlfriend who was a mechanical engineering grad student at MIT and how he made coffee in the morning , and how contemporary their relationship was , hanging out betwixt Cambridge and New York City .
Also , you ’ll make his day if you ask him to read from The Corrections to you .
You ’ll need to sit on his lap , and no — that ’s not a mechanical pencil — he ’s just happy to read to you .
—
This concludes our Book Lover ’s Guide to IKEA seating .
Remember , literature is a civilized sport ; please read responsibly .
And to our readers in Sweden , trevlig trä !

8 Ways to Help Senior Adults Stay Safe Online

Torture instigators George Bush and Dick Cheney should not be allowed to evade prosecution on grounds they acted in good faith on their lawyers ’ advice because they told their lawyers what advice to give , a law school dean says .
“ Could Al Capone or ‘ Lucky ’ Luciana receive immunity for acting in accordance with the advice of counsel when they told counsel what to advise ? ” asks Lawrence Velvel of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover .
“ ( Vice - President ) Cheney and ( President ) Bush knew that they were ordering violations of law , ” Velvel points out .
“ The fact that they were doing so , and were well aware they were doing so , was one of the reasons why they , like a significant number of CIA officials who knew the same , demanded that lawyers produce legal cover for them in the form of Office of Legal Counsel memos authored by the likes of ( John ) Yoo and ( Steven ) Bradbury . ”
Lower level CIA and military personnel that did not read the supposedly exculpatory memos , Velvel said , also cannot claim reliance on legal counsel because “ they had to know that torture was forbidden no matter what some lawyers said .
You could not grow up in America and not know this ” any more than a person could claim murder was lawful because some lawyer told him so , Velvel writes .
“ People who grew up in America cannot realistically claim that they thought it was lawful to beat people mercilessly , to smash their heads against walls , to kill about one hundred of them apparently , to hang them from ceiling hooks , to make them freeze , to deny them sleep for weeks on end , and so forth , ” Velvel writes in an essay in his new book “ America 2008 ” from Doukathsan Press .
“ They knew what they were doing was wrong , ” he continued .
“ FBI …guys on the scene knew it regardless of what lawyers like Yoo said , and it was knowledge that what they were doing was wrong that caused some lower level CIA guys too to want a ‘ get out of jail free card , ’ ” Velvel writes .
“ That realization is why CIA officials , from 2002 to 2006 or 2007 demanded memoranda from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice , falsely claiming that the abuse and torture were not criminal acts , ” Velvel said .
“ The officials wanted these OLC memos so that they could later avoid or defeat prosecutions by claiming that the decision - making office of the DOJ had approved the legality of what they were doing .
The officials wanted a ‘ golden shield , ’ ” he added .
Those who claim they were ordered to torture , like those who said they had a legal opinion that to do so was okay , are guilty of an effort to “ escape the Nuremberg principles by saying that others said what the culprits were doing was okay , ” Velvel continues .
The Nuremberg tribunal that judged accused Nazi war criminals after World War Two concluded they could not evade guilt by asserting they were only following orders .
“ But claiming that their actions were immune because others okayed them is precisely what Cheney , Bush , their whole crowd … have been attempting to do …
They knew what they were doing was illegal , as evidenced by the extreme secrecy they practiced lest it be learned they were practicing , and lest they be accused of practicing , the crimes they were in fact practicing .
Morality , decency , and Nuremberg alike forbid this . ”
“ By now it seems beyond serious doubt that George Bush and company committed numerous war crimes , ” Velvel wrote .
“ It is evident that if these things can be done , then there is an end of law where the truly wealthy and powerful are concerned .
Whether it is Al Capone or Dick Cheney , the filthy rich or obscenely powerful will have it in their power to do the most awful things yet escape the law by using contributions or power to obtain immunity from preexisting law and to buy the opinions of immoral lawyers .
That is the moral and philosophical basis why these things ca n’t be permitted , ” Velvel said .
Velvel is dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , founded in 1988 for the express purpose of providing a quality , affordable legal education to minority students , immigrants and students from low - income backgrounds who would otherwise not be able to afford law school .
Tuition at the school is only about half that charged by other New England area law schools .
Velvel has been honored for his contributions to legal education reform by the National Law Journal and has also received a number of awards from the book publishing industry for his essays .

ll Patriarch of Ethiopia : " The world will know the Ark of the "
Roma , 17 giu .
( Adnkronos ) - Soon the world will admire the Ark of the described in the Bible as the container of the Tables of the Law which God gave to Moses and the center , over the centuries , of research and studies .
He said in an interview exclusive video all 'ADNKRONOS , Ign visible on the site , tested on - line site Adnkronos ( www.adnkronos.com), the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia Abuna Pauolos , in these days in Italy for ' G8 of Religions ' , and that tomorrow will meet Pope Benedict XVI for the first time and to which , " if you ask - continued the Patriarch - tell the whole of part of the current situation . "
" The Ark of - reaffirms Pauolos - is in Ethiopia for many centuries .
Patriarca
As I saw with my own eyes and only a few very qualified people have been able to do the same , so far . "
According to the patriarch is kept in a church , but to defend the authentic copy of a religious symbol and ' been placed in every church in the country .
The official announcement that the Etopia give the world the keys to the secret part of the millennium , will be given next Friday during a press conference at the Hotel Aldrovandi 14 Rome from the Orthodox Patriarch of Ethiopia , along with Prince Aklile Berhan Makonnen Haile Selassie , and the Duke Amedeo D'Aosta , which will be in Rome tomorrow morning .
According to some studies , the Ark was stolen from Jerusalem by the son of King Solomon and brought to Axum , regarded as the Jerusalem of Ethiopia .
It will rise to Axum Museum named to host the Ark , whose project was funded by the Foundation of the prince , heir - designate to the throne by Haile Selassie before he died , Crhijecllu , acronym of the initials of the names of the children of Prince Christian , Jessica , Clarissa , Lucrezia .
A few weeks ago had been shown around the world the news that would have been seen by a journalist in the Ark authentic Ethiopian church .
It 'was then that the Patriarch has gained Pauolos the decision to " say once and for all the world the truth ' " on the wooden crate and gold with the Tables of the Law of God The Patriarch has judged the time ripe to close permanently chapter in which up to now no history , no research , no ' Indiana Jones ' , was able to write the word order .
The Patriarch of the ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Church has wanted to be at his side in this adventure , the grandson of the Negus , head of an important family , whose role is recognized both in Ethiopia and abroad .
Prince heir who two years ago managed to reconcile the Christian and Muslim factions at the center in Ethiopia for a hard contrast .
It 'started the countdown to finally unveil the mystery of the sacred Ark of the Covenant , capable , according to legend , to release bursts of divine light and lightning can incinerate anyone who was affected , as is effectively described in the cult movie ' I lost part of the predators ' .
From the fiction film will now be transferred to reality .
Friday press conference with the official announcement , an event was possible thanks to the collaboration of Paul Salerno , collaborator of Prince and the journalist Antonio Parisi , who for several years following the historical events of royal families and the Ethiopian in particular , and of course part of the Alliance .
What is the Ark of the Covenant , one of the greatest mysteries of antiquity on which fantasy , legend and history have continued to interlacing for centuries ?
The Ark , in Jewish tradition , contained the Tables of the Law , ie the Ten Commandments , and the artefact , acacia wood , was built by Moses .
Outside decorations were gold and has long been kept by the Jewish people : it has accompanied its vicissitudes , the battles and defeats , the wanderings and struggles against the Philistines and was kept in various places until the King David is not l 'was placed in the fortress of Jerusalem .
But it is Solomon , son and successor of David , to put the Ark in the Temple of Jerusalem which he himself had built .
This story then interwoven with historical events and other religious and national traditions .
In fact , the Ark of the disappeared in 586 BC with the conquest of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the consequent destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem .
However it can be ruined , there is no written testimony , since the Ark becomes a symbol eternally searched by the men and found in various parts of the world , from Africa to the Middle East .
Ethiopian tradition places the Ark in the kingdom of Axum , after Solomon had given to the son of the Queen of Sheba , Menelik I .
Here , it remained over the centuries protected by Orthodox monks in the city ' in the holy of Lalibela to Axum , where would be today .
The Ark , which is not visible to anybody except a monaco that the guards , is preserved in the complex of the cathedral of Saint Mary of Zion , and ' therefore hidden to all and is carried in procession once a year but wrapped in a cloth .
The Ark has access to the imagination of archaeologists , writers , religious groups , seven of every kind .
In fact , tradition states that it adopts a particular power but also that those who were touched fulminates .
An object that given its location - the Temple of Jerusalem - has been from time to time in the middle of stories related to Masonry or Templars .
However , it should be remembered that there are many churches in Ethiopia and in which ' kept un ' ' ' arca ' ' , as well as other scholars - often moving at the edge of mystery and legend - the place in various parts of the world .

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Fla . 
As the space shuttle Endeavour lifted off into orbit Wednesday evening , several pieces of debris fell off the external fuel tank , and at least one hit the orbiter .
Astronauts in space and engineers on the ground will spend the next few days examining and analyzing the damage to see if it might pose a danger to the shuttle on re-entry .
The shuttle Columbia disintegrated in 2003 , killing the seven astronauts on board , because of damage to its wing caused by falling foam during liftoff .
The countdown Wednesday proceeded without major glitches , and the weather finally cooperated , with the skies clear after showers early in the afternoon .

Oh , yeah , they are your favorite cartoon characters .
But not as you are used to seeing them on cartoon network or Disney channel , these are cartoon characters in 3D .
This is what they would look like if they were real and walking around your neighborhood .
Some look really funny , others look a bit scary and it is obvious they should stay in their 2D world instead of 3D .
I do n’t think that a lot of children would n’t like Popeye looking like he does in 3 D at all .
On the other hand Calvin & Hobbes or Johnny Bravo look kind of cool rendered in a 3D world .

Hate Poem
I hate you truly .
Truly I do .
Everything about me hates everything about you .
The flick of my wrist hates you .
The way I hold my pencil hates you .
The sound made by my tiniest bones were they trapped in the jaws of a moray eel hates you .
Each corpuscle singing in its capillary hates you .
Look out !
Fore !
I hate you .
The blue - green jewel of sock lint I ’m digging from under my third toenail , left foot , hates you .
The history of this keychain hates you .
My sigh in the background as you explain relational databases hates you .
The goldfish of my genius hates you .
My aorta hates you .
Also my ancestors .
A closed window is both a closed window and an obvious symbol of how I hate you .
My voice curt as a hairshirt : hate .
My hesitation when you invite me for a drive : hate .
My pleasant “ good morning ” : hate .
You know how when I ’m sleepy I nuzzle my head under your arm ?
Hate .
The whites of my target - eyes articulate hate .
My wit practices it .
My breasts relaxing in their holster from morning to night hate you .
Layers of hate , a parfait .
Hours after our latest row , brandishing the sharp glee of hate , I dissect you cell by cell , so that I might hate each one individually and at leisure .
My lungs , duplicitous twins , expand with the utter validity of my hate , which can never have enough of you , Breathlessly , like two idealists in a broken submarine .

Solution to XKCD Velociraptors Problem # 2
Original Comic :
Introduction : After introducing my housemates to the wonderful webcomic XKCD , we discovered a quite interesting puzzle in the comic titled " Substitute . "
I have reproduced it on the right side of this page .
Problem one is fairly simple , and has already been solved on the XKCD forums .
From a quick browsing of the XKCD forums , there 's been some half - hearted discussion , but no analytic or numeric solution so far .
My housemates and I decided to take on problem number two .
Solution Method :
We created a numeric simulation of this situation in Java .
We choose Java because it 's easy to work with , and we were all pretty experienced with it .
All our source code has been released under the GPL , so feel free to modify and redistribute our code .
Assumptions :
We had to make some assumptions about the problem , and we also consulted with Mr. Munroe ( The creator of XKCD ) for further clarifications .
The human will run radially outward in a straight line .
This will allow us to characterize a run path with just the angle of the run .
The velociraptors need to be very close ( 10 cm ) to your position to eat you .
The eating distance really only slightly affects the survival time
The human has infinite acceleration to 6 m/s .
This really would only effect the time slightly .
The shape of the solution would not change significantly .
The velociraptors can turn any angle at any velocity .
This has a large effect on the solution , and was only implemented after consulting with the author , who said , " I actually remember seeing some research saying that Utahraptor may have sacrificed some speed in favor of quick turning ability , so there 's some justification for that one .
So I would say you let them turn as fast as they want , but they always run toward your current position ( in reality , raptors are far more cunning than this ) . "
We have placed the acceleration limit on the straight - line acceleration , but allowed the raptors to always turn towards the target , regardless of velocity .
More Solution Information :
Since the only characteristic of a human 's behavior is the angle at which he runs , and the only measure of success is survival time , we have a relatively simple task , to maximize survival time by changing the angle .
Since evolutionary algorithms are fun , and amusingly appropriate to this problem , we created a method for a human to ' reproduce ' by undergoing mitosis , and introducing mutation to the run angle at this time .
Mutation Details :
We initially start the simulation with 8 runners , facing E , NE , N , NW , W , SW , S , SE .
We then take these eight ' parents ' , and mutate them 10 times , to produce 80 new runners .
These 80 are the first generation .
They are placed into the simulation , individually , and run until they get eaten .
When all 80 have been evaluated , we take the 8 runners that survived the longest , mutate 10 children off each of those , which produces the 80 runners of the next generation .
We keep track of the best time and best runner for each generation , and when we have gone 15 generations with no improvement , we end the trials .
Visualization of Results : Getting a single number out of a simulation is n't very believable , so we started dumping run data into a comma split file ( CSV ) , for later analysis .
We wrote a visualization application that could read those output CSV files , and provide graphical feedback .
Here are two screen - shots , one standard , and one with ' trails ' , which show where each object came from .
These images are from the same simulation run , and from the same point in time , at 2.08 seconds .
Video Results :
If pretty pictures were n't enough , I ( automatically ) prepared a screen - shot from each of the 309 steps of this simulation run , and created a video of both with and without trails .
Click on the screen - shot to see the associated video .
Hopefully the videos work for your computer .
The were created with mencoder from a series of PNG images .
I think I created an mpeg4 video , so please let me know if the video does n't work for you .
Really , the videos are n't important , just kind of amusing .
Results :
As someone noted in the forums , there are actually two ' solutions ' , symmetric about the vertical axis .
In our simulation , we found angles of 0.5694 and 2.5724 radians , or 32°37 ' 27 " and 147°23 ' 15 " gave the same results , a survival time of approximately 3.1 seconds .
In other words , the solutions were ( Pi/2 ) ±1.0015 radians , or 90°±57.3877° .
It 's interesting to notice how the runner 's angle seems to be closer to the injured raptor , until the very end , when the quicker raptor catches up , and they eat the human at the same time .
Also interesting , is that the injured raptor 's velocity limitation does n't become a factor until approximately 2.5 seconds into the simulation , when all raptors have accelerated up to 10 m/ s.
After 2.5 seconds , the injured raptor is limited to 10 m/s .
At the end of the simulation , the healthy raptors are only going about 12.3 m/s , less than half of their maximum velocity .

Mr Taylor , of Eye , said : " It is just laughable really .
It is health and safety gone through the roof .
Nearly four years ago we set up a coffee morning at Eye Library after the librarian at the time came up with the idea , and since then about seven of us have been going there every Tuesday .
As some of you may have heard , ESPN reporter Erin Andrews was the victim of a horrible crime .
Some nut made a peep hole in her hotel room and shot video of her in the nude .
That 's disgusting enough , but then Rupert Murdoch 's NY Post published photos of her that were blurred out as the pervert tried to sell them to other news agencies .
Sexy ESPN sportscaster Erin Andrews was the target of a peephole pervert who surreptitiously shot a video of her walking around her hotel room naked -- and posted it on the Internet .
The sideline siren wants the creepy cameraman brought to justice , both for herself and to keep other victims from having to go through the same nightmare .
Andrews ' lawyer , Marshall B. Grossman , confirmed yesterday she was " surreptitiously videotaped " while " in the privacy of her hotel room . "
" Although the perpetrators of this criminal act have not yet been identified , when they are identified , she intends to bring both civil and criminal charges against them and against anyone who has published the material , " Grossman said .
In the video , Andrews is seen primping her hair and putting on her makeup ...
I know the Post is a rag , but this is a low blow even for them .
Yes , she is very attractive and the nation is full of voyeurs , but FOX News employs dozens of beautiful reporters on all of their shows .
Would they be publishing nekkid shots of them on their pages ?
Nope .
And they should n't .
Once again a woman is victimized by the media .
ESPN responded to the NY Post by banning their reporters that regularly appear on ESPN .
ESPN banned staffers from the New York Post from appearing on any of its programming on Wednesday after the newspaper published photos this week taken from a video showing sideline reporter Erin Andrews nude in a hotel room .
The Post published three images from the blurry video Tuesday .
" While we understand the Post 's decision to cover this as a news story , their running photos obtained in such a fashion went well beyond the boundaries of common decency in the interest of sensationalism , " ESPN senior vice president of communications Chris LaPlaca said in a statement Wednesday night .
Newspaper reporters are regular guests on ESPN shows .
The NY Post responded by calling them Mickey Mouse :
The New York Post declined to comment on Thursday on ESPN 's decision to ban the newspaper 's reporters from appearing on its outlets , but it fired back with an item on its gossip page calling ESPN a " Mickey Mouse sports network . "
The item accused the network itself of being the first to identify ESPN reporter Erin Andrews as the woman in an illicitly recorded video that became an Internet sensation .
There was no mention of the Post 's decision to publish images from the video Tuesday , which infuriated ESPN .
Very mature response by the Post .
I cover the sports media on the pages of C&L because a lot of the same garbage that goes on with the beltway Villagers happens in the journalism of the sports world .
I 'll have an ESPN cover up a little later on something completely different .
Super StarDust HD has a rich history .
The popular series started life back in 1993 as StarDust on the Amiga computer system by Commodore .
A year later Super StarDust was born with some enhancements .
While state of the art for the time , the older series resembled Asteroids more then the HD incarnation .
Recently , developer Housemarque mentioned on their website the possibly more updates coming to Super StarDust HD .
The developer even goes as far to include their email address in the event you had any feedback for them .
Looking back , throughout the whole experience of developing Super Stardust HD , even with its success and critical acclaim the most important thing for us has been the personal feedback we ’ve received from fans of the game from all corners of this planet .
We ’d like to thank you for all your kind words , emails and support .
Although we ’ve recently been busy with our current PlayStation 3 project , we still keep thinking of doing some updates for Super Stardust HD in the future .
There is at least one specific idea that would certainly add a new dimension to the game !
If you have any thoughts , you can let us know what you ’d like to see added to the Super Stardust HD experience ; just email us at [ email protected ]
Housemarque does mention they have one specific idea that would add a new dimension to the game .
The hints provided by Housemarque make it sound like the game will go 3D to some degree .
Does this mean they will add the warp tunnels gameplay sequence as in previous installments ?

David Broder in the Washington ( Republican Propaganda ) Post :
The saga of South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and his Argentine romance has been such ripe fodder for the gossip mills that the essential governmental question has almost been forgotten .
Whether Sanford can resolve the mess he has made of his personal life is of little concern to anyone but the people involved .
But when he disappeared for five days , telling no one in his administration or even his security detail where he had gone , he did something totally irresponsible .
Had any kind of emergency occurred , South Carolina would have been leaderless .
At the moment Sanford abandoned his duties in secret pursuit of private pleasure , he in effect tendered his resignation .
The Legislature should insist he follow through on it .

The immigrant evaded the notice of the immigration officers
An illegal immigrant managed to smuggle himself into the UK by hanging on underneath a coach full of Border Agency officers returning from France .
Despite the driver carrying out checks , the man squeezed into a space next to the fuel tank , evaded capture and ran off when they arrived in Folkestone .
The Home Office is now conducting a full investigation .
It says the case is further evidence of extreme and dangerous measures some people will take to enter the UK .
Gave chase
Before setting off from Coquelles near Calais with coach of immigration officers , the driver - who is not an employee of the Border Agency - carried out the usual checks to make sure there were no stowaways .
But unbeknown to him - and the immigration officers onboard - a man had managed to get underneath the coach and squeeze himself into a small space next to the fuel tank .
He remained there during the journey through the Channel Tunnel .
The driver gave chase when he ran off in Folkestone , but failed to catch him .
For those with a below - par grin , one of an array of smile - boosting messages will op up on the computer screen ranging from " you still look too serious " to " lift up your mouth corners " , according to the Mainichi Daily News .
On the afternoon of June 15th , I bumped into my old friend Reza at the huge demonstration on Azadi Street — the march that nobody will ever forget .
He was with his wife , Hengameh , his arm raised , giving the “ V ” sign for victory and shouting , “ Death to the dictator ! ”
Then he saw me .
His eyes widened and we kissed on both cheeks .
“ How many ? ” he asked breathlessly , before answering himself .
“ A million , I ’d say . ” I had last seen Reza a few months before , in the small office where he runs a modest trading business .
He had looked pale and tired , and was complaining about money problems .
But now was different .
He shone .
“ Come to dinner tomorrow night , ” he called , and then we were separated .
According to a police official who was quoted in the Western press , a million or more people took part in the Azadi Street march .
Later , I asked a person close to the rally organizers how many people there were , and he told me that he thought the figure was closer to two million .
It was , he said , the biggest protest Iran had seen since the 1979 revolution , which overthrew the Shah .
From where Reza and I stood , half a mile from the western end of Azadi Street , where it enters Azadi Square , a thick belt of humanity stretched eastward seemingly without end .
Although the rally was illegal , there was no sign of riot police or Basij militiamen .
In an Islamic republic that regards large , unsanctioned gatherings as a threat , the marchers were smiling with the joy of being in one happy , unhindered mass — a pleasurable feeling , utterly unfamiliar .
On June 14th , two days after the election that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is alleged to have stolen from his main challenger , the reformist Mir-Hossein Moussavi , I hurried back to Iran from a trip abroad .
The next day , the day of the Azadi Street march , I had lunch with a journalist friend .
In view of the election fiasco and the coverage that it had received abroad , my friend told me , the authorities were now trying to curtail the activities of the Western media .
“ If you want to write for a foreign magazine , ” he said , “ do it without a byline . ”
The authorities were refusing to extend the visas of most visiting foreign journalists ; several Iranian journalists had been thrown in jail .
I had come to Azadi Street to lose myself in a crowd bedecked in green — Moussavi ’s color and , not coincidentally , Islam’s .
I had also come to try to work out what sort of Iranian had voted for Moussavi .
According to the caricature sketched by his opponents during the campaign , Moussavi was backed by a coalition of radical counter - revolutionaries and their minions , who include some misguided students and pampered , Westernized hedonists from the well - heeled neighborhoods of north Tehran .
The supporters of Ahmadinejad , by contrast , were said to be poor and virtuous , and to hold a monopoly on patriotism .
The President has referred to Moussavi supporters as “ chaff . ”
And yet , contrary to the caricature , the demonstrators around me represented an impressive cross-section of Iranian society .
The crowd in Azadi Street was dominated by young people , and many of the girls wore the regulation black maghna ’eh , or hooded cloak , that they wear in class .
There were also elderly men and women , and families whose dress and appearance suggested that they had come from modest precincts of Tehran or the provinces .
I saw a friend who has a government job .
She had left work early , along with ten of her colleagues , and with the permission of her supervisor .
We passed a government office building where employees were leaning out the windows , waving .
I do n’t think much work got done in Tehran on June 15th .
A little farther on , I found myself once again near Reza and Hengameh .
( I ’ve changed their names . )
Reza , who has a thick beard , and Hengameh , in a chador , have an old - fashioned “ revolutionary ” appearance .
They do not look like the sort of people who would attend an unsanctioned rally against the regime .
But there were plenty of marchers who looked like them — pious , middle - aged Iranians .
This is the generation that took part in the 1979 revolution , and then , as in the case of Reza , fought in the long war against Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , and , finally , grew tired of all the lies .
I have known Reza and Hengameh for a decade .
I know that they are unfailingly loyal to the memory of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic , but not to the current generation of leaders , who , with their love of power and their financial corruption , have , they believe , spoiled Iran .
In addition , everything I have seen of Reza and Hengameh tells me that they are true democrats — for example , the relaxed way they have brought up their teen - age son , Mohsen .
“ We never obliged him to say his prayers or observe the Ramadan fast , ” Reza told me once , “ and now he does both , of his own accord . ”
Iranians can draw on a rich culture of resistance to authority , going back to the country ’s first experiments with constitutional rule , a hundred years ago , and this , combined with their celebrated verbal dexterity , makes them naturals in the art of political verse .
As we passed the Employment Ministry , the marchers improvised a chant : “ Ministry of Employment , why so much unemployment ? ”
We passed under a pedestrian bridge , from which dozens of people were watching the marchers .
Then came another chant : “ You wo n’t win freedom of thought by standing on a bridge ! ”
My favorite slogan was one that referred to Ahmadinejad ’s notorious claim , caught on film and subsequently made public , that he had been crowned by a “ celestial halo ” while addressing the United Nations General Assembly , in 2005 : “ He saw the celestial halo , but he did n’t see our votes . ”
Standing on a balcony overlooking Azadi Street , a man held a copy of the Koran above the heads of the marchers .
The march broke up peacefully , at around seven .
Reza was surprised ; he had expected the street to be full of police .
He wondered why the Basijis had n’t attacked the protesters .
“ Maybe they ’re laying the groundwork for a concession , ” Hengameh said hopefully , alluding to Moussavi ’s demand that the election results be annulled and a new vote held .
If the afternoon of June 15th was hope , the evening was despair .
Seven protesters were killed during a clash with Basijis who fired on them from their barracks north of Azadi Street .
Around the city , there was fighting between Basijis and pro-Moussavi demonstrators who had set fire to trash carts and buses .
Drivers sounding their horns in support of Moussavi were dragged out of their cars and beaten , and the Basijis damaged and looted houses where they suspected Moussavi supporters had taken sanctuary .
My wife ’s parents ’ cook , I found out the following day , spent half the night searching the streets for her son ; he had gone out to defy the Basijis and got home at five in the morning , having spent the previous three hours hiding in the house of a stranger .
From my apartment window , in north Tehran , I watched two Basijis , unable to catch a group of fleeing Moussavi supporters , use their truncheons to smash the windshields of every car parked on our street .
“ Let me see what my mother wants — aside from attention . ”

Shopping
We had been wrong to be optimistic .
Did the authorities mean to keep the peace at the rallies that Moussavi ’s supporters had vowed to hold , every day , until the election results were annulled , and to attack people at night , after they had dispersed ?
In extraordinary times , one rapidly gets used to new arrangements .
Since June 14th , the people of Tehran have grown accustomed to attending to their daily business in the mornings , when the traffic circulates normally and the Basijis are asleep or at prayer , and planning their afternoons around either joining or avoiding the scheduled protest .
At lunchtime , worried parents begin calling their children , entreating them to come home or go to a friend ’s house before things get “ busy . ”
The children assure their mothers that this is exactly what they plan to do , and then they go and join the march .
In the course of the afternoon , contact gets harder .
The cell - phone networks seize up and the Internet performs even more sluggishly than usual , while the government tries to jam all foreign TV stations — in particular , the BBC ’s Persian - language channel .
This channel , beaming images and reports sent by normal Iranian citizens back into the country , has been hugely influential in spreading news of the protests to Iranians who would otherwise have relied on state television or the inferior American - based Persian - language channels .
On the afternoon of June 16th , I rented a motorbike with a driver and went to the second pro-Moussavi march , on Tehran ’s main north - south artery .
Again , the crowd was huge , if less easily quantifiable than it had been the previous day .
Many people wore black , and the march was conducted largely in silence , out of respect for the people who had been killed the night before .
I saw a marcher holding up a large photograph of one of the dead men .
The dead man had a bloodied chest and lay cradled in another man ’s arms .
Many of the marchers had gathered around and were taking snapshots of the photograph with their cell phones ; those cell - phone images soon circulated around the world .
At seven , the streets were still calm .
I left to go to Reza and Hengameh ’s house , in Yussefabad .
Yussefabad is a traditional middle - class neighborhood in the center of Tehran .
Reza ’s apartment block , he told me as we went up in the elevator , is occupied mostly by native Tehranis , not migrants from the provinces .
Reza used to live in eastern Tehran , but he likes Yussefabad better .
“ It ’s a proper neighborhood , ” he said .
By that , he meant that it is clean and friendly , with all the shops you need , and a strong family ethos .
We sat on the small balcony of Reza and Hengameh ’s flat , and ate peaches and plums .
Our friendship began when Reza and I met and discovered that we shared an interest in Persian literature ; the relationship soon came to include our families .
Hengameh is a superb cook and tolerant of her husband ’s indifferent entrepreneurial record .
I had always found her a reserved person , but tonight she seemed markedly less demure .
The unrest was agitating people , causing them to lower their guard .
She called Ahmadinejad “ Ahmadi geda , ” which means “ beggar Ahmadi , ” and laughed wickedly .
A change had also come over Mohsen , their son .
The last time we met , he had been a typical teen - ager , sulky and monosyllabic .
Now Mohsen seemed fully grown , an adult , and he participated enthusiastically in our conversation , which inevitably revolved around politics and the marches .
Mohsen had been active in Yussefabad on behalf of the local Moussavi campaign , standing on street corners and handing out leaflets .
He had also run the Basiji gantlet , and had the bruises on his knees to prove it .
“ Are you sure the election was a fraud ? ” I asked him .
Mohsen smiled ruefully .
“ Some of the boys from the campaign headquarters were at the local count , and when they came back that evening they were laughing and saying it was all over — Ahmadinejad had no chance .
Then . . . ”
Mohsen shrugged , and his father said , “ You should have seen this neighborhood .
There was hardly a single Ahmadinejad poster .
Only green .
Only green !
Of course it was a fraud .
They stole the vote . ”
Mohsen brought out glasses of tea on a tray .
As we drank the tea , we discussed the deaths of the previous night , and Reza shook his head sadly .
“ The idea of a Basiji shooting a fellow Iranian ! ” he said .
“ When I was a Basiji , all we wanted to do was kill Iraqis .
The idea of killing an Iranian would n’t have entered my head ! ”
Ever since I ’d known Reza , he ’d made a point of not having a satellite dish on his roof .
He distrusted the foreign television channels , and was content to watch Iranian state TV .
During the recent election campaign , however , as state television praised Ahmadinejad endlessly , he had found it difficult to watch ; it made him feel physically sick .
He bought a satellite dish , so that the family can now watch the BBC ’s Persian channel — or , at least , when it is n’t jammed .
“ It has shown us that everything we have been watching here , most of our lives , is full of lies , ” he said .
“ Give me an example , ” I said , and he replied , “ You know what they said on TV about yesterday ’s march ?
They could hardly pretend it never happened , because it was all over the foreign channels and the Internet .
So they announced that the rally had been organized by all four Presidential candidates , including Ahmadinejad , in the name of national unity ! ”
Dr. Geoffrey Thyne is no Ward Churchill .
He ’s a geologist and an academic with three decades of field work and experience as a research scientist in the oil and gas industry , including the last 13 years at Colorado School of Mines in Golden .
Thyne said in an interview that he was caught completely off - guard in late May when his bosses at the 135 - year - old school threatened to fire him for comments he made to reporters on hydraulic fracturing — an increasingly controversial but equally common practice of injecting natural gas wells with high - pressure water , sand and chemicals to force open rock formations and free up gas .
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette , a Denver Democrat , is co-sponsoring legislation that would remove a Safe Drinking Water Act exemption for the process , also known as “ fracking , ” that was put in place by the Bush administration in 2005 .
Oil and gas industry trade groups have mounted a massive — and expensive — campaign to fight DeGette ’s bill and maintain the exemption , which no other extractive industry enjoys .
Thyne said he was threatened with termination as a research associate professor at Mines , a position he still holds through the end of the summer , because of pressure put on the state school by powerful players in the oil and gas industry who were upset with his position that federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing may ultimately be necessary if oil companies do n’t find other solutions .
“ I was shocked , ” Thyne said .
“ It ’s fine to call up and complain .
It ’s fine to call up and say , ‘ Hey , we want an explanation of why you said this . ’
I think that ’s totally reasonable .
What I found so interesting is no one ’s ever called me , except my bosses , and they just come in and go , ‘ Your ass is going to get fired if we can find a way to do it . ’ ”
As it turns out , a position came open as a senior research scientist at the Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute at the University of Wyoming , and so Thyne is transitioning there by the end of the summer .
But he clearly was rattled with the fallout from comments he made to both National Public Radio and Denver ’s KUSA Channel 9 TV in late May .
“ There ’s some really powerful people that are making a lot of money off of this , and when they see any kind of opposition , their response is to pick up the phone and say , ‘ Fire this guy , ’ ” Thyne said .
“ I ’m first surprised that a state institution can be influenced that way … ”
Colorado School of Mines public relations officials did not return a call requesting comment Thursday .
Late Thursday afternoon a spokeswoman provided an e-mail response ( see related blog item ) .
Thyne contends there needs to be much more rigorous study of fracking to determine the extent to which it can contaminate groundwater supplies .
Industry money currently being poured into the aggressive and highly defensive campaign to defeat DeGette ’s legislation would be better spent building a credible scientific case for why the exemption was necessary in the first place , he adds .
Industry officials claim state regulation of the practice is more than adequate and that the chemicals used in fracking need to be kept secret for competitive purposes .
They also argue that in 60 years of fracking there has never been a case directly linking it to the contamination of drinking water wells because so many precautions are taken .
But Thyne is currently being employed as an independent consultant by Garfield County to study a case near Silt in which a property owner claims fracking contributed to an ongoing gas seep in Divide Creek .
Thyne ’s report on those claims may be discussed at a meeting next week of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , which dismissed the claims .
Working for the consulting company he founded , Science Based Solutions , Thyne has conducted other studies for Garfield County that showed elevated levels of methane in groundwater since the most recent drilling boom began in 2000 .
Thyne says the West Divide Creek seep in 2004 resulted from a bad cement job by EnCana Oil and Gas , which was fined a record amount of more than $ 370,000 by the COGCC , and had nothing to do with fracking .
But at the same time he was asked as a professor at Mines to conduct an unfunded review of a 2004 EPA study of fracking for the Oil and Gas Accountability Project .
Thyne was not as convinced as the EPA that the fracking exemption is justified by current data , and he wants to see far more study on the topic because it has taken off so much in the last decade .
“ You want to know those things because now that we ’re employing this technology broadly we ’re hearing about problems , ” Thyne said .
“ Not many , but a few .
And if we ’re going to employ it even more broadly , and particularly into residential areas , it ’s just the prudent thing to do is be sure . ”

The Forest School helps to tackle the urban " nature deficit "
How many three year olds would n't want to get muddy by jumping in a puddle ?
Or how many would n't want to roll down a hill ?
But if an inner-city child is not introduced to a natural environment in early life , they may miss out on such activities , or even be scared to try them .
Deep in woodland in Roehampton , south west London , a group of three and four year olds are now accustomed to picking up bugs , traipsing through woods and getting dirty .
Their nursery - Eastwood Centre - is part of the Forest School movement , which provides school sessions out in the natural world around their home .
Katherine Milchem is the Forest School co-ordinator at Eastwood , and says some of the children needed encouragement at first .
" Some kids were petrified of getting dirty and muddy in the beginning . "
" I 've heard it spoken about as a ' nature deficit ' in their lives . "
Toads
The forest session begins by getting dressed in red boiler suits and luminous jackets for visibility .
The staff lead them into the woodland in Froegel Park , part of the Roehampton University site .
Each child is given a " bug bubble "
There , the children are reminded of how they must respect the surroundings .
" If we pick all the flowers , none of the animals will have their food , " says Emily .
With a little prompting , she remembers that bees and butterflies might be affected if flowers are removed .
There are activities for the children when they arrive at a suitable spot in the woodland , which can be adapted according to what the children feel like on the day .
This session sees the children taking an interest in animals and any plans for arts or crafts are left for another day .
But not before they have found some muddy puddles to jump around in .
Some children are still a little reluctant .
One does n't want to jump in the puddle in case she kills a baby toad she saw in a puddle last time .
Several children take up the idea and go looking for baby toads - and the rest follow suit .
Katherine Milchem captures two toads and puts them in a bucket for the children to inspect , and one has the task of keeping them safe for the rest of the trip .
' Confident ' Forest Schools are beginning to increase their presence in urban areas , having been used in rural areas across Britain since the 1990s .
The idea was originally developed in 1995 by educationalists at Bridgewater College in Somerset , who drew on the Scandinavian model of Nature Kindergartens , and still train most Forest School leaders .
Forest Schools can now be found in Birmingham , and several south London boroughs , as well as 20 other regions in England , Scotland and Wales .
Children get a chance to find about wildlife Eastwood Nursery centre took on the Forest School idea in 2006 and Katherine Milchem says it has benefited children of all ages and stages of development .
The local area has some deprived estates , and the London borough of Wandsworth has a relatively high level of obesity .
A considerable number of the children at the centre have special needs such as language delay , or autistic spectrum disorder .
Three - year - old Alisha is now beginning to say a few words in front of other children but still talks more freely at home , according to her parents who joined in the session .
Her mother Davina says today has been a good day - Alisha 's mixing in .
" She 's becoming more confident and is learning a lot , " Davina says .
" For example she 's been learning about the different seasons because the children have been going out for quite a while now , " adds father Ian .
" And that 's not necessarily the type of thing we would have talked about at home , " says Davina .
Children gain confidence from their experience of nature Parents enjoy themselves too - though one big , burly dad in the group cannot bear to touch any beetles or bugs , leaving this to his three - year - old daughter .
It is not hard to see why some of these city children are also a little timid around nature at first .
" It 's important to introduce natural spaces for play and learning in childhood so that this can be continued into adulthood , " says Katherine Milchem .
However , it is not just about learning the names of beetles and bugs or trees , she says , but about emotional development , confidence , empathy and getting on with others .
" There 's some research to back up the idea that children who learn to care for animals are more likely to take responsibility for themselves in adult life .
" And they learn to assess risk too - what they can and cannot do , " she says .
The staff , led by Katherine , have had the children using hack saws and secateurs , working with wood from the local elder trees and building a house in which to collect insects and learn more about the local habitat .
On the way home , Emily wants to carry the toads , but before she is allowed , Katherine asks her to explain why they must be put back where they were found .
" How will they feel if we do n't take them back to their house ? "
" They might hop away ... " replies Emily .
" And they might be sad . "

Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe , from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you 're out or at home .
A chat with Saul Rubinek , Saul Rubinek interview , Warehouse 13 , True Romance
TV Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Saul Rubinek is one of the most versatile characters actors in Hollywood , able to move from sitcom to serious drama without a moment ’s hesitation .
As a result , he ’s one of the busiest guys in the business , a fact which is easily proven by taking a gander at his IMDb listing .
It ’s been awhile , however , since he ’s taken on a role as a series regular , which should give you an idea of how special he believes his new gig , Sci - Fi ’s “ Warehouse 13 ” ( premiering July 7th ) , to be .
Bullz - Eye spoke with Rubinek about how he came aboard the series and what we can expect from his character , and we also chatted with him about his experiences on “ Frasier , ” “ Star Trek : The Next Generation , ” and “ The Outer Limits , ” and the legacy of “ True Romance . ”
Saul Rubinek : Will , you ’re in the middle of the “ bullz - eye ” of a storm , huh ?
Bullz - Eye : I am .
Thankfully , it looks like it ’s passing now , but I was n’t sure for a few minutes if I ’d have power to do this interview .
SR : We must be flying right over you .
Where is the storm ?
BE : In Chesapeake , Virginia .
Right next door to Norfolk .
SR : Oh , we ’re going to be pressing north of you , then .
We ’re heading from Los Angeles to Toronto in about a half hour .
BE : Well , I just finished watching the pilot for “ Warehouse 13 , ” and it ’s really a fun show .
" I adore ( ' Warehouse 13 ' ) , and it ’s a pleasure to be able to talk about it .
I ’ve had so many times in my life where I ’ve had to sell a show , you know , and do my due diligence as an actor and try desperately to look for something positive to say .
Here I am in a kind of heaven . "
SR : Oh , I ’m so glad to hear you say that .
I adore it .
I adore the show , and it ’s a pleasure to be able to talk about it .
I ’ve had so many times in my life where I ’ve had to sell a show , you know , and do my due diligence as an actor and try desperately to look for something positive to say .
Here I am in a kind of heaven , I have to tell you , Will .
I mean , I ’ve been doing this a long , long time .
Connecting with a character like that …it ’s been many , many years since I ’ve had that .
I loved playing that character .
BE : I was talking to my wife about the series , and I said that , at first , the temptation is to call the main characters Mulder and Scully , but they ’re actually more like Bones and Booth from “ Bones . ”
SR : They ’re not Mulder and Scully .
I know there ’s some similarity , but we do n’t take ourselves as seriously as “ X - Files ” did .
BE : So how were you pitched the script for this show ?
Did you know someone involved with the project , did they come to you , or did you just audition ?
SR : Well , it ’s a very interesting process , and I have to give a tremendous amount of credit to Mark Stern , who is essentially one of the heads of not only NBC Universal Cable , but also one of the heads of Sci - Fi Network .
Mark Stern , from what I understand , suggested me when they were having some trouble trying to figure out what direction to go with this character .
You know , it ’s just one of those great , good - fortune things .
I had never met Mark , I do n’t think , formally .
But for years I had worked for him without knowing I was working with him , in a way .
Do you remember the series that was on a few years ago called “ The Outer Limits ” ?
BE : Yeah .
SR : I did a couple of those episodes .
I did one episode in particular , their 100th episode , which was actually written by the guy who is a show writer for “ Sanctuary ” now .
Sam Egan wrote about his dad , who was in Auschwitz .
My parents are Holocaust survivors .
Sam wrote an episode of “ Outer Limits ” where somebody goes back in time to Auschwitz .
I was very nervous about doing a science fiction show that might in s0me ways diminish or belittle , you know ?
That whole thing .
It turned out to be one of the things I am most proud of .
And I know that Mark Stern was working with Trilogy , I think , who were the producers and the writers of that show .
At the time , I did at least …
I think I did a double episode of “ Stargate SG - 1 ” ; I did an episode of “ Psych ” for USA , for NBC Universal .
I did an episode of , I think , the first season of “ Eureka ” .
BE : You did , indeed .
SR : And so , in a way , I was primed for this , even though they were n’t originally looking for someone like me for this role .
So by the time that Mark suggested me and I came in I met David Simkins , our wonderful , brilliant writer of our pilot … you know that he and Jack Kenny are running the show together right now .
But at that time , David Simkins was wide open when I came in , and I had ideas .
In changing stuff , sometimes you insult the people who have been working for years and years on development .
I try to be very cautious not to offend people .
I say , “ Listen , I do n’t have to do this .
I can leave it . ”
But you know , Will , I was doing the series , and …you can look at my career ; I do n’t do series that are not where my family is .
Very rarely .
Actually , never , in fact .
I have never gone away to do a series .
I have a fourteen - year - old son and an eighteen - year - old daughter .
BE : I have a three - year - old daughter , so I know what you mean .
SR : You know what I ’m talking about .
So , yes , I have to pay the bills , but leaving the family for four months or more a year …even though it ’s off and on , it would have to be great .
They were so collaborative and so inclusive .
It ’s such a great concept and the people are so wonderful .
It just turned out to be , so far , a job sent directly from Heaven .
I feel very grateful and incredibly lucky that I ’m in the midst of this great group of people .
These are really great writers .
And , you know , this is the thing .
I know I ’ve heard actors say this stuff before , sometimes they say it with a tongue in their cheek because they ’ve got to , and sometimes they mean it .
This is a really great group of people , with tremendous high pressure put on them .
And I ’m not talking about just the writers here .
The executives , both on the network side and the studio side , I ’m thrilled to tell you because I would n’t have brought them up at all , are so enthusiastic and have been so additive that the only struggles have been with the positive creative struggles , where sparks fly and people are trying to get the show right .
So I ’m in the midst of a very good thing .
I just keep knocking on wood .
I wonder if I ’m dreaming .
It ’s really cool .
BE : In addition to the show itself , you ’ve definitely got a very interesting character with a lot of intrigue around him , one who starts kind of light when he first appears and then gets progressively darker .
I mean , there ’s definitely some baggage to be had there .
SR : Oh , I think that you ’ll find there is quite a bit of baggage .
In fact , a whole trainload of baggage .
( Laughs )
BE : You also get some really clever lines .
I think my favorite was one when you were describing an item and said , “ It ’s bigger than a breadbox .
Or smaller . ”
SR : ( Laughs )
That ’s the genius of David Simkins , I ca n’t take credit for it .
And there ’s a wonderful line in there also where somebody says , “ I guess the metaphor for the warehouse is that it ’s Pandora ’s Box , ” and I say , “ No , actually , Pandora ’s Box is in aisle 33 , section G. ”
And I say , “ As you can tell from the state of the world , thebox is empty . ”
The thing that ’s most fun is that they figured out a way to walk a tightrope between suspense and humor .
And that ’s their struggle , and it ’s ours as well , to walk a tightrope where we do n’t take ourselves too seriously , and yet we try not to take ourselves so lightly that the audience does n’t care about the outcome , you know ?
So you have to walk a tightrope .
I ’m hoping that we succeed most of the time .
You ca n’t succeed all of the time when you ’re playing a tightrope walk between comedy and drama .
You can ’t .
But it ’s a very , very exciting …to keep the metaphor going , it ’s a very , very exciting walk , you know ?
" That world of Lewis Carroll , Jules Verne , Robert Louis Stevenson is a world that I threw myself into as a kid .
And also , even darker , into the world of Lovecraft and Poe as well .
I loved that .
As a child , I was able to throw myself into a world of make believe where I actually was in that world , because as a kid , boy , it was really easy to believe it when I was doing it . "
BE : So had you worked with anyone on the cast before ?
Eddie McClintck , CCH Pounder …
SR : No , I had n’t met any of them .
We ’ve crossed paths through friends , and it ’s been really a brand new family .
It ’s really interesting , because one of the things that I ’ve said to Jack Kenny and to David , I think I even said it to Mark Stern when he visits our set , is , “ I know you guys are dealing with the struggle of any first year show and trying to figure out what a ‘ Warehouse 13 ’ episode is . ”
You know , is this an episode for this show , or is it not ?
So they ’re struggling to find the identity of the show , and I ’ll tell you what I think .
I think the minute that they find the identity of the show , we ’re dead .
I think that there is an obvious thing going here about searching for artifacts that belong in the warehouse .
That ’s the very simple premise .
But the truth is that I love the fact that we ’re struggling , always searching for a new way to tell the stories .
I do n’t know how long that can last , because it ’s a very difficult thing for the writers to stay away from formula .
But so far , I can tell you in our whole first season , there is no formula .
It ’s very difficult , but it ’s very exciting .
BE : I ’d ask you if you are a sci - fi guy , but since you first turned up on my radar almost 20 years ago in an episode of “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” , I dare say you at least are n’t afraid of sci-fi .
SR : No , I love it .
I read it as a kid , of course .
A lot of Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury , and Arthur C. Clarke .
I grew up reading all of that stuff .
I love science fiction films .
But I also love fantasy , because one of the first roles I remember was “ Treasure Island . ”
I played Jim Hawkins in “ Treasure Island ” when I was 11 years old .
A world of Robert Louis Stevenson and a world of Jules Verne .
I think my office resembles , more than anything else , something that was designed by Jules Verne .
That world of Lewis Carroll , Jules Verne , Robert Louis Stevenson is a world that I threw myself into as a kid .
And also , even darker , into the world of Lovecraft and Poe as well .
I loved that .
But I ’ve been acting since I was six , seven years old .
Some of the plays that I did at that time were adaptations of those peoples ’ works .
So as a child , I was able to throw myself into a world of make believe where I actually was in that world .
Because as a kid , boy , it was really easy to believe it when I was doing it .
I always feel I am trying to go back to where I was at when I was eight years old , as an actor .
BE : Do you have a favorite of your sci- fi appearances ?
Maybe one that is n’t necessarily remembered by as many people but that you just particularly enjoyed ?
SR : Well , one of the things that I really , really liked doing was that episode of “ The Outer Limits , ” where I played a Nazi hunter .
I did two “ Outer Limits ” episodes , but on this one ( “ Tribunal ” ) , I played a Nazi hunter , and I did it with Lindsay Crouse .
Sam Egan ’s dad himself was in Auschwitz , and as I said , my parents are also Holocaust survivors , although they were never in a death camp .
They were hidden for two and a half years .
In this episode , my character actually travelled back in time to Auschwitz .
And I did it with my old friend Jan Rubes .
Remember , he was the grandfather in “ Witness ” ?
I had worked him before – he also played a Jewish grandfather in a movie I did ( “ The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick ” ) – but here he actually played the Nazi I was hunting .
So he was an old friend of mine and I did it with him I was nervous about doing it , but I spoke to Sam Egan and found out what he felt about it , and that he wrote it .
His father was even able to visit the set .
That episode … I ’m very proud of that .
It was a science fiction episode , but the real events were n’t diminished at all .
There was a lot of heart from every area .
What ’s really interesting is that Mark Stern worked on that episode .
I think , if I ’m not wrong , Mark was working for Trilogy at that time , who were the producers / writers of the show .
Anyway , it ’s one of my favorite things I have done on sci-fi .
BE : When they called you up and invited you to appear on “ Frasier , ” did you just pinch yourself ?
Because it seems like it was a great gig .
SR : Oh , man , and it only got greater .
I was only called to do three episodes , and the ratings went up because of the relationship , partly because I drove such a wedge between Niles and the love of his life , so that story arc continued for two years .
Yes , I had to pinch myself .
That was one of the most amazing times I have ever had , where you feel like you are doing this little one act play , no interference from anyone , anywhere .
We ’re just doing this little one act play , and then 23 million people showed up .
It was an extraordinary group of people .
I was very fortunate to be a part of it .
BE : I thought it was particularly great when they brought you back for the episode when Niles and Daphne were eloping .
On doing " Frasier " : " I had to pinch myself .
That was one of the most amazing times I have ever had , where you feel like you are doing this little one act play , no interference from anyone , anywhere .
We ’re just doing this little one act play , and then 23 million people showed up . "
SR : ( Laughs ) I know .
Yeah , that ’s a great episode .
That ’s a brilliant show , and my son , who is now 14 , is just now watching them all religiously .
He ’s just old enough to appreciate the brilliance of the writing of that show , and the acting .
BE : And I see you just finished another Jesse Stone film not long ago .
SR : I did .
What ’s kind of wonderful about that group of people is that they have created a small repertory company for that town .
As a result , even though my character is one of the first ones got sent to jail , he ’s in jail , then he gets out of jail .
They have created a community of characters and it ’s a real , really nice group of people to work with .
I love doing that show .
BE : Were you surprised that “ Blind Justice ” only lasted seven episodes ?
SR : I ’m never surprised at decisions of networks .
I ’ve learned not to be surprised .
I worked with Steven Bochco once without meeting him .
I did a guest star role in a “ Hill Street Blues ” episode back in the early 80’s , and I think I did the very last episode of “ L.A. Law . ”
But I do n’t know .
All I know is I ’m terrified of liking shows .
I really liked “ The Unit , ” I really liked “ Eli Stone , ” I really liked “ The Sarah Connor Chronicles . ”
So I ’m afraid of liking anything , because they get cancelled .
What I ’m hoping is that , since we ’re on such a fast growing cable network , it wo n’t be the same pressures and they will give our show a chance to grow .
BE : Well , it reminds me quite a bit of “ Eureka , ” just as far as a general kind of feel to it , so I ’m hoping that the audience embraces the same way that they did that show .
SR : I hope so .
And I hope that we are also able to expand and get …
I think that they are very interested in getting a larger women audience , and I think that the show deserves it , you know ?
BE : I was looking back over your IMDb page , and I was just wondering : do you have any recollection of working on “ Death Ship ” ?
SR : I have a very good recollection of working on “ Death Ship ” .
We called it “ Death Shit . ” I was glad I was killed off quickly .
But you ’ve got to remember that it was my second movie .
I think I had done one movie before that .
I was thrilled , you know , no mortgage , no kids .
I was just thrilled to travel down to , I guess , Mississippi .
No , Alabama .
We were in Southern Alabama .
And all I remember was that , as I was leaving the production trailer , I saw all of my fellow cast members in the water .
And there was a production report saying that under no circumstances should the actors be in this water , it ’s polluted , and you will have to be hospitalized .
But apparently nobody had told the actors .
And that ’s when I began to understand something about the nature of independent movies .
( Laughs )
BE : Are there any roles that people come up to you and cite as being their favorites that leave you just thinking , “ Wow , that ’s what you remember me for ? ”
SR : Rarely .
BE : Really ?
SR : Yeah .
Mostly it ’s a combination of either “ Star Trek : The Next Generation , ” where I played a character who kidnapped Data in an episode called “ The Most Toys . ”
Which I loved doing because it was my old friend Brent Spiner , who I had done theater with in New York .
That , “ Frasier , ” ‘ True Romance , ” or “ Unforgiven . ”
Or “ The Family Man , ” actually .
I guess those are the ones that I ’m most recognized for .
But I ’m proud of them all , so what can I say ?
BE : You definitely had a very iconic look in “ Unforgiven . ”
I remember you and your hat in that film .
SR : Well , that ’s one of the ones where I would have paid them to let me be in the movie .
BE : And I see you ’ve had a pretty solid presence in Jewish films .
You were in “ Oy Vey !
My Son Is Gay !! ”
SR : I just did that movie .
It was an opportunity to work with Lainie Kazan and the wonderful John Lloyd Young , who won a Tony Award for doing “ Jersey Boys . ” “ Jersey Boys ” was created by my old friend Des McAnuff , who I grew up with in Toronto .
John Lloyd Young , who was doing his first film , playing my son , is really a wonderful actor .
I mean , aside from the silly title of that movie , I had a wonderful time .
Very funny movie .
And Lainie Kazan is a force of nature .
I was just glad to be in her presence .
BE : And then many years ago , you also did “ The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick . ”
SR : With Jan Rubes , exactly .
I ’ve played two Hasidic Rabbis !
One I did in the movie called “ The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick , ” a Hasidic Rabbi who wants to be a comic .
The other movie I did , a couple of years after that , was a movie called “ The Quarrel , ” a much more serious film where I played a very right wing , fundamentalist Hasidic Rabbi .
BE : Do you have a favorite film that you worked on that did n’t necessarily get the love that you thought it deserved ?
SR : I loved working on “ Getting Even with Dad . ”
It ’s where I first met Ted Danson , and I just think he ’s one of the world ’s great actors .
I think his performance in “ Damages ” was one of the true comic masterpieces of villainhood , you know , that has ever been performed .
I met him there first and I loved doing that role .
I loved working with Howie Deutch .
That character is not a character … all my characters have university degrees , I do n’t even have a university degree .
But that character , playing that kind of a street punk in “ Getting Even With Dad ” … I love that movie .
But there are small , independent movies …
“ The Quarrel ” was an example of a movie that has not been seen .
I loved doing that film , I ’m very proud of it .
I ’m very , very proud of that film .
There have been a number of films throughout time … you know I originally felt that way about “ True Romance . ”
As soon as it came out , I was doing “ Getting Even With Dad , ” and I remember Howie Deutch saying to me after the first weekends ’ gross were less than four million dollars , “ Well , that ’s the end of that . ”
I thought , Jesus , that ’s too bad , because that was some movie .
Well , there ’s a movie that ’s grown in cult status .
I can guarantee that , if you opened that movie right now in a theater , it would do well .
That ’s strange , is n’t it ?
So I do n’t have to say that ’s one where I ’m not recognized for , because it turned out to be a cult movie all on its own .
I ’ve done so many .
Sometimes they do n’t get any recognition , you ’re absolutely right .
It just happens that way .
BE : I think you ’re the only actor who appeared in both “ Nixon ” and “ Dick . ”
SR : Oh , you ’re absolutely right .
I think I ’m the only one who did .
I really wanted to play Kissinger in “ Nixon , ” too , but they cast Paul Sorvino .
What can I say ?
Life does what it does .
So when I was cast as Kissinger in “ Dick , ” I was so thrilled .
And Dan Hedaya , one of the world ’s great actors , what a thrill to work with him .
BE : Last one : when you did “ The Bonfire of the Vanities , ” could you tell it was on its way to being a train wreck even at the time you were filming it ?
SR : No , of course not .
I loved doing “ The Bonfire of the Vanities . ” I mean , look , nobody knows these things , and if they tell you that they know these things , they are lying or psychotic .
First of all , the movie is not an act of genocide , you know ?
If you go back and look at that movie , it has really great things in it .
But people so loved the book and it was such a departure in many ways from the book that , naturally , there was a lot of animosity and hatred towards it .
There was a whole book written about it called “ Devil ’s Candy , ” which I refused to be interviewed for because I did n’t want to trash it .
There ’s a great phrase which says that every time you throw dirt , you lose a little ground .
I ’m not interested in throwing any dirt .
My feeling was that , hey , I got to know Tom Hanks .
It was before “ Philadelphia , ” it was before he had done “ Forrest Gump , ” but I was a huge fan because of “ Big , ” which I think is one of the most highly underrated performances in film of all time .
And I was working with Morgan Freeman , who I got to work again with in “ Unforgiven . ”
It was just fun for me , you know ?
Fun .
Do I look at it and go , “ Geez , I would n’t have made that choice or made this one ” ?
I do that with movies that have won Academy Awards !
As you know , I ’ve directed four films now , so I ’ve learned .
Brian
De Palma is one of the world ’s great directors , and I watched him and Bill almost every single day .
You could n’t drag me away from what they were doing .
The fact that it did n’t succeed in the marketplace … ?
Who the hell knows ?
Who ’s able to figure that one out ?
I do n’t know .
BE : Actually , I meant to ask this earlier : do you have a favorite of the films that you have directed ?
SR : I think my favorite is probably …
( Hesitates )
You know , they are all wonderful in their own way .
I ’ve only done four .
The last one I did , which is “ Cruel But Necessary , ” was made for under $ 40,000 .
BE : Wow .
SR : And it was an extraordinary experience .
The true favorite I did was with my wife as producer .
“ Jerry and Tom ” is very close to my heart as my first film , because I directed it as a play , and then the last one , “ Cruel But Necessary . ”
But then if you ask me about “ Bleacher Bums ” and all my friends who were in it , and working with Alan Alda and Steven Weber on “ Club Land ” … ?
I have n’t done that many directing jobs that I can really say , “ This is my favorite . ”
They all are very close to my heart , all four of them .
BE : With “ Jerry and Tom , ” every time I look at the cast of that film , I am just flabbergasted .
It ’s really remarkable .
( Writer ’s note : the cast includes Joe Mantegna , Sam Rockwell , Ted Danson , William H. Macy , Charles Durning , Peter Riegert , Sarah Polley , and Maury Chaykin . )
SR : Thank you !
Now there ’s a movie that I wish had gotten a bit more recognition .
I wish Miramax had not unreleased it .
They bought it at Sundance , got cold feet , and just sold it to Showtime .
But , look , that gave me the opportunity to direct two Showtime movies !
Well , I am going to go catch my plane now …
BE : Well , Saul , it has been a pleasure talking to you .
Like I said , I ’m really psyched for the show .
I hope it does well for you .
I ’m glad you like it .
I ’m thrilled that you like it .
And thanks for this interview .
I really appreciate it !

The mystery of Hirta 's shrinking Soay sheep has finally been solved
Climate change is causing a breed of wild sheep in Scotland to shrink , according to research .
Scientists say milder winters help smaller sheep to survive , resulting in this " paradoxical decrease in size " .
Classic evolutionary theory would predict that wild sheep gradually get bigger , as the stronger , larger animals survive into adulthood and reproduce .
Reporting in Science journal , the team says this shows the " subtle interplay " between evolution and the environment .
Scientists first began studying Soay sheep , on the island of Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago , in 1985 .
Since then , the sheep have decreased in size by 5 % - their legs getting steadily shorter and their body weight decreasing .
This strange phenomenon was first reported in 2007 , but the reason for it remained under debate .
' A natural laboratory '
The lead researcher in the study , Tim Coulson from Imperial College London , said the island provided an ideal opportunity to tease apart the factors driving the sheep 's physical change .
" The island is almost like a natural laboratory - there are only the sheep and the vegetation there , " he said .
He and his team had access to detailed information about the sheep that had been collected over more than two decades .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " We have so much great data , " said Professor Coulson , " that we were able to write a ledger of how much of an effect each of the different factors had on the sheep . "
They used a formula called the " Price equation " , which was designed by evolutionary theorist George Price to predict how a physical trait , such as body size , will change from one generation to the next .
With all of this data , the team was able to " rearrange the equation " and use it to work out how much of a contribution each driver made to the sheep 's body size .
They found that the local environment had a stronger effect on the animals than the evolutionary pressure to grow larger .
" In the past , only the big , healthy sheep and large lambs that had piled on weight in their first summer could survive the harsh winters on Hirta , " said Professor Coulson .
Because of climate change , he explained , grass for food is now available for more months of the year on the island .
" Survival conditions are not so challenging - even the slower growing sheep have a chance of making it , and this means smaller individuals are becoming increasingly prevalent in the population , " he said .
" Young mums " tend to give birth to smaller lambs
The team also found that younger sheep tended to give birth to smaller lambs - a phenomenon they termed " the young mum effect " .
This effect , said Professor Coulson , combined with environmental changes had " overriden what we would expect through natural selection " .
As for the future of the sheep , the team believes that they are still shrinking .
" The next step is to extend our description of past change into a predictive model , " said Professor Coulson .
" But it 's too early to say if , in 100 years , we will have chihuahuas herding pocket - sized sheep . "

WASHINGTON -- A secret Central Intelligence Agency initiative terminated by Director Leon Panetta was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives , according to former intelligence officials familiar with the matter .
The precise nature of the highly classified effort is n't clear , and the CIA wo n't comment on its substance .
According ...
In his annual Berkshire Hathaway letter , Warren E. Buffett recently urged investors to pose tough questions at the shareholders meeting in May .
Here is one on the mind of some Buffett watchers :
When are you going to fix Moody’s ?
Mr. Buffett , known as the Oracle of Omaha , owns a stake of roughly 20 percent in the Moody ’s Corporation , parent of one of the three rating agencies that grade debt issued by corporations and banks looking to raise money .
In recent months , Moody ’s Investors Service and its rivals , Standard & Poor ’s and Fitch Ratings , have been prominent in virtually every account of the What Went Wrong horror story that is the financial crisis .
The agencies put their seals of approval on countless subprime mortgage - related securities now commonly described as toxic .
The problem , critics contend , is that the agencies were paid by the corporations whose debt they were rating , earning billions in fees and giving the agencies a financial incentive to slap high marks on securities that did not deserve them .
At least 10 of the big companies that failed or were bailed out in the last year had investment - grade ratings when they went belly up  like deathly ill patients bearing clean bills of health .
Miss Dean was born with her left forearm missing A woman claims clothing firm Abercrombie & Fitch made her work in the stockroom because her prosthetic arm did not fit the shop 's image .
Riam Dean told an employment tribunal she felt " diminished " and " humiliated " by the incident at its Saville Row store in central London .
The 22 - year - old law student is suing for disability discrimination and seeking up to £ 20,000 in damages .
The company said she " exaggerated " the impact of the experience on her life .
Miss Dean , who was born with her left forearm missing and wears a prosthetic arm , said she was granted special permission to wear a cardigan to cover the join in her arm .
No -one could have prepared me for such debasement
Riam Dean
But she told the tribunal she was later removed from the shop floor and made to work in the stockroom because the cardigan did not adhere to the strict dress code .
Miss Dean told the tribunal , in central London , she felt " taunted " when her manager told her she could return to the floor of the firm 's flagship store if she removed the cardigan .
She said : " I felt personally diminished , humiliated and could not argue a point I could never win . "
She told the hearing she would have stayed with the company until her law qualification was complete , had she not been " bullied " out of her job .
' Adult bullying '
Miss Dean added that when she left the company she " was n't the same person " .
" I was always prepared for children to be curious about my disability , but to be faced with adult bullying , no - one could have prepared me for such debasement , " she said .
Genevieve Reed , a close friend of Miss Dean , told the tribunal : " The girl who once felt invincible started to question whether this was the first of a series of obstacles she would come up against to her disability .
" To watch my extraordinary friend 's character and spirit crushed by a large corporation was heartbreaking . "
' Socially - isolated ' But Akash Nawbatt , representing Abercrombie & Fitch , argued Miss Dean had deliberately played up the effect of her experiences .
He referred to a medical assessment Miss Dean underwent to secure disability funding for university .
The report described her as " becoming socially - isolated " and unable to use public transport because of anxiety .
However , Mr Nawbatt told Miss Dean : " Just as you are exaggerating in the report , you are exaggerating what happened at Abercrombie and the effect it had on you . "
Miss Dean has just finished her final exams at Queen Mary , University of London .

DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson has repaid £ 555 to the House of Commons ’ fees office after charging dozens of pay - to - view movies to the tax payer .
The former junior minister made claims for 68 pay - to - view movies at London hotels where he stayed in 2004 and 2005 , according to the Daily Telegraph .
Under the rules , he was allowed to use his second home allowance to pay for items “ wholly , exclusively and necessarily ” relating to parliamentary duties .
The claims were paid by the fees office , which has come under fire after a series of damaging disclosures in the Daily Telegraph for meeting MPs ’ often unlikely and expensive claims .
He is now to repay costs relating to room service , mini-bars and entertainment from hotel stays , amounting to £ 678.90 .
Details of Mr Donaldson 's claims were published in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday .
The newspaper quoted sources in the hotels who said the movies watched by Mr Donaldson were in the highest price category , made up of recent box office smashes and adult movies .
In a statement to the Daily Telegraph , Mr Donaldson said he had not watched anything adult or pornographic .
“ Such material was not viewed on the date alleged , or at all , ” he said .
His hotel bills made reference to “ room service 2 ” .
Asked by the Daily Telegraph what the reference meant , John McBurney , Mr Donaldson ’s solicitor , said : “ Clearly , it is impossible to be precise in relation to each and every item .
“ However , it would have been common practice to have used pay TV , including internet access and other media services . ”
First Minister Peter Robinson said : “ Mr Donaldson has been asked to pay back any expenses which have not been properly incurred and I understand that he intends to do so .
“ In the light of his categorical denials , Mr Donaldson is clearly entitled to a presumption of innocence . ”
Film prices ranged from £ 7.50 at the Marriot , County Hall , to £ 14.95 at the Renaissance Hotel , Heathrow Airport .
He was also billed for 30 films at £ 7.95 each during stays at the Jolly Hotel St Ermine near Westminster and claimed on four occasions for £ 9.95 , the cost of watching a film at Hilton Hotels .
In 2004 and 2005 , the MP stayed in London for two or three nights a week .
In 2005 , he bought a flat in south London with fellow DUP MP Sammy Wilson , and the hotel claims ceased .
The MP denied watching any content of an adult or pornographic nature .
Belfast Telegraph
Shanghai is to urge eligible couples to have two children , as worries about the looming liability of an ageing population outweigh concerns about over - stretched resources .
The Shanghai policy , reported by the China Daily , marks the first time in decades that Chinese officials have actively encouraged more procreation .
China 's famous " one child " policy is actually less rigorous than its name suggests , and allows urban parents to have two offspring if they are both only children .
Rural couples are allowed a second child if their first is a girl .
But since the late 1970s worries about developing an already highly populated country without straining scarce land , water and energy supplies has meant the government has always pushed to keep families as small as possible .
This is still the official line in most of China , but Shanghai is now apparently rich enough to focus on a new concern - the burden of an ageing population on the generation born since the one child policy was unveiled .
The US - based Centre for Strategic and International Studies warned in April that by 2050 China will have more than 438 million people older than 60 , with more than 100 million of them 80 and above .
The country will have just 1.6 working - age adults to support every person aged 60 and above , compared with 7.7 in 1975 .
" We advocate eligible couples to have two kids because it can help reduce the proportion of ageing people and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future , " the China Daily quoted Xie Lingli , head of the city 's Family Planning Commission , as saying .
Volunteers and family planning officials will make home visits and distribute leaflets to promote slightly larger families , and even provide emotional and financial counselling .
Shanghai's over - 60 population is already move than 3 million , or more than one - fifth of residents .
But that proportion is expected to rise to around one - third by 2020 , as the children of a baby boom promoted by former Chairman Mao Zedong age , the paper said .
China is ill - prepared to cope with its greying population , with an underfunded state pensions system and shrinking family sizes removing a traditional layer of support for elders .
But if Beijing changes tack on policy , it may not be difficult to shift the population balance .
More than two - thirds of women would like to have two or more children to prevent their children becoming spoilt or lonely , a senior official at the National Family Planning Commission said earlier this year .

( CNN ) -- Don Lerman set a record by eating seven sticks of salted butter in five minutes .
During six years of competitive eating , he gained 100 pounds .
Takeru Kobayashi has enthralled and puzzled audiences for years at the annual Nathan 's hot dog-eating contest .
Dominick Cardo , known as " The Doginator " in competitions , woke up at night sweating , nauseated and feeling stomach and chest pains .
Both former competitve eaters competed in the Nathan 's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest .
This year 's competition airs Saturday on ESPN .
" Any way you look at it , it 's not healthy , " Dave " Coondog " O'Karma , a retired competitive eater , said of his former hobby .
" You do it once in a while , and it 's fun .
I do n't think loading your body with fat and salt is healthy . "
After 35 years of gobbling hamburger , oysters , eggs , corn on the cob and even bull testicles , O'Karma listened to his family and retired from the competition .
Despite having quit for health reasons , ex-speed eaters fondly recall the thrill of competing , cramming food down their throats and basking in the cheers .
" I 'm probably a hypocrite , " said O'Karma , who directs the Association of Independent Competitive Eaters .
" There 's a sixth - grader in me who loves a good hot dog contest . "
The toll of competitive eating on the body has not been researched , and it appears unlikely that such a study will take place , since it is a small , specialized population .
In 2007 , four University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine doctors who specialize in gastroenterology and radiology conducted an experiment on the stomach activities of a competitive eater and an average eater .

Hot dog heavyweights weigh in
The average eater ate seven hot dogs before he felt sick .
Champion speed eater Tim Janus ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened .
Janus , a trim 29 - year - old at the time , insisted that he did not feel full .
Through training and competing , he no longer felt full regardless of how much he ate .
His stomach did not have muscle contractions called peristalsis , which move the food down the digestive tract .
Instead , the hot dogs sat in his stomach and " protruded enough to create the distinct impression of a developing intrauterine pregnancy , " the doctors wrote .
One sample is not conclusive , lead author Marc S. Levine said .
He speculated that over time , the stomach might lose its ability to deflate , which could cause nausea and vomiting .
Lack of stomach activity , like Janus ' , has been seen in extreme cases where people suffer stomach obstruction , said Levine , a professor and chief of gastrointestinal radiology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center .
Stomachs stop contracting and swell when there is scarring , ulcer disease or a tumor causing obstruction .
" Patients who have terrible gastroparesis -- that 's when the stomach does n't contract -- those are patients who usually have diabetes or are on high doses of narcotics over a long period of time , " Levine said .
Janus told the doctors that his stomach would deflate several days after the competition .
During that time , he did not eat .
In an opinion piece published in the American Journal of Radiology , the doctors warned of possible " morbid obesity , profound gastroparesis , intractable nausea and vomiting , and even the need for a gastrectomy [ surgical removal of all or part of the stomach ] .
Despite its growing popularity , competitive speed eating is a potentially self - destructive form of behavior . "
During 35 years of competitive eating , O'Karma disregarded the medical advice .
" When I was having fun , I did n't care , " he said .
" It was worth that discomfort to get what I wanted .
It was fun -- not the eating so much , but the trips , getting to see all kinds of places and different people .
I 'm a house painter in real life .
How else could I ever get the opportunity like that ?
For an average dopey guy , I kind of went a long way with something stupid . "
Despite health warnings about obesity , the faces of competitive eating are not overweight .
Takeru Kobayashi of Nagano , Japan , is a slender man who snaps the hot dogs in half and gobbles the bits robotically .
For years , Kobayashi and world record holder Joey Chestnut of San Jose , California , have vied for the top prize in the annual hot dog contest at Coney Island , New York .
" The new generation of eaters is interested in weight - lifting , running , " said Jason Fagone , who followed competitive eaters for a year for his book " Horseman of the Esophagus . "
" They have more athletic body types than the old generation . "
The younger , fitter speed eaters justify the health risks by likening them to running marathons .
Their reasoning : Activities like football and running are stressful to the body , but an occasional game , marathon or speed - eating contest will be ok , Fagone said .
Injuries could occur , such as vomiting , stomach pain and choking .
In October , newspapers in Taiwan reported that a 23 - year - old student choked to death in a steamed - bun- eating contest .
The prize was $ 60 .
Some longtime competitive eaters have developed diabetes and acid reflux diseases , Fagone said .
Some take medication to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
" It tends to attract an intense sort of person , the person willing to ignore the best health advice , " he said .
Lerman retired from competitive eating because he could n't keep up with the younger eaters .
Since retiring three years ago , the 66 - year - old is trying to shed the extra 100 pounds he gained , which he attributes partly to a foot injury that kept him inactive .
In his prime , he wolfed down 120 jalapeño peppers and six pounds of baked beans and loved every bite and his time in the spotlight .
" When you 're up on stage and they announce your name , and you get your picture with Mayor Giuliani or Mayor Bloomberg , it 's like a high .
It makes you feel so good inside , " he said .
Down in the gut , the Levittown , New York , resident said , " You 're really bloated . "
Former contestant Cardo knew that his love of eating was n't healthy .
But he continued to train and ate 3 pounds of beef tongue in one contest .
As he ballooned to 400 pounds , he realized he was n't getting better in eating contests .
He often felt tired and out of breath .
" During competitions , you get to a point you can't go anymore , " Cardo said .
" I did n't want to continue abusing my body . "
He had an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis .
His arteries were halfway clogged , triggering chest pains .
His stomach ached , and his doctor warned him to stop .
Cardo finally listened and retired in 2006 .
After a gastric bypass surgery , Cardo is half his former size , at 205 pounds .
To fill the need to compete , he bowls and plays poker instead .
Cardo plans to tune in to the hot dog eating contest on TV .
" I 'm going to watch the contest on Saturday , because I used to do it , and I enjoyed it , " he said .
" Between that and living longer and having a healthier life , I 'd rather do what I 'm doing now . "
All About Healthy Eating • Competitive Eating
Just two weeks after the Swedish Pirate Party won a seat in the European Parliament , the German PiratenPartei has gained a seat in the German government .
Jörg Tauss has left the Social Democrats Party ( SPD ) and has joined the Pirate Party .
When it was said by some that the Swedish win in the European elections would act as a catalyst , nobody would have thought that the results would start to show so quickly .
Two weeks after getting 230,000 votes in the EU elections , the Pirate Party has gained a seat in the German Federal Parliament .
Politician Jörg
Tauss left the SPD yesterday over concerns about Internet censorship .
The German Pirate Party had been running a petition against an attempt by the German government to have a censorship list , which , although at first applied to child pornography , has already been considered for expansion to cover other areas .
Faced with this censorship system , which has not been proven to do anything to protect children or do anything except stifle free speech , Tauss decided to leave his party and join the Pirate Party instead .
In a statement the Pirate Party welcomes him into the party as “ one of the most experienced politicians in the areas of education , research and new media , ” and calls the defection the “ culmination of a long chain of failures of the SPD ( Social Democratic Party of Germany ) in the areas of civil rights in the digital age and shows a dramatic loss of their credibility inside and outside . ”
However , there is also controversy as Tauss is currently under investigation over allegations that he was improperly in possession of child porn images .
Tauss claims that such images were sent to him during the basis of an investigation into that subculture , in line with his official government work .
Criminal charges on the possession of the images may be pending soon , with Die Welt quoting the prosecutor as saying charges will be brought “ within a few weeks ” .
Regardless , the Pirate Party is standing by Tauss , who has been a member of the parliament since 1994 , at least until a determination of charges is announced .
“ As long as there will be no criminal conviction against Mr. Tauss , the Piratenpartei has no reason to question Mr. Tauss ’ innocence and moral integrity . ”
With their seat in the German Parliament the Pirate Party hopes to do something about the increased censorship of the Internet and abuse of copyright by multi-billion dollar companies .

Olatunbosun Ugbogu ( C ) is escorted by US military officers at the police station in Yokosuka .
Amid growing tense relations between Washington and Tokyo , a US navy sailor has been sentenced to life for the stabbing murder of a taxi driver in Japan .
Olatunbosun Ugbogu , a 23 - year - old serving in the US Navy , was sentenced in the Yokohama District Court on Thursday .
The service member was found guilty of stabbing 61 - year - old Masaaki Takahashi to death near a US naval base in south of Tokyo in 2008 .
The locals have called for tougher punishment for the US service members who disregard the law .
The murder strained Washington - Tokyo relations , prompting the US officials to apologize to the Japanese people and the victim 's family .
The US military personnel 's relationship with the local population is often uneasy .
Japanese people have called for a complete withdrawal of about 50,000 US military personnel in the country .
The verdict also comes at a time as Japan 's opposition leader says he intends to end the country 's contribution to the US - led mission in Afghanistan and Iraq should his party come to power in upcoming elections .
Opinion polls show that the main opposition party lead by Yukio Hatoyama stands a good chance of winning in Japan 's September elections .
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday set the tolls that for the first time will allow solo motorists to drive in carpool lanes on two of the region ’s most congested freeways .
Los Angeles ’ first experiment with so - called congestion - based pricing is slated to begin in late 2010 or early 2011 .
The introduction of tolls on the 10 Freeway east of downtown Los Angeles and 110 Freeway south of downtown will mark a major departure for roads that generations of Californians have clung to as “ freeways , ” even though toll roads already exist in several parts of the state .
It is also a significant expansion of congestion pricing into the heart of the most freeway - crossed -- and traffic - jammed -- region of the nation .
Under the pricing schedule , solo motorists will pay 25 cents to $ 1.40 per mile to travel 14 miles of high - occupancy lanes on the east - west San Bernardino Freeway and 11 miles on the north - south Harbor Freeway .

As they do on tollways in neighboring Orange County , the MTA ’s tolls are designed to rise and fall in direct relation to traffic volume , so individual motorists , carpools , van pools and buses in the high - occupancy lanes can move at a minimum of 45 mph , even during rush hour .
According to the plan , 25 cents per mile would be charged when demand is lowest , while the maximum toll would be in effect during rush hour .
If speed in the lanes falls below 45 mph , highway signs will warn other solo motorists not to enter the lanes until the flow of traffic accelerates .
Motorcycles and vehicles carrying more than one person will be able to continue using the lanes at no cost .
“ There are something like a half dozen projects like this in the U.S. and about a dozen in the world , ” said Martin Wachs , a transportation expert at Rand Corp. , a think tank based in Santa Monica .
“ We can virtually say this has worked 100 % of the time .
Advertisement
The experience to date shows that this is one strategy for relieving congestion and raising revenue . ”
During public hearings on the plan , opponents argued that tolls were unfair to the poor , low - wage earners and people struggling financially because of the recession .
But MTA officials decided to press ahead with the toll plan .
“ Residents have raised concerns that freeways should be free , ” said Stephanie Wiggins , the executive officer of the project .
“ We know freeways are n’t free because the state gas tax pays for them .
But this project is not about paying for freeways .
It is about better managing congestion , improving transit service and offering better travel choices . ”
Advertisement
The project , which will be evaluated to see if congestion is indeed reduced on both highways , has received a $ 210 - million federal grant , the largest of its type awarded to any city to date , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation .
Some of the money will also go to improve bus service along the two freeways .
The California Department of Transportation and the MTA will convert existing carpool lanes to high - occupancy toll lanes on the 10 from Alameda Street to the 605 Freeway and on the 110 between Adams Boulevard and the Artesia Transit Center at 182nd Street .
A second high - occupancy toll lane will be added in each direction to the 10 Freeway .
Plans also call for automated toll plazas , road improvements and additional transit services , including 57 clean - fuel buses that will operate along both highway corridors .
The work is expected to be completed in December 2010 .
Wachs said the movement of solo motorists into the high - occupancy lanes should provide modest congestion relief in the other highway lanes .
Brian Taylor , a UCLA urban planning professor who has studied congestion pricing , agrees that high - occupancy toll lanes can work .
If the carpool lanes are underused and have extra capacity , they can draw traffic from the other highway lanes , Taylor said .
But , he added , if the lanes are already congested -- a regular occurrence in Los Angeles County -- a high - occupancy toll lane would not have much effect .
Advertisement
A solo motorist who wants to use the high - occupancy lanes must enroll in MTA ’s “ ExpressLanes ” program and be given a transponder , an electronic device that attaches to windshields and dashboards .
When a car uses a toll lane , overhead sensors read the transponder ’s coding and the motorist is automatically billed .
MTA officials say they are working out the details so motorists can shut off their transponders if they want to carpool .
For a while , it appeared that the MTA had missed an opportunity to obtain federal funding earmarked for tollway proposals across the country .
In 2007 , the agency was eliminated in a nationwide competition for federal assistance because it wanted only to study congestion - based pricing , not to build a tollway .
Local officials reapplied for the money in December 2007 and qualified for help after a congestion pricing plan proposed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scuttled by the New York Legislature .

The resignation speech of Sarah Palin : a deconstruction
In what can best be described as mildly coherent rambling , Sarah Palin , the Governor of Alaska , announced her resignation on July 3 .
During her speech , she alluded to a combination of factors that lead to her decision .
Reading through the full text of her speech , I was able to extract 11 reasons that were buried deep amidst her wandering prose and tangled logic .
They are paraphrased below ( along with the relevant text from her speech in italics ) :
1. Defending myself against claims of ethics violations by political operatives is distracting me from doing my job as governor .
Therefore , I resign .
“ Political operatives descended on Alaska last August , digging for dirt .
The ethics law I championed became their weapon of choice .
Over the past nine months I ’ve been accused of all sorts of frivolous ethics violations …
Every one – all 15 of the ethics complaints have been dismissed .
We ’ve won !
But it has n’t been cheap – the State has wasted THOUSANDS of hours of YOUR time and shelled out some two million of YOUR dollars to respond to “ opposition research ” – that ’s money NOT going to fund teachers or troopers – or safer roads .
2. Life is short .
Time is too precious to waste .
I am wasting my time as governor .
Therefore , I resign to make better use of my time .
“ Life is too short to compromise time and resources …
Productive , fulfilled people determine where to put their efforts , choosing to wisely utilize precious time … to BUILD UP . ”
3 . I am expected to serve out the term I was elected for .
But that would make me a quitter .
Therefore , I am quitting because I do n’t want to be a quitter .
“ … it may be tempting and more comfortable to just keep your head down , plod along , and appease those who demand : “ Sit down and shut up ” , but that ’s the worthless , easy path ; that ’s a quitter ’s way out .
And a problem in our country today is apathy .
It would be apathetic to just hunker down and “ go with the flow .
Nah , only dead fish “ go with the flow ” . ”
4 . I want to help people .
I now realize that I do n’t need the title of Governor to do that .
Therefore I will do away with my superfluous title of Governor .
“ I ’ve never believed that I , nor anyone else , needs a title to do this – to make a difference … to HELP people .
So I choose , for my State and my family , more “ freedom ” to progress , all the way around … so that Alaska may progress …
I will not seek re-election as Governor . ”
5 . I have decided not to seek reelection .
Lame duck governors milk the system by traveling around and neglecting their state ’s politics .
That is wrong .
The best option once one decides not to run for reelection is to desert one ’s post .
Therefore , I quit .
“ And so as I thought about this announcement that I would n’t run for re-election and what it means for Alaska , I thought about how much fun some governors have as lame ducks … travel around the state , to the Lower 48 ( maybe ) , overseas on international trade – as so many politicians do .
And then I thought – that ’s what ’s wrong – many just accept that lame duck status , hit the road , draw the paycheck , and “ milk it ” .
I ’m not putting Alaska through that – I promised efficiencies and effectiveness ! ?
That ’s not how I am wired .
I am not wired to operate under the same old “ politics as usual . ”
I promised that four years ago – and I meant it .
It ’s not what is best for Alaska . ”
6 . The political environment in Alaska has turned on me .
I want to take a stand .
Therefore , I am resigning to take a stand against those who wish me out of office .
“ My choice is to take a stand and effect change – not hit our heads against the wall and watch valuable state time and money , millions of your dollars , go down the drain in this new environment . “
7 . I want to pursue my priorities for Alaska and America on a bigger scale .
Being Governor is holding me back .
Therefore I will quit so that I might better serve as a citizen .
” Rather , we know we can effect positive change outside government at this moment in time , on another scale , and actually make a difference for our priorities – and so we will , for Alaskans and for Americans . ”
8. I am Alaska ’s governor in title only .
This is wasting taxpayer ’s time and money .
While some may endorse my charade , I oppose it .
Therefore , I resign .
“ Some Alaskans do n’t mind wasting public dollars and state time .
I do .
I cannot stand here as your Governor and allow millions upon millions of our dollars go to waste just so I can hold the title of Governor . ”
9 . My children told me to resign , primarily because an adult said something nasty about their handicapped brother Trig .
An emphatic cuss - word used by one of my kids convinced me that they were right .
“ In fact , this decision comes after much consideration , and finally polling the most important people in my life – my children ( where the count was unanimous … well , in response to asking : “ Want me to make a positive difference and fight for ALL our children ’s future from OUTSIDE the Governor ’s office ? ”
It was four “ yes ’s ” and one “ hell yeah ! ”
The “ hell yeah ” sealed it – and someday I ’ll talk about the details of that …
I think much of it had to do with the kids seeing their baby brother Trig mocked by some pretty mean - spirited adults recently . ) ”
10 .
Even though I am opposed to governors milking the state for unnecessary travel , a recent trip I took to visit wounded soldiers in Kosovo and Landstuhl showed me that their work is of national importance and real while my work as Governor is local and superficial .
Therefore I will quit because I want to do something national and real .
“ My decision was also fortified during this most recent trip to Kosovo and Landstuhl , to visit our wounded soldiers overseas , those who sacrifice themselves in war for OUR freedom and security … we can ALL learn from our selfless Troops … they ’re bold , they do n’t give up , they take a stand and know that LIFE is short so they choose to NOT waste time .
They choose to be productive and to serve something greater than SELF … and to build up their families , their states , our country .
These Troops and their important missions – those are truly the worthy causes in this world and should be the public priority with time and resources and NOT this local / superficial wasteful political bloodsport . ”
11 . I believe “ no more politics as usual ” is good .
Deserting my post is highly unusual .
Therefore deserting my post is good .
So I quit .
“ I have given my reasons … no more “ politics as usual ” and I am taking my fight for what ’s right – for Alaska – in a new direction . ”
There was a twelfth reason .
It was not stated explicitly by Palin the politician , but stated clearly between the lines by Palin the hockey mom .
That voice said :
“ The pressure of publicity brought to bear on me and my family since last August are beyond my ability to cope , no less govern .
Therefore , I resign . ”
Saying this would have confirmed Governor Palin ’s limitations as a politician but redeemed her integrity as a human being .
Had Sarah Palin the courage to make that 27 - word speech then she would have been living up to her credo of “ no more politics as usual ” .
Lacking that courage she couched her resignation waste - deep in 2,571 words of empty political rhetoric , transparent positioning and populist prattle .
Politics as usual .
Her constituents deserved better from her .

PARIS --
For the first time , a panel of climate experts has confirmed that global warming is occurring and that it is " very likely " - - 90 percent certain - - man - made .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a working group of some 3,000 delegates from 113 countries , today issued its final report here on the state of climate change -- and the findings were grim .
" There can be no question that the increases in these greenhouse gases are dominated by human activity , " says Susan Solomon , co-chair of the working group and an atmospheric scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
" Warming of the climate system is now unequivocal .
That is evident in observations of air and ocean temperature as well as rising global mean sea level . "
" The 2nd of February in Paris will be remembered as the day that the question mark was removed from the idea that humans had anything to do with climate change , " adds Achim Steiner , executive director of the United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP )
" The focus of attention will now shift from whether climate change is linked to human activity and whether the science is sufficient to what on earth are we going to do about it . "
A wealth of new data in the years between this report and the last one in 2001 provided improved accuracy and precision .
For instance , thanks to a diversity of computer models -- as well as several runs of each -- the scientists can now provide a best estimate for the temperature change based on a doubling of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) levels in the atmosphere : three degrees Celsius .
This doubling is based on preindustrial levels of the most prevalent greenhouse gas -- roughly 280 parts per million ( ppm ) .
Concentrations of CO 2 in the atmosphere had already reached 379 ppm in 2005 .
" Some of the models show an ice - free Arctic .
We see more severe extremes , heat waves .
We see a lot of heavier precipitation , drought increases in a lot of regions .
Tropical cyclones are projected to become more intense in a lot of areas with ongoing increases in sea surface temperatures , " says Gerald Meehl , an atmospheric scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) and a contributing author .
" We see what we 've already seen but everything becoming a lot more extreme . "
This warming would vary from place to place , with some regions experiencing far more .
" The last time our polar regions of the earth were significantly warmer than they are today over an extended period occurred 125,000 years ago , " Solomon notes .
" At that very different time we did see reductions in the polar ice sheets that led to four to six meters ( 13 to 20 feet ) of sea level rise . "
Adds geoscientist and lead author Jonathan Overpeck of the University of Arizona , some scientists " drilled through an Antarctic ice sheet and it was n't there then .
That 's going to be a big focus for the future . "
The process of drafting this summary report proved contentious at times .
For example , a sentence was ultimately removed that said man-made greenhouse gases outweigh the contribution of the sun by a factor of five .
" The difference is really a factor of 10 , " says atmospheric scientist and lead author Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in England .
In fact , this report , despite its gravity , represents a very conservative estimate of what may happen as a result of man-made climate change .
Future reports from the IPCC will focus on impacts and strategies for mitigation , culminating in November in a summation of their findings .
Action is already being taken : many countries have committed to reducing greenhouse gases under terms of the Kyoto Treaty ; but this IPCC document represents the international consensus on the state of climate science .
" It 's important that all governments have agreed to the conclusions of this science , " notes Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
" The economic costs of waiting to act will be severe . "
The U.S. , which emits the most greenhouse gases , has so far not accepted any form of reduction in such emissions , either as part of international efforts or domestically .
But it also acceded to this summary , saying it " summarizes the current state of climate change research and will serve as a valuable source of information for policymakers , " according to a statement from Sharon Hays , leader of the U.S. delegation and deputy director for science at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy .
Efforts to combat climate change include proposals to mimic the natural cooling effect of volcanic eruptions or to place an enormous parasol in space to block sunlight .
" We could probably offset the effects now by having a big volcano every 10 years or so , " Forster says .
" You would have to do it now , you 'd have to do it for the rest of time or until you find some other alternative .
It can only ever be temporary . "
But there are other , less intrusive options .
" The largest opportunity is energy efficiency , " says Halldor Thorgiersson , deputy executive secretary for scientific and technological advice at the UNFCCC .
" There are also new technologies such as carbon capture and storage . "
Already , potential impacts of climate change should be taken into account for long - term planning , such as hydroelectric projects or sewer systems that will last a century or more , says lead author David Wratt , principal scientist for New Zealand 's National Climate Center .
" Let 's not do the minimum , let 's put in some tolerances or at least make it so that putting [ in ] more pipes in 50 years is n't too difficult . "
It is now clear that the world will undergo even more rapid changes this century if the levels of greenhouse gas emissions are not slowed .
" If we were to have continued emissions at or above the current levels , the changes in the 21st century would very likely be larger than they were in the 20th century , " Solomon says , just as the rate of sea level change in the 19th century is dwarfed by the rate of sea level change in the 20th century .
" We now know we have warming and it is due to humans , there should be no real debate , " Overpeck adds .
" We know there have been a variety of associated changes : stronger hurricanes , reduction of snowpack .
These are the kind of changes we have had that are detectable with just a fraction of a degree of warming . "
" We 're going to see these same patterns continue in the future and get more and more severe , " he continues .
" We have a really clear picture of what is going to happen if we do n't do anything or if we make some reduction in emissions . "
I ’ve been using Clojure for nearly a year now , and something strange has been happening …
I still think unit - tesitng is extremely important , but for some reason I do n’t seem to be writing the same number of tests any more .
I ’m ashamed to say it , but there it is .
And it gets stranger – this new lower test count does n’t seem to matter .
It seems to me that my Clojure code works right the first time more often than my Ruby or Java code ever did .
And I seem to find less defects in the Clojure code over time , too .
This is not just a fanboy speaking , though I am a huge fan of Clojure .
I think that the reasons I ’m observing this is due to a an important characteristic of the language .
Instead of just talking about it , let me first walk you through an example .
This is something I had to do recently – we wanted to build a kind of reverse index for an HBase table .
The row ids of this table are time - stamps .
The idea was that this “ reverse index ” would allow us to answer the question of what the first time - stamp for a given day was .
In other words , we needed to convert a list of time - stamps into a lookup of day vs. the first time - stamp of that day .
Eg .
Input :
[ “ 112323123 ” “ 1231231231 ” “ 123123123 ” “ 1231231123 ” ....]
Output :
{ “ 2009 - 07-01 ” “ 123123123 ” “ 2009-07-02 ” “ 123131213 ” “ 2009-07-03 ” “ 123123122 ” }
( Note : I plucked the numbers out of the air , they are n’t accurate .
But the idea is that the input is a long stream of timestamps , and possibly hundreds could correspond to each day . )
So I get started … thinking to myself – I know how to convert a timestamp to a day .
From there , it ’s easy to write a function that returns a hash containing the day vs. timestamp ( Since I already had a function day - for - timestamp , it was easy ) –
( defn day - vs - timestamp [ time - stamp ] { ( day - for - time - stamp time - stamp ) time - stamp} )
So now , all I have to do is map the above function across the input .
This gives me a list of hash - maps , each with one key - value pair .
To ensure that I ’m doing this in order of oldest first , I sort the input as well .
Inside of a let form , all of this looks like –
( let [ all - pairs ( map day - vs - timestamp ( sort input - list ) ) ]
Now , I have this list of hashes , each with one key ( the day ) and one corresponding value ( the time - stamp itself ) .
I want to combine these into one single hash - map which would be the final answer .
But I have to deal with the issue of duplicate keys – when I find a duplicate key , I want to keep the first value associated with the key since it would be the oldest .
Clojure has a merge - with function which does just this – it accepts a function with 2 arguments ( which are the two values in case a duplicate key is found ) and the returning value is used in the merged hash - map .
( apply merge - with #( first [ % 1 %2 ] ) all - pairs )
That ’s basically it .
Combining everything –
( defn day - vs - timestamp [ time - stamp ] { ( day - for - time - stamp time - stamp ) time - stamp} ) ( defn lookup - table [ input - timestamps ] ( let [ all - pairs ( map day - vs - timestamp ( sort input - list ) ) ] ( apply merge - with #( first [ % 1 %2 ] ) all - pairs ) ) )
When I write code like this – I often ask myself , what exactly should I test ?
I end up writing a few happy path tests that prove my code works .
And then a couple of tests that test border cases and negative paths .
And I sometimes do it test first .
But the REPL has spoilt me .
What I used TDD for when coding with Ruby ( and still do ) , I often do at the REPL .
I build tiny functions that work – these are often single lines of code .
Then I combine these into other functions , often no more than two lines of code each , sometimes three .
And it all just works – leaving me wondering what to cover with tests .
The main reason I still write tests is for regression – if something breaks in the future , I catch it quickly .
However , the other thing – the test * driven * design aspect of TDD – has been somewhat replaced by the REPL .
And its very much more dynamic than a set of static tests .
It really brings out the rapid , in rapid application development – especially when combined with Emacs and SLIME .
One main difference with Clojure vs. Ruby ( say ) is that Clojure is functional ( I use very little of Clojure ’s constructs for state ) .
And in the functional world , I just do n’t have to worry about state ( obviously ) , and this tremendously simplifies code .
I think in terms of map , filter , reduce , some , every , merge , etc. and the actual logic is in tiny functions used from within these other higher level constructs .
The idea of first - class functions is also key – I can build up the business logic by writing small functions that do a tiny thing each – and combine them using higher - order functions .
This is one reason why we ’re so productive with Clojure .
We ’ve moved to Clojure for 90 % of our work .
That said , we still use Ruby for parts of our code - base , and it ’s still my favorite imperative language 🙂
According to a fresh report by Donanim Haber , AMD 's next performance graphics accelerator , the Radeon HD 5870 , codenamed " Cypress " is expected to be aggressively priced , at US $ 299 .
At that price , it intends to be highly competitive against GeForce GTX 285 from NVIDIA .
The secret - sauce behind the price could be the 40 nm fab process on which the GPU is being built , which allows upping transistor counts while maintaining significantly smaller die - sizes compared to 55 nm .
There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the specifications of the GPU , including what level of performance with existing application could it end up offering .
Some sources , such as ChipHell , which are one of the first to leak pictures of components related to various Evergreen family products claim the Cypress GPU to have an almost 100 % increase in stream processor counts compared to RV770 , while others remain conservative expecting it to be around 50 % .
With this kind of a pricing , Cypress could trigger market - wide changes in GPU pricing , if it ends up with a good price / performance ratio at $ 299 .
Cypress is expected to be launched on 22 September , close to two weeks after the company unveils the Evergreen family of DirectX 11 compliant GPUs on September 10 .
Market availability is expected in October .
In related news from the same report , the enthusiast - grade accelerator that uses two of these GPUs , codenamed " Hemlock " , is expected to be out in November .

lol ... about 3 months ago i was thinking the new 5000 series will get beyond that " limit " . so ... IT`s safe to say that my GTX 260 is competitive against GeForce GTX 285 . .

yes and the same as the 3870 @ 299 $
and werez , i am thinking , just the price point , since NO one knows the performance .
its the 285 price point and ( lets hope ) it is 100 % more powerful , well then thats a competitive product .

SO ; comes out the same day as the NorthAmerican release of Aion , yes this will go nicely !!
I figured I would join the speculation on the specifications :
4870 ---> 5870
73 % increase in SP
11 % decrease in powerconsumption
33 % increase in transistors
clocks will be 895 mhz standard ( give or take 5 % )
3dmark06 increase of 57 % @ 1900x1200 Posted on Aug 24th 2009 , 22:45 Reply

Bird of Prey Sounds like a nice entry point .
I expect about 6 months or so and the prices will drop .
I was hoping they would do 1000 mhz on the core , seeing as the 4890 can get that .

" waits for 1600 sp 5870 "
this card is gonna woop the GT200 either way though , but 1200sp vs 1600 will decide if it can outperform a GTX295 or HD4870X2 with 1 card Posted on Aug 24th 2009 , 23:00 Reply

Overclocked quantum bit " Highly competitive " with a GTX 285 ?
WTF does that mean ?
This sounds like the performance will be similar .
For a brand new architecture and top of the range card , it should be at the very least 50 % faster .
I hope that it 's just that the rumours are wrong .
One thing that occurs to me , is that the card at stock clocks may be similar in performance to a GTX 285 , but will overclock to hell and back straight out of the box , with no tweaking required .
This could allow AMD to price it low , while still blowing away a GTX 285 in performance when overclocked .
As word got round about this , it would fly off the shelves .
This is my theory , anyway .

nope not joking , you have to remember that the GTX295 and HD4870X2 are only about 40 to 60 % faster than their single versions in most cases , add in that ATI could be doubling the specs of their new card vs their previous card ( which they have never done ) and has enough bandwidth to handle it and you have a monster .

Wow , AMD is falling back into the trap that Nvidia has set up AGAIN .
This happened when the HD 3000 series came up , and now , Nvidia is simply going to strike back using retaliation as their advantage over knowing the weaknesses of this video card .
This reminds me of chess too much .

Think about it , HD5870 could have 1600SP and 32 Rops , The HD4870X2 also has 32 Rops and 1600SP 's but loses performance due to crossfire
which one would be faster
but I will still say the GTX380 would woop it even still .

I think that 40 nm fab process real benefit is just lower power consumption , and lower temperature ... at a 299 US $ price point i can`t really see more than a 10 % - 15 % performance increase ( HD4890 as reference ) + dx11 full support .

According to an analysis done by The New York Observer , ever since Lou Dobbs started discussing President Obama ’s birth certificate on his CNN program , his ratings have taken a nosedive .
Dobbs has lost 15 % of his total viewers , and 27 % of viewers in the 25 - 54 demographic .
The Observer found that , “ Mr. Dobbs ’ first began reporting on Obama birth certificate conspiracy theories on the night of Wednesday , July 15 .
In the roughly two weeks since then , from July 15 through July 28 , Mr. Dobbs ’ 7 p.m. show on CNN has averaged 653,000 total viewers and 157,000 in the 25 - 54 demo . ”
This means that Dobbs ’ numbers have taken a dive , “ By contrast , during the first two weeks of the month ( July 1 to July 14 ) Mr. Dobbs averaged 771,000 total viewers and 218,000 in the 25 - 54 demo .
In other words , Mr. Dobbs ’ audience has decreased 15 percent in total viewers and 27 percent in the demo since the start of the controversy . ”

Dobbs has also experienced a ratings drop over his quarterly numbers , “ But , that said , Mr. Dobbs ’ ratings over the past two weeks , during the height of the “ birthers ” controversy , are also down significantly compared to his overall numbers during the second quarter of 2009 when he averaged 769,000 total viewers and 222,000 in the 25 - 54 demo . ”
This means that if Dobbs was trying to juice his ratings by getting all birther , he has more than failed , he has lost audience share .
You can be certain that Dobbs ’ superiors at CNN have noticed the decline , and unless things reverse for him soon , the network will have all the justification that they would need to fire him .
The problem that Dobbs presents for CNN is that his program is running counter to the political momentum of the country .
When Dobbs moved to the fringe right , he lost 118,000 nightly viewers .
The viewers that Dobbs has lost have moved to the 7 PM replay of MSNBC ’s Hardball .
The rerun of Chris Matthews ’ program is now beating or running even with Dobbs .
This should not be much of a surprise as Matthews has spent the last couple of weeks taking on the birthers .
Where does all of this leave Dobbs ?
I think he is fine for now , but if he continues to lose viewers , CNN will replace him .
The former cable news giant is struggling in primetime , and ca n’t afford to have a 7 PM lead in that is causing viewers to flee the network .
I do n’t know what possessed Dobbs to go birther , but if this decline continues , his decision might end up costing him his show .

The Libertarian Solution to Global Climate Change
By Barry Hess
Much has been said about the apparent changes in our climate , world - wide , but all that has been said has been coupled to the writer ’s ‘ solution ’ to what they claim is a “ problem ” that needs to be addressed .
And therein lies the real problem .
The people posing as the ‘ scientific community ’ are the real problem , and not surprisingly , the ‘ numbers ’ of scientists weighing in on the subject is almost exactly split in making opposite claims to support their particular position .
Pseudo - science is making a comeback through the political realm using environmental changes only as a springboard to forward political ends .
Hopefully , there can be no argument from any sentient being that weather patterns are in an almost perplexing flux .
Seasonal weather patterns have certainly changed over the span of time that data has been collected or can be reliably determined through other means .
The ‘ issue ’ of whether or not the climate of our planet is changing is not , or should not be in contention .
There is some contention as to exactly ‘ what ’ is changing .
We ’ve been told the climate is both heating up , and cooling down , by ‘ real ’ scientists .
Dr. Bob Balling ( a personal acquaintance ) , a climatologist at ASU , has spoken clearly and with reference to ‘ peer ’ reviewed journals in asserting that ‘ global cooling ’ is the effect we are experiencing .
Others , spouting the same sort of ‘ peer ’ reviewed journals claim the effect is the opposite .
This leaves the layman scratching his / her head over whether the Earth is cooling down or heating up .
Regardless of what is actually happening we ( the global community of Mankind ) can rest assured that ‘ something ’ is happening .
This debate will continue , so it remains a ‘ real ’ question , but it really is a moot point .
Whether the Earth is cooling or heating literally does n’t matter — if it is the result of a natural environmental cycle .
If it is , human beings must necessarily adapt to the changes .
That ’s not a question .
The next question that should be scrutinized is really the crux of the whole ‘ debate ’ :
Have , or can human beings make a difference , in terms of Earth climate / environment changes ?
This is where the debate itself heats up , and this is where the political agenda comes into play .
Sociologically , libertarians are rational , thinking individuals not generally given to the emotional scare tactics of politics , but they are practical and cautious in their considerations .
They certainly cannot ascribe to the Al Gore approach of stretching proofs and sprinkling the story with fear , but they will agree that instead of allowing the issue to be used as a control mechanism over any individual ’s property , it should be dealt with in a prudent and practical manner .
If a matter is in genuine contention , ‘ fixing ’ the problem is all a libertarian considers .
Fixing blame , is left to the Republican / Democrat / socialist groups .
So , how would a libertarian ‘ fix ’ environmental issues ?
Simple , just follow the philosophy .
Libertarian philosophy is centered around a very basic concept that entwines personal individual liberty to do anything they want ( as long as it does n’t harm another individual ’s person , property or inherent natural Rights ) with the property they own .
Understanding this concept is critical .
Prudence demands that if there is a genuine contention as to a causal connection between human actions and climate change , human actions must be curbed .
Here ’s where the whole ‘ debate ’ gets lost in politics .
The socialists have historically announced their intention to use environmental concerns to further their control over the actions of individuals .
They ’ll say things like ;
“ We have to stop anyone and everyone who uses the combustion engines they own ” .
From there the litany of demands for more laws as to what an individual can or cannot do with their property splinters into a million directions , depending on which special interest group happens to be screeching at the time , and what they think ‘ you ’ should ‘ be allowed ’ to do , i.e. government control of people ’s private lives through the use of force .
The real ‘ truth ’ is that most of the pointy - heads ( those claiming to be ‘ experts ’ or ‘ scientists ’ ) who chime in either have an agenda of their own , or are a front , hired by the politically - motivated to bolster their particular claims .
Yes , ‘ scientific ’ proof of virtually anything can be bought and paid for ( look up the famed anthropologist / archeologist , Dr. Leaky to find that many of his incredible ‘ scientific ’ discoveries were faked to keep his grant funding flowing ) .
This is also why insidious people like our novelty president can use environmental issues to pad the pockets of their friends and cohorts with nonsensical laws that allow the selling of ‘ carbon credits ’ .
Their concern is obviously not the environment or they would institute a very libertarian principle to solve the problem perceived through environmental pollution .
What is that libertarian principle that would literally solve the ‘ problem ’ ( whether perceived or real ) ?
Well , here it is :
That no person ( or artificial entity ) may pollute either the atmosphere or terra firma beyond their own property line — period .
No ‘ carbon credits ’ , no more pollution of any kind .
Simple , huh ?
I would assume that no one can argue that stopping all ‘ public ’ pollution would necessarily be as much as can be done to actually ‘ fix ’ the pollution problem without revealing their political agenda of control over the lives of individuals .
In what the socialists say is “ the real world ” , stopping all air / water / ground pollution could n’t be done because big businesses can’t function without spewing garbage into the atmosphere .
They are simply and obviously wrong .
While they will argue till they are blue in the face that ‘ their ’ solution is the only solution — they ’ll still be wrong .
Would such a libertarian approach to landownership Rights work — yes , undeniably , “ if ” the real motive for addressing the problem of pollutants causing global warming / cooling is the future habitability of this planet .
The answer is no , if the real motive is control over others through the bigger guns of government .
Would such a demand that all those who pollute the common air cease and desist their polluting ways really shut down what minor manufacturing is still left in this country ?
No , in fact it would most likely stimulate a whole new industry in developing ways , means or products that clean up the unhealthy pollutants before they get into the common environment .
We wo n’t even need governmental oversight or regulation to tell them ‘ how ’ to clean up a smoke stack , or to make it fit an economic model .
So , the next time an ‘ environmentalist ’ tells you that ‘ they ’ have the only solution to save the planet , just ask if stopping everyone from polluting the environment would suit them .
What they do n’t say in their response is what you should pay most attention to .
As an ex-Brit , I ’m well aware of the authorities ’ love of surveillance and snooping , but even I , a pessimistic cynic , am amazed by the governments latest plan : to install Orwell ’s telescreens in 20,000 homes .
£ 400 million ( $ 668 million ) will be spend on installing and monitoring CCTV cameras in the homes of private citizens .
Why ?
To make sure the kids are doing their homework , going to bed early and eating their vegetables .
The scheme has , astonishingly , already been running in 2,000 family homes .
The government ’s “ children ’s secretary ” Ed Balls is behind the plan , which is aimed at problem , antisocial families .
The idea is that , if a child has a more stable home life , he or she will be less likely to stray into crime and drugs .
It gets worse .
The government is also maintaining a private army , incredibly not called “ Thought Police ” , which will “ be sent round to carry out home checks , ” according to the Sunday Express .
And in a scheme which firmly cements the nation ’s reputation as a “ nanny state ” , the kids and their families will be forced to sign “ behavior contracts ” which will “ set out parents ’ duties to ensure children behave and do their homework . ”
And remember , this is the left - wing government .
The Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling , batting for the conservatives , thinks these plans are “ too little , and too late , ” implying that even more obtrusive work needs to be done .
Rumors that a new detention center , named Room 101 , is being constructed inside the Ministry of Love are unconfirmed .
UPDATE : Further research shows that the Express did n't quite have all its facts straight .
This scheme is active , and the numbers are fairly accurate ( if estimated ) , but the mentions of actual cameras in people 's homes are exaggerated .
The truth is that the scheme can take the most troublesome families out of their homes and move them , temporarily , to a neutral , government - run compound .
Here they will be under 24 - hour supervision .
CCTV cameras are not specifically mentioned , not are they denied , but 24 - hour " supervision " certainly does n't rule this out from the camera - loving Brits .
It remains , though , that this is still excessively intrusive into the private lives of citizens , cameras or not .

Every so often white trash makes a run at the mainstream .
Remember the mullet ?
It spread like crabs , up from the trailer park to the forefront of society .
But time passed , the cocaine wore off and people began to point and laugh when they saw one .
It was n’t long before the mullet was the butt of the joke .
It retreated back to where it found safety , at rodeos and minor league hockey games .
Even lesbians backed off the mullet .
It ’s easy to kick a guy when he ’s down and let ’s face it , the mullet is down .
It ’s not even really fun to goof on the mullet anymore .
It moved past cliché to this post - laughable entity , where it ’s such a conscious decision to go mullet now that it ’s almost back to what it originally was : a hairstyle that looks good with cowboy boots .
So why lash out against one particular white trash keystone , yet stand idly by while another goes unquestioned ?
Why the double standard with the chin strap ?
Why am I still seeing these douchebags walking around trying to make their jaw line more pronounced by growing a quarter inch thick beard ?
This is a move right out of the white trash playbook .
Am I wrong or did Pittsburgh become the trend setting beacon of fashion and I just did n’t get the memo ?
What the hell happened ?
Maybe 5 years ago a chinstrap and tickets to the drag race might have scored you some chick ’s number .
I ’ll give you that , but enough is enough .
I know you have to live with the bad idea you tattooed around your bicep in the shape of some barbwire , but that does n’t mean you have to shave your face like an idiot .
You want to grow a beard ?
Fine , but do n’t walk out of the house looking like you drew on yourself with a sharpie .
Seriously , that ’s the kind of thing I would do to somebody who passes out at a party .
The first asshole gets a Hitler moustache , the second guy gets a chin strap and if there ’s a third and I ’m out of ideas I usually just take a dump in his hand .
So the next time you see one these jerks walking around with a chinstrap , do society a favor - point and laugh .
Take a picture of them and send it to your friends so they can point and laugh .
If you have a vagina , run , get it as far away from these men as possible .
There is a cure for douchbaggery and it ’s called humiliation .
So by all means point , laugh .
You ’re allowed to : they ’re idiots .
Wingårdh Architects designed the VillAnn Residence in Gothenburg , Sweden .
From the architects :
A straight house on an oblique plot cause the architecture and the unobtrusive landscaping to twist the axis .
The parterres of the garden have also helped to allay the impression of the public highway traversing the lower part of the plot .
This house , designed for a builder and his wife , reflects the self - consciousness of a couple who do not balk at letting their personality be expressed in their building .
Like the two individuals for whom the house is built , the two volumes look out to sea , one of them a little more prudently over the other one ’s shoulder .
The pale concrete frame is followed through in a pale - stained , room - length solid Oregon pine for the flooring and fittings .
The glass wall crossing the edge of the roof beams creates a seamless contact between building and terrace .
This ends in a black concrete pool , the water of which is constantly flowing over the edge , becoming part of the building ’s façade .

We believe in ESP , ghosts , and angels over the scientific theory of evolution .
While science offers a wealth of rational explanations for natural phenomena , we often prefer to embrace the fantasies that reassured our distant ancestors .
And we 'll even go to war to protect our delusions against those who do not share them .
These are examples of what evolutionary psychologist Hank Davis calls " Caveman Logic . "
Although some examples are funny , the condition itself is no laughing matter .
In CAVEMAN LOGIC : THE PERSISTENCE OF PRIMITIVE THINKING IN A MODERN WORLD ( Prometheus Books , $ 19.98 ) , Davis encourages us to transcend the mental default settings and tribal loyalties that worked well for our ancestors back in the Pleistocene age .
Davis laments a modern world in which more people believe in ESP , ghosts , and angels than in evolution .
Superstition and religion get particularly critical treatment , although he argues that religion , itself , is not the problem but " an inevitable by - product of how our minds misperform . "
" Caveman Logic is a whirlwind tour through the deeper recesses of our evolved mind .
Hank Davis brings to bear cutting edge research from the cognitive sciences to reveal how mental tools designed to serve the needs of our ancient ancestors continue to exert an influence , both subtle and powerful , on human thought and behavior today , " said John Teehan , Associate Professor of Religion , Hofstra University and author of In the Name of God : The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Ethics and Violence .
Davis says CAVEMAN LOGIC : THE PERSISTENCE OF PRIMITIVE THINKING IN A MODERN WORLD is the product of more than two decades of pondering , teaching and writing about " the powerful influence of irrational , delusional thinking that is anchored to our Pleistocene - era brain circuitry . "
He asserts that much of this primitive thinking is supported by modern social institutions .
For example , a 2007 poll found that nearly 70 percent of Americans believe angels and demons are active forces in the world , while a 2009 survey concluded that only 39 percent believe in Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Even non-religious persons often thank God or " the heavens " in response to good news .
" Ways of thinking that were both reasonable and advantageous in caveman days become illogical -- and potentially destructive -- when they are overextended to modern times , " says Madeleine Van Hecke , author of Blind Spots : Why Smart People Do Dumb Things .
Maggie Jackson , author of Distracted : The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age adds , " Hank Davis reveals the deep roots of humanity 's weakness for superstitions , blind assumptions and primitive thinking , and shows how we can start to overcome ' caveman logic . ' "
Davis advocates a world in which " spirituality " is viewed as a dangerous rather than an admirable quality , and suggests ways in which we can overcome our innate predisposition toward irrationality .
Davis points out that , " biology is not destiny . "
Just as some of us succeed in watching our diets , resisting violent impulses , and engaging in unselfish behavior , we can learn to use critical thinking and the insights of science to guide individual effort and social action in the service of our whole species .

A common theme in conversations of the peak oil / limits to growth aware is '
What do I do '?
Just slightly less common is ' What do I do with my money ? '
The biggest difficulty in contemplating / deciding / acting towards a new paradigm is one does this while the old paradigm is still going strong , if only on the surface and the media .
In a temporary departure from usual Campfire topics , tonight 's discussion will revolve around the concept of investments , and the coming transition from the old finance based rules into new undefined territory .

Subject : So What the Hell Does One Do ?
Date : Aug 27 , 2009
______________________________________
Nate , I read your work in various venues and appreciate the thought that goes in it .
I have been peak oil aware for too many years , made some money , kept it and yet was too early .
What the hell does one do now ?
Specifically : Any thoughts on farmland ?
Farm income is going down , but I am looking at buying a good chunk - the offer is on my desk and as I am a broker I can buy it at wholesale - but will the odds of the land going down in monetary value be greater than the odds of it going up ?
I see the worst case scenario that I lose half my invested wealth in farmland , I see the best case scenario that I lose half my wealth invested in farmland and keep the rest at break - even .
Yeah , free advice is what it 's worth I guess .
But it is becoming exhausting trying to win this game .
And , if truth be known , I really do n't want to go live on a farm , sit on metaphorical beans , bullets , and band aids ; but as a retired doctor doing public medicine I also see a huge part of our society that just wo n't be able to cope post peak - and part of that society is the doctors in private practice .
Damn , I did everything right for retirement , actually made it there and now this little inconvenience of peak oil comes along ...

I rarely give investment advice , except to my closest friends and family .
Clearly there are logical market neutral themes that should prove advantageous over time to those who primarily care about such goals .
For example , long the low cost , low externality energy companies vs. short the companies making non-essential goods , long the companies that focus on top 10 % of social demographic vs short companies that rely on general consumer , etc .
However , other than needing to really understand someones objectives on risk , return , time frame , etc. , I have stopped giving investment advice for other reasons .
Firstly , I increasingly believe that a ) the tertiary wealth markers ( stocks , bonds , derivatives , etc. ) have decoupled so fantastically from primary ( energy , forests , materials , metals ) and secondary ( gasoline , lumber , tractors , blankets ) wealth and b ) the tertiary wealth markers due to excessive credit / debt / leverage are becoming more and more correlated to eachother , evidencing massive systemic risk and c ) the receding tide of cheap energy , cheap credit , and available leverage will leave behind a social stratification so extreme that governments will increasingly have to change the rules of the game - on the fly - to appease the various disenfranchised .
In other words , following fundamental macro based analysis will be increasingly akin to betting on a match of Jai Alai .
( You can bet on Jai Alai but its 50/50 whether you are choosing the side rigged to win ) .
I suspect the standard portfolio manager model of ' dollar average on dips ' , ' stocks return 10 % on average over the long run ' , ' some new technology will cause DJIA to be at 30,000 in 10 years ' , etc. is finished , though a majority of the players do n't yet realize it .
( the concept of differentiating primary , secondary and tertiary wealth was detailed in E.F.
Schumachers Small is Beautiful , but has origins as far back as Frederick Soddy 's Wealth , Virtual Wealth , and Debt " , in 1926 .
It remains a central tenet of Ecological Economics )
My second reason is more personal - the whole investment business is becoming a bit obscene , irrespective of whether one wins or loses , and I have decided ( for myself ) I 've spent too much of my finite life on something with little lasting meaning .
I suppose dealing with 80 + year old billionaires who never spent a penny but screamed at me when their $ 5 million monthly Treasury coupons did n't transfer to their banks on time gave me an early clue .
As such , let me approach this readers question from a different angle ....
Why do we invest ?
Wealth - any income that is at least one hundred dollars more a year than the income of one 's wife 's sister 's husband .
H. L. Mencken
We are genetically wired to respond to cultural cues to move up the mating ladder , as opposed to down .
Theories of sexual selection , relative fitness , etc. are robust in the animal kingdom and humans differ only in their expression of what constitutes successful competition during different socio-economic eras .
Our culture currently measures status many different ways - respect , reputation , intelligence , publication , accomplishment , notoriety , etc .
However , pecuniary wealth has , at least in the last two hundred or so years , functioned as a shortcut for moving up the social status ladder .
In short , investing in financial assets has been one avenue open to jumping up a few notches on the social status ladder , not to mention the other fun and novel experiences it enables .
Once obtained , paper assets widens the spigot of neurotransmitter cocktails matching the sensations our ancestors experienced as they themselves became successful at opportunities involving acquiring resources , mating and reproducing .
In sum , making money is promoted by our culture , and it feels good .
Losing money , or having no money versus our conspecifics , ( especially if we used to ) , feels bad ...;-)
Why do we care about risk and diversification ?
Our aversion to risk has evolutionary origins :
Kacelnik A , Bateson M 1996 .
Risky Theories - The Effects of Variance on Foraging Decisions
American Zoologist 36 ( 4 ) : 402-434 .
Here 's the abstract :
This paper concerns the response of foraging animals to variability in rate of gain , or risk .
Both the empirical and theoretical literatures relevant to this issue are reviewed .
The methodology and results from fifty - nine studies in which animals are required to choose between foraging options differing in the variances in the rate of gain available are tabulated ,
We found that when risk is generated by variability in the amount of reward , animals are most frequently risk - averse and sometimes indifferent to risk , although in some studies preference depends on energy budget .
In contrast , when variability is in delay to reward , animals are universally risk - prone .
A range of functional , descriptive and mechanistic accounts for these findings is described , none of which alone is capable of accommodating all aspects of the data .
Risk - sensitive foraging theory provides the only currently available explanation for why energy budget should affect preference .
In essence we prefer the highest return per unit time , adjusted by its risk ( measured in financial assets by standard deviation ) .
Basically , in the above graphic , we will prefer opportunities , ( ceteris paribus ) that move right to left ( less risk ) and move bottom to top ( more reward ) .
( In animals , ' reward ' is measured primarily by calories ( energy ) .
However in humans , the only species to ( significantly ) use exosomatic energy ( the average american consumes almost 240,000 calories daily - only about 3,000 via food - the rest on transportation , entertainment , waste , etc. ( 1 ) .
It is our desires , our infrastructure , our marketing , and our social cues that dictate the exogenous ( out of body ) energy ' needs ' . )
Let 's take a look at boilerplate business school finance - the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Efficient Frontier - the foundations of asset allocation and investing .
Capital Asset Pricing Model and Efficient Frontier
In the above graphic , imagine hundreds or even thousands of points below the blue line as investable ( financial ) assets .
The green dot represents Treasury bills - a smallish return , but zero risk .
To get a higher return , we must move from left to right on the graph , taking on incrementally higher risk .
An investor will always prefer Asset A to Asset B , because for the same return , A has less risk .
Similarly , an investor will always prefer Asset D over Asset C as for the same risk , D has a higher return .
The risk of a portfolio includes systematic risk , ( considered undiversifiable ) , and unsystematic risk ( or diversifiable risk ) .
Systematic risk refers to the risk common to all risky securities - i.e. market risk .
Unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets and can be reduced by including a greater number of assets in a portfolio .
The CAPM assumes that the risk - return profile of a portfolio can be optimized - i.e. the lowest possible amount of risk for the chosen level of return .
This occurs by adding uncorrelated assets into a portfolio .
All such optimal portfolios , i.e. , one for each level of return , make up what is called the efficient frontier ( shown in red ) .
A rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded .
Other than some statistics and top notch job interviews , you just saved 80 k in tuition for MBA school ...;-)
Peak Oil CAPM
The problem of exponential growth against a finite resource base has manifested in an orgy of tertiary marker wealth creation ( and in so doing , sending a false signal through the socio- economic system that energy supply was being increased on its own merits ) .
We do n't really know how far removed 2,000 trillion of claims on 55 trillion of global GDP , itself heavily financially skewed , is from the reality of primary ( natural resource ) wealth ( 2 ) .
I suspect it is greater than an order of magnitude , but it might be less , if there is a high degree of notional offsettables .
But derivatives and other contracts notwithstanding , we have north of $ 200 trillion of money as debt circulating worldwide , all in need of servicing .
At some point , and I will argue in upcoming analyses , this point is now , the debt becomes unserviceable .
In other words , what we think of as wealth , at least many of us , and much of it , is not .
The interesting aspect is that although the debt will never be able to be serviced , the perception that it will be serviced is still with us .
The Capital Asset Pricing Model taught in business schools is predicated on the assumption that treasury bills ( the risk free asset ) are , by definition , not correlated with any other asset , and , by definition ' risk free ' .
It is quite likely that the perception of these assumptions , or possibly the assumptions themselves , end up being proven false in coming years .
I drew the ' Peak Oil ' CAPM to illustrate lower expected return , and higher expected risk across the board for tertiary marker assets .
Ronald Inglehart of the World Values Survey verbalized the above graph by stating that after meeting basic needs , lifestyle choices make up the majority of the difference in the GNP spectrum , and lower energy lifestyles do just about as well as high energy lifestyles ( indeed , the USA uses 38 times the primary energy of the Phillipines but gets equivalent rankings of ' very happy ' - any of you that have lived or worked abroad will intuit this ) .
A Future Interpretation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model , incoporating Natural Capital ,
As such the Capital Asset Pricing Model , the foundation of modern finance , can only remain a valid model if it is reapplied with wider non-financial boundaries : substituting natural , built , human and social capital for the tertiary financial markers of stocks , bonds , commodities , and cash .
The risk free rate in such a model would be ' basic needs ' ( food , water , shelter , companionship , meaning , etc . )
Above this level ( * which I marked in yellow because it is NOT risk free in reality , but still could be acquired with little risk to an individual ) , one would gradually increase their risk adjusted return ( in an evolutionary sense ) , by having a well diversified portfolio during their life made up of reasonably equal proportions of built , human / social , and natural capital , only then supplemented by financial .
As a social species that implicitly values rank , we will never all be equal , and our makeup virtually guarantees we will continue to compete for status .
But channeling our penchant for competition towards the human and social capital areas will be better for us and better for our planet than competing for natural or built capital ( 3 ) .
Still , we will need those things as a foundation for our basic needs , and a springboard for higher pursuits .
The main takeaway here is not a formal model but for folks to think beyond digits / finance in measuring their own , and our planets ' wealth ' .
The Four ( non-financial ) Capitals ( description )
There is going to be an upheaval in our social structure in the intermediate ( and possibly near ) term future .
It will not entirely invert , as many of those near the top got there due to skill , smarts and ambition , and if the rules change , they will quickly adapt , and these attributes will in relatively quick order reshuffle them to the top .
The point however , is that post peak oil / credit , piles of financial wealth may not represent the free pass to the upper social crust they have the past few generations :
a ) there is a non-zero possibility of a debt jubilee , new currency , or financial reset where fortunes could literally disappear overnight ,
b ) in a world that eventually must move away from increased specialization , globalization , and efficiency , and more towards local / regional scale , redundancy , and resiliency , the forward thinking human will need to diversify beyond financial assets , and into a portfolio of real capital .
It stands to reason the more uncertain the future becomes , the more one will need uncorrelated assets for proper diversification .
Financial capital in reality has always just been one part of an individuals broader asset allocation - this fact is just likely to be more publicly intuited even if the financial academy does n't acknowledge their methods measuring risk and wealth are broken .
Individuals , neighborhoods , cities , regions , and countries that recognize this trend earlier will likely have advantages .
After all , we are animals seeking the best perceived risk adjusted reward .
On that , the safest advice I can give Pat , or anyone how to increase their wealth is an idea borrowed from Buddhist philosophy - reduce the denominator in the equation Wealth = Assets / Desires .
This is possibly the only strategy that will increase ones wealth in virtually all future scenarios .
Lastly , however , our perception of wealth utilizes neural reward pathways linked with wanting , not having .
Therefore , irrespective of how we change our cultural definition of wealth , as individuals we will still ' want ' more of whatever wealth is than our conspecifics .
Only when some unknown majority of people realize their own wealth will suffer if we continue to compete for finite resources , will the Tragedy of the Commons problem start to resolve .
Barring such a cultural transformation , we 'll continue in a series of socio- economic boom - busts where the striving for the upper levels draws down our collective primary wealth .
That 's a lot of risk for a species .
==================================================================
CAMPFIRE QUESTIONS :
1 ) How many of you experience similar feelings with respect to investments as Pat does ?
2 ) Will monetary wealth hold its value to the next generation ?
3 ) How can people that understand the implications above most effectively move more towards a portfolio of natural , social , built and human capital when we all still live in a culture that sends strong cues favoring financial ( marker ) capital ?
4 ) Will we ever get social / media cues that frown upon excessive financial wealth , but instead laud men and women with skills , knowledge and generosity ?
If so , would you give up / allocate some of your money to increase your standing in these other areas ?
5 ) Natural capital , other than land with water , trees , soil etc. can't be directly ' owned ' other than by all of us .
How would a change in values towards real capital accelerate awareness of the public commons ?
6 ) Other .

(1) In 2004 , Americans consumed about 342,700,000 [ 3.4e8 ]
Btu per capita , per year . [ http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1c.xls ]
This converts to about 86,358,951 [ 8.6e7 nutritional ] calories per year [ http://www.onlineconversion.com/energy.htm ] or 86,358,951 / 365 = 236,599 [ 2.37e5 nutritional ] calories per day .
But humans only require something like 3,000 [ nutritional ] calories [ of food energy ] per day to survive , so it seems we ( very roughly ) use something like 235,000 [ 2.35e5 nutritional ] calories per day , per capita for non-nutritional purposes .

Here 's what the 60 Plus Association has to say on their website :
The 60 Plus Association is a
non-partisan seniors advocacy group with a free enterprise , less
government , less taxes approach to seniors issues .
60 Plus has set
ending the federal estate tax and saving Social Security for the

60 Plus is often viewed as the
conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons
( AARP ) .
While the 60 Plus Association is happy to take government money for their own health care , heaven forbid it should be extended to others .
But I 'm guessing the geniuses responsible for the organization do n't know that medicare and medicaid are government programs .
DENVER --
As Troy Tulowitzki headed for second , the words of teammate Brad Hawpe echoed in his head .
" We were sitting on the bench together and he was telling me , ' If you get anywhere close to getting a triple you better go , ' " Tulowitzki said .
" I honestly think if it were n't for him I would have stopped at second . "
Tulowitzki gambled and sprinted for third on his hit down the left - field line in the seventh , sliding headfirst into third to complete the first cycle in his young career .
He had a night to remember , getting five hits with a career - high seven RBIs to help Colorado beat the Chicago Cubs 11 - 5 on Monday night .
" That 's a pretty good career for some guys , " Rockies manager Jim Tracy said .
" Just a tremendous offensive performance . "
Tulowitzki , who had a home run denied in the first video review at Coors Field , came to bat to lead off the seventh a triple shy of the franchise 's fifth cycle and first in nine years .
He laced a 3 - 2 pitch down the left - field line and slid headfirst into the bag before third baseman Jake Fox could corral the throw from left .
" I thought I was going to be out , but I keep going back to Hawpe , " he said .
" He said he would have been upset if I did n't try . "
Tulowitzki hit his 21st homer in the first , singled in the second and doubled in the fourth in his first three at - bats .
He added a two - run single in the eighth .
When he came out to play the field in the eighth inning , the crowd of 34,485 gave him a standing ovation .
" I do n't know if I 'll ever have a game like this ever in my career , " he said .
" Not too many people can say they had a cycle in the big leagues . "
It was the sixth cycle in the majors this season .
" He achieved something that 's not easy to do , " teammate Todd Helton said .
" I 'm proud of him and very happy to be able to have a front - row seat to watch that tonight . "
Helton had three singles to extend his hitting streak to 15 games and Jorge De La Rosa struck out 11 for the Rockies , who took three of the four games in the wraparound series with the Cubs .
Tulowitzki had a chance at more RBIs , but a review of his high fly ball in the second inning went against him .
With the bases loaded , Tulowitzki hit a fastball from Esmailin Caridad deep down the left - field line and it was ruled foul by third base umpire Bill Welke .
Rockies manager Jim Tracy asked the umpires to look at the replay and the call was upheld under review .
" That might have been too high over the foul pole for even replay to grab a hold of , " Tracy said .
" I give them credit for not objecting to my request .
If he would have rejected the request I would have been in a little bit difference place for the rest of the night . "
The review of the play took 4 minutes , 10 seconds .
" They did everything they possibly could , there just was n't enough evidence to change it , " Tulowitzki said .
" They called it foul from the beginning so they had to stick with it . "
The delay did n't bother Tulowitzki .
Two pitches later he lashed a two - run single to left to give Colorado a 6 - 0 lead in a busy second inning that knocked Cubs starter Tom Gorzelanny out of the game .
With one out Barmes hit his 16th home run to make it 3 - 0 .
Yorvit Torrealba followed with a double and De La Rosa singled to put runners on the corner .
Dexter Fowler followed with a hard grounder off of Gorzelanny 's right foot , scoring Torrealba .
Gorzelanny ( 4 - 2 ) suffered a contusion on the foot and had to leave the game .
" X - rays showed no damage , " Cubs manager Lou Piniella said .
" We will re-evaluate him when we get home . "
Chicago got its first run on Geovany Soto 's leadoff homer in the sixth .
The Cubs had their chances against De La Rosa ( 10 - 8 ) , who struggled early but last 7 2/3 innings .
They left the bases loaded in the first and second innings , but after that De La Rosa settled down .
He retired 10 of 11 batters in the middle innings and struck out the side in the fourth .
He loaded the bases in the eighth before Rafael Betancourt retired pinch - hitter Aaron Miles to get out of the jam .
Game notes
De La Rosa 's 11 strikeouts were one short of his career high set May 9 against Florida .
... Chicago left 13 runners on base for the second straight game .
... Cubs 3B Aramis Ramirez ( left shoulder soreness ) was out of the lineup Monday .
Piniella said Ramirez will be seen by the team doctor in Chicago on Tuesday .
...
An MRI Monday on Rockies RHP Aaron Cook right big toe revealed the joint is inflammed .
He will pitch a bullpen session Thursday and is scheduled to start Saturday in Florida .
Rookie Jhoulys Chacin will start in his place Tuesday .
Hubble Space Telescope Captures Rare Jupiter Collision
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has taken the sharpest visible - light picture yet of atmospheric debris from an object that collided with Jupiter on July 19 .
NASA scientists decided to interrupt the recently refurbished observatory 's checkout and calibration to take the image of a new , expanding spot on the giant planet on July 23 .
Discovered by Australian amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley , the spot was created when a small comet or asteroid plunged into Jupiter 's atmosphere and disintegrated .
The only other time such a feature has been seen on Jupiter was 15 years ago after the collision of fragments from comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
" Because we believe this magnitude of impact is rare , we are very fortunate to see it with Hubble , " said Amy Simon - Miller of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Details seen in the Hubble view shows a lumpiness to the debris plume caused by turbulence in Jupiter 's atmosphere .
"
The new Hubble images also confirm that a May servicing visit by space shuttle astronauts was a big success .
" This image of the impact on Jupiter is fantastic , " said U.S. Sen.
Barbara A. Mikulski , D - Md. , chairwoman of the Commerce , Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee .
" It tells us that our astronauts and the ground crew at the Goddard Space Flight Center successfully repaired the Hubble telescope .
I 'm so proud of them and I can't wait to see what 's next from Hubble .
" For the past several days , Earth - based telescopes have been trained on Jupiter .
To capture the unfolding drama 360 million miles away , Matt Mountain , director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , gave observation time to a team of astronomers led by Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
" Hubble 's truly exquisite imaging capability has revealed an astonishing wealth of detail in the impact site , " Hammel said .
" By combining these images with our ground - based data at other wavelengths , our Hubble data will allow a comprehensive understanding of exactly what is happening to the impact debris .
" Simon - Miller estimated the diameter of the impacting object was the size of several football fields .
The force of the explosion on Jupiter was thousands of times more powerful than the suspected comet or asteroid that exploded over the Siberian Tunguska River Valley in June 1908 .
The image was taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 .
The new camera , installed by the astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in May , is not yet fully calibrated .
While it is possible to obtain celestial images , the camera 's full power has yet to be seen .
" This is just one example of what Hubble 's new , state - of - the - art camera can do , thanks to the STS - 125 astronauts and the entire Hubble team , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
" However , the best is yet to come . "

I ’ve read a couple great blogs lately about handling failure during presentations ( for example : Rands in Respose ) .
The essence is that while you should prepare to succeed , your audience is more likely to remember how you handle failure when it ( inevitably ) happens .
Working with computers and giving presentations you will inevitably have a case where your hardware or software lets you down .
If you ’re giving tech demos or doing live coding , you are pushing these risks to the breaking point .
When failure happens , you must be prepared to move forward with humor , engagement , and a minimal loss of impact .
If you do so , your audience will likely not only forgive you but grant you positive favor .
I attended a Youth Group presentation today where several high school seniors were giving speeches and performing in front of a large audience .
While everyone did great and the speeches and performances ranged from good to great , one young man stood out .
He performed in the very first musical number , playing guitar and singing .
In a critical part of the song where he was supposed to solo , the guitar microphone slipped out of the mic holder .
He calmly stopped playing , clipped the mic back in , tossed a quick phrase to the girl playing piano behind him , and completed the solo without getting even slightly flustered .
Amazing poise .
That ’s how it ’s done .
I ’ve seen many far more experienced presenters ( and myself included ) hit a technical snag and tunnel into the problem , instead staying engaged to the audience .
I remember a time giving a presentation where I had a question about the difference between the way two components handled data ordering .
I tried three attempts to answer this question ( with no apparent success ) and then ( foolishly ) thought I could quickly tweak an existing demo to show the answer .
I quickly discovered that I did n’t know the API as well as I thought and could not get the code even to compile .
I ultimately bailed out but there was no saving face at that point .
[ I damn well worked through the solution that night though and understood where I was confused ! ]
I should have shut down the line of questioning after the second query from the guy and never tried to live code the answer .
It was a good question and worth answering , but once you ’ve given one good answer , there is rarely percentage in trying to satisfy one person in the middle of a talk .
If it ’s one person , ask them to talk to you at the end .
Sometimes more than one person is confused .
In that case , you ’re probably to blame and it ’s worthwhile to clear up the confusion ( and fix your talk later ) .
Sometimes it ’s hard to tell whether you ’re in a 1 - person or general problem – if so , poll the group .
It ’s quick to ask who else has the same question .
No hands means move on , many hands means slow up .
Circling back to the young man from above , when it was his turn to present , he got up and engaged the audience directly with humor .
He spoke not from the paper but to the audience , clearly ad - libbing some of the prepared speech , which told a story of searching and ultimately finding answers .
At many levels , I found his presentation inspiring .
A group of journalists were kept as hostages by a bunch of Southern looking guys dressed in military uniform .
Well , almost .
It is a new experience one can get in Chelyabinsk city , Russia in the recently opened special courses of “ How to behave during if you was taken as a hostage ” .
First a bus full of people is being stopped in the middle of nowhere by a bunch of Arabic people yelling “ Allakh Akbar ” each and every five seconds .
Those are not real terrorists , but Russian SWAT soldiers carefully picked by appearance – with Southern roots so that they could resemble ethnical Chechen or Arabic threat .
“ Face to the ground ! ” was a command and all the “ civilians ” were forced down to the muddy field in all their good cloths and stayed such for quite a while .
“ We were treated really rough , no matter man or woman ” , remembers one journalist .
First , all the cameras and mobile phones were seized .
Firing from the real guns with real bullets .
Just to keep everyone intact .
After a while all men were searched again .
Those who had mobile phone hidden
somewhere in the pocket were convinced that they are wrong .

An independent inquiry into the Iraq war will be held in private , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told MPs .
Opposition parties - and many Labour MPs - have been calling for the probe since shortly after the 2003 invasion .
It will start next month and take at least a year , Mr Brown said .
It will not aim to " apportion blame " , he added .
The Tories said it " should have started earlier " and have public hearings .
The Lib Dems accused the PM of trying to " cover up the path " that led to war .
The inquiry will cover the period from July 2001 to July 2009 and be chaired by civil servant Sir John Chilcot , Mr Brown told MPs .
Security considerations
The government had been urged to hold the inquiry in public , but Mr Brown said he must take into account national security , and avoid damaging Britain 's military capability .
More than a million people demonstrated against the war in 2003
It was designed on a similar basis , he added , to the Franks inquiry into the 1982 Falklands War , and it would aim to identify " lessons learned " .
He added it would hear evidence in private so witnesses could be " as candid as possible " .
The prime minister said : " No British documents and no British witness will be beyond the scope of the inquiry . "
He said the final report would reveal " all but the most secret of information " and the " unprecedented " process would be " fully independent of government " .
But the prime minister was jeered by Conservative MPs when he announced the inquiry would take a year to report - beyond the date of the next general election .
Tory leader David Cameron said there was a danger the public would believe the process had been " fixed to make sure the government avoids having to face up to any inconvenient conclusions " .
Mr Cameron said membership of the inquiry " looks quite limited " and complained its terms of reference were " restrictive " , adding it should have taken place sooner .
' Public trust ' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg - who has always called for the inquiry to be held in public - said " the government must not be able to close the book on this war as it opened it - in secret " .
Mr Clegg added : " To rebuild public trust , this inquiry must be held in public . "
Sir John Chilcot , 70 , is a former permanent under-secretary of state at the Northern Ireland Office who sat on the Butler Inquiry into the intelligence on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Also on the panel are former diplomat Sir Roderick Lyne , crossbench peer Baroness Prashar and historians Sir Lawrence Freedman and Sir Martin Gilbert .

For the Scottish National Party , Dundee East MP Stewart Hosie told the Commons the decision to hold the inquiry in private was " the wrong thing to do " .
Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said Mr Brown had " misjudged the public mood " .
Mr Price added : " The government that tried to keep MPs expenses under wraps is now doing the same over Iraq . "
The Stop the War Coalition 's Lindsey German predicted the inquiry would produce " another bucket of whitewash " .
Rose Gentle - whose son Gordon was killed in action in Basra - said she would continue to lobby for a public inquiry .
She added : " We have fought and fought for this but it will be no use and it could all be for nothing behind closed doors . "
' Academic exercise ' Former prime minister Tony Blair would be willing to give evidence to the Iraq inquiry if he were asked to be a witness , the BBC understands .
A source close to Mr Blair said " if asked " , the former prime minister would " of course " appear before the probe , BBC political correspondent James Landale said .

In full : Brown 's statement UK fatalities in Iraq Nick Robinson 's blog Defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said he believed all those involved in the UK 's decision to go to war would be willing to give evidence voluntarily .
But ex-minister Clare Short , who resigned from the Cabinet over the post - war governance of Iraq , said the inquiry would be an " academic exercise " in which people could decline to answer questions they were n't happy with .
" It wo n't get to the bottom of things and people wo n't get the answers they want , " she told Channel 4 News .
The reasons for going to war in Iraq - including the now discredited claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which could be used within 45 minutes of an order being given - have been a source of long - standing controversy .
Two inquiries - the Hutton and Butler inquiries - have already been held into aspects of the Iraq war .

The Butler inquiry looked at intelligence failures before the war while the Hutton inquiry examined the circumstances leading to the death of former government adviser David Kelly .
In 2008 the government defeated Conservative attempts to force a public inquiry , saying it would be a " diversion " for UK troops serving in Iraq .
In February Justice Secretary Jack Straw vetoed the publication of minutes of cabinet meetings discussing the legality of the war in the run-up to the invasion .
In March David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said the government was committed to holding a " comprehensive " inquiry into the conduct of the war and its aftermath .

In a whole new breed of net roots activism , gaymers who play Warcraft will have their 5th Annual Proudmoore Pride Parade at noon server time on Saturday June 20 , 2009 !
The creators over at The Spreading Taint an LGBT gamers community are modeling Pride this year to be much like real life pride celebrations with contests , prizes , and most importantly , pride floats !
Last year Proudmoore Pride Parade :
It 's fair to say that when Warner Bros announced that McG would be directing the latest Terminator movie , the reaction they got was something of a shock .
Only the words " Brett Ratner " , hated despoiler of X - Men , could have provoked more vocal fanboy consternation .
But if the studio reeled slightly , McG himself was n't all that surprised .
People have been judging him before they 've even met him since he was a kid .
" It 's partly the name , " says McG , relaxing on a sofa in the offices of his production company Wonderland Sound & Vision .
" I mean what kind of asshole goes around calling himself McG ?
It 's real fun to hate that guy . "
Well it might partly be the name ( not , as most people assume , a piece of faux hip - hoppery but a long - standing nickname given to him by his parents when he was a child as a result of there being three Joe Nichols in the house : his middle name is McGinty which became McG ) .
But it also might be something to do with the films .
An ex-music video director who made his name with promos for Korn and Sugar Ray before moving on to high - profile commercials for Coke and Gap , his contribution to cinema runs to Charlie 's Angels ( 2000 ) , Charlie 's Angels : Full Throttle ( 2003 ) and We Are Marshall ( 2006 ) , a slightly soapy true tale of a sports tragedy whose only real surprise was Matthew McConaughey declining to remove his shirt .
None of it immediately suggests he 's the right guy to take the reins of James Cameron 's time - warping cyborg epic .
" Oh yeah , I was completely aware of the fact that the reaction was ' fuck this Charlie 's Angels guy ! ' " he declares , " but I 'm willing to let the work do the talking .
I 'm tired of being the cheerleader for my films .
I 'm no stranger to being the long shot .
My whole life has been from a place of disadvantage .
I 've got to the point where I do n't give a fuck . "
Terminator Salvation got a slug of unwanted publicity when the now infamous Christian Bale flame - out hit the internet .
McG declines to comment any further than he already has , but points out that movie sound stages can be stressful places where creative battles sometimes become heated .
Particularly , it seems , on his sound - stages .
" I 'm reintroducing the fist - fight to movie sets , " he smiles .
" I do n't think there 's been a film I 've made where there has n't been some kind of physical fight .
I mean , I 've been headbutted by an A - list star .
Square in the head .
An inch later and my nose would have been obliterated . "
Will he be revealing any names ?
" Nah , I probably should n't , " he smiles .
" But it was Bill Murray .
Y'know , it 's a passionate industry . "
Complicating McG's life even further is what he describes as a " long - standing broad spectrum anxiety disorder " .
This is no trivial slice of SoCal psychobabble .
It 's a real condition and it's cost him dearly , at one point threatening to completely derail his career .
In 2004 , after a couple of years of on - again - off - again preparation , he was set to direct JJ Abrams 's screenplay of Superman : Flyby , scheduled to be shot in Australia , only to find himself , at the last moment , in the throes of an epic anxiety attack and unable to board the Warner jet , which was pretty much idling on the runway .
" I learned a lot about myself in that moment , " he says ruefully .
" It really was the lowest point in my professional life and utterly embarrassing .
I 've got it under control now but I 'm like the fat guy who loses 200 pounds .
He knows if he loses focus he 'll return to who he was in a heartbeat . "
It must go towards calming his nerves that Terminator Salvation is as certain a box office hit as they come .
Is he relishing the thought of proving a lifetime 's worth of naysayers wrong ?
" Nah , I do n't think that way .
I 've been kind of humbled enough by my own neuroses along the way .
I 've experienced too much humiliation and depression and sadness to grab my cock and begin slapping people in the head with it .
I have a great deal of empathy for what people go through .
My brother died last year of a drug overdose , which was the shittiest thing that ever happened to me .
People always get the wrong idea about me .
There 's this idea that I 'm this sunny guy living in California making little pop videos and fucking beautiful women - my life is n't like that . "
Not for the first time , it seems , everyone is wrong about McG .
• Terminator Salvation is out on Fri
Although they say those who fell ill in Jilin could have been poisoned , psychogenic experts outside China say it is also possible for some to have been affected by toxic fumes while others exhibited psychosomatic illnesses set off by real poisonings .
Robert E. Bartholomew , a sociologist at the International University College of Technology in Malaysia , said the government ’s handling of the episode , including the ban on reports in the news media , might be fueling paranoia .
“ The best way to handle psychogenic illness is to be open and transparent , which tends to dissipate concerns , ” said Mr. Bartholomew , a co-author of “ Outbreak !
The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior . ”
If it is indeed a case of mass hysteria , he said , it would be the largest instance of workplace psychogenic illness on record .
The episode is not Jilin ’s first experience with the perils of aniline .
In 2005 , an explosion at another factory that produced the volatile substance killed eight people and sent 100 tons of deadly benzene and nitrobenzene into the Songhua River , tainting drinking water for millions of people downstream .
Public anxiety was high even before the new $ 125 million aniline plant opened in early April .
During a test run last September , two security guards standing in front of the textile plant were overcome by fumes .
Connell paid them compensation , although it is unclear what adjustments were made to the manufacturing process and , more important , the venting of its airborne byproducts , a mix of carbon monoxide , hydrogen sulfide and nitrogen oxide .
Shortly after production began , Li Hongwei , a 34 - year - old Connell worker , collapsed and died on the job .
Although rumors suggested that he had been poisoned , factory officials insist that Mr. Li succumbed to a heart attack .
His family , which received a compensation package that included a job for his wife and a monthly $ 200 stipend for his mother and son , declined to talk to reporters .
After Mr. Li’s death , the authorities forced Connell to halt production for a month .
But in early June , not long after it resumed , Wang Shulin , a 38 - year - old technician at the textile mill , went into convulsions while on the job .
He was sent to the hospital but died just as doctors were administering a CT scan , according to co-workers .
The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage .
Image Textile workers were stricken in the industrial city of Jilin .

Factory officials insist that Mr. Wang ’s death had nothing to do with chemical exposure .
Such assurances have done little to quiet fears that Connell continues to taint the air .
Li Jingfeng , 35 , an electrician at an ethanol plant that abuts the aniline plant , said chemical detectors at his factory had gone off five or six times in the last month , forcing workers to evacuate .
“ Everyone is nervous about what ’s coming out of that place , ” he said .

Eco-friendly materials + slick design + light as a feather = one INCREDIBLE pair of shoes !
That ’s the formula END Footwear ( END stands for Environmentally Neutral Designs ) applies to its shoe - making process and the result is way too wonderful to miss !
I received a pair of END Stumptown 10’s , and let me tell you firsthand , they ’re absolutely AMAZING !
END Footwear is definitely the new kid on the block , having only entered the shoe market late in 2008 .
Since then , however , they ’ve been taking the performance shoe world by storm !
Just this past month , for example , the END Footwear OTG won Runner ’s World “ Best Debut ” award .
The END Stumptown 12 oz ( not the 10 oz , that I have ) also won Runner ’s World “ Best Trail Running Shoe Debut ” in April .
Check out TreeHugger ’s review of the END Stumptown 12 .
Basically what I ’m saying is that the eco-friendly and uber - green methods and materials used in the shoes from END Footwear are taking the shoe world by storm !
Just wait , if you have n’t heard of them yet … you will soon !
What Makes The END Stumptown 10 So Great ?
124 hands used to build this shoe ( that ’s a 50 % human impact reduction )
Single mold , 25 % recycled carbon rubber outsole
10 % recycled EVA midsole
Reduced amount of foam by over 50 %
25 % bamboo infused linings in the collar and tongue
100 % recycled PET laces and webbing
Vegan designed
Women ’s designs will no doubt be deemed “ super cute ” by the she - folk ( see the bottom 2 pictures at right )
Learn more about END themselves :
You can find the END Stumptown 10 ( and all other END Footwear shoes ) at many retail locations and online vendors around the U.S .
The Stumptown 10 ’s cost about $ 70 ( whether they be men ’s OR women’s ) .
That ’s a VERY affordable price , especially given the over - inflated price tag of many eco-friendly products .
My Personal Experience In The Stumptown 10’s
I ’ve been following the awesomeness that is END Footwear since late last year .
A few weekends ago I saw them in a retail store for the first time .
I tried on the Stumptown 10 ’s in a half size too big and too small ( since the store did n’t have the 11.5 that I needed .
I contacted END to ask where I could find an 11.5 and they offered to send me a pair for review .
Wow !
Let me just say that these shoes are unlike anything you ’ve ever put on .
The shoe seems to conform to your foot for a custom fit and then seems to disappear as if you ’re not even wearing one .
They ’re so light it ’s tough to even detect them on your feet !
I ’ve worked out , run sprints , taken a few long walks , and boxed in these shoes so far and they are outstanding !
The support , lateral movement , ability to “ cut ” quickly , and comfort of this shoe have been superb thus far .
The only qualm that a person might have with this shoe ( though it ’s not an issue to me ) is that the lack of padding in the upper shoe results in feeling some of the elements of the shoe upper itself .
No big deal .
It ’s so light you ’ll no longer notice it in a matter of moments .
Do your feet a favor and invest in some uber - green and incredibly priced shoes by END Footwear !
Burgers Made Me Dumb
The downside to working as a food writer
Illustration : Jay Taylor
Long before Super Size Me , the 2004 documentary about a McDonald ’s binge , I knew that a steady diet of hamburgers would systematically destroy my heart , my liver , my cardiovascular system , and my sex appeal .
But no movie or medical study could prepare me for what it would do to my brain .
For 65 days this summer , I ate basically nothing but burgers .
A lot of them were excellent ( see Under the Bun : The Best Burgers in Chicago ) ; some were not ( see my refrigerator , second shelf from the bottom ) .
All of them were beef , however , and the onslaught of red meat did what drugs and alcohol and fatherhood could not :
It made me stupid .
Since my “ research ” began back in April at Flub A Dub Chubs , a hole in the wall on North Broadway , I ’ve spaced my grandmother ’s 90th birthday , hit a parked car across the street from Jury ’s , and spent an entire workday with my fly open .
Then there was the little incident in Indiana involving sunscreen and a toothbrush .
But let ’s not get into that .
Armed with nothing more than a C in high - school biology , my laptop , and a history of cyberchondria , I sought medical answers online .
Fifteen minutes later , while finishing my leftovers from Kuma ’s , I concluded that I was not permanently stupid — I had developed a mild case of cognitive dysfunction syndrome .
CDS ( a.k.a. brain fog ) can be caused by anything from mercury poisoning to constipation and leads to confusion , difficulty concentrating , and forgetfulness .
It also appears mainly in dogs .
The warning signs described online sounded familiar : aimless wandering ( did this at Epic Burger ) , inappropriate vocalization ( Moody’s ) , and sudden loss of appetite ( Boston Blackie’s ) .
One night , a frozen turkey fell from my fridge and bonked my noggin , and I barely felt it .
I had literally become a numbskull .
That ’s when I knew , without the aid of scientific proof : Saturated fats had eroded the connections between neurons in my brain .
To keep such connections flexible , the Alzheimer ’s Association website recommends mental challenges such as jigsaw puzzles , crosswords , or sudoku .
The Alzheimer ’s Association is , in my opinion , more reputable than CDSinDogs.com , so I gave it a shot .
After successfully conquering my toddler ’s 30 - piece Thomas the Tank Engine jigsaw in just under four minutes , I moved on to sudoku .
Confused , I ended up playing tic - tac - toe against myself in the boxes .
( I cheated and still tied myself . )
Forty - four minutes into the crossword puzzle , I got distracted while Googling a clue about Norman Fell and spent the rest of the afternoon watching Three ’s Company bloopers on YouTube .
Tail between my legs , I returned to CDSinDogs.com , where I read about a wonder drug called Anipryl , sometimes prescribed by veterinarians for CDS .
I do n’t know any vets , so while drooling onto my plate at TopNotch Beefburgers , I called up my brother - in - law , a professor of emergency medicine at Penn .
He asked for my symptoms .
Sluggishness , sweats , irritation , confusion .
“ That sounds an awful lot like menopause , ” he said .
“ Has your vagina been particularly dry lately ? ”
Then he hung up .
Next I consulted a gastroenterologist I play basketball with .
Would it be smart and / or ethical for him to prescribe me Anipryl ?
I asked .
“ Or , ” he said , “ you could just stop eating burgers . ”
Three weeks and another 23 burgers later , I finally did .
My recovery so far has been excruciatingly slow .
These days , I celebrate small victories , like the fact that I can once again carry my kid in from the car without getting winded .
Trouble is , I keep taking him to the wrong apartment .

A Victorian woman has been placed on the sex offender 's register for life after being jailed for sexually abusing four girls .
County Court judge Michael Patrick Bourke said 22 - year - old Alicia Storrie 's crimes against her victims , aged 12 to 15 , were exploitative and damaging .
" This was ... prolonged predatory and grooming behaviour against young and vulnerable girls , " he said .
Storrie , of Portland , pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and five of performing an indecent act with a child under 16 .
The court heard she assaulted the girls between 2004 and 2008 at various locations in the Portland and Warrnambool area in south - west Victoria .
July 1 ( Reuters ) - Fitch Ratings said U.S. credit card losses hit a record 10.44 percent in June , squeezing profit margins for credit card securitizations to a 10 - year low , the Financial Times reported .
Fitch said profit from off - balance sheet vehicles backed by credit loans in June fell below the 5 percent threshold for the first time since November 1998 , the paper said .
A spokesperson at Fitch said the report would be issued later on Wednesday .
Last week , Moody ’s Investors Services said U.S. monthly credit card charge off rate -- the percentage of debt it does not expect to be repaid -- surpassed 10 percent and hit a sixth straight record high in May .
Credit card companies enjoyed hefty gains during the credit boom , but are now losing billions as debt - burdened Americans lose jobs and default on credit card payments .

ALBANY — A man who was forcibly sedated so his body could be searched for drugs that were never found will receive $ 125,000 under an out - of - court settlement reached recently with Albany County and Albany Medical Center Hospital .
The settlement stems from a federal lawsuit filed two years ago by Tunde Clement , an ex-convict arrested by sheriff 's investigators on March 13 , 2006 , at the Albany bus terminal .
Clement was carrying a backpack when he stepped off a bus from New York City and was quickly confronted by investigators who suspected he may be carrying drugs .
Clement , 35 , who police claim had an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court in a neighboring city , was handcuffed and taken to a police station where he was strip - searched .
No contraband was found , so Clement was taken to Albany Med , where doctors forcibly sedated him with powerful drugs against his will .
Sheriff 's investigators did not obtain a search warrant for the procedure , and hospital officials did not require them to produce one .
Police and hospital officials considered the matter a " medical emergency . "
While Clement was under sedation , a camera was inserted in his rectum , he was forced to vomit and his blood and urine were tested for drugs and alcohol .
Scans of his digestive system were performed using X - ray machines , according to hospital records obtained by the Times Union .
Clement spent more than 10 hours in custody before being released on an appearance ticket for resisting arrest — a charge that was later thrown out by an Albany City Court judge .
" I think the settlement speaks for itself , " said John F. Queenan , Clement 's attorney in the federal lawsuit .
Clement 's suit claimed his civil rights were violated .
He filed the federal complaint against Albany Med and several doctors and nurses , and also sued Albany County and Sheriff James Campbell , Inspector John Burke , who heads the narcotics squad that arrested Clement , and eight investigators assigned to Burke 's unit .
He claimed he was a victim of assault and battery when officials strapped him down and injected him with drugs against his will and with no medical need or emergency .
After being led from the bus station in handcuffs , Clement was taken to a holding cell in the county Judicial Center .
He was forced to strip naked , squat and cough as investigators wrongly concluded he was hiding drugs inside his body .
He was then taken to the emergency room .
Medical records indicate a doctor called the hospital 's risk management director to assess the liability exposure of what they were about to do .
People under arrest normally cannot be forcibly sedated without a court order unless they are in imminent danger , such as when a bag of drugs bursts inside them and they have a seizure or fall unconscious .
The hospital 's records indicate Clement was behaving normally and showed no signs of any medical emergency .
" Spoke to Shirley of Risk Management , " a physician wrote , documenting the medical decision - making that day .
" OK to treat , sedate & remove FOB ( foreign object body ) against ( patient 's ) will despite his personal refusal . "
The following month Clement received a $ 6,792 bill from Albany Med for the procedures .
Hospital records indicate the final diagnosis as " hemorrhoids . "
" Every step of the way there was a factual basis for everything that was done by the law enforcement personnel in the case from the initial stop , and learning there was an arrest warrant , and then being advised there was a medical emergency , " said Thomas J. O'Connor , an attorney for Investigator Douglas Vogel , who is assigned to the narcotics unit .
" They were afraid for his life . "
Lawyers for the hospital and Albany County could not be reached .
The county 's share is $ 65,000 .
The sheriff 's department 's stop - and - frisk tactics at the downtown bus station have drawn harsh criticism from defense attorneys and civil rights advocates .
Eight years ago , the state 's highest court issued a searing rebuke of their methods while overturning the conviction of a passenger who'd been arrested carrying three ounces of cocaine .
The Court of Appeals said it was improper for the investigators to board buses from New York City and flash their badges , waiting for passengers to react .
Now , sheriff 's investigators said they no longer single out buses from New York City and simply approach passengers who appear to be acting suspiciously .
Clement was paroled from state prison last month after serving less than two years on a drug charge related to an arrest in Albany .

Yo Quiero No More : Taco Bell Spokes - Chihuahua Dies at 15 Gidget , famous for her Taco Bell ads , also acted alongside Reese Witherspoon .
July 22 , 2009  --
Her bug eyes and sweet face captured the hearts of millions of fast food enthusisats .
But more than 10 years after her face first graced a " Yo Quiero Taco Bell " ad , marketing 's top chihuahua has died at 15 from a stroke .
" It was very hard to lose her , " owner Karin McElhatton told ABCNews.com today .
" She was a great little dog . "
Gidget , a 12 - pound Hollywood dynamo in her prime , was propelled to stardom when Taco Bell 's advertisments hit in the late 1990s , featuring the feisty little dog as an insistent consumer of Taco Bell .
The phrase " Yo quiero Taco Bell " -- " I want Taco Bell " in a man 's voice -- spawned a series of commercial catchphrases for the chain including " Drop the chalupa " and made its mark on pop culture with T - shirts as well as a line of dolls and toys .
The ad campaign even touched off a chihuahua frenzy with would - be dog owners suddenly becoming very interested in the Mexican breed .
At the height of her popularity as the Taco Bell dog , Gidget traveled by limo and first - class in planes .
She even got a seat on the company 's private jet for a trip to Manhattan to open up the New York Stock Exchange .
Sue Chipperton , who trained Gidget for Studio Animal Services , said the pooch was constantly mobbed by people when she took Gidget out even though she was careful to make sure very few people knew Gidget was the real Taco Bell dog .
" They could come over and go ' Oh that looks like the Taco Bell dog ! ' "
Chipperton said .
But Gidget , who had lived with Chipperton for most of her life , was never coddled .
Chipperton said she was expected to follow commands and was never carried when she could walk on her own .
As a result , Chipperton said , " her personality was that of a big dog . "
While the commercials were hugely popular , they eventually nabbed the ire of Hispanic watchdog groups which claimed Taco Bell was promoting stereotypes and demanded the commercials be taken off the air .
The commercials ended so abruptly , Internet rumors that Gidget had met an untimely demise abounded leading to her very own entry on the myth - busting Web site Snopes.com .
Her owner , McElhatton , who owns Studio Animal Services which trains animals for film , television and adverstising , said Gidget -- unique for her " really huge ears " -- just knew when the camera was on her .
And she was very particular about who got her attention .
" She was very much a primadonna , " she said .
" If she did n't like you , she would n't give you the time of day . "

Taco Bell Spokes - dog Lived Like a Queen
Taco Bell issued a statement today saying , " We enjoyed working with Gidget and she will be missed by many .
Our deepest sympathies go out to her owners and fans . "
Gidget , who had previously done an ad campaign for Old Navy , kept working after her stint with Taco Bell ended .
Perhaps most notably , she acted alongside Reese Witherspoon in 2003 's " Legally Blonde 2 : Red , White and Blonde " as the mother of Bruiser , the prized chihuahua owned by Witherspoon 's character Elle Woods . <
" The whole world was all about her , " McElhatton said .
" We felt very blessed to have her as a part of our company . "
Chipperton said that while Gidget was on set she was very focused on her job , even finding her " mark " on the stage before being told to do so .
" She really did have a concept of being in front of the camera , " Chipperton said .
" She just had a sparkle . "
In later years , McElhatton said the spunky little dog enjoyed a daily sunbath and had her favorite toys and beds -- everything given to Gidget was simply the best .
" She lived , " McElhatton said , " like a queen . "
Now this is a campaign we can get behind .
It ’s sports - related and chick - tastic at the same time .

To put some context on a new estimate that puts this year 's federal deficit at $ 1.8 trillion , consider this :
That amount had never been spent by the federal government in a single year until 2000 , let alone borrowed .
That 's right .
As the decade began , the US government spent $ 1.8 trillion in a year for the first time .
Now it 's poised to spend that much in excess of its tax revenues .
The Treasury released the latest figures Wednesday , showing spending of about $ 3 trillion in the past 10 months , and revenues of only $ 1.74 trillion .
With two months to go in the fiscal calendar , the Obama administration is projecting that the imbalance will end up totaling $ 1.84 trillion , more than four times last year 's record - high .
The monthly deficit for July , also reported this week , came in a bit above what economists had expected .
The record red ink stems from familiar sources .
The government is spending prodigiously on stimulus , to lift the economy out of recession , and on rescuing the financial system from a credit crisis .
The cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan add to the tab .
Meanwhile , in recessions tax revenues tend to fall , and this one is no exception .
Government receipts were down about 6 percent in July from a year before .
The good news is that many of these forces are cyclical or temporary .
The massive stimulus wo n't last forever , and revenues from taxes should rise again when the economy grows healthier .
" We expect this year ’s deficit will be ... 10.5 percent of GDP [ gross domestic product ] and next year ’s to equal 8.3 percent of GDP as the spending spree and revenue weakness persist into the first year of the recovery , " Merrill Lynch economist Drew Matus wrote in a report last week .
The report predicted shrinking deficits after that , but warned that the " the long - term outlook remains poor . "
That 's the bad news , many economists agree .
The fiscal position will remain difficult , since baby boomers are already starting to retire in a wave that will grow more costly in coming years .
The soaring deficits have raised worries among foreign owners of US Treasury securities including the Chinese , the largest holder of such debt .
President Barack Obama 's economic team sought to reassure the Chinese during high - level talks last month that the administration is committed to reducing the deficits once the current economic and financial crises have been resolved .
The concern , however , is that rates could begin rising if foreigners lose confidence in the government 's ability to manage its debt burden .
In bond markets , prices fell Wednesday after a fairly weak auction of $ 23 billion in 10 - year Treasury notes .
The Treasury Department is auctioning a record $ 75 billion in debt this week .
The yield on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note , which moves opposite its price , rose to 3.75 percent from 3.70 percent ahead of the auction results and 3.67 percent late Tuesday .
The total public debt now stands at $ 11.6 trillion .
Interest payments on the debt cost $ 452 billion last year , the largest federal spending category after Medicare - Medicaid , Social Security , and national defense .

EVERYONE has had the experience .
You are confronted by a complex problem , with a not - so - obvious solution .
You pore over it , engrossed , but still the answer will not come .
Fearing you will be stuck for ever , you take a walk .
Then suddenly , from nowhere , there it is .
Eureka !
But did it really come from nowhere ?
A piece of research about to be published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience , by Joydeep Bhattacharya at Goldsmiths ' College in London and Bhavin Sheth at the University of Houston , in Texas , suggests that although people are not consciously aware of it , their brains have to be in a certain state for an insight to take place .
Moreover , that state can be detected electrically several seconds in advance of the “ aha ! ” moment itself .
The question of where insights come from has become a hot topic in neuroscience , despite the fact that they are not easy to induce experimentally in a laboratory .
Some researchers have used getting the punch line of a riddle as an example of an insightful outcome .
Critics complain , however , that this is less an insight than an “ outsight ” .
Other experiments have used word tasks .
In these , a person might be given three seemingly unrelated words , such as “ skirts ” , “ black ” and “ put ” , and asked to come up with a fourth that can link to each of the other three .
( In this case , “ out ” . )
But those tasks may say more about lexical ability than true insight .
Dr Bhattacharya and Dr Sheth have taken a third approach .
They have selected some brain - teasing but practical problems in the hope that these would get closer to mimicking real insight .
To qualify , a puzzle had to be simple , not too widely known and without a methodical solution .
The researchers then asked 18 young adults to try to solve these problems while their brainwaves were monitored using an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) .
A typical brain - teaser went like this .
There are three light switches on the ground - floor wall of a three - storey house .
Two of the switches do nothing , but one of them controls a bulb on the second floor .
When you begin , the bulb is off .
You can only make one visit to the second floor .
How do you work out which switch is the one that controls the light ?
That light - bulb moment
This problem , or one equivalent to it , was presented on a computer screen to a volunteer when that volunteer pressed a button .
The electrical activity of the volunteer 's brain ( his brainwave pattern , in common parlance ) was recorded by the EEG from the button 's press .
Each volunteer was given 30 seconds to read the puzzle and another 60 to 90 seconds to solve it .
If he had not done so in the time allotted , a hint appeared .
In the case of the light - switch puzzle , the suggestion was that you turn one switch on for a while , then turn it off .
Some people worked it out ; others did not .
The significant point , though , was that the EEG predicted who would fall where .
Those volunteers who went on to have an insight ( in this case that on their one and only visit to the second floor they could use not just the light but the heat produced by a bulb as evidence of an active switch ) had had different brainwave activity from those who never got it .
In the right frontal cortex , a part of the brain associated with shifting mental states , there was an increase in high - frequency gamma waves ( those with 47 - 48 cycles a second ) .
Moreover , the difference was noticeable up to eight seconds before the volunteer realised he had found the solution .
Dr Sheth thinks this may be capturing the “ transformational thought ” ( the light - bulb moment , as it were ) in action , before the brain 's “ owner ” is consciously aware of it .
There is a precedent for such observations of unconscious thought in action .
In the 1980s Benjamin Libet of the University of California , San Francisco , showed that simple decisions , such as when to move a finger , are made about three - tenths of a second before the brain 's owner is aware of them , and subsequent work has found that the roots of such decisions can be seen up to ten seconds before they become conscious .
But this is the first occasion that such a long lead time has been shown for more complex thought processes .
This finding , combined with Libet 's , poses fascinating questions about how the brain really works .
Conscious thought , it seems , does not solve problems .
Instead , unconscious processing happens in the background and only delivers the answer to consciousness once it has been arrived at .
Food for further thought , indeed .
On Wednesday 20 May 2009 , speaking at a parliamentary Justice Committee debating his new blasphemy law , Dermot Ahern joked that people were making blasphemous comments about him , and he compared his own purity to that of the baby Jesus .
In response , on Monday 25 May 2009 , at a crowded public meeting in Wynns Hotel in Dublin , campaigners against the blasphemy law have founded the Church of Dermotology , to worship Dermot Ahern and his proposed blasphemy law .

Beneath the slate - gray surface of the North Sea , about a half - mile off England ’s east coast , lies the underwater town of Dunwich .
Crabs and lobsters skitter along the streets where some 3,000 people walked during the town ’s heyday in the Middle Ages .
Fish dart through the sea sponge - ridden ruins of its churches , now partially buried in the seabed some 30 feet down .
Erosion — caused by the North Sea ’s relentless pounding of England ’s east coast — had all but consumed Dunwich ( pronounced DUN-ich ) by 1750 .
And the sea ’s silty , cold waters made visibility almost nonexistent for the intrepid few who wanted to explore the medieval ruins .
Until now .
Thanks to advances in acoustic technology , a group of divers and a geomorphologist are surveying the sunken town this summer using multibeam and sidescan sonars that can detect objects on the seafloor .
During a survey last year , the group mapped two churches and found evidence of a third .
“ This is absolutely opening the seas up , ” said David Sear , the Dunwich project ’s geomorphologist who teaches at the University of Southampton .
And , he added , the North Sea has plenty to reveal ; in addition to Dunwich , Sear would like to use the undersea technology to explore the submerged towns of Old Kilnsea and Eccles that lie farther north .
The English sunken sites join a list of others that span the globe .
According to UNESCO , submerged settlements have been found in Egypt , India , Jamaica , Argentina , Denmark , Sweden , Italy , and the Black Sea .
“ Under the sea is probably the world ’s biggest museum , ” said James P. Delgado , president of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology based in Texas .
“ There ’s not a lot of work going on in this area right now , however .
The issues are time , money , interest , and research .
Just to do a single shipwreck can take years ....
Underwater archaeology costs 10 times more to dig . ”
In addition to these issues , Delgado noted a strong push toward conservation pervading the world of nautical archaeology .
People are n’t jumping into the water unless a site is in danger or stands to advance research .
For Sear , surveying Dunwich answers a question people in the region have asked for years :
Is anything left ?
“ In the 1970s when I was a child playing on the beach , the last remains of All Saints church were visible on the shoreline , ” Sear said in an e-mail .
“ Hence why I got fired up over the place !... The sand banks grow and decline over time , so there are periods when more of the site is exposed ( 1970s ) and when they are not ( now ) .
As the coast recesses , so the banks migrate shorewards covering more of the site .
The exposed remains lie in a tidal scour channel between the inner and outer bank .
This migrates shorewards too ; so in another 100 years different ruins may well be exposed , assuming the coastal morphology remains the same . ”
Sear expects to find ruins of religious structures and forts , since they were made of stone .
Houses were made of timber or wattle and daub .
Lead diver Stuart Bacon has found several objects since he began his exploration in 1971 .
One of the most exciting finds to date is a portion of a slab used to cover a knight ’s tomb in 1320 , a fine example of the prosperity Dunwich once enjoyed .
“ Eight hundred houses ... a dozen abodes of prayer and worship , windmills , workshops , taverns , shops , storehouses , ships , ” wrote Rowland Parker in Men of Dunwich , the 1978 classic reference book about the town .
“ It would be difficult to think of an every - day commodity in existence in the late 13th century which was not obtainable in Dunwich market - place , either immediately or ‘ when the next ship comes in from ’ Copenhagen , Hamburg , Barcelona or wherever . ”
The sea that brought trade to Dunwich was not entirely benevolent .
The town was losing ground as early as 1086 when the Domesday Book , a survey of all holdings in England , was published ; between 1066 and 1086 more than half of Dunwich ’s taxable farmland had washed away .
Major storms in 1287 , 1328 , 1347 , and 1740 swallowed up more land .
By 1844 , only 237 people lived in Dunwich .
Today , less than half as many reside there in a handful of ruins on dry land .
These include portions of the Greyfriars monastery and a corner of All Saints ’ cemetery .
Beachcombers have occasionally seen bones protruding from the cliffs , left over from burial grounds that are crumbling into the sea .
And local fishermen over the years have said they heard bells tolling in the church towers from beneath the waves .
Ghostly sounds or not , the rediscovery of Dunwich continues .
Sear wants to create a 3 - D map of the church sites found so far .
The group wants to expand the survey to cover other churches and structures .
“ We ’ve got to be in for some surprises , ” he added .
Around the world , other sunken settlements have been explored or are the subject of current work :
* Kekova ,
Turkey :
The partially submerged ruins of the ancient city of Simena are easy to see through the clear turquoise waters off Turkey ’s southern coast .
A massive earthquake buried much of Simena in the 2nd century AD .
Tourists can swim near the ruins or see them from glass - bottomed tour boats .
* Port Royal , Jamaica : On June 7 , 1692 , an earthquake wiped out this Caribbean port , once known as “ the wickedest city on Earth . ”
Two thousand people were killed instantly , and many others perished later .
Nautical archaeologists have found eight buildings so far .
* Alexandria , Egypt : Divers have found remnants of Alexandria ’s famous lighthouse in the bay , as well as Cleopatra ’s palace .
UNESCO is looking into whether the world ’s first underwater museum could be built here .
* Mahabalipuram , India : Several manmade structures believed to be temples built in the 7th or 8th century surfaced off India ’s southeast coast after the 2004 tsunami .
Some believe they are pagodas that were part of this pilgrimage city , which is now a World Heritage site .
* Tybrind Vig , Denmark : During the late Mesolithic period ( 5600 to 4000 BC ) , people hunted , fished , wove fabric , and were buried in this new submerged settlement close to the west coast of the island of Fyn .

There is great news this morning for fans of cheerleaders and Florida International University .
Your cheerleading team has been saved , reports the team captain .
Just a couple weeks ago the school announced that cheerleading and marching band were being eliminated due to budget issues .
Times are rough .
We just hired a way overpriced basketball coach .
The football stadium mortgage is killing us .
On and on .
The young ladies did n’t take the news and go home crying .
They got busy raising money with bikini car washes and blood drives .
The student body united with petition drives and gaining national exposure for their cause .
The hard work appears to have paid off according to Facebook chatter .
Captain Rachal Girolmetti updated her status last night giving mankind the great news .
There is similar reactions on the Save FIU Cheer Facebook group page .
We have n’t been able to track down how much money was raised but the initial number to keep the team was $ 45,000 , according to the Miami Herald .
FIU administrators now say they ’re only willing to keep cheerleading if [ the team ] can raise enough private funds , and that those dollars be committed for future years .
It ’s unclear if someone stepped forward with money to finance the team .
Whatever the case , the team is coming back .
BC is still efforting to see if the band held bikini car washes to save themselves .

I met Eddie Spearritt in the Philharmonic pub , overlooking Liverpool .
It was a few years after 96 Liverpool football fans had been crushed to death at Hillsborough Stadium , Sheffield , on 15 April 1989 .
Eddie 's son , Adam , aged 14 , died in his arms .
The " main reason for the disaster " , Lord Justice Taylor subsequently reported , was the " failure " of the police , who had herded fans into a lethal pen .
“ As I lay in my hospital bed , " Eddie said , “ the hospital staff kept the Sun away from me .
It 's bad enough when you lose your 14 - year - old son because you 're treating him to a football match .
Nothing can be worse than that .
But since then I 've had to defend him against all the rubbish printed by the Sun about everyone there being a hooligan and drinking .
There was no hooliganism .
During 31 days of Lord Justice Taylor 's inquiry , no blame was attributed because of alcohol .
Adam never touched it in his life . "
Three days after the disaster , Kelvin MacKenzie , Rupert Murdoch 's " favourite editor " , sat down and designed the Sun front page , scribbling " THE TRUTH " in huge letters .
Beneath it , he wrote three subsidiary headlines : " Some fans picked pockets of victims " . . .
" Some fans urinated on the brave cops " . . .
" Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life " .
All of it was false ; MacKenzie was banking on anti-Liverpool prejudice .
When sales of the Sun fell by almost 40 per cent on Merseyside , Murdoch ordered his favourite editor to feign penitence .
BBC Radio 4 was chosen as his platform .
The " sarf London " accent that was integral to MacKenzie 's fake persona as an " ordinary punter " was now a contrite , middle - class voice that fitted Radio 4 .
" I made a rather serious error , " said MacKenzie , who has since been back on Radio 4 in a very different mood , aggressively claiming that the Sun 's treatment of Hillsborough was merely a " vehicle for others " .
When we met , Eddie Spearritt mentioned MacKenzie and Murdoch with a dignified anger .
So did Joan Traynor , who lost two sons , Christopher and Kevin , whose funeral was invaded by MacKenzie 's photographers even though Joan had asked for her family 's privacy to be respected .
The picture of her sons ' coffins on the front page of a paper that had lied about the circumstances of their death so deeply upset her that for years she could barely speak about it .
Such relentless inhumanity forms the iceberg beneath the Guardian 's current exposé of Murdoch 's alleged payment of £ 1 m hush money to those whose phones his News of the World reporters have criminally invaded .
" A cultural Chernobyl , " is how the German investigative journalist Reiner Luyken , based in London , described Murdoch 's effect on British life .
Of course , there is a colourful Fleet Street history of lies , damn lies , but no proprietor ever attained the infectious power of Murdoch 's putrescence .
To public truth and decency and freedom , he is as the dunghill is to the blowfly .
The rich and famous can usually defend themselves with expensive libel actions ; but most of Murdoch 's victims are people like the Hillsborough parents , who suffer without recourse .
The Murdoch " ethos " was demonstrated right from the beginning of his career , as Richard Neville has documented .
In 1964 , his Sydney tabloid , the Daily Mirror , published the diary of a 14 - year - old schoolgirl under the headline , " WE HAVE SCHOOLGIRL'S ORGY DIARY " .
A 13 - year - old boy , who was identified , was expelled from the same school .
Soon afterwards , he hanged himself from his mother 's clothesline .
The " sex diary " was subsequently found to be fake .
Soon after Murdoch bought the News of the World in 1971 , a strikingly similar episode involving an adolescent diary led to the suicide of a 15 - year - old girl .
And Murdoch himself said , of the industrial killing of innocent men , women and children in Iraq : " There is going to be collateral damage .
And if you really want to be brutal about it , better we get it done now . . . "
His most successful war has been on journalism itself .
A leading Murdoch retainer , Andrew Neil , the Kelvin MacKenzie of the Sunday Times , conducted one of his master 's most notorious smear campaigns against ITV ( like the BBC , a " monopoly " standing in Murdoch 's way ) .
In 1988 , the ITV company Thames Television made Death on the Rock , an investigative documentary that lifted a veil on the British secret state under Margaret Thatcher , describing how an SAS team had murdered four unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar with their hands in the air .
The message was clear : Thatcher was willing to use death squads .
The Sunday Times and the Sun , side by side in Murdoch 's razor - wired Wapping fortress , echoed Thatcher 's scurrilous attacks on Thames Television and subjected the principal witness to the murders , Carmen Proetta , to a torrent of lies and personal abuse .
She later won £ 300,000 in libel damages , and a public inquiry vindicated the programme 's accuracy and integrity .
This did not prevent
Thames , an innovative broadcaster , from losing its licence .
Murdoch 's most obsequious supplicants are politicians , especially New Labour .
Having ensured that Murdoch pays minimal tax , and having attended the farewell party of one editor of the Sun , Gordon Brown was recently in full fawn at the wedding of another editor of the same paper .
Don Corleone expects nothing less .
The hypocrisy , however , is almost magical .
In 1995 , Murdoch flew Tony and Cherie Blair first - class to Hayman Island , Australia , where the aspiring war criminal spoke about " the need for a new moral purpose in politics " , which included the lifting of government regulations on the media .
Murdoch shook his hand warmly .
The next day the Sun commented : " Mr Blair has vision , he has purpose and he speaks our language on morality and family life . "
The two are devout Christians , after all .

1. Security , security , security : Windows XP Service Pack 3 patched a lot of holes , but Vista takes security to the next level .
There are literally too many changes to list here , from the bidirectional software firewall that monitors inbound and outbound traffic to Windows Services Hardening , which prevents obscure background processes from being hijacked and changing your system .
There ’s also full - disk encryption , which prevents thieves from accessing your data , even if they steal the PC out from under your nose .
Perhaps most crucial ( and least sexy ) is the long - overdue User Account Protection , which invokes administrator privileges as needed , such as during driver updates or software installations .
UAP makes it much more convenient for users to operate Vista with limited rights ( meaning the system wo n’t let them do certain things , like load software , without clearance from an administrator ) .
This in turn limits the ability of malware to hose your system .
2. Internet Explorer 7 : IE gets a much - needed , Firefox - inspired makeover , complete with tabbed pages and better privacy management .
There ’s also the color - coded Address Bar that lets you know if a page is secured by a digital key , or , thanks to new antiphishing features , if it ’s a phony Web site just looking to steal information about you .
These features will all be available for Windows XP users who download IE7 .
But Vista users get an important extra level of protection : IE7 on Vista will run in what Microsoft calls “ protected mode ” –a limited - rights mode that prevents third - party code from reaching your system .
It ’s about darn time .
3 . Righteous eye candy :
For the first time , Microsoft is building high - end graphics effects into Windows .
The touted Aero Glass interface features visually engaging 3D rendering , animation , and transparencies .
Translucent icons , program windows , and other elements not only look cool , they add depth and context to the interface .
For example , hover your cursor over minimized programs that rest on the taskbar and you ’ll be able to see real - time previews of what ’s running in each window without opening them full - screen .
Now you can see what ’s going on behind the scenes , albeit at a cost :
You need powerful graphics hardware and a robust system to manage all the effects .
4. Desktop search : Microsoft has been getting its lunch handed to it by Google and Yahoo on the desktop , but Vista could change all that .
The new OS tightly integrates instant desktop search , doing away with the glacially slow and inadequate search function in XP .
Powerful indexing and user - assignable metadata make searching for all kinds of data–including files , e-mails , and Web content–a lot easier .
And if you ’re running Vista on a Windows Longhorn network , you can perform searches across the network to other PCs .
5 . Better updates : Vista does away with using Internet Explorer to access Windows Update , instead utilizing a new application to handle the chore of keeping your system patched and up - to - date .
The result is quicker response and a more tightly streamlined process .
The update - tracking mechanism , for instance , is much quicker to display information about your installation .
And now key components , such as the Windows Defender antispyware module , get their updates through this central point .
Like other housekeeping features , a better Windows Update is n’t a gee - whiz upgrade , but it should make it easier–and more pleasant –to keep your PC secure .
6 . More media :
Over the years , one of the key reasons to upgrade versions of Windows has been the free stuff Gates and Company toss into the new OS , and Vista is no exception .
Windows Media Player ( perhaps my least favorite application of all time ) gets a welcome update that turns the once - bloated player into an effective MP3 library .
The Windows Photo Gallery finally adds competent photo - library - management functionality to Windows , so you can organize photos ; apply metatags , titles , and ratings ; and do things like light editing and printing .
The DVD Maker application , which was still very rough when I looked at it , promises to add moviemaking capabilities –along the lines of Movie Maker–to the operating system .
There are even some nice new games tucked into the bundle .
7. Parental controls : Families , schools , and libraries will appreciate the tuned - up parental controls , which let you limit access in a variety of ways .
Web filtering can block specific sites , screen out objectionable content by selected type , and lock out file downloads .
You can also restrict each account ’s access by time of day or day of the week .
As a dad , I can tell you this will be great for keeping kids off the PC while you ’re at work , for instance .
You can even block access to games based on their Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings .
8 . Better backups :
When Windows 95 first came out , the typical hard disk was , maybe , 300 MB in size .
Today , desktops routinely ship with 300 GB or 400 GB hard drives .
And yet , the built - in data - backup software in Windows has changed little in the past decade .
Windows Vista boasts a much - improved backup program that should help users avoid wholesale digital meltdowns .
Microsoft also tweaked the useful System Restore feature –which takes snapshots of your system state so you can recover from a nasty infection or botched software installation .
9 . Peer - to - peer collaboration : The Windows Collaboration module uses peer - to - peer technology to let Vista users work together in a shared workspace .
You can form ad hoc workgroups and then jointly work on documents , present applications , and pass messages .
You can even post “ handouts ” for others to review .
10 . Quick setup : Beta code alert :
There are some Vista features I hope dearly for even though they have n’t been built yet .
This is one of them .
Jim Allchin , Microsoft ’s co-president , says that Windows Vista boasts a re-engineered install routine , which will slash setup times from about an hour to as little as 15 minutes .
Hurray !
The new code was n’t in the beta version of Vista that Microsoft sent to me–my aging rig took well over an hour to set up–so I ’ll believe it when I see it .
Still , any improvement in this area is welcome .
The streets of Juarez are swallowing the young and pretty .
Monica Alanis , an 18 - year - old college freshman , never came home from her exams .
That was more than four months ago .
Across town , 17 - year - old Brenda Ponce did n’t return from a job - hunting trip downtown .
That was a year ago .
Hilda Rivas , 16 , was also last spotted downtown .
That was 17 months ago .

Two dozen teenage girls and young women have gone missing in this violent border city in the last year and half , stirring dark memories of the killings of hundreds of women that made Ciudad Juarez infamous a decade ago .
The disappearances , which include two university students and girls as young as 13 , have some crime - novel touches : mysterious dropped calls , messages left by third parties and unsubstantiated reports of the women being kept at a house .
There is no clear evidence of wrongdoing or links among the cases , which have been overshadowed by a vicious drug war that has killed more than 2,500 people in Juarez since the beginning of 2008 .
But relatives of the young women say it is highly unlikely that they would have left on their own .
Monica Alanis ’ parents say she was seldom late returning from the campus .
Olga Esparza says she called her daughter that day toward the end of March to find out why she was three hours late .
Monica reassured her : “ I ’ll be home later . ”

Desperate family members have hung missing - person banners and taped fliers to telephone poles all over the city in hope of getting leads on the whereabouts of loved ones .
They ’ve checked hospitals and combed dusty canyons in the impoverished fringes of the city .
They ’ve badgered state investigators , but complain that authorities have no solid leads to explain why so many young women would drop from view at once .
“ There is no theory .
There is no hypothesis , ” said Ricardo Alanis , Monica ’s father , his voice thin with pain .
“ They do n’t have anything concrete after four months . ”
The vacuum has prompted parents to envision their own disturbing story lines .
Several say they believe their daughters have been seized and forced into prostitution , perhaps in the United States , by the same criminal bands that have turned this border city into the bloodiest front in the drug war .
“ She ’s in the hands of those people .
I do n’t know who they are or where they are , ” said Aiben Rivas , a carpenter and the father of Hilda .
She disappeared Feb. 25 , 2008 , after chatting with a friend downtown .

Trying to find similarities in cases
Relatives and activists see common threads in the cases .
Most of the young women are attractive , dark - haired and slender .
Most were last seen downtown , a scruffy but bustling precinct of discount clothing stores , cheap eats and honky - tonk bars .
Four of the missing teens are named Brenda .
The profile looks different from that of the more than 350 women killed during a 15 - year stretch from 1993 .
Many of those victims worked in the city ’s assembly plants and came from other parts of Mexico .
Their bodies turned up , often with signs of sexual abuse and torture , in bare lots and gullies .
Despite some arrests and the creation of a special prosecutor ’s office , the cases remain largely unsolved .

By contrast those missing today are , for the most part , local residents from stable , middle - and working - class homes .
“ They are not only from the poorest families , ” said Marisela Ortiz , who directs a group representing families of the slain women that is now working with the families of those who disappeared recently .
“ The characteristics have changed . ”
And this time there are no bodies .
Relatives say authorities have carried out desultory inquiries , and left them to hunt their own leads .
But the families say they lack investigators ’ power to track cellphone calls or question acquaintances of the women .
Some have suggested that corrupt police may be involved in the disappearances .

The Chihuahua state attorney general ’s office , whose missing - persons bureau has jurisdiction over the cases , declined to make anyone available to comment , despite several requests .
Investigators privately have told local journalists they suspect the young women were seized by trafficking rings for prostitution .
Loved ones say they believe the young women are alive .
“ God willing , someday I ’ll see her again , ” said Yolanda Saenz , who is Brenda Ponce ’s mother .
The girl , dressed in bluejeans and a black blouse , went downtown July 22 , 2008 , to look for a store job to help pay for dental braces and school expenses , her mother said .
“ I just want to know what happened to her so I can find peace , ” Saenz said .

Some parents keep hope alive
Some families say they ’ve gotten possible clues .
Saenz said that even after a year , calls to Brenda ’s cellphone go to voice mail , implying that her account is still active and fueling her hope .
Monica Alanis ’ parents said someone hung up after calling their home in June from a number in the Tijuana area , where they do n’t know anyone .
They said a friend of their daughter got a hang - up call from an unfamiliar number in Chihuahua , the state capital .
Sergio Sarmiento , whose cousin , Adriana Sarmiento , was 15 when she went missing last year , said the family got a phone call from a man saying she was fine and had left on her own .

“ I do n’t believe it , ” said Sergio Sarmiento , who works as a bus driver and lives amid the trash - strewn gulches of northeastern Juarez .
He said that since the disappearance , the girl ’s mother has fled across the border to El Paso with another daughter , who is 18 .
“ I want to be an optimist , ” he said .
After Adriana disappeared in January 2008 , loved ones went around tacking up posters with her picture and description ( 5 - foot - 5 , thin , brown eyes , dark brown hair ) .
But competition with other missing - person fliers grew as the number of disappearances mounted .

At long last , a dear friend reached me by phone from Tehran yesterday .
I had been trying to get hold of her for days , but cell - phone service has been cut , and Internet access , which is absurdly slow in the best of times in Iran , has been restricted to three unpredictable hours a day .
With all the reports of street violence and escalating unrest , I was worried about her .
She is not an activist , just an ordinary citizen whose family has been harassed by the Islamic Republic for nearly thirty years .
Last night , when she got through after two hours of trying , her voice sounded lighter than ever .
Not giddy ; lucid , bright , unburdened .
She had spent the last days in the streets .
She was one of the millions in Azadi Square on Monday .
The energy , she told me , was indescribable .
You could not feel afraid ; the sense of common purpose was too powerful , and it had left her with a profound and nearly serene certainty that this movement would succeed .
At Azadi Square , she spotted Hashem Aghajari , an old revolutionary - turned - reformist intellectual who became famous when he was sentenced to execution , in 2003 , for saying that Muslims were not monkeys who should follow a Supreme Leader .
( “ We have a saying in Farsi , ” Aghajari told me in 2005 , the day Ahmadenijad ’s Presidential - election victory was announced .
“ ‘ There is no shade darker than black . ’
The worst they can do is execute me .
I have prepared myself for that .
If I am worried , it is not for myself .
It ’s for the Iranian people , for young people , today ’s generation and future generations .
My freedom and my life , and those of one or two people like me , do n’t matter . ” )
Student demonstrators succeeded , back in 2003 , in pressuring the judiciary to commute his sentence to two years in prison .
Did I know , my friend asked , that Aghajari had lost a leg in the Iran - Iraq war ?
There he was , among the protesters at Azadi Square on Monday , holding his wooden leg under one arm .
Not an hour after this phone call , our dinner guests , an Iranian journalist couple forced to leave their country less than three years ago , arrived .
It had not been easy to pry them away from their laptops .
They were haggard and sleepless , the husband unshaven , the wife ’s face a mask of desolation and fury .
She had been watching a video of a student being killed by armed thugs .
“ Is power really worth this ? ” she demanded .
“ Khamenei has had power longer than some of those people were alive . ”
Inside Iran , she told me , the demonstrators feel euphoric and confident , like my friend on the phone .
Few of them are seeing the footage that has circulated outside the country .
They are buoyed by optimism and also by anger : they feel that the authorities not only stole the election from them , but insulted their intelligence .
Israel said its 22 - day military operation in Gaza in January was aimed at ending rocket fire from Hamas , and weakening the Islamic movement that controls the coastal Strip .
Six months after the conflict , three Gazans affected by it give their views on Hamas 's standing in Gaza .
YOUSSEF ABU EIDA , FATHER OF EIGHT Youssef Abu Eida 's four - floor house , home to his eight children and other extended family members , was destroyed during the conflict .
Construction materials are blocked from entering Gaza under Israel 's blockade , so he has not been able to begin rebuilding .
" Nothing has changed .
Each month I feel worse .
I got mad .
Now I am living in Jabaliya camp , with 12 people in one bedroom .
" Hamas and the Jews both did this .
Hamas do n't have the power for war - so why did they launch rockets at Israel ?
Israel needed war here , but who gave Israel the key to come here ?
Hamas .
GAZA CONFLICT : SIX MONTHS ON
Gaza industries struggle to rebuild Recovery battle for war injured Uneasy recovery for south Israel Guide : Gaza under blockade " They say ' no problem ' .
But there is a problem !
They take everything , clothes , milk food , everything .
I think a lot of money comes into Gaza - where is it ?
For who ?
Who has taken all the money ?
What have Hamas done for my family ?
" There are 1.5 m people in Gaza - are all of them Hamas ?
No , they are not .
You can ask my son , does he need Hamas ?
Does he like Hamas ?
No .
" In six months ' time maybe I will go crazy , take off all my clothes and run in the streets .
All my dreams were in this house , it took me 32 years work to build it .
The people here are dead , nothing is moving , everything is stopped . "
KAMALAIN SHAAT , ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY Kamalain Shaat is head of Gaza 's Islamic University , which is widely seen as close to Hamas .
Some of the university 's buildings were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes - Israel said it targeted a chemistry laboratory used to make explosives .
" We have lost two main buildings , including all our science college labs - but we decided from day one that we have to continue with life .
Right now we are offering our students educational services with maybe 90 % efficiency , with the minimal resources we have .
" I am not sure about the popularity of Hamas .
But what is really clear is that five missiles targeted two educational institutions , which is not acceptable at all .
The Israeli army did n't deny this , so they are to blame of course .
" Hamas came in by election .
I do n't think anything would change if there was an election tomorrow .
The people here are suffering , but they are persistent not to give up .
" I think all the time life is difficult [ not just in Gaza or because of Hamas ] .
Do you think people in the [ Fatah - controlled ]
West Bank are not in a difficult situation ?
They have more than 600 checkpoints .
We are in difficulty too - it is part of the whole situation . "
TIHANI ABED RABBU , BEREAVED MOTHER
Unity pleas mask split Tihani Abed Rabbu 's teenage son Mustafa , her brother and her closest friend were all killed during the conflict .
" After six months , life is hell .
I can't understand , I can't absorb it .
None of us can go back to normal life , not me , not my children , nor my husband .
" It 's not easy to forget the memory , to get rid of the image from your mind .
Also there is no security .
The Israelis could attack again , the Fatah and Hamas conflict could ignite again .
" I 'm afraid that after I have lost Mostafa , that I will lose somebody else as well .
When my children go to sleep , and I look at them , I start to think ' who is next - is it Ahmad 's turn , or his brother ? '
" What worries me is the safety of my family , my sons and my husband .
My husband is going through a difficult time , a crazy time .
He wants to affiliate with Hamas , he wants to get revenge after what they have done to us .
" How do you expect us to be peaceful after they have killed my son and turned my family into angry people - as they refer to us , " terrorists " .
I can not calm my family down .
" One of my sons is affiliated to [ Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud ]
Abbas , every day he fights with his brothers and his father .
" If Fatah and Hamas do n't reconcile after this war , I feel like all those people who died , died for nothing , and that the people from both factions have nothing to do with the Palestinian cause - that they are not paying respect to those who died .
" They should wake up and put an end to this division .
Unless they do that , I wo n't feel that my son died as a martyr for the Palestinian cause . "

They say a picture speaks a thousand words , and that is definitely true when it comes logo design .
A well - thought logo design can effectively use a simple icon to leave a deep enough impression for the public .
Most logos communicate ideas to people , for instance , the kind of quality services a company can provide for its customers .
A memorable logo is always a plus if one wants to ensure first - time visitors to their websites will return in future .
While there ’s no easy answer as to what kind of logo design is the most effective and impressionable , it is probably intuitive to assume that creatively designed logos are more likely to stand out .
However , that does not necessarily mean that a logo has to be very elaborated .
A simple logo with an innovative play of wordings can be as intriguing as an aesthetically pleasing logo .
This is the beauty of logo designs .
Here is a compilation of 80 creative logos of different variety , all categorized under these groups : Wordmark , Symbolic , and Combined mark .
Enjoy !
Wordmarks
As you shall see , these logos involve the creative arrangement and modification of words to enhance the name of the company they represent .
Unlike symbols and icons , text - based logos are effective in the sense that the name is clearly spelled out for easier recognition .
Symbolic , Iconic & Combine Mark
Using symbols and icons , the logo desingers attempt to establish an association between the brand name and the image .
One advantage of symbolic and combine mark logo is that there is more room for creativity than text - based ( wordmark ) logos which only play around with words .
Some logos , however , actually incorporate both text and icons to form a unique logo design .

A Santa Clara County sheriff 's deputy pleaded guilty Friday to two misdemeanor counts of vehicular manslaughter for hitting and killing two bicyclists last year when his patrol cruiser crossed the center line .
Deputy James Council , 28 , is expected to be sentenced June 25 to four months in county jail in the deaths of Matt Peterson , 29 , of San Francisco and Kristy Gough , 30 , of San Leandro .
Council will be eligible to serve that time in a sheriff 's furlough program or in home detention , authorities said .
He will also be required to perform 800 hours of community service , said Deputy District Attorney Ray Mendoza .
The prosecutor said the expected sentence is appropriate " in light of all the circumstances .
This is a tragic case for everybody involved . "
Peterson 's sister Mary echoed that sentiment in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
" The sorrow that I imagine Deputy Council carries is the greatest punishment he will experience , " she wrote .
" Justice and mercy are meaningless without each other . "
The accident happened March 9 , 2008 , when Council 's cruiser crossed the center line on Stevens Canyon Road in Cupertino and struck three cyclists .
Peterson died at the scene , and Gough died a short time later at a hospital .
The third bicyclist , Christopher Knapp of Germany , was badly injured but survived .
Witnesses later said there were no skid marks and that the deputy reported falling asleep at the wheel .
Council 's attorney , Michael Rains , confirmed that the deputy had nodded off .
Council , who had been with the department for 18 months , was 4 1/ 2 hours into a 12 - hour shift at the time of the Sunday morning crash after working a 12 1/2 - hour shift the day before .
Prosecutors have concluded that Council was not engaged in serious reckless driving and had no drugs or alcohol in his system .
Council was prepared to go to trial Monday on the misdemeanor charges , but he did not want to subject his family or relatives of the victims to " gruesome " photos and difficult testimony , Rains said .
Council remains on administrative leave from the Santa Clara County Sheriff 's Office .
The three victims were among about a dozen people riding with Third Pillar , a San Mateo - based bicycle racing team , and Team Roaring Mouse from San Francisco .
Gough was a professional triathlete who had recently taken up road racing and who friends said had won every race she entered in 2008 .
She and Peterson , an amateur road - racing cyclist who , like Gough , had done triathlons , both won their divisions in a road - racing event in Merced eight days before they died .
Lawsuits against Santa Clara County filed by the families of Peterson and Gough are still pending , and Knapp is still in discussions with the county , said his attorney , James McManis .
" I 'm fine with the sentencing , " McManis said .
" It was an accident , and we should n't be putting people in jail for accidents . "
The victims ' fellow bicyclists recently commemorated the first anniversary of the crash , which sent ripples of shock and sorrow through the tight - knit racing community .
Those emotions were reawakened Friday .
" If you had told me the day after this happened that the person who did this would serve a short sentence , I would have been outraged , " said David Parrish of San Francisco , president of Team Roaring Mouse , of which Peterson was a member .
" I think now ... I 'm inclined toward compassion , " Parrish said .
" The person left standing here , James Council , the person behind the wheel , has his own personal hell to go through for the rest of his life . "
Gough rode with Third Pillar , and team captain Anthony Borba said he was struggling a bit with the end of the case .
" It seems like if a civilian were to fall asleep and kill two people , four months ' prison time or whatever does n't seem like much , " he said .
" I believe it was an accident .
I hope for the sake of the officer that it was an accident . "
More important than the sentence , the bicyclists said , is the hope that the case reminds motorists to be aware of riders on the road .
Borba added that he hopes the Santa Clara County Sheriff 's Office will reconsider its policies on lengths of shifts .
The office is working with a sleep researcher , said spokesman Sgt. Don Morrissey , seeking to learn more about the effect of sleep patterns on deputies .
Activation of two different kinds of neurons is necessary for appetitive and aversive memory recall in crickets , say researchers BMC Biology who blocked octopaminergic ( OA - ergic ) and dopaminergic ( DA - ergic ) transmission and found that this resulted in the inability to recall pleasant and unpleasant memories , respectively .
Makoto Mizunami ( now at Hokkaido University , Japan ) led a team of researchers from Tohoku University , Japan , who carried out the tests .
He said , " This is the first study to suggest that classical conditioning in insects involves neural mediation between an originally neutral stimulus and a pleasant or unpleasant stimulus and the activation of these neural responses for memory recall .
Such neural responses are often called cognitive processes in classical conditioning in higher vertebrates " .
Mizunami and his colleagues previously reported that , in crickets , OA - ergic neurons and DA -ergic neurons convey signals about reward and risk , respectively .
In this report , they found that blockers of synaptic transmission from OA - ergic and DA-ergic neurons prevented the insects from recalling which stimuli were related to the reward , and , therefore , could be approached , and which stimuli were related to the risk , so should be avoided .
According to Mizunami , " These findings are not consistent with conventional neural models of classical conditioning in insects .
Instead , we suggest that the cognitive account of classical conditioning proposed for higher vertebrates is applicable to insects " .

A professor at Stanford University has had his entire genetic code sequenced for less than $ 50 K .
And it ’s going to get cheaper and cheaper until you can just walk into Wal - Mart and have it done for $ 5.95 .
This is a huge deal , says Stephen Quake , who believes that the process will open the door to the world of “ personalized medicine . ”
“ This is the first demonstration that you do n’t need a genome center to sequence a human genome .
It ’s really democratising the fruits of the genome revolution and saying that anybody can play this game , ” Quake told the UK Independent .
“ This can now be done in one lab , with one machine , at a modest cost .
It ’s going to unleash an enormous amount of creativity and really broaden the field .
Some of the doctors are starting to poke and prod me to see how they can couple my genome with medicine . ”
There are advantages to knowing in which ways your health is at risk .
It ’s an opportunity to tailor medical treatment to your genetic makeup .
On the other hand , do n’t think this information is going to be used strictly for your own benefit .
All this data will be fed into computers so that insurance companies can sort out ways to maximize profit .
If it turns out you ’re prone to heart disease 10 , 15 or 20 years down the road , expect to get a note from your health care provider telling you that from now on you have to live on tree bark and grass clippings .
And if you do n’t well , whatever damage you ’ve caused is your own doing .
Imagine if , as is the dream of many Republicans — and some Democrats as well — that everyone is required to purchase health insurance on the open market .
If you ’ve got high risk of heart disease , Alzheimer ’s disease , or cancer in your future , imagine getting a reply to your health insurance application that says , “ Congratulations !
You ’ve been accepted ! ”
Yes , and there are some condos in Florida I would like to show you .
None of this is to say that genetic code sequencing should or will be stopped .
It wo n’t .
Just another reason to buckle your seatbelt .
As the good professor himself said :
“ The $ 1,000 genome is just around the corner , and when everybody will be able to have their genome sequenced , what ’s it going to mean for privacy , health insurance and decisions about human health ?
The technology is not going to let people escape these ethics and policy questions .
“ Are we going to require people , based on their genetic inheritance , to modify their behavior , or just suggest it ?
Your insurance company could ask you to have a certain diet or they ’re not going to cover you .
Is that what we want ? ”
How do you get people to pay for something they 're used to getting for free ?
It 's a question that bedevils the music and film industries , and it's no less of a challenge for anyone trying to monetise an app for Facebook , MySpace or Bebo .
But a new approach is emerging – make it cheap .
Really cheap .
Charge just 10 or 20 p for a bingo card , an accessory for a virtual pet or a weapon for a game character .
Get enough people signed up and , once you 've added up all those pennies , you 've made a tidy bundle .
Like all ideas that sound too good to be true , you 'll be thinking , it probably is .
But it 's not just a theory .
In Asia , such ' nanopayments ' have been making big money on social networks for years .
In 2007 , China 's Tencent raised $ 523 million in revenue – that 's four times as much as Facebook , in a country where the average monthly wage is less than $ 20 – with operating profits of $ 224 million .
Yet only 13 per cent of revenue came from ads .
Two - thirds came from internet services like games and digital goods : ' gifts ' such as virtual flowers , background music for users ' profiles , virtual pets , fashion items to dress avatars in , and so on .
Lessons to be learned
It 's tempting to mock the predominantly young people who spend their money on such things .
But young people are much the same everywhere , and in the same way other Asian fads , from karaoke to Pokémon , have spread like wildfire , there 's much we in the West can learn from the East .
There are lessons to be learned closer to home , too .
The success of Apple 's App Store has proved beyond reasonable doubt that people are willing to pay small amounts for virtual goods , whether useful or trivial .
More than a billion applications created by 50,000 developers have now been downloaded from the Store , typically for between $ 0.99 and $ 4.99 , from fart noisemakers to translators to virtual spirit levels .
Yet if such success is to be repeated on social networks , there 's one thing everyone agrees on : the need for stable , reliable , easy to use payment platform .
For a start , there 's no point in charging to credit cards if the bulk of your audience is too young to have one .
In China , kids can add money to their Tencent accounts via their mobile phone bill or by buying ' QQ coins ' in real world shops .
Similar systems exist for users of Japan 's Mixi and Korea 's Cyworld .
( In case you have n't heard of Cyworld , it was actually the world 's first social networking site .
Founded in 1999 , three years before Friendster , it 's been making massive profits for a decade , so it must be doing something right . )
Which platform ?
At the end of 2007 it looked as if Facebook was joining in the party .
Just before Christmas of that year it announced the beta test of Facebook Payments , which would enable firms to accept small payments from users directly inside their Facebook apps .
Then … nothing .
However , you can't keep a good idea down .
MySpace COO
Amit Kapur revealed at last November 's Web 2.0 Summit that MySpace is working on its own payment platform .
And while developers are waiting for the big boys to come up with the goods , a number of start - ups have sprung up to fill the gap , such as Spare Change , Zong , OneTouch and PayByCash .
Spare Change 's system is currently being used by 400 games and apps , charging users an average of 25 cents a pop .
You can add money to your account through PayPal , through your mobile phone bill or using cash at thousands of retailers throughout the US .
Co-founder Mark Rose says that the " shoestring operation " he set up a year and a half ago is already making healthy profits : " We 've got more than a million users , mainly of quasi - casual gaming applications , " he says .
One example is Mob Wars , a Facebook app in which players rise through the ranks of a gangster organisation by committing crimes and fighting other players .
According to TechCrunch , it 's generating $ 1 million per month .
Mob Wars costs nothing to play , and you 're given a certain amount of virtual currency to spend on recruiting and equipping your mob .
To earn more , you have to perform certain tasks – or sidestep the process by paying with real money instead .
" Apps like this lure people in and get them hooked , " explains Rose .
" Once people are engaged and having fun , they 're happy to shell out a few cents to continue . "
And it 's not just games .
Other apps let users adopt virtual gifts ; send their friends ' kisses ' , virtual gifts or cash ; sign up to dating services , make charitable donations and so on .

Massive burning of forests for agriculture thousands of years ago may have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide enough to alter global climate and usher in a warming trend that continues today , according to a new study that appears online Aug. 17 in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews .
Researchers at the University of Virginia and the University of Maryland - Baltimore County say that today 's 6 billion people use about 90 percent less land per person for growing food than was used by far smaller populations early in the development of civilization .
Those early societies likely relied on slash - and - burn techniques to clear large tracts of land for relatively small levels of food production .
" They used more land for farming because they had little incentive to maximize yield from less land , and because there was plenty of forest to burn , " said William Ruddiman , the lead author and a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia .
" They may have inadvertently altered the climate . "
Ruddiman is a climate scientist who specializes in investigating ocean - sediment and ice - core records .
In recent years he has searched across scientific disciplines – anthropology , archaeology , population dynamics , climatology – to gain insight into how humans may have affected climate over the millennia .
He said that early populations likely used a land - clearing method that involved burning forests , then planting crop seed among the dead stumps in the enriched soil .
They would use a large plot until the yield began to decline , and then would burn off another area of forest for planting .
They would continue this form of rotation farming , ever expanding the cleared areas as their populations grew .
They possibly cleared five or more times more land than they actually farmed at any given time .
It was only as populations grew much larger , and less land was available for farming or for laying fallow , that societies adopted more intensive farming techniques and slowly gained more food yield from less land .

Ruddiman notes that with the highly efficient and intensive farming of today , growing populations are using less land per capita for agriculture .
Forests are returning in many parts of the world , including the northeastern United States , Europe , Canada , Russia and even parts of China .
The positive environmental effects of this reforestation , however , are being canceled out by the large - scale burning of fossil fuels since the advent of the Industrial Revolution , which began about 150 years ago .
Humans continue to add excessive levels of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , contributing to a global warming trend , Ruddiman said .
Five years ago , Ruddiman made headlines with a hypothesis that humans began altering global climate thousands of years ago , not just since the Industrial Revolution .
That theory has since been criticized by some climate scientists who believe that early populations were too small to create enough carbon dioxide to alter climate .
According to projections from some models of past land use , large - scale land clearing and resulting carbon emissions have only occurred during the industrial era , as a result of huge increases in population .
But Ruddiman , and his co-author Erle Ellis , an ecologist at UMBC who specializes in land - use change , say these models are not accounting for the possibly large effects on climate likely caused by early farming methods .
" Many climate models assume that land use in the past was similar to land use today ; and that the great population explosion of the past 150 years has increased land use proportionally , " Ellis said .
" We are proposing that much smaller earlier populations used much more land per person , and may have more greatly affected climate than current models reflect . "
Ruddiman and Ellis based their finding on several studies by anthropologists , archaeologists and paleoecologists indicating that early civilizations used a great amount of land to grow relatively small amounts of food .
The researchers compared what they found with the way most land - use models are designed , and found a disconnect between modeling and field - based studies .
" It was only as our populations grew larger over thousands of years , and needed more food , that we improved farming technologies enough to begin using less land for more yield , " Ruddiman said .
" We suggest in this paper that climate modelers might consider how land use has changed over time , and how this may have affected the climate . "
Kelley
Howe gets through just about all of it .
His arrest .
The night he spent in jail .
Being charged with three crimes , including a felony .
His ailing mother 's shock to see his mug shot on Channel 15 news .
The theft of his own bike .
The parking ticket .
But when he gets to the part about his cat , Howe breaks down .
He starts crying , then weeping .
" Her name was Luka , " he says between sobs .
" She was a sweetheart .
I do n't know where she is .
It 's not her fault . "
Howe , 50 , is a former Marine sergeant who 's also worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
He 's disabled , and lives at Capitol Centre .
At a family gathering on July 4 , Howe 's brother Michael mentioned that his locked Trek 1400 road bike was recently stolen from the parking garage of his apartment .
Mike , the former chair of Madison 's Commission on People with Disabilities and member of its Equal Opportunities Commission , had reported the theft to Madison police .
Two days later , on July 6 at about 10:30 a.m. , Kelley Howe was returning from the grocery store .
As he drove past the muffler shop on Park Street , by Fish Hatchery , he saw a young man on a Trek 1400 road bike .
" Oh , that 's not Mike 's bike , " he recalls thinking , discounting the possibility .
But he pulled over to get a closer look .
When he saw the modified bike components that he'd installed , he knew .
It was Mike 's bike .
" I took my right hand , put it on the handlebars and said , ' This is a stolen bike .
It 's my brother 's bike , and it was reported stolen . ' "
Present were three other people , including the young man on the bike and his father .
The father insisted he bought the bike from Goodwill for $ 30 .
Howe knew this explanation did n't make sense .
For one thing , the bike was worth much more than $ 30 .
( His brother reported its value as $ 900 . )
And it did n't have a registration sticker ( license ) , which Goodwill makes available at the time of purchase .
Howe says he kept his hand on the bike as the young man tried to pull away .
" I did not try to take the bicycle , " he stresses .
" I was just trying to hold onto it . "
This went on for about 10 minutes before a Madison police squad car stopped at the traffic light , a few feet away .
Howe called out , then tossed a muffler part from a display rack into the street , to get the officer 's attention .
It worked .
Howe says he handed the officer , Erik Dalma , his driver 's license , explaining : " This is a stolen bicycle , it belongs to my brother . "
He says Dalma also conversed , in Spanish , with the three men .
Dalma then placed Howe under arrest .
He was handcuffed and driven to the Dane County jail , fingerprinted and photographed , and held in solitary until the following afternoon .
The whole time , he was focused on his cat .
On July 7 , based on Dalma 's account , Kelley Howe was charged with felony robbery with use of force and two misdemeanors : criminal damage to property ( for damaging the thrown muffler part and causing a flat to a vehicle that ran over it ) and disorderly conduct .
The charges prescribe a maximum of eight and a half years in prison and $ 36,000 in fines .
According to the criminal complaint , the young man felt threatened by Howe and , in the struggle over the bike , got a scrape on his right calf .
He was allowed to retain possession of the bike .
Howe says the conclusions reached by Dalma are obviously faulty .
If Howe really was trying to steal the bike , why did the father not use his cell phone to call the cops ?
And why did Howe throw the muffler part into the road while a squad car was passing ?
" I 'm going to rob three people in the middle of the street in broad daylight and then do everything I can to get the attention of a police officer ? "
Here 's the kicker :
The police subsequently determined that the bike in the young man 's possession was indeed the one that Michael Howe reported stolen .
He got it back July 10 - missing , he says , about $ 500 of parts and gear , some of which he thinks was taken after the young man was allowed to keep the bike .
Dalma did not respond to a request for comment .
Lt. Stephanie Bradley Wilson says the serial number of Howe 's stolen bike was not initially entered into the MPD 's system , due to a problem that the city 's IT staff is aware of , and working to fix .
So it was only afterward that police were able to determine that the bike was Mike's .
On Tuesday , after Isthmus made inquiries into the case , Madison police issued a $ 300 citation for obstructing an officer against the father , Javier Tecua - Hernandez .
Lt. Wilson says he was charged for changing his story from saying he bought the bike at Goodwill to claiming he found it abandoned .
As for the bike theft itself , Wilson says " there 's not a lot of evidence " to tie the father or son to the crime .
Actually , there is .
Michael Howe sent an email to Jen Adams , the housing manager of his apartment complex , where the theft occurred .
He asked if she knew the young man found in possession of his stolen bike .
Adams sent this reply , which Michael says he passed on to police : " I did some checking and [ the young man ] used to work in the building and his parents still do work in the building . "
When he stopped on Park Street to check on the bike , Kelley Howe had groceries in his car , his bike in his trunk , and his cat along for the ride .
He says he begged jail authorities to have police check on his cat , but by the time they did so , late that night , Luka had escaped - presumably through his trunk , which was ajar because it held his bike .
When Howe got back to his car after getting out of jail , it had a $ 30 ticket on the windshield .
The police , he says , had moved it to another street , right below a no-parking sign .
His bike was gone .
That night , Channel 15 reported Howe 's arrest for " trying to steal a bike away from a rider who was still on it . "
It did n't bother to say " allegedly . "
On Wednesday , Assistant District Attorney Brian Asmus , who 's handling the case , confirmed he plans to dismiss the felony theft charge against Howe next Monday , July 27 , after first giving the " victim " a chance to object .
But the two misdemeanor charges will remain , at least for now , as Asmus awaits additional information from police .
Lt. Wilson , for her part , seems to support the remaining charges , saying of Howe : " He caused a disturbance . "
Howe says he 'll fight any charges , although he does not have a lawyer .
After two weeks of looking , he has not found his cat .
His driver 's license , he says , was never given back .
And he knows there 's one shoe left to drop : the bill for the flat tire caused by his successful effort to get the attention of police .
" Could this have worked out any worse ? " he asks .
Of course it could ;
Howe might still end up with a criminal conviction and additional jail time .

SFPD Issues Rare Press Release on Hit-and - Run Crash of Bicyclist , Young Son
Andrew Bennett and his 4 - year - old son Robby .
The San Francisco Police Department — in a rare public display of concern for bicyclists — has issued a press release on the hit - and - run on Valencia Street last Wednesday involving a bicyclist and his 4 - year - old son , who was riding in the back on a tandem extension .
It asks for the public ’s help tracking down the driver of a " gray SUV or gray Chrysler PT Cruiser " ( with a partial plate of " KAY " and a heart symbol ) who is responsible for the crash :
The driver was described only as a female , late 20s , with dark hair .
No one else was in the vehicle .
There may be front - end damage to the vehicle .
Anyone who may have witnessed this collision is urged to contact Inspector Jim Custer of the Hit and Run Detail , 553- 9516 , or to call the Confidential Tip Line , 415-575-4444 .
The bicyclist , Andrew Bennett , suffered a broken back , and clarified in an email that although his son was scraped up a little , he was not injured .
Bennett also gave us an update on his condition :
My orthopedic doctor told me today that I will be in a brace for six
weeks at a minimum , three months at most and that I ’ll be unable to do
the work of my chosen vocation for many months .
There is a possibility
that this injury will prevent me from being able to return to my work
at all due to its extremely physical demands ( being the head rigger or
head carpenter on cirque de soleil , Bob Dylan , the Beastie Boys and
such is difficult if you ca n’t lift your own body weight ) .
Time will
tell .
On a positive note , I saw my bicycle today and steel frames rock .
My
quad - butted frame took a direct hit on the fork , head tube , top tube ,
and down tube at from a SUV going 25 - 40 mph and is not bent .
Everything attached to it , including me , is , but wow - what amazing
stuff .
I ’m so lucky that I was in the bottom of the pedal stroke on the right
side - had I been pushing through the upstroke on my right I would have
a peg leg .
I ’m also glad that I gave up clip / " clipless " pedals for free
footing : being attached to that bike would likely have increased my
injuries .
The story about the hit - and - run has sparked outrage among many bicyclists from around the world , who left comments on our initial post , offering help and wishing Bennett a speedy recovery .
A spokesperson for the SFPD said this morning there ’s been no update on the case since the initial press release was put out around 3 yesterday afternoon .
The press release , as far as we can tell , is the first the SFPD has issued on a bicyclist injured in a crash in recent memory .
Andy Thornley , the program director at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition , said it ’s the first time he ’s ever seen one :
The SFPD has never included the SFBC in the distribution of any such
press alert or other outreach or publicity about an investigation ; in
my four - plus years on SFBC staff I ’ve never been contacted by the SFPD
to aid in any investigation , to get the word out to our members or
utilize our own media connections .
We almost always have to seek
information from the SFPD about a bike crash or other cyclist - involved
incident , and receive very little information when we ask .
The SFBC has
no special standing with the SFPD as partners or community
representatives for the sake of sharing information , despite repeated
attempts by us to establish a closer working relationship .
Sgt. Wilfred Williams , a spokesperson for the SFPD , said inspectors do n’t treat bicyclists any different than other victims of crimes .
But " each incident is never the same " and " each inspector may handle a case differently . "
" From our point of view , be it a bicyclist , be it a motorist , be it someone walking across the street , be it someone catching a bus , be it someone in a park , if anyone is the victim of any type of crime , we put forth our best effort in trying to solve the crime . "
Williams said any problems the bicycling community has had with the SFPD " could be very easily remedied with better communication . "
Traffic on this blog has been very high of late .
I have noted ( and those who read the comments on this blog will also have noticed ) that my blogs in support of government spending – which is the only ( and I stress only ) way to avoid depression in the UK and other economies - have not gone down well with the libertarian community .
They think that all tax is theft ; all government activity is bad and those who win a mandate for government spending from democratic electorates are ‚ Äòstatists ’ .
These people – who wish to undermine society as we know it and who would end all social security , state pensions , public health services , state education and much more besides – want to overturn society as we know it .
As one said recently – we should rely for support on our families churches , synagogues or mosques – but not the state .
This ignores the fact that many are simply outside those communities of support .
For them I suspect the workhouse would beckon .
This Victorian concept of grudging charity is what these people promote – with the consequence of a random lottery of survival – and destitution for many .
I do not believe in this callous , self interested view of life .
It offends my Christian beliefs that suggest we have a duty as a society to fulfil the instruction – present in all major religions – but not in libertarianism that we love our neighbour as ourselves .
Of course that requires that we love ourselves and that means we have rights – and that they should be respected .
But there is no way on earthy civilised society can ignore the needs of others – and tax is the way we meet this need in our modern , complex society in which expectations of medical and social support are high –and the cost of meeting them as high .
Those who say otherwise are not offering an alternative within out society – they are suggesting we tear down our society and replace it with another .
In doing so they show complete contempt for many , some ( most , I suggest , by far ) of whom are in the positions they are through no fault at all of their own .
One on this blog has called those in need ‚ Äòan underclass ’ .
I make clear I think this as repugnant as racism .
I would reject this language from a racist .
I would reject a call from the far left to over throw society .
Why is it then that this vicious , self interested and , might I suggest inherently socially violent group are allowed to make this sort of contribution – as they do all over so many blogs where those with real concern for society , from across the mainstream political spectrum , seek to discuss issues in an open , rational and respectful fashion ?
I would love , for example , to see far - right libertarians thrown off the Guardian bogs as a matter of course – which might improve their appeal to many others as a result .
It is time we named these people for what they are – as being amongst the enemies of civilised society .
I am happy to do that .
It would be good if others would do the same – and fight them as we do racists .

Ingredients :
1 large shallot
12 ounces tomato paste
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup Coca - Cola

1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground chipotle
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon mesquite liquid smoke
salt
Directions :
Pulse all ingredients in a blender until smooth .

Allow to cool completely .
Pour into an airtight container and refrigerate .
My thoughts :
This year I have found a new interest in making homemade barbecue sauces .
It was n't that I had been using bottled sauces until now , I had n't been using any barbecue sauce at all until this summer .
The few times I encountered a bottled sauce they were always too sweet or weak tasting .
So I decided to start making my own .
It seemed like most of the tomato - based recipes I came across called for my old nemesis , ketchup .
Since I detest ketchup and its cloying sweetness , I knew that was not for me .
So I decided to use intensely flavored tomato paste as a base and add some of my favorite ingredients to create my own ultimate sauce .
The balsamic adds a fruity roundness , the coke adds a light sweetness ( and no one would guess that it was an ingredient at all ! ) and the savory Worcestershire sauce adds an extra depth of flavor .
I wanted a spicy - smoky note in the sauce so in went a dash of my favorite mesquite liquid smoke and ground chipotle pepper .
The result ?
A tangy , spicy , smoky , not - too - sweet sauce that is perfect for any meat .
This sauce is also fantastic drizzled over pork or beef sandwiches , meatballs or in pulled pork .

Camera abandoned by student on mountain top is returned full of snaps of fellow walkers
A student left a camera on a picturesque mountaintop in Snowdonia in an experiment into human trust .
Paul Bellis Jones , 24 , left a note with the camera near the summit of Mount Tryfan , instructing walkers to take a picture then leave it for the next person .
He was keen to know if the camera would be returned to his home in Glan Conwy , near Llandudno , as per his instructions , of if it would be stolen instead .
Snap happy : Paul Bellis Jones was left with over 30 pictures of fellow walkers when he abandoned a camera near the summit of Mount Tryfan
Thankfully for Mr Jones , over 30 ramblers took photographs of themselves at the beauty spot , which overlooks two large rocks near the summit .
When the film ran out four days later , the camera was personally returned to his house by a National Park warden .
The student , who left the camera and accompanying note in a sealed bag , launched the experiment in mid-May .
He said : ' I was speaking to a friend who said you can't trust anyone , anywhere these days .
' I did n't want to believe that so I set up this experiment to found out what might happen and proved you can trust people . '
High hopes :
The camera was left on the Snowdonia peak as an experiment
Strike a pose :
The camera was left with a note instructing walkers to take a picture then leave it for the next person
' I planned it that way .
Tryfan is very popular and gets a lot of visitors , but not as many as Snowdon .
' The camera was one of the use - once type and was left in clear view near Adam and Eve , the two large rocks , right at the summit .
' I took the first photo of my friends and then left it .
There was another group just behind us coming up to the summit and I saw they had found the camera and knew it was being used .
But I did n't know then if I would see it again . '
In the frame :
The camera was returned to Mr Jones personally by a National Park warden when the film ran out
Rock on :
The camera was left in clear view near two large rocks near the summit
The camera was returned to Mr Jones by Ogwen Valley warden Brian Jones .
He said : ' We find a lot of equipment on the hills during the year and we do our best to reunite it with their owners .
' I found the camera and thought it had been lost until I saw the note .
' I was passing his home and just dropped it off .
I 'm glad the photos came out fine . '
Say cheese : Mr Jones set up the experiment to prove people could be trusted
National trust :
Over 30 ramblers took photographs at the beauty spot

New York Times
BEIJING —
In the wake of Sunday ’s deadly riots in its western region of Xinjiang , China ’s central government took all the usual steps to enshrine its version of events as received wisdom : it crippled Internet service , blocked Twitter ’s micro-blogs , purged search engines of unapproved references to the violence , saturated the Chinese media with the state - sanctioned story .
It also took one most unusual step : Hours after troops quelled the protests , in which 156 people were reported killed , the state invited foreign journalists on an official trip to Urumqi , Xinjiang ’s capital and the site of the unrest , “ to know better about the riots . ”
Indeed , it set up a media center at a downtown hotel — with a hefty discount on rooms — to keep arriving reporters abreast of events .
( Link )
From the
As Arianna Huffington put it in her op - ed last week , China “ slammed the door in the face of new media — and offered traditional reporters a front row seat . ”
Now , from the Associated Press we find out that Afghanistan is learning from China ’s example :
KABUL —
The Afghan government has blocked access to four Web sites with President Hamid Karzai ’s name in the address that are critical of the Afghan leader or have links to sites advertising locally taboo subjects such as online dating and mail order brides .
The shutdown order comes ahead of the country ’s Aug. 20 presidential election .
An Information Ministry spokesman initially said the original complaint about two of the sites came from the Karzai campaign .
Karzai ’s campaign spokesman agreed , but later called back to deny involvement .
( Link )
Kharzai ’s actions might seem strange , since most of his rival candidates have no internet access .
But that ’s not the point of doing this .
By blocking the site , he controls the public perception of his regime through state media .
And “ state media ” really is the operating phrase .
Newspapers are easy to shut down ; so are TV stations .
You can block a website , but you ca n’t block an internet user so easily .
The more access people have to the tools of new media , the less control a government has over what the world sees , hears , and reads about it .
Via email , Juan Cole tells us what happened in Tehran on Friday :
Every time Ansari mentioned the Supreme Leader , the crowd booed .
Every time he referred to the opposition as traitors , chants of “ liar , liar ” started .
When he mentioned that everyone should listen to the advice and dictates of the Supreme Leader , chants of “ Death to the dictator ” were loudly shouted .
When he derailed ( sic ) America and Britain for muddling in Iran ’s affairs , the crowd erupted in chants of “ Down with Russia ” ( because Russia immediately recognized the re-election of Ahmadinejad and congratulated him ) .
As he spoke of the recent killings of Muslims in China , the crowd chided him and the system for its hypocrisy .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has kicked the man - on - the - scene reporters out of Iran because , unlike in China , the regime in Iran has been unable to quell dissent in the streets .
Reporters will not be allowed to return to Tehran until it goes quiet — and the demonstrators are determined not to be quiet .
Indeed , they have proven impossible to shut up .
We know this because more emails , blogs , and videos come out of Iran every day .
They wind up on YouTube and get reposted through social media sites .
We listen to thousands of voices jam the call to prayer , or chant Allah ’u ’akbar in the night :
Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's attempt to bar all MediaSentry evidence from her copyright infringement retrial next week has failed , as has her attempt to assert a " fair use " defense .
Judge Michael Davis oversaw the first Jammie Thomas trial and was sympathetic to her plight .
After a jury awarded the music labels $ 222,000 in damages for Thomas ' file - sharing , the judge made clear that he disapproved of the penalty :
While the Court does not discount Plaintiffs ' claim that , cumulatively , illegal downloading has far - reaching effects on their businesses , the damages awarded in this case are wholly disproportionate to the damages suffered by Plaintiffs .
Thomas allegedly infringed on the copyrights of 24 songs — the equivalent of approximately three CDs , costing less than $ 54 , and yet the total damages awarded is $ 222,000 — more than five hundred [ emphasis his ] times the cost of buying 24 separate CDs and more than four thousand times the cost of three CDs ...
But that dislike of the verdict does n't mean that Davis is going to give Thomas - Rasset ( who married in the time between the two trials ) whatever she asks for .
Case in point : today , Davis tossed out every argument against RIAA investigative firm MediaSentry , which collected the information that led to Thomas - Rasset 's trial .
Thomas - Rasset 's new lawyer , Kiwi Camara , had argued that the company violated the Minnesota Private Detectives Act ( MPDA ) because it had not taken out a private investigator 's license in the state .
But Davis concluded that " MediaSentry is not subject to the MPDA .
Based on the language of the MPDA , the Act does not apply to persons or companies operating outside of the state of Minnesota ...
MediaSentry does not operate within Minnesota .
It has no employees in Minnesota and does not conduct any activities in Minnesota . "
Camara also claimed that MediaSentry was violating federal " pen register " laws and wiretapping statutes by recording the packets sent to it over the Internet .
The Court did n't buy that one , either .
" The Pen Register Act can not be intended to prevent individuals who receive electronic communications from recording the IP information sent to them .
If it did apply in those cases , then the Internet could not function because standard computer operations require recording IP addresses so parties can communicate with one another over the Internet , " he wrote .
" Additionally , the Pen Register Act does not bar recordings of the contents of communications that are made with the consent of one of the parties to the communication . "
As to the claim that Thomas - Rasset had an expectation of privacy around her communications , the judge completely disagreed .
" There is no expectation of solitude or seclusion when a person activates a file sharing program and sends a file to the requesting computer , " he wrote .
" By participating in Kazaa , a user expects millions of other users to view and copy her files , each time receiving the very information that Thomas ?
Rasset sent to MediaSentry and MediaSentry recorded . "
So much for that defense , which aimed to kneecap the recording industry lawsuit before the trial even began .
( Camara does plan to contest the labels ' copyright registrations , though , which would also cripple the case completely . )
If the case proceeded past those obstacles , Camara still had hope that he could claim ( like his mentor , Harvard Law's Charles Nesson ) " fair use " in this case .
But fair use is an " affirmative defense , " one that must be raised before trial so that witnesses can be questioned about it in deposition and discovery .
" Defendant failed to raise the fair use defense in her Answer , at any time before the First Trial , during the First Trial , or at any time leading up to this retrial until only two weeks before retrial , " said the judge .
" This litigation has gone on for years , yet Plaintiffs had no inkling of this defense until the eve of trial .
Because Plaintiffs had no notice of this defense , they have taken no discovery regarding Defendant ’s alleged fair use defense .
The record in this case , with which this Court is intimately familiar , gave no hint that a fair use defense would be forthcoming .
It would be highly prejudicial to Plaintiffs to allow Defendant to assert this new affirmative defense on the eve of retrial , when they have no opportunity to conduct discovery on this issue ... "
So , MediaSentry is in , fair use is out , and Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's expert witness has had his testimony pared back .
( He wo n't be able to invoke the specter of someone using Thomas - Rasset 's wireless router to share files , for instance , since it emerged form the first trial that she did n't own one . )
Oh , and as for that first trial ?
It will only be referred to in court as " a prior proceeding , " the results of which wo n't be revealed to the jury .
We 'll have daily coverage of the case live from the courthouse starting next Monday .

Tanker fire shuts I -75
Firefighters battle a blaze where a tanker explosion on 1 - 75 caused the collapse of part of the Nine Mile overpass in Hazel Park on Wednesday , July 15 , 2009 .
The freeway was closed in both directions after the crash occurred about 8:00 p.m .
No injuries have been reported .
Ricardo Thomas / The Detroit News
The family of former Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer won an important legal victory Monday against the manufacturer of the helmets and shoulder pads he wore when he died nearly eight years ago from complications of heatstroke .
A federal judge in Ohio concluded that manufacturer Riddell Inc. had a duty to warn Stringer that its helmets and shoulder pads could contribute to heat stroke when used in hot conditions .
As a result , U.S. District Court judge John D. Holschuh ordered a Nov. 2 jury trial to determine whether Riddell 's failure to warn Stringer comprises legal culpability for his death .
Regardless of that eventual outcome , Stringer family spokesman James Gould termed Monday 's ruling " landmark " because it makes the connection between the equipment and heat stroke .
Gould said the best way to uphold Stringer 's legacy is to " make sure what happened to Korey does n't happen to any other football player -- from the National Football League all the way down to kids in Pop Warner . "
" This decision should go a long way to ensure it doesn't , " Gould added .
A Riddell spokesperson did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment .
Stringer collapsed after a training camp practice on July 31 , 2001 and died the next day in Mankato , Minn .
His wife , Kelci , settled legal claims in 2003 against the Minnesota doctor who treated him .
She also settled a lawsuit earlier this year against the NFL , which agreed to support the creation of a heat illness prevention program for athletes of all ages .
Technically a re-read , but I had n't read most of it since I was a kid reading it in dull bits of church , and I think I must have skipped some , because I do n't remember all of it .
Going to review the books separately .

Going to review the books separately .
I read the New Testament first because it was research , then went back to the beginning .
Matthew : Nothing would cure me of any impulse towards Christianity more than reading this .
Meaning , of course , that the pre-Reformation church was right to tell people to look at the pretty pictures and go to mass but not read it .
Mark :
This was the original , and there was also Q. Oh dear .
So obviously not what the Church made of him later , in terms of being incarnate God , so obviously a confused person wandering about a backwater province of Rome feeling his way .
And John so obviously important in ways that are not what was made of the story later .
Fascinating to see this as a building block for such a teetering edifice .
Luke :
How could anyone start off with this Bible and come up with the concept of biblical inerrancy ?
It would seem more plausible to me if they 'd come up with Lacan or Foucault based on having four contradictory accounts of the same events .
These things can not all be true if they contradict each other !
If they did the Flight into Egypt , then they could n't have had the Presentation in the Temple .
And yet , I have stood in front of paintings of both done by pious people who are n't seeing the problem .
John : I like this one best .
Entirely contradictory , but poetic .
Acts of the Apostles : I 've read this one relatively recently .
I like it .
It 's an account of some ordinary people wandering around the eastern Med in the early Roman Empire trying to organize a cult .
Clearly a real account .
Perversely , I wish there were three contradictory versions of it .
Why did n't they start a religion where there are necessarily four contradictory versions of everything ?
Why was n't that a standard of truth ?
That would have been really neat .
Epistles :
What ?
St. Paul says they can stop with the food rules as long as they do n't eat blood .
I -- what ?
They ate blood all the time !
Christian Europe in the middle ages ate blood sausage and blood puddings and meat with blood , and they still do .
I never even heard this !
Do people read their own Bible ?
Christians totally eat blood , right now !
This is worse than " God hates shrimp " , this is supposed to be the new dispensation , and the new dispensation is you can eat shrimp and bacon but not blood .
Guys !
Do your own religion right !
Pay attention .
Generally reading the epistles is great , I love letters , and these are n't very different from reading the Patristic stuff I 've been reading , except that they 're supposed to be canonical and holy in a different way -- people would be OK with St Basil being wrong but not these , they knot themselves into pretzels to make these right , except when they ignore them .
Interesting to compare .
Revelation : I can't help thinking about Slactivist 's takedown of Left Behind all the time .
And having finished , back to the beginning .
Genesis : People say the Bible is like mythology , but it is n't .
It 's like listening to old people tell long meandering stories where they leave bits out -- oh , actually , she was his half - sister , so it was n't a lie -- and motivations get left out .
Also , how did Rebecca 's dad know about Abram and Sarai 's name change ?
Did they send him a name change card ?
" Abram and Sarai would like you to know that from now on , they want to be known as Abraham and Sarah .
( Pronouns remain the same . )
Thanks for remembering ! "
And why did Lot stay in the wilderness ?
There were all those other cities he could have gone to .
Weird , weird , book .
Exodus : Orson Scott Card wrote a series of books where God is a broken computer .
It seems obvious to me reading this that God in this book is a stranded alien with very specific needs and very limited powers that mostly do n't help much .
Seen in this way , he 's the most sympathetic character .
He needs an ark to be carried in , and he needs to get back to the mother ship in Israel before it leaves .
He 's degenerating all the time .
This makes so much sense I 'm surprised it is n't a ) an SF book and b ) a loopy Velikovsky theory .
Leviticus : More staggering around with the poor confused alien .
The Children of Israel sure did like to stop worshipping God and worship idols .
And the food rules .
Numbers :
More numbers than I could possibly have imagined .
Wow .
Where did this come from ?
What purpose could it possibly serve ?
This is even worse than the list of ships .
Am I supposed to remember all these names ?
They 're all so weird ... except for the occasional one that sounds like an American .
Deuteronomy : And more ?
Really ?
Joshua :
You know what 's weird ?
Being in the POV of barbarians .
" And then we came to the cities of civilization and we trashed them because we do n't know about cities . "
Barbarians do not normally write chronicles , and so that feels odd to me .
This should be cited more by historians .
Judges : OK , so this is a chronicle .
Fine .
Ruth : Odd little episode .
It 's odd generally to see how much space the " bible stories " have in the bible .
I do n't understand why this incident survived and was important .
4 Books of Kings :
These are more actual historical chronicles and therefore quite interesting .
I now have a theory that following the rules is hard , and worshipping Baal and having bacon was very tempting .
If the alternatives are other monotheisms , then it's not so tempting , not like falling away into paganism , which they did at the drop of a graven image .
2 Books of Chronicles :
Oh , I was supposed to be memorizing all these kings ready to get more information about them ?
When it said there was more information there really was ?
Who collated this ?
Ezra :
This is great .
Nehemiah : Oh , first person , and events , not just ranting !
This is also great .
But I 'm trying to fit it together with actual history .
The Babylonians conquered them , and then the Persians conquered them , and then ( after this ) Alexander conquered them , and then they were Hellenistic and then Romans .
( NB to God -- next time , consider giving your chosen people an island .
or possibly Switzerland .
Somewhere more defensible and less in the way ?
Cyprus , maybe ? )
And this excellent story about rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem happened after the Persian conquest ?
I could probably find a concordance .
but it would probably be annoyingly religious .
Wait -- I should get Tobit and Judith next , but King James left them out ?
Gah .
I 'll have to find another translation and come back to them at the end .
I hate it when translators do this kind of thing .
Esther : The Purim story .
Reads like actual history , coherent and makes sense and everything .
Shushan is Susa .
Remarkably little God in this one , just some Jews coping with persecution in the Persian Empire .
Job : Good heavens , philosophy and theology !
Just when I 'd given up expecting any .
But I 'm back to " how the heck did anyone come up with the concept of Biblical inerrancy starting from THIS Bible " .
I liked Job .
But it does not fit with either a ) Christianity as it is OR b ) the rest of the Bible .
Nor is God 's behaviour either ethical or consistent .
I could take a system based in Job , or I could take a system without it , but saying it 's totally canonical then utterly ignoring it and its theological and philosophical implications is bizarre .
( Judaism is easier to fit Job into , where Satan is a job .
But even then , what 's with this annual meetup of God and the sons of God and Satan ?
Again , I could retrofit the universe , but it would be hard work . )
I 'm back to thinking that the pre-Reformation position that reading the Bible was dangerous and confusing and best left to experts had a great deal to be said for it , at least if you want people to follow the religion .
But I 've been told that while actually reading the Bible is a Protestant thing to do , even Catholics are encouraged to do it now .
I have no idea how this works .
It must take a miracle .
Yay , Psalms next .
Psalms .
Lots of poetry , some of it intimately familiar , some of it completely off the wall strange .
Beautiful language .
Very very long .
Took forever to read .
And now , a whole book of proverbs .
Well , you can't say it 's boring , you never know what 's coming next .
Proverbs
Again , a weird mixture of the very familiar and the utterly off the wall .
Most of it went in one ear and out the other .
Ecclesiastes
Beautiful , philosophical , kind of grumpy , kind of Stoic .
I do n't understand how it fits with the rest of it .
The discussions on what to put in , what was canonical for the Jewish bible must have been epic .
I only know about the Christian arguments , and they pretty much took these as accepted .
I expect it 's too early for there to be good records the way there are for Church councils .
But I expect there was a lot of debate on this one .
The Song of Solomon
Excellent poetry about love and sex , some from the female point of view .
I hear it 's supposed to be an analogy for Christ and the Church .
Risible .
Obviously not .
Really good though .
My pleasure in reading the bible has had an uptick with Ecclesiastes and this .
Isaiah
You know that passage about the virgin having a baby and calling his name Emmanuel ?
Of course you do .
Did you know the next line starts AND , and goes on to say he 'll eat butter and honey to know good from evil early because before he naturally knows good from evil the king of Syria will die ?
Of course you do n't .
It 's hard to see this kind of picking and choosing from sources as being anything other than mendacity .
But people read this .
Christians read it .
Do they read it with their eyes half closed , to stop reading at Emmanuel and not see the AND ?
Even if modern Christians do this , what about the early Church ?
What about St Paul ?
What about Jerome ?
Surely St Jerome had more integrity than to do that ?
I 'm horrified .
Some good ranting , but this is clearly in the genre of " prophecy written after the event " like the Ohs of Merlin .
Jeremiah -- now this is how prophets ought to be .
Personal , accurate , specific , and the bit where he got thrown into prison during the siege was unexpectedly exciting .
Much less obviously fake than Isaiah , because of the details like the king burning the scroll and the crusts of bread .
This works as a fantasy story about an actual prophet .
This is the only part of the Bible so far that works as fantasy .
Exodus etc. sort of work as SF .
Lamentations . --
I thought that did n't sound very cheerful , but it turned out to be short and very poetic , and I guess people are entitled to lament after they 've correctly predicted everything awful that was coming and nobody listened and then it has all happened .
Ezekial -- so far , so whiplash .
Woah , where did this come from ?
Visions , and not God telling you that if you do n't quit with the idol worship the king of Babylon will trash your city but super specific fantasy images of weird flying animals .
I have seen Raphael 's painting of this , but even so it was a surprise .
And it goes on , weird imagery , overly specific measurements , odd prophecies , and then suddenly bang , " shall these bones live " that I know both from Eliot and from the song , both of them undoubtedly coming from this one chapter of Ezekial , and on both sides of it acres of stuff that nobody has ever heard .
How did they -- I mean did they throw a dart at the pages and decide what was going to be used ?
It 's so weird .
Now on to Daniel , which I remember from Sunday school , Lion 's den , furnace , Shadrach and Abednego .
Let 's see how much is really there .
Daniel : Very short , and indeed , has the furnace and the lions den , and also some deeply weird prophetic stuff .
Trying to reconcile dates of Darius / Cyrus etc probably not a good plan .
Hosea : Lots of whoredom , and not so disapproving as usual .
Joel : Short , vivid , and a surprising amount of it familiar though I would n't have known where it was from .
Amos : Savonarola 's favourite prophet , so I 've re-read this recently .
Obadiah :
In one ear and out the other .
Jonah :
That great city , Ninevah .
Also , it 's a fish not a whale .
It 's so odd that everyone knows this one .
If I went out into the street and stopped a random person even if they were a Buddhist they'd know this , but not a word of Obadiah or Micah .
Micah : More propheting .
Doom , doom .
Nahum :
And more , some specific .
Habakkak : Again , the conference where they decided what to put in must have been fun .
Zephanaiah : More Christian picking and choosing relevant bits .
Haggai : More propheting , less dire than some .
Zecchariah : More propheting
Malachi : Done done done done done !
Well , that was ... interesting , and boring , and took a lot of persistence .
So glad I 'm done !
If I 'd started at the beginning , going on to the New Testament now , and stories of actual people doing actual things would be a real relief .
As it is , zero desire to re-read those bits .
I cannot recommend reading this book this way to any sane person .
I cannot recommend reading it if you are a Christian and you 'd like to stay one , because it would need so much doublethink that it could n't be good for you .
I do , however , recommend it heartily to any atheist or agnostic who likes Christian art and Latin masses and would sort of like to believe in Christianity , or anyone thinking about Pascal 's wager , or anyone in doubt from that direction , because there is NOTHING going to dispel any doubts or " would n't it be nice if it were true " or " what if God had gone to all that trouble to save me and I was ungratefully ignoring it " better than reading this with an open mind because it is so very very obviously not an inerrant revelation , or even a coherent basis for a religion , and you 'd have to be feeling super charitable to even think it was a glass darkly .
It 's a mix of history and poetry and ranting and very occasional scraps of philosophy and theology and it does n't fit together at all , and it reveals the selectivity of its readers .
And I do n't think I should say any more , because it would be unkind .
Next Generation Fund
Stephen Timms said :
“ If the question is , is the levy definitely going to be legislated for this side of the election , I ca n’t say for sure .
Things that are contentious will have to be left until [ AFTER THE ELECTION ] . ”
Next Generation Fund
The governments new Communications Minister , Stephen Timms , has given his strongest hint yet that its controversial plans for a 50 p per month tax on all fixed UK phone lines ( aka -) - designed to help foster development and uptake of next generation ( faster ) broadband services , could be dumped .
The levy was first proposed in June by Lord Carter 's final Digital Britain report ( original news ) , which also set a target of 2017 for 90 % of UK homes and businesses to be within reach of next generation broadband lines .
However Timms recently warned The Times newspaper that , this being an election year , such a tax was unlikely to survive .
Timms has since given several even stronger hints to other mainstream media outlets , which would appear to support the above outcome .
It 's also understood that The Conservative party is stiffly opposed to the tax and since Labour looks less likely to win the next election then .. you do the math .
Ironically thewas one of the few measures with any kind of substance to come out of Carter 's Digital Britain report and its loss would make the whole exercise seem rather pointless .
However the tax was also controversial for many other reasons .
Europe was concerned about its impact on competition , others felt that it would n't have raised enough cash and we had concerns about how the money could be " fairly " distributed and yet still be effective at reaching its goal .
The " Polywell " Approach to Fusion
Overview
This approach neatly side - steps several of the difficulties that have kept fusion always the " energy source of tomorrow . "
Theoretical and experimental results suggest that this " polywell " approach to fusion can not only generate net power , but do it in a clean way , with no radioactive byproducts , using fuels ( hydrogen and boron ) that are abundant environmentally friendly .
It 's just a matter of confirming the results with a few more experiments , and then working out the engineering details for a full - scale power plant .

SHENZHEN , China 
In this sprawling metropolis in southeastern China stand two hulking brown buildings erected by a private company , the Longgang trash incinerators .
They can be smelled a mile away and pour out so much dark smoke and hazardous chemicals that hundreds of local residents recently staged an all - day sit-in , demanding that the incinerators be cleaner and that a planned third incinerator not be built nearby .
After surpassing the United States as the world ’s largest producer of household garbage , China has embarked on a vast program to build incinerators as landfills run out of space .
But these incinerators have become a growing source of toxic emissions , from dioxin to mercury , that can damage the body ’s nervous system .
And these pollutants , particularly long - lasting substances like dioxin and mercury , are dangerous not only in China , a growing body of atmospheric research based on satellite observations suggests .
They float on air currents across the Pacific to American shores .
Chinese incinerators can be better .
At the other end of Shenzhen from Longgang , no smoke is visible from the towering smokestack of the Baoan incinerator , built by a company owned by the municipal government .
Government tests show that it emits virtually no dioxin and other pollutants .
Certainly many of the religious references in the speeches Crabb studied were made during debates about terrorism and seemed to originate in an interpretation of the attacks as a " clash of civilisations " between the Christian West and fundamentalist Islam ; a discourse that saw religion used to divide the virtuous , " us " from the murderous " them " .
At the time , I listened with alarm as MPs lined up to claim Christian identity while seeking to justify the Howard government 's decision to join then US president George Bush in the attack on Iraq .
However , I think there 's more to it than this .
While the very public embrace of religion as justification for particular policies may still be confined to a minority of members , there is a risk that religious reasoning , not subject to the usual rational challenges , may grow in significance .
As political philosophies have been eroded in favour of a pragmatic market - based materialism , and as the parties look more and more alike , elected representatives are often unable to explain why they make the decisions they do .
Religion offers a possible way out , even if many of those espousing religious codes to justify their political stances have only the haziest notions about scripture and theology .
No matter  very few others have a clue either .
What is important is that the MP appears principled and upright , yet not so devout as to arouse suspicion in a largely secular society .
However , there are dissenters defending the secular nature of our democracy .
Every sitting day in the House of Representatives , before the conduct of any other business , two prayers are said ; the first asking " Almighty God " to bless the Parliament and to " direct and prosper " its deliberations for the advancement of his " glory " , and , almost as an afterthought , for " the true welfare of the people of Australia " ; the second , the Lord 's Prayer .
On most days , only a few  presumably Christian  MPs attend .
But on Tuesdays , because the House convenes just before question time , all members , under threat from the whips , are required to be seated before questions begin .
Some Labor
MPs regularly choose to wait in the Opposition lobby until prayers are concluded ( at least I suppose they still do , unless the ascension of a leader who is a self - described " God botherer " has changed all that ) .
During the period of my self - imposed exile on the backbench , I took part in this small act of resistance to religious observance in politics .
The talk in the lobby as we waited for prayers to finish sometimes turned to the reasons we were there .
It was clear that one of the objections was that the prayers recited did not countenance faiths other than Christianity ; believers of other faiths were effectively excluded .
So too were non-believers like me .
Mention too was made of the fact that our constitution provides for the separation of church and state in recognition of the need to protect freedom of thought , conscience and religion .
While we could avoid taking part in the ritual , we could n't prevent other members violating our religious freedom by purporting to speak for all of us in offering our deliberations to " Almighty God " .
Problems are caused by blood clotting too much or too little Scientists have discovered a molecular mechanism that is key to regulating the way blood clots .
The team from Harvard University , writing in the journal Science , said the finding could help treat people who have blood - clotting disorders .
If blood clots too much , people can develop a potentially fatal thrombosis ; too little and they can bleed to death .
UK experts said the research was important and could help develop new treatments for blood disorders .
This discovery should aid the creation of more effective medicines
Professor Jeremy Pearson , British Heart Foundation
A molecular messaging system has to maintain a balance between blood not clotting too much or too little .
The Harvard team identified an area on the von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) blood - clotting protein which contains a molecular sensor to regulate the size of the protein , important for it to work effectively .
VWF is vital to the body 's circulation .
It controls the balance between blood clotting and bleeding , and abnormalities affecting VWF can lead to health problems such as bleeding disorders and heart attacks .
Dr Wesley Wong , who worked on the research , said : " The human body has an incredible ability to heal from life 's scrapes and bruises .
" A central aspect of this response to damage is the ability to bring bleeding to an end , a process known as haemostasis .
" Yet regulating haemostasis is a complex balancing act . "
The team say the work will improve understanding of how the body regulates the formation of blood clots , and could also give some insight into how bleeding disorders , such as von Willebrand disease , disrupt this regulation system , potentially leading to new avenues for treatment and diagnosis .
' Refine treatment ' Professor David Lane of the department of haematology at Imperial College London , said : " The size of the VWF protein is important .
" This is controlled by unfolding of VWF by blood flow , which then allows an enzyme - called ADAMTS13 - to get into the protein and chop it up .
" This research has shed light on how this occurs by revealing the detailed structure of the section of VWF that is unfolded and chopped .
" It is important because it tells us where these important sites are in relation to the faults in the protein that cause inherited bleeding disorders , and it tells us more about how blood flow unfolds VWF . "
Professor Lane added : " The findings help us to understand the interplay between molecular structure of VWF , blood flow and common diseases , which will help to refine development of treatments . "
Professor Jeremy Pearson , Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation , said : " These researchers have deciphered how a crucial part of a crucial protein in our circulation is built .
" This helps us understand how it works in controlling the amount we bleed after injury , while preventing blood clots forming in the wrong place . "
He added : " This discovery should aid the creation of more effective medicines for people with diseases , such as von Willebrand 's Disease and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP ) [ blood clotting disorder ] , for which treatments are currently not good enough . "

Apple 's latest $ 29 update to OS X Snow Leopard ships this Friday — but will all of your essential applications run when you install it ?
This application compatibility list is a good place to find out .
Advertisement
I 've been running various builds of the Snow Leopard preview for months now , and every single one of my most important applications ( with the exception of one * ) is working just fine .
Advertisement
* I happen to use an abandoned beta of Synergy KM to share my mouse and keyboard between my PC and Mac , and its System Preferences pane requires a restart every once in awhile to get it to connect .
Overall , a minor annoyance for other worthy updates .
Notable non-compatible apps to look out for from the list : Adobe CS2 Suite , Adobe Photoshop Elements , CoverSutra , Cyberduck , ( maybe ) Disk Inventory X , Disk Warrior , and ( maybe ) Google Gears .
( Google Gears occasionally does this weird thing where it launches a virtual disk and then closes it again ; otherwise it has worked for me .
Disk Inventory X also works for me , albeit slowly , in build 10A421a of Snow Leopard . )
Got a must - have application of your own that 's not yet working with Snow Leopard ?
Let 's hear it in the comments .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned on Saturday that the United States would not accept a nuclear North Korea and the growing threat could trigger an arms race in Asia .
In a speech to an Asian defense conference in Singapore , Gates also warned Pyongyang against transferring nuclear technology abroad .
“ We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us , ” Gates told a meeting on defense ministers in Singapore .
“ We will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state . ”
Gates said the Obama administration would hold North Korea “ fully accountable ” if it transferred any nuclear material outside its borders .
“ The transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies .
And we would hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such action . ”
The statement seemed to harden and broaden the Obama administration ’s stand on North Korea ’s recent series of provocations from a regional security issue to a global proliferation threat .
This week North Korea has detonated a nuclear device , launched a series of missiles , including one on Friday , and threatened to attack South Korea .
Gates ’ speech will reassure allies such as Japan and South Korea that the new Obama administration will stand firm on the Cold War ’s last frontier on the Korean peninsula .
His remarks may also be intended to send a message to would - be buyers of North Korean missile and nuclear technology .
Impoverished North Korea earns an estimated $ 1.5 billion a year from missile sales , and past customers include Pakistan , Libya , Iran , Syria and Egypt .
But Gates said the U.S. did not view North Korea as a direct military threat now and Washington ’s next step would be political in reaching out to other regional powers .
He was due to meet Japan and South Korea ’s defense ministers later on Saturday for a trilateral discussion about North Korea and regional security issues .
A South Korean newspaper reported on Saturday that North Korea is preparing to move an intercontinental ballistic missile from a factory near Pyongyang to a launch site on the east coast .
North Korea has warned of an intercontinental ballistic missile test in anger over U.N. Security Council punishment of what Pyongyang said was a satellite launch on April 5 .
Gates said North Korea is creating an environment in the region that may spark an Asian arms race .
“ If they continue on a path they are on , I think the consequences for stability in the region are significant and I think it poses the potential , the potential for some kind of an arms race in this region . ”
He said strong financial sanctions were needed to tackle North Korea , echoing comments made by Australia ’s Prime Minister Kevin Rudd at the defense meeting on Friday .
Rudd , in a keynote address to the defense conference , said North Korea only responds to a unified stand from the international community .
“ The first test of strength will be what measures we embrace as an international community through the U.N. Security Council , ” he said .
“ The measures have to be uniform and strong . ”
As mcjoan wrote earlier , during the second quarter alone , AHIP , the health insurance industry 's political arm , has bankrolled anti-reform efforts to the tune of at least $ 133 million .
To put the insurance industry 's largesse in perspective , they spent about as much in the second quarter as the Bush - Kerry campaigns spent in the 2004 general election combined and 50 % more than the Obama campaign 's quarterly average .
To fight back , reform advocates are on the air with a tough new ad going after the health insurance industry , and the GOP for supporting it .
Going after the GOP 's ties to the health insurance industry is an important new front in the debate , and it was made possible in large part by the GOP itself , which gave Democrats a stationary target last week when its
House leadership introduced a health care plan that amounts to a $ 700 billion giveaway to the health insurance industry .
With their legislation , Republicans have made it clear they are on the side of health insurance companies .
Democrats are on the side of patients and health care providers .
You can expect reform allies to take advantage of the GOP 's blunder in the coming days and weeks , because this really is about the health insurance industry vs. the people -- and that 's not a debate AHIP or the Republicans will win .

Web site to selected test users , but accidentally revealed the ' Facebook Lite edition ' to a much larger group than intended .
" This evening , the test was temporarily exposed to a larger set of users by mistake , " said Facebook officials .
According to Facebook , the Lite edition is a fast - loading , simplified version of Facebook that enables people to post comments , accept friend requests and look at photos and status updates .
Facebook Lite is being tested in India and other countries where new users are flooding to the service .
Invitations to take part in a private test of ' Facebook Lite ' reached a variety of U.S. bloggers only to have the enclosed links to be available to everyone online .
The screen shots of the new version captured and posted online revealed a Facebook page devoted to fresh comments and updates from friends in a style that could challenge the real - time interplay on Twitter .
Facebook had announced on Monday that it had acquired FriendFeed , a startup which allows members to see what their friends are doing online and share content .
FriendFeed has been described as a potential rival to Twitter in its ability to conduct real - time search , an area where Facebook has been seeking to expand .
Deregulation of the banks was built on two intellectual pillars .
One was that regulation was not necessary because banks would self - regulate in order to protect their reputation .
Please stop laughing .
The other was that regulation would not work because regulators would always be one step behind the bankers .
And unfortunately we cannot laugh this one off .
Indeed , the technical problems facing regulation are now compounded by political impediments .
Green shoots , lobbying by the banks , and turf wars among the regulators have eroded the momentum for action .
So if banks cannot effectively be regulated by the authorities , what can be done ?
The Turner review came up with two solutions .
One is radically to raise the capital requirements of banks so that shareholders have something to lose if management goes wrong .
The other is to change incentive payments for managers so bonuses depend on the past three years of performance .
The increase in capital requirements makes sense .
But the three - year rule is weak .
The inherent problem facing shareholders is that incentive payments cannot go negative .
However much damage a manager inflicts , wiping out both shareholders and depositors , the consequences cannot be remotely commensurate .
As a result , even bonuses with a three - year lag bias the system towards risk - taking .
If you thought big bonuses were history you have missed BAB , the new banking mnemonic : yes , Bonuses Are Back .
So how can we avoid another Northern Rock ?
While shareholders cannot impose genuine penalties , governments can .
Fear of jail would discourage excessive risk .
Before bankers huff about blunting incentives , yes , I realise that without carrots , bankers will just sit and gaze at the office ceiling .
Bankers , set your minds at rest : the introduction of penalties would permit BABEL : that is , the carrots for genuinely smart behaviour could be Even Larger .
The key problem with using the law against bankers has been the difficulty of getting a conviction : surely , the managers of Northern Rock did not intend to profit at our expense .
We do not need to set the burden of proof that high .
Intention misses the point .
Faced with a corpse and a killer , police do not need to prove ill intent : manslaughter sets the hurdle lower than murder .
It is enough to show the killer was irresponsible .
That is the standard we need ; we need a crime of managing a bank irresponsibly : in other words , bankslaughter .
On Turner 's proposal a manager can still benefit from recklessness – as long as the bank does not blow up within three years .
After that , if the bank crashes he can be off playing golf .
With bankslaughter , when the bank blows up – even if it is a decade later – a criminal investigation traces back to determine whether crucial decisions were reckless .
If a reasonable banker faced with the information available at the time would not have taken those risks , the person responsible is dragged off the golf course and jailed .
Once bankslaughter was on the books , bonuses would be less dangerous .
Managers would have to weigh the balance between risk and return and take defensible decisions .
I doubt hyper-caution would be a problem : the overly cautious would not get bonuses .
Surely we can rely on our bankers to exhibit the necessary degree of greed .
Bankslaughter would target the wild fringe rather than the average banker .
The wild fringe matters : sometimes it generates a crisis that becomes systemic .
We now know that as early as 2004 , the Bank of England anticipated that Northern Rock would implode .
Its business model was so risky that other banks had not adopted it .
But in the short term , reckless behaviour looks smart , and so wiser management teams were coming under pressure to emulate it .
By the time of its demise , the Rock was doing a fifth of British mortgages .
By curtailing the wild fringe , bankslaughter would complement Turner 's approach , which is to make the average bank behave better .
Both are needed .
Turner 's concern about performance is manifestly necessary .
But the crisis has revealed that some banks are more rotten than others .
In Britain , the two Scottish banks and Northern Rock were pioneers of imprudence .
In Ireland two banks run by an alliance of construction firms and politicians swept the country to ruin .
Even if shareholder capital is at risk , some banks are likely to suffer because of poor corporate governance .
Had bankslaughter been on the books , the management of Northern Rock would now perhaps be in the dock .
But , vengeful as we feel , the point of criminal sanction would not be to punish reckless behaviour but to discourage it .
If this law had existed , would our financial knights have been so errant ?
Pauline Harris and Simon Kuper take a detailed look at working from home in I had a meeting in the bath ( FT , August 1st ) ups , downs and sideshows .
As they note , for companies it can be a source of savings ( office space , utilities and so on ) .
For employees , it gives them back the time wasted commuting , they pollute less and save money otherwise spent at the pump .
The authors also suggest that people might be more productive working at home as there are less interruptions than in an office setup .
For others , freelancers and entrepreneurs it is now socially acceptable .
We all have heard people interviewed with kids sounds in the background .
What makes working at home successful according to I had a meeting in the bath is first and foremost having a space of your own .
Make the space work for you .
Can afford it , hire people like Neil Zimmerman of At Work At Home to design a custom home office for you .
For those of us who do not have room in our living quarters for office space , the article mentions the option of Shedworking documented by Alex Johnson , a homeworker in the UK .
You obviously need a backyard or a garden ( and a permit ) to setup this extension .
The advantage in the eyes of Alex Johnson is that even though your ' office ' is only a stone throw away from your home when you close the door you leave your work behind .
I noticed attractive offerings like this room with a view from one of his sponsors , Garden 2 Office ( picture above ) .
It does not take discipline just to get your work done .
It also takes discipline to know when to stop .
Health , sanity and a rested body and mind are at stake .
Pauline Harris and Simon Kuper remind us that in order to get things done , we need to set ground rules with family members for ' do not disturb ' times .
As for working hours , each person has to find when their mind is at its sharpest .
If your energy is depleted , take a nap they suggest and also find time to meet people face to face .
Let 's do lunch sometimes .
No car , no punch clock for Monday Work Etiquette # 101
Number 100 for Monday Work Etiquette was :
Public Schools Are Evil !
There is nothing more damning and destructive to America 's youth today than the Godless public school system !
I thank God for the Bill of Rights .
I thank God for the wisdom of our founding fathers .
I thank God for the the First Amendment which gives us the legal right to freedom of speech , press , religion , and the right to peaceably assemble and protest .
I am exercising my God - given freedom , by publishing this desperately needed article about the Godless and heathen public school system .
There is no evil today like the Communist , humanistic , sexually immoral public school system .
I detest the public school system !
It is destructive to the faith of children !
Sex Education Program in Our Public Schools : What Is Behind It ?
Perhaps you are asking , " What is so wrong with the public school system ?
In a word , EVERYTHING !
Perhaps a better question is :
What is right about the public school system ?
The truth is intolerant my friend .
1 + 1 = 2 .
Now you can ignorantly claim that 1 + 1 = 3 ; but you'd be wrong ( and probably a product of the public school system ) .
Children are robbed of faith in God in public schools .
Instead , children are taught that they evolved from " stardust " which somehow formed into a planet , and then life just happened .
Children are taught that humans are animals .
If this is true , then bestiality is acceptable , right ?
This is what the evolutionists teach is it not ?
Satan 's crowd fully understand that children are a weapon in the hands of the Devil , which the Holy Bible confirms .
Psalms 127:4 , “ As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth . ”
He who controls today 's youth , sets the future .
The communist dictator Vladimir Lenin also understood this truth , who said : “ The best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals . ”
If you grasp this truth , then it becomes obvious why wicked men have usurped control of the government 's public fool system !
Satan wants to kill , steal and destroy your children , and your family !
It is not a coincidence that children 's public school curriculum is so senseless and confusing , that parents cannot even help their children do their homework .
They are intentionally dumbing - down the children !!!
A good Christian family is a bulwark for good morals , the soil for the planting of good character , the tool and means for the furthering of Biblical Christianity and confirming it upon the earth .
The family is also the foundation of the nation , as Philaret , Metropolitan of Moscow , wrote , “ In the family lie the seeds of everything that later sprouts and grows into the greater family which is called the nation . ”
Satan knows this truth better than any Christian .
Why do you think the family is under demonic attack from all sides ?
The Bible , God's Word , foretold that the time would come when people would be lovers of their own selves , woefully ignorant of the truth .
We are certainly living in such a time .
The same sun that melts the wax , hardens the clay .
I 'd like to quote some Scriptures from the Holy and Preserved Word of God ( i.e. , the King James Bible ) ...
" This know also , that in the last days perilous times shall come .
For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy , Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good , Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ; Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts , Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth . "
— 2nd Timothy 3:1 - 7 Faith MUST come before knowledge .
Character must come before knowledge .
To educate a man beyond his character is to produce an educated fool ( Romans 1:22 , " Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools " ) .
To educate a man who lacks faith in God is to produce an educated heathen .
The public school system produces educated fools .
Young children who should be taught about God are instead brainwashed with Evolution and worldly philosophies .
I call Evolution , Devilution , and for good reason ( Hitler was a big fan of Charles Darwin 's The Origin of Species ) .
Communism , Nazism , Godlessness and Evolution are all synonymous in ideologies .
Welcome to the public school detention - camp .
America 's school children long ago were taught HOW TO THINK , but for the past half century have been taught WHAT TO THINK !
“ Education is a weapon , whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed . ”
— Communist dictator , Joseph Stalin ( 1934 )
“ He alone , who owns the youth , gains the future . ” — Adolf Hitler
Oh ! , but you say , " Parents are supposed to teach their children about faith and character ; not the schools . "
That 's like saying that you should push and pull at the same time .
The arguments presented by advocates of public education are as senseless and lame as is their educational system .
No child , I do n't care how good a home they come from , is going to develop properly spending hours each day in a heathen learning environment !
You can't teach a child at home that God created mankind ; and then expect that same child to learn from a heathen teacher that mankind evolved from apes , without there being a spiritual conflict .
It is difficult for a Christian child to have to attend a Godless prisonhouse like the public school system .
Satan has a bid for your child .
Communism is of the Devil .
Communism is not an ideology ; but rather , a secret weapon of THE ILLUMINATI intended to enslaved the human race .
It was Karl Marx himself , unquestionably the father of modern Communism , who said : “ My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism . ” — Karl Marx Satan wants your child .
There is no book series and movie any more evil than THE GOLDEN COMPASS , a fantasy trilogy written by English author Philip Pullman in the late 1990s called His Dark Materials .
Philip Pullman is a sinfully proud , God-hating , militant atheist .
In a 2001 interview with the Washington Post , Mr. Pullman said : “ I ’m trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief . ”
Pullman targets children , as does wicked Hollywood .
Hollywood 's Satanic Agenda ( 1:28 hour documentary exposing the occult roots of Hollywood ) .
The wicked elite who control America want to indoctrinated and control your child .
It is indeed a satanic conspiracy .
A conspiracy is simply two or more people plotting to do evil .
Why is it so hard for people to receive the word “ conspiracy . ”
Do you really think Jane Roe solely caused the legalization of abortion in America ?
Do you really think Madalyn Murray O'Hair was solely responsible for removing prayer and the Bible from America 's schools ?
Freemasonry is connected with every form of evil imaginable .
Anything that subverts , corrupts and destroys America is perpetrated by Masons .
Please understand that 95 % of masons are a front for the inner elite who worship Lucifer .
It 's an organization within an organization , just like Mormonism .
The outer 95 % are normal everyday people ; but the innermost group are sick - minded , secret society , arrogant , Kaballah - controlled , Satan - worshipping scum .
People have no idea what 's going on in our nation .
Watch the following movie in its entirety and you 'll feel sick ...
Obama Rothschilds Choice .
Criminals have taken over our nation .
President John F. Kennedy tried to warn us about secret societies and a White House coup .
Freemasons are behind the Communist government schools .
California and other states have outlawed homeschooling , to ensure that your child is INDOCTRINATED .
And to add injury to insult , California just made a law requiring school curriculum to teach homosexual history and promote the Homosexual Agenda .
Gay History to Become a Part of California 's School Curriculum ( LGBT want to live in Sodom ) .
It was Whittaker Chambers , a former Communist and Soviet spy , who said : “ The Communist vision is the vision of man without God .
It is the vision of man 's mind displacing God as the creative intelligence of the world . ”
Dethrone God ?
Man without God ?
Can a person dethrone God ?
Absolutely not !
The very essence of Communist philosophy is the absence of God .
That 's why public school teach the lie of Evolution !
DEVILUTION

In case you did n't know , the 10th Plank of Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto
called for a " public school system . "
Public schools are government schools !
" I am unalterably opposed to the public school system "
— Pastor Jack Hyles ( 1926-2001 )
Though some advocates of the public school system would lead us to believe that there are many good schools in the system , there are none .
It all depends on how you define " good . "
Sure , I know that there are a few academically great schools in the system ; but a child requires more than mere " academics " to develop properly .
A developing child 's moral mindset will be determined by the presence ( or LACK OF ) Biblical principles being instilled in them .
Remember that the Heaven 's Gate cult was composed mostly of the collegiate type .
Education must never be exalted above faith in God , for without faith in God there is NO morality .
If there is NO God than man becomes his own god , i.e. , humanism .
Every child should be taught the Ten Commandments .
Every child should be taught faith in God .
Of course , this is ILLEGAL in public schools .
However , contrary to what many parents have been led to believe , it is NOT illegal for a child to pray or read the Bible in a public school ( although many teachers have removed such children wrongfully because teachers do n't understand the law ) .
However , it is illegal for a public school or teacher to sponsor such activities .
A child can bring a Bible into class , but the teacher cannot read that Bible to the class .
So sad !
A teacher could be fired for leading the class in prayer .
Is it any wonder why the United States today makes Sodom and Gomorrah look like a nice place to live ?
“ Parents give up their rights when they drop the children off at public school . ”

The Illusion of Separation Between God and State
We often hear about separation between religion and State ; however , there is no such thing as separation between God and State .
If you eliminate God , you have Humanism ... and humanism will eventually lead to the destruction of America .
Why should God continue to bless a nation which increasingly honors and caters to Sodomites ?
Why should God bless a nation that worships immoral celebrities and praises the ungodly ?
God will not continue to bless this wicked mess !
Why should God bless a nation of baby - killers , whoremongers and warmongers ?
Our founding fathers never intended for God to be ignored by our lawmakers , Supreme Court and political leaders .
By the deceptive creation of the 501c3 tax - exempt organization , even our churches have backed off and are eerily silent concerning blatant and massive government crimes against the American people and innocent people abroad .
If the church , i.e. , the righteous , refuse to rise up against the evildoers ( Psalm 94:16 ) , then who will ?
The wicked ?
It is a deception to think that God can be separated from government .
The degree by which God is abandoned determines the level of wickedness amongst our leaders .
Faith in God is the very foundation of freedom .
Without God there is no absolute moral standard by which to guide our lives .
Communism is rooted in atheism .
Removing
God from the public school system was the nails - in - our - coffin as a nation .
The notion that the absence of God isolates the State from religious belief and bias is untrue .
The absence of God always leads to Humanism .
To educate without God is humanism in pure form .
The the entire public school system is of the Devil !
Humanism is of the Devil .
Humanism is an insane form of human thinking that invades the human mind , convincing it of it's superiority over God and His Word .
It is humanistic reasoning that banned teacher - led prayer and Bible reading in the first place .
The public school system teaches the religion of Humanism , i.e. , man is his own god .
In sharp contrast , the Bible says we are to trust in the Lord ( Proverbs 3:5 - 6 ) .
The Bible teaches that humanity is sinful , prone to evil and self - destruction .
History itself proves this .
Look at all the hundreds - of - millions of people who have been killed over the centuries in bloody wars .
Yet , you can hear these Godless fools today still taking about how education is going to make this world a better place to live .
Garbage !
Some of the craziest sickos on this planet are rich educated people .
The solution is not reformation , nor rehabilitation , nor education ; but rather , regeneration by the Spirit of God.
Jesus said “ ye must be born - again ” ( John 3:5 ) .
Research the days of the Russian Gulags ( 1920 - 1950 ) where an estimated 60,000,000 people were killed in slave labor death camps .
Do you think it could n't happen here in America ?
It will eventually !
The Patriot Acts , Homeland Security and Operation Garden Plot were created to police U.S. citizens .
We are fast losing our First Amendment rights .
The best education is SELF EDUCATION .
Do your own homework and THINK FOR YOURSELF !
Public Schools INDOCTRINATE ;
They Don't Educate
A child by nature believes in a supreme being Who created all things ( Romans 1:21 ) .
It 's not until their faith in God is shaken by some godless teacher that they start doubting .
Where do all the atheists and heathen philosophers come from ?
They come out of heathen schools and universities !
One atheist begets another atheist .
It is evil to mislead a child to believe that Evolution is a fact .
Evolution is an unproven theory , a demonic malicious lie intended to apostatize children .
Public school children are being lied to , being taught that they evolved from stardust and slime , and that they came from a primitive blob of life which allegedly evolved from a chaotic explosion to form the universe .
How demeaning !
No wonder society is so messed up nowadays .
Without God , children have no moral compass .
To teach Evolution is to attack God 's Word and the Creator ( John 1:1 - 13 ; 2nd Peter 3:5 ) .
Any fool knows that this world did n't evolve from a piece of rock which broke off from the moon .
That 's the commonly accepted theory today !
Can the universe have boundaries ?
What is beyond the tangible universe ?
Can there be nothing ?
Even the blackness of space is something !
Can time begin or end ?
When did time begin ?
The only LOGICAL answer is God ( 2nd Peter 3:5 ) .
A proper and good education must include God .
We are all created in God 's image .
To teach children without including faith in God is to produce an educated fool .
" ... Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of THE TRUTH . " — 2nd Timothy 3:7 This Scripture speaks of the gospel of Jesus Christ .
It is tragic that prayer and the Bible were banned from public school in 1962 and 1963 , respectively .
The world is filled with highly educated fools who know not God .
They have never come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ .
They are always studying and learning ; yet they have rejected the greatest knowledge of all , the gospel .
It is foolishness to them ( 1st Corinthians 1:21 ) .
They have never been born - again ( John 3:5 ) .
Only by believing on Jesus , the Christ , the Son of God , can any sinner be forgiven ( John 20:31 ; Romans 4:5 ) .
Even the best academic schools in the world are detrimental to a child if God is not a part of the child 's education .
Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto is a living reality in the United States today .

Marx 's 10th plank of his Communist Manifesto called for a public school system .
The stated purpose of which is to enable government brainwashing and control of children and thus society .
Public school children are being fed the scam of Global Warming , the vile homosexual agenda , whacko environmentalism , spying on parents , unquestioning support of government tyranny , demonic New Age philosophies , et cetera .
Read for yourself what the sickos behind public school policy think about parents ...
" Every child in America entering school at the age of five is insane because he comes to school with certain allegiances toward our founding fathers , toward his parents , toward a belief in a supernatural being ...
It 's up to you , teachers , to make all of these sick children well by creating the international children of the future . "

The government has NO BUSINESS educating our children .
The government was originally intended to PROTECT our property , person and freedom ( now they 're confiscating our property , harming our person and robbing our freedoms ) .
Tragically , the government does n't even know what education is ...
" In 1979 , a newsletter called EDUCATION USA reported that at least one judge stated that no one knew what education was .
That rather revealing conclusion was offered by a judge in a court case involving a mother who sued the San Francisco Unified School District in 1976 because her son , who was a high school graduate , could not read or write .
She sought damages for remedial education and the wages her son would be unable to earn because of his lack of educational skills .
The judge disagreed , according to the newsletter , saying : ' Schools have no legal duty to educate .
If there is no legal duty to educate , there can be no malpractice where education fails . '
( Education USA , September 24th , 1979 , pg 29 )
The judge in the district court that heard the case reported that ' schools have no legal duty to educate , ' because the purpose of education was not known .
Not even the educators know what they are to do with the children forcibly brought to their schools .
The judge in the appeals court explained : ' The science of pedagogy [ defined as the art or science of teaching ] itself is fraught with different and conflicting theories ...'
As a result , he said , there is no way to assess the school 's negligence when they do not educate any child .
So the courts do not know what the purpose of education is . "

The public school system is evil .
Their real goal is not education , but indoctrination !
The teaching of Evolution is indoctrination .
It is a deliberate attempt to shake the faith of young people in a divine God .
Teaching young people that they are animals ( mammals ) is evil .
The Bible teaches that people are not animals , we are human beings ( 1st Corinthians 15:39 ) .
A society that abandons God and the Bible to appease a small group of God-haters and atheists is headed for imminent destruction .
This is why America is in such a mess today .
Our government leaders would n't have been able to sell us out to the Banksters , deliberately bankrupting America 's economy , if Americans had simply cared .
Americans did n't care in 1913 when the Federal Reserve criminal act was passed , and they could n't care less today .
Our pastors are ignorant , having sold out to the government , allowing their churches to be government - licensed as 501c3 organizations .
Billy Sunday saw the apostasy 100 years ago , and it 's much worse today ...
“ It would be a godsend if the Church would suffer persecution today ; she has n't suffered it for hundreds of years .
She is growing rich and lagging behind .
Going back . ” - Billy Sunday , The Need for Revivals , From " Billy Sunday : The Man and His Message " , by William T. Ellis , Philadelphia : John C. Winston Co. , 1914 Americans do n't care about the next generation .
The economic debt which we 've allowed our government to place upon us and our children 's children is tragic .
It is all fraud .
Most churches today are supportive of government tyranny and are completely silent on the issues .
This country is going into depression , while pastors are enjoying trips to the Holy land .
Wake up America !
Sin always undermines any nation .
Americans have become complacent , indifferent and irresponsible .
" Humanistic universities often shoot their satiristic barbs toward fundamental schools and say they are prisons .
Nothing is further from the truth !
The humanistic school is the prison .
Many of the students there are bound by liquor , bound by narcotics , bound by homosexuality , bound by immorality , bound by nicotine and bound by rock music .
No one loves them enough and no one is wise enough to build a wall of standards around them in order that they may be free from those things which enslave .
Freedom is not in the university which has no rules ; freedom is in a university which loves its students enough to build rules of protection around them .
Love is not breaking down the walls ; love is building the walls !
Love is not freedom to go to the captor ; love is freedom from the captor ! " — Quoted from Pastor Jack Hyles ' book , Jack Hyles Speaks On Biblical Separation , Chapter three - Liberty Through Separation .
Children need to be educated in a God- friendly environment , not the public school abyss .
Public schools will show a Harry Potter movie , but never anything about Jesus .
It is evil .
Now even homosexuality ( which the Bible calls Sodomy ) is inherent in the INDOCTRINATION curriculum .
It is not education .
Sodomy is not acceptable as a lifestyle , it is wicked sin which brought the judgment of God upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah !
Children need to be taught that God created Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve .
“ The main thing wrong with the public school system is not what they teach , it 's what they do n't teach . ”
— Pastor Jack Hyles
The Devil owns and controls the public school system ...
" The Masons / Communists / Humanists / Illuminists all want the government to train the children of the nation in government run schools .
Adam Weishaupt , the founder of the Illuminati , wrote : ' We must win the common people in every corner .
This will be obtained chiefly by means of the schools . '
( Proofs Of A Conspiracy , pg. 111 ) ' We must acquire the direction of education -- of church -- management -- of the professorial chair , and of the pulpit . '
( Proofs Of A Conspiracy , pg. 109 ) And professor John Robison wrote in his book about the Illuminati entitled PROOFS OF A CONSPIRACY that : ' They [ the Illuminati ] contrived to place their Members as tutors to the youth of distinction . '

The public school system is evil .
Evil is a plot , a conspiracy , a plan to do evil .
The public school system is a diabolical plot to brainwash children for the Devil .
The curriculum is worldly and anti-God in nature .
No matter how good the school may be academically , if the child is not being taught morals and God 's law , that child is being prepared to live a life of sin and rebellion against God .
No wonder this once great nation has plunged into the moral abyss .
Parents Are Under Attack
Families are under attack in America .
Children do n't belong in public schools .
If there 's a mark on your child , the school nurse ( known as a “ mandatory reporter ” ) will call CPS and the State confiscates your kids forever .
Even if a child gets hurt playing , a parent will likely be blamed and charged with abuse .
God forbid that you actually spank your child when they misbehave .
CPS will take your children from you .
It happens every day .
You 'll lose your kids forever .
The United Nations is planning to take control over America 's children .
Good parents lose their children every day in America , because of CPS thugs who think they are God .
Even yelling at your child is considered mental cruelty and abuse nowadays .
It 's insane !
Hell will be hot enough !

Whether you realize it or not , public school nurses regularly take children into the medical office and ask them to remove most of their clothes for abuse inspections .
A lot of public school teachers resent Christian parents .
So if you tell the teacher you do n't want your child watching a Harry Potter movie being shown in class that day , expect to be targeted by the school medical office .
Be careful when you ask your child 's teacher why your child is n't learning in class .
You 'll likely be turned into the medical office for anything and everything .
They 're a dirty bunch of cut - throats .
All of them ... the teachers ... the principles ... the State ... their lawyers ... the judges ... et cetera .
Parents have become the enemy of the State .
If you think I 'm over - exaggerating , you need to READ THIS .
I n 1946 , Dr. Chisholm presented a paper entitled The Psychiatry of Enduring Peace and Social Progress at a US conference on mental health .
Two years later , his message was published by the ( now prestigious ) magazine Psychiatry , and by his Communist friend , Alger Hiss , the publisher of the socialist magazine , International Conciliation .
Alger Hiss , the presiding Secretary General at the 1945 founding of the United Nation , wrote the Preface to Dr. Chisholm 's paper , which now bore the above title .
Ponder Dr. Chisholm 's radical views of faith and freedom .
Any decent parent would be alarmed and angered , and never enroll your child into a public school again , if you truly understood the Satanic power and ungodly agenda at work to destroy your child ...
“ To achieve world government , it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism , loyalty to family tradition , national patriotism , and religious dogmas . ”
— George Brock Chisholm , in a Speech given at the , Conference on Education , Asilomar , California , September 11 , 1954
Satan's Bid For Your Child
Tonight Bill O’Reilly addressed his recent smear of HotAir.com , claiming that Hot Air has the responsibility to police its comments .
Pronouncing that “ it ’s not enough to say , ‘ I did n’t do it , ' ” O’Reilly sanctimoniously told his viewers that he polices comments on his own web site :
Here ’s the money quote :
Miss Malkin is upset because I did n’t identify the “ Hussein ” comment was made by a civilian — not her or her staff .
And that ’s true .
I should have been more precise .
But we often cite hateful civilian comments on blogs and say they should be edited , as we do on billoreilly .com .
Oh really ?
Tonight I went ahead and paid $ 4.95 to join billoreilly.com , and lookee here at what I was asked to agree to :

Pea-sized pony
This is Satomi's pygmy seahorse ( Hippocampus satomiae ) .
It is the smallest known seahorse , with a standard length of 13.8 millimetres and an approximate height of 11.5 mm .
It was discovered near Derawan island , off the coast of Kalimantan – the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo .

Snail that ’s whorls apart
Opisthostoma vermiculum is unique , because of the way its shell twists .
Most snail shells coil tightly , following a logarithmic spiral .
They also coil around no more than three axes .
The shell of O. vermiculum , however , coils around four axes – the most for any known gastropod .
The whorls , meanwhile , detach three times and reattach themselves , twice , to preceding whorls .
O. vermiculum appears to be restricted to a single region of limestone karst geography : Gunung Rapat , in Perak , Malaysia .

Self - destructive palm
Tahina spectabilis is the palm that flowers itself to death .
Commonly known as the Tahina palm , the gigantic plant produces a huge mass of flowers .
Most palms flower throughout their lives , but the Tahina Palm does so only once – at the end of its life .
After fruiting , the palm dies and collapses .
The new genus is unrelated to any other of the 170 - plus palms of Madagascar and is only known to grow in the northwestern Analalava district .
Fewer than 100 individuals have been identified .

Abyssal blue
This is the deep blue chromis ( Chromis abyssus ) .
The publication in which this species , and four others , were described heralded a new era in taxonomy : it was the first act registered in the taxonomic database ZooBank .
The discovery of the new species off the coast of Ngemelis island , Palau , also highlights how little we know of deep - reef biodiversity .

Fantastic phasmatid
Phobaeticus chani , part of the Phasmatidae family , is the world 's longest insect .
The stick insect 's body alone is 35.6 centimetres long , and with its legs and antennae it reaches a overall length of 56.7 cm .
It is found in the Ulu Moyog area of Borneo , Malaysia .

Devonian delivery
The mother fish , Materpiscis attenboroughi , is the oldest known vertebrate to give birth to live young .
The fossilised specimen is an extremely rare find , showing a mother fish giving birth approximately 380 million years ago .
This date places it in the early Frasnian subdivision of the Devonian period .
The fossil was found near Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia .

No jump in these beans
Charrier coffee , Coffea charrieriana , is a new caffeine - free coffee from Cameroon .
It is the first known caffeine - free species from Central Africa , though others have been found elsewhere .
Cameroon is a centre of diversity for the Coffea genus , and wild species like C. charrierianaare potentially important in breeding programmes .
In this case , the new species could be used for breeding naturally decaffeinated beans .

The battle over intellectual property rights is likely to be one of the most important of this century .
It has enormous economic , social and political implications in a wide range of areas , from medicine to the arts and culture – anything where the public interest in the widespread dissemination of knowledge runs up against those whose income derives from monopolising it .
Now it appears that international efforts to slow the pace of worldwide climate disruption could also run up against powerful interests who advocate a fundamentalist conception of intellectual property
According to Inside US
Trade , the US chamber of commerce is gearing up for a fight to limit the access of developing countries to environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) .
They fear that international climate change negotiations , taking place under the auspices of the United Nations , will erode the position of corporations holding patents on existing and future technologies .
Developing countries such as Brazil , India and China have indicated that if – as expected in the next few years – they are going to have to make sacrifices to reduce carbon emissions , they should be able to license some of the most efficient available technologies for doing so .
Big business is worried about this , because they prefer that patent rights have absolute supremacy .
They want to make sure that climate change talks do n't erode the power that they have gained through the World Trade Organisation .
The WTO is widely misunderstood and misrepresented as an organisation designed to promote free trade .
In fact , some of its most economically important rules promote the opposite : the costliest forms of protectionism in the world .
The WTO 's rules on intellectual property ( Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property , or Trips ) are the most glaring example .
These are designed to extend and enforce US - style patent and copyright law throughout the world .
Patents are monopolies , a restriction on trade that creates inefficiency in exactly the same way that tariffs , quotas or other trade barriers do .
The economic argument for relaxing patent rules is therefore the same as that for removing trade barriers , only times 50 or 100 or even 1,000 – since the average tariff on manufactured or agricultural goods is quite small compared to the amount by which patent monopolies raise the price of a pharmaceutical drug .
These restrictions cost US consumers an estimated $ 220 bn a year compared to competitive pricing – many times the gains from trade liberalisation that we could even hope to get from a successful completion of the current Doha round of negotiations in the WTO that began in 2001 in Qatar .
It took years of struggle by non-governmental organisations to loosen the big pharmaceutical companies ' stranglehold on the WTO , to the point where the organisation 's 2001 Declaration on Trips and Public Health reaffirmed the rights of member countries to produce generic versions of patented drugs in order to promote public health .
But this was just a first step , and seven years later these rights have been applied almost exclusively to anti-retroviral drugs for the treatment of Aids , in just a handful of developing countries .
The power of the pharmaceutical companies , with their governments in the United States and Europe as advocates , still keeps life - saving medicines priced out of reach for hundreds of millions of the world 's poor .
The legal procedure that has been used – although very infrequently – to allow for the production of generic drugs for the treatment of Aids is called a compulsory license .
This means that a government can legally authorise the production of a generic version of a drug that is currently under patent , provided that this is done for public health purposes .
A royalty is paid to the patent holder , but this is generally not very expensive .
Developing countries such as Brazil , India and China want to make sure that such possibilities are open for new environmentally sound technologies , eg in the areas of renewable energy , that might enable them to meet future targets for reducing carbon emissions .
A Brazilian official noted that his country had only issued one compulsory license , for the anti-Aids drug Efavirenz , produced by Merck .
But big business does n't want to take any chances .
Today they are launching a new coalition called the Innovation , Development and Employment Alliance ( Idea ) .
( You 've got to love the Orwellian touch of those marketing consultants ) .
Members include General Electric , Microsoft and Sunrise Solar .
They will reportedly also be concerned with intellectual property claims in the areas of healthcare and renewable energy .
For the intellectual property fundamentalists , the income claims of patent holders are property rights , seen as analogous to a homeowner 's right to her house .
But the framers of the US constitution ( article I , section 8 ) did n't it see that way , and neither , for the most part , have US courts .
Our legal system has long taken into account that protection for patent and copyright monopolies must reflect an important tradeoff between rewarding innovation and creativity , on the one hand , and allowing for the dissemination of knowledge and the development of new technologies .
The WTO rules , driven by the protectionist interests of powerful corporations , have gone far to advance the fundamentalist view of intellectual property , at the expense of the world 's economy and public health .
Now our corporations fear that negotiators at the United Nations , under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , might not share these fundamentalist views , especially when the future of the planet is at stake .
Ten years ago environmentalists played a major role in exposing the built - in prejudice of WTO rules , which tend to strengthen commercial interests against environmental regulation .
A tipping point was reached when they helped organise large - scale protests that shut down the WTO negotiations in Seattle in 1999 , raising alarm bells and building opposition worldwide .
Environmental awareness and a sense of urgency with regard to climate change are much more broadly shared today .
The Obama administration should take note of this and place itself squarely on the side of promoting the spread of environmentally sound technologies .
I ’m a little bummed we did n’t get to include Diddy Kong wearing a Nintendo hat , as it probably would have made an ironic ending panel .
To make up for it though , you can take a look at the vector art for Samus , Link , and Luigi , as well as a sketch I did to prepare .
Which is actually pretty rare …
I ’d also like to thank all of you readers for making 2P START !
such a long and enjoyable journey thus far .
It ’s been lots of fun , and I hope you are enjoying it as well .
If you have never checked out our podcast before , I encourage you to take a listen .
We actually strive to keep it a worthwhile piece of edited audio .
I was excited about this comic for a couple reasons : first , Ray got Link ’s panel done a day early and it looked GOOOOD , it built up the anticipation for me !
Second , those complaining about last week ’s lack of ‘ quality artwork ’ would hopefully be more than satisfied with this one !
Regarding the topic at hand , one of my favorite TV shows , Burn Notice , recently sold itself out to a beer company and now episodes include closeups of the beer label and lines of dialogue about how few calories are in this particular beer .
I fear that as the gaming industry ‘ matures ’ we ’ll see more and more of this ( as if we do n’t see enough already ) .
Please Nintendo , never sink to this level !
Crimes against the rich vs. crimes against the rest of us
“ You simply cannot hang a millionaire
in America . ”
- William Bourke Cockran
“ The law , in its majestic equality , forbids the rich
as well as the poor to sleep under bridges , to beg
in the streets , and to steal bread . ”
- Anatole France
Contrary to the myth that Western capitalist society obeys the rule of law , it has long been understood that the wealthy live under a different set of laws than the rest of us .
The crimes against property and against the wealthy are not weighted on the same scale as crimes against the weak and the destitute .
The average OSHA penalty for a wilful violation of the workplace safety laws causing death is $ 27,000 ( USD ) .
On the other hand …
The average penalty for uttering profanity ( which would naturally cut into advertising revenue ) on radio or television in the United States is $ 500,000 . ‡
The penalty for downloading 24 songs online ( and thus depriving capitalists of that potential revenue ) is $ 1,920,000 ( source , source ) .
On the other hand …
Child abduction will cost you only $ 25,000 .
Committing burglary against your non-wealthy neighbour is worth only a $ 375,000 .
Arson is worth roughly the same as burglary .
Stalking is worth a pittance of just $ 175,000 . ( source )
Vandalizing a something that is n’t even a primary dwelling or domus nets you $ 260,000 in France .
On the other hand … in British Columbia , Canada , the police ( RCMP ) can actually vandalize the primary residence of homeless people with impunity .
( source )
A while back , TVO had a great speech by Darryl Davies which dealt precisely with the crippling inequality in the way we approach what is “ criminal ” and what is not .
For your viewing pleasure , I have included this lecture below .
We must start thinking of our modern capitalist society as not that far removed from feudalism in terms of the legal basis reinforcing the privilege of the wealthy .
I think this lecture goes a long way toward accomplishing precisely this .

First , let me say that of course I realize that a union - affiliated organization would be anxious to criticizes the notoriously anti-union Whole Foods corporation .
However , this letter is not appealing for unionization .
Rather , it is appealing as an enormously powerful long - term investor in Whole Foods stock .
In fact , the word " union " is only used in describing CtW Investment Group .
Here are some quotes from the letter ( all emphases are mine ) :
( the original can be seen here )
Events of the past week establish yet again that John Mackey ’s lack of personal discipline makes him a liability for Whole Foods Market , Inc. Despite past indications that the board needed to exercise independent oversight of Mr. Mackey and supervise his external communications closely – most notably his postings on the Yahoo !
Finance bulletin board , which led to an SEC inquiry – you and your fellow directors failed to take meaningful action to prevent Mr. Mackey ’s uncompensated brand and reputational risk to our Company .
We therefore call on the board to immediately undertake the following : * Immediately remove Mr. Mackey as Chairman of the Board .
Whole Foods ... has benefitted from growing environmental and health consciousness among affluent urban consumers .
However , this leading position makes Whole Foods uniquely vulnerable to disaffection from these core customers if they perceive that the company is not managed in a manner consistent with their values .
While we respect Mr. Mackey ’s First Amendment right to express his political views , as he did for instance in noting that the Constitution contains no " right " to health care , we hasten to point out that neither the First Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution give Mr. Mackey or any other CEO the right to retain their position regardless of behavior or performance .
Moreover , Mr. Mackey ’s article was not a citizen ’s " letter to the editor , " but a lengthy op - ed that explicitly tied him to Whole Foods by identifying him as the CEO .
Given Whole Foods ’ unique exposure to a key segment of the customer base , Mr. Mackey ’s decision to express his views in such a public way , and on an issue of such enormous moment , seems ill - advised at best .
What do CEOs do ?
A CEO Job Description
The Chief Executive Officer is one of the most coveted titles , and least understood jobs in a company .
Everyone believes that CEOs can do whatever they want , are all powerful , and are magically competent .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
By its very nature , the job description of a CEO means meeting the needs of employees , customers , investors , communities , and the law .
Some of a CEO ’s job can be delegated .
But several elements of the job must be done by the CEO .
Read on for the details of what makes a CEO .
What is intrinsic to the CEO ’s job ?
This is n’t a traditional job description ; it ’s an examination of the actual roles that a CEO plays ( legally or de facto ) within a company .
A CEO ’s job description includes a few important areas .
Any individual CEO may take on any tasks that they wish , but these are the things that ca n’t be delegated :
While a CEO may get input for some of those duties , it is the CEO ’s — and only the CEO ’s — responsibility to perform those well .
Being the CEO , they can spend the rest of their time doing whatever they decide they want to spend their time on .
But ultimately , everything else about a given CEO ’s job is optional .
Success as a CEO requires more than just knowing the CEO ’s job description .
A CEO needs to know how to measure their success as a CEO , avoid the pitfalls that are unique to the CEO ’s job , and conduct themselves to stay sane and skillful over time .
A CEO Job Description , Part 1
Admit it .
We all feel a touch of awe when someone has it : the CEO title .
The power , the salary , and the chance to Be The Boss .
It ’s worthy of awe !
Too bad so few CEOs are good at what they do .
In fact , only 1 in 20 are in the top 5 % [ 1 ] .
Many do n’t know what their job should be , and few of those can pull it off well .
The job is simple — very simple .
But it ’s not easy at all .
What is a CEO ’s job ?
More than with any other job , the responsibilities of a CEO diverge from the duties and the measurement .
A CEO ’s responsibilities : everything , especially in a startup .
The CEO is responsible for the success or failure of the company .
Operations , marketing , strategy , financing , creation of company culture , human resources , hiring , firing , compliance with safety regulations , sales , PR , etc . — it all falls on the CEO ’s shoulders .
Being responsible means that the CEO is the one held accountable for the success of the company ’s efforts , across the board .
But of course , the CEO does n’t actually do all that work .
The CEO ’s duties are what she actually does , the responsibilities she does n’t delegate .
Some things ca n’t be delegated .
Creating culture , modeling values , building the senior management team , financing road shows , ultimate approval of how money gets spent , and , indeed , the delegation itself can be done only by the CEO .
Many start - up CEOs think fund - raising is their most important duty .
I disagree .
Fund - raising is necessary , but the CEOs contribution is in building a superb business with the money raised .
Setting strategy and direction
What is the CEO ’s main duty ?
Setting strategy and vision .
The senior management team can help develop strategy .
Investors can approve a business plan .
The Board can approve , advise , or ask the CEO to revise a business strategy .
But at the end of the day , it ’s the CEO who ultimately sets the direction :
Which markets will the company enter ?
Against which competitors ?
What will the company ’s product lines be ?
How will the company differentiate itself ?
Will it be low cost ?
High service ?
Convenient Locations ?
Flexible financing ?
High - touch ?
Mass produced ?
The CEO decides , sets budgets , forms partnerships , sells off incompatible product lines , makes acquisitions , and hires a team to steer the company accordingly .
Modeling and setting the company ’s culture , values , and behavior
The CEO ’s second duty is building culture .
Work gets done through people , and people are profoundly affected by culture .
A lousy place to work can drive away high performers .
After all , they have their pick of places to work .
And a great place to work can attract and retain the very best .
Culture is built in dozens of ways , and the CEO sets the tone .
Her every action — or inaction — sends cultural messages ( see “ Life Under a Magnifying Glass ” ) .
Clothes send signals about how formal the workplace is .
Who she talks to signals who is and is n’t important .
How she treats mistakes ( feedback or failure ? ) sends signals about risk - taking .
Who she fires , what she puts up with , and what she rewards shape the culture powerfully .
This can not be emphasized enough !
People imitate a CEO ’s behavior when deciding how to act .
The book Pre-suasion by Robert Cialdini , documents at length the ways in which , for example , a dishonest CEO makes employees feel as if they can cut corners , steal from the company , and generally behave according to those same standards .
A project team worked weekends launching a multimedia web site on a tight deadline .
Their CEO was on holiday when the site launched .
She did n’t call to congratulate the team .
To her , it was a matter of keeping her personal life sacred .
To the team , it was a message that her personal life was more important than the weekends and evenings they had put in to meet the deadline .
Next time , they may not work quite so hard .
The emotion and effect on the culture was real , even if it was n’t what the CEO intended .
Congratulations from the CEO on a job well done can motivate a team like nothing else .
Silence can demotivate just as quickly .
If vision is where the company is going , values tell how the company gets there .
Values outline acceptable behavior .
The CEO conveys values through actions and reactions to others .
Slipping a ship schedule to meet quality levels sends a message of valuing quality .
Not over - celebrating a team ’s heroic recovery when they could have avoided a problem altogether sends a message about prevention versus damage control .
People take their cues about interpersonal values — trust , honesty , openness — from CEO ’s actions as well .
Building and leading the senior executive team
Team - building is the CEO ’s # 3 duty .
The CEO hires , fires , and leads the senior management team .
They , in turn , hire , fire , and lead the rest of the organization .
The CEO must be able to hire and fire non-performers .
She must resolve differences between senior team members , and keep them working together in a common direction .
She sets direction by communicating the strategy and vision of where the company is going .
Strategy sets the direction for the senior team , who in turn set it for the rest of the company .
With clear direction that everyone understands , the team can rally together and make it happen .
Do n’t underestimate the power of setting direction .
In 1991 , at Intuit ’s new employee orientation , CEO Scott Cook presented his vision of Intuit as the center of computerized personal finance .
Intuit had just 120 employees and one product .
Ten years later , it ’s a billion - dollar company with thousands of employees and dozens of products .
Worldwide , it is the winner in personal finance , bar none .
The success is due in no small part to every Intuit employee knowing and sharing the company ’s vision and strategy .
Allocating capital to the company ’s priorities
Capital allocation is the CEO ’s # 4 duty .
The CEO sets budgets within the firm .
She funds projects which support the strategy , and ramps down projects which lose money or do n’t support the strategy .
She considers carefully the company ’s major expenditures , and manages the firm ’s capital .
If the company ca n’t use each dollar raised from investors to produce at least $ 1 of shareholder value , she decides when to return money to the investors .
Some CEOs do n’t consider themselves financial people , but at the end of the day , it is their decisions that determine the company ’s financial fate .
Footnotes for Part 1
Measuring Success as a CEO .
[ 1 ]
Pay no attention to the math background peeking from behind the curtain … back
Knowing the job description is a good first step for a CEO , but to know how she ’s doing , she needs to design her own measurement system .
Unlike inconvenient lower - level jobs , no one tells the Chief Executive how she ’s doing .
Do managers let her know she ’s undermining their authority , making poor decisions , or communicating poorly ?
Not likely .
Even when a CEO asks for honest feedback , the fear is there : non-flattering feedback may stall a promising career [ 1 ] .
Even when a company uses 360 - degree feedback , no one penalizes the CEO if she does n’t act on the feedback .
The Board of Directors supposedly oversees the CEO , but they are far removed from day - to - day actions .
Over time , they can evaluate performance , but they look mainly at share price and company strategy .
They are rarely interested in — ( or qualified to comment on ! ) — the CEO ’s daily behavior .
But the CEO ’s daily behavior will make or break the company !
The CEO ’s duties do n’t change because they are unmeasured .
Indeed , lax measurement makes it easy for the CEO to feel confident , even when she should n’t .
Good feedback is the only way to know what ’s working , but share price simply does n’t do it .
External measures measure the company , not the link between the CEO ’s actions .
A low share price tells her something ’s wrong , but it does n’t help her figure out what .
By measuring her performance based on her duties , a CEO can learn to do her job better .
As explained in part 1 , the CEO ’s job is setting strategy and vision , building culture , leading the senior team , and allocating capital .
The last of these is easy to measure .
The first three are more of a challenge .
How does a CEO know she ’s doing the vision thing ?
It ’s hard .
Having vision is n’t enough — that just takes a handful of mushrooms and a vision quest .
Communicating the vision is the key .
When people “ get it , ” they know how their daily job supports the vision .
If they ca n’t link their job to the vision , that tells a CEO that her communication is faulty , or she has n’t helped her managers turn the vision into actual tasks .
Either way , a CEO can monitor her success as a visionary by questioning and listening for employees to link their jobs with the company vision .
Culture building is subtle , the culture a CEO sees may be very different from the culture of the rank - and - file .
One company had a facilities policy that all equipment within 450 feet of the senior management offices was kept in top working order .
Senior managers saw a smoothly running company , while everyone else saw neglect and carelessness .
Surveys about openness , values , and morale can be used to develop a measure of culture .
The questions to ask are n’t rocket science .
The book First , Break all the Rules gives a great questionnaire for measuring overall culture .
Also , check turnover .
When 95 % of your workforce says they can’t wait to get to work , something is going right .
If people rarely leave , and if it ’s easy to attract top talent at below - market prices , you can be sure the culture plays a large role .
If people leave ( especially your top performers ) , again — look to culture .
And do n’t underestimate the power of walking around and counting smiles .
If people are having fun , it will show .
The CEO ’s success at team - building can often be measured through the team .
Teams usually know when they ’re effective .
They can also rate their team using assessments that measure specific behaviors .
For example , “ I can trust my teammates . ”
“ My teammates deliver their part of the project on time . ”
“ Every member knows what is expected of them . ”
Regular team self - assessments can help the CEO track the team ’s progress and hone her abilities to keep the team running smoothly [ 2 ] .
Easiest to measure is a CEO ’s capital allocation skill .
In fact , financial measures are the ones made public : earnings and share price .
But how can a CEO link those to her actual decisions ?
Working with her CFO , a CEO can devise financial measures appropriate to her business .
Sometimes traditional measures are most appropriate , such as economic value added or return on assets ( for a capital - intensive company ) .
Other times , the CEO may want to invent business - specific measures , such as return on training dollars , for a company which values state - of - the - art training for employees .
By monitoring several such measures , a CEO learns to link her budget decisions with company outcomes .
Ultimately , the CEO ’s should be creating more than a dollar of value for every dollar invested in the company .
Otherwise , her best bet is to return cash to the shareholders for them to invest in more productive vehicles .
In startups , earnings begin low to nonexistent , and share price is more about salesmanship and vision than earnings .
So the CEO gets almost no useful feedback about her capital allocation wisdom .
She does n’t know whether a dollar spent on a slightly nicer - than - necessary copy machine is wasted or is a wise investment in a long - term .
Careful attention to the design and tracking of financial measures can help her prepare for the transition to an earnings - driven company .
In his 1988 Annual Report , Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett included an excellent essay on CEO accountability .

Footnotes for Part 2
Pitfalls and Solutions for the CEO
[ 1 ] The CEOs do n’t help the problem .
Many of my CEO clients highlight the value of honest feedback from their coach .
Yet they complain about employees who disagree with them , just do n’t “ get it ” or do n’t have enough information “ to understand the real issues . ”
In a coaching call , they can hear feedback and consider it .
At work , they treat disagreement as dissension , and then wonder why everyone ’s a “ Yes man . ” back [ 2 ]
There are dozens of team effectiveness surveys .
You can start by checking out http://www.cambriaconsulting.com, http://www.ccl.org, and http://www.pfeiffer.com.
A CEO can tank a company by not understanding their duties , or failing to set up good measurement systems .
But it ’s also true that the job itself can screw up the person , as well .
It ’s said that power corrupts , and few positions are more powerful than CEO .
While the USA may be a democracy , our companies are legal dictatorships with the CEO calling the shots ( 1 ) .
While she may be having a great time playing Boss , the position may be taking a very human toll .
It ’s all too easy for the CEO to become a … ; jerk ( 2 ) … ; without realizing it .
They can forget — if they ever knew — what it was like to have a boss .
They are free to ignore feedback that they do n’t want to hear , and no one will call them to task for it .
They can bypass the chain of command when they want to meddle .
They can give themselves raises and genuinely believe they deserve it .
And most dreadfully , they can forget what it is like to be “ one of the little people ” :
worker I have to leave early today .
CEO
Why ?
worker
To pick up my kids from daycare .
CEO Oh… ( looks genuinely perplexed )
Why do n’t you have your nanny do that ?
worker I do n’t have a nanny .
CEO Oh… ; wanders away with a mildly confused expression
The worker was an incredibly productive person .
She worked harder than the CEO , got more done , yet could n’t have afforded a nanny if her life depended on it .
The CEO did n’t intend to be a jerk , but his lack of empathy did n’t win many supporters .
A CEO can become arrogant by externalizing blame
Having no day - to - day accountability for her actions can also turn a CEO sour .
When things go wrong , she can blame everyone around her without facing her own shortcomings .
“ My employees just do n’t get it , ” proclaims the CEO , never thinking for a moment that she is the one who hired them .
Did she hire incompetents ?
Or has she failed to communicate goals consistently and clearly ?
“ Market conditions have changed . ” she declares .
A nice excuse , but is n’t it the CEO ’s job to anticipate the market and position the company for success under a variety of scenarios ?
Without someone to keep her honest , she can gradually absolve herself of all responsibility .
Believing in a title can lead to overconfidence
Arrogance also threatens a CEO .
“ Because I am CEO , I must know the business better than anyone else . ”
It has been said , but it just is n’t true .
No CEO can be an expert in all functional areas .
A CEO who is doing her job is spending time with the big picture .
If she knows the details better than her employees , she ’s either hiring the wrong people or spending her time at the wrong levels of the organization .
It ’s appropriate for a CEO to manage operations if absolutely necessary , but she should quickly hire good operational managers and return to leading the whole business .
If she also comes to believe that the CEO title grants infallibility , watch out .
Even the Pope is only infallible a couple of times each century .
But CEOs can reinforce their delusions of grandeur by giving themselves higher salaries ( surely she deserves it !
After all , salary benchmarks show how underpaid she is ) and more perks .
Then when layoffs come , the CEO wants applause for having the moral strength to make “ hard choices , ” quietly overlooking how her own poor decision making led to the need for layoffs .
CEOs can stop learning well
Of course , once infallible , there ’s no more to learn , and a CEO may quietly stop learning .
Without daily oversight and high quality feedback on how she does her job , she can mistakenly believe her actions lead to success .
In reality , she may be doing the wrong thing , but her staff may be working around the clock to cover for her .
Furthermore , sins of omission are n’t penalized .
A CEO who does an adequate job , but far less than she could / should have done — goes unnoticed .
In hindsight , XYZ Software ( 3 ) could have had a $ 1 billion market niche , and gone public with a valuation of tens of billions .
Instead , it stuck to one product , had little understanding of its markets , and ignored competition .
Yet it still went public in a $ 300 - million IPO .
Was management penalized for a lack of vision and market responsiveness ?
Hardly !
The top managers walked off with $ 60 million apiece , reinforcing the notion that they had done a great job .
Yet with a slightly grander vision , the company might have been 10 or 100 times its size .
Setting vision is the CEO ’s job , but nothing tells her if her sights are too low .
She is n’t penalized for missing the grander vision .
Such sins of omissions are a CEO ’s worst enemy .
She can be lulled into mediocrity by not knowing what would have been possible .
The four - minute mile was considered impossible … until Roger Bannister ran it .
Now , it ’s commonplace .
Likewise , a CEO may limit herself by not realizing she can do her job better .
Though salary benchmarks are common , performance benchmarks are surprisingly rare .
Quality learning demands a CEO benchmark herself against other superb CEO’s .
Her central learning question is not “ are you doing a good job ? ” but “ are other CEOs doing a better job and if so , how can you learn to measure up ? ( 4 ) “

(1) Ok , ok .
Technically the Board of Directors has hire / fire authority over the CEO , but the Board ca n’t control day - to - day operations .
And while there are certainly boards that replace inept CEOs , it takes sustained incompetence over a long time to move a board to action .
So for practical purposes , the buck stops with the CEO .

Coaching tips to stay sane and skillful at the top of the heap .
These coaching assignments will help an executive avoid some of the pitfalls of the CEO job .
They are simple , easy , and wo n’t take much time .
They ’ll help a CEO stay connected with workers , keep herself humble , and increase her learning while becoming more successful .
The suggestions strive to be quick and easy to do , while still producing real results .
Make Space to Practice These Assignments
Set aside 5 to 10 minutes , daily , to developing as a leader and human being .
This will be the time you think about the below topics and set your mind for the day .
Schedule the time if necessary .
Just make sure that you do what ’s right for your growth .
Pace yourself .
Life is long .
Adopt these suggestions one or two at a time , and practice until you make them your own .
Then move on .
Forcing wo n’t help ; this is about developing at your own natural rhythm .
Do one assignment for a few weeks , then move on to another .
Keep the ones that work for you and drop those that do n’t .
Staying connected with “ the little people ”
Cultivate an attitude of respect — your respect for them .
The “ little people ” are the ones turning your vision into reality .
Meditate on this for a few minutes and ask yourself whether you can their jobs as well as they can .
If you can , then you ’re not hiring the right people — go change that !
Otherwise , once a day , go talk to one of your low - level employees — someone more capable than you in their area of expertise — and learn from them .
Choose a different person each day .
Get as close to the front line workers as possible .
Listen with an open mind and learn .
Learn about their job .
Ask what works for them and what does n’t .
Above all , listen to their comments without judgment .
Your goal is to connect with their experience of the world , not impose your own .
Learn about their life .
Find out what motivates them .
Why did they come work for you instead of somewhere else ?
Simply by spending a few minutes understanding their life , you can greatly increase your appreciation of how they ’re different ( and similar ! ) .
Share your vision and job with them , from a position of service .
Pretend that your job is to make this person a success .
Ask them how their job fits into the work the company does .
If they do n’t know , take on the responsibility of helping them understand how their job links to the vision .
Clarify any confusion they may have about where the company is going .
And ask them what you can do to help them succeed at doing their best .
Then do it .
Staying humble
Acknowledge , often !
Without your employees , your dreams and plans would n’t amount to much .
Take every available opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of those around you and give them credit , especially in public .
Feedback is rare in most companies , and positive feedback is rarest of all ( 1 ) .
“ Get ” that it ’s all your responsibility .
When things do n’t go the way you want , take responsibility — whether or not it ’s your fault .
The mindset of responsibility will put you in a much more powerful place than the mindset of blame .
Regularly review circumstances asking , “ What could I do differently ( or stop doing ) to make a positive difference ? ”
Identify the action and then take it .
You ’ll be surprised how much more power you have over externalities , operating from responsibility rather than blame .
Gather honest advisors to hold you accountable for your behavior .
Sometimes a Board of Directors will give honest feedback , but they are removed from your day - to - day behavior .
Actively solicit feedback from third parties : friends , peers , associates .
Share your issues and how you ’re handling them , and ask for an honest assessment .
Everyone in a company is accountable to someone for their behavior , except the CEO .
Make yourself accountable as best you can .
Identify your limits .
Ask , “ can someone else in the world do my job better than I am currently doing it ? ”
If the answer is Yes , seek out that person and ask for their guidance in getting better .
If the answer is No , validate that answer by asking your advisors , competitors , suppliers , customers , and employees .
Many companies have crashed and burn because they believe they were the best , for no good reason but pride and ego .
Create measurable performance criteria for your executive team , including yourself .
Make sure people within the organization know your goals , and know what you can be counted on to do .
Hold yourselves accountable .
If you do n’t meet your goals , withhold your bonus , take no raise , and treat yourself exactly as you would treat an employee who missed their targets .
It sends a powerful message to the company that you ’re serious about performance .
Ask your direct reports , your Board of Directors , and anyone else you work with for feedback a couple of times a year .
You can use a 360 - degree feedback process or simply ask in an e-mail .
It ’s a lot easier to hear feedback on your performance if you ’ve explicitly asked for it .
Videotape yourself receiving bad news .
Watch the videotape and decide whether or not you would want to work for that person .
If the answer is No , learn to chill when you hear bad news .
Learning well
Study excellent CEOs .
Call a CEO you admire and invite them to lunch .
Exchange tips and adopt tactics that others have found useful .
Read books like First , Break
All the Rules , which are broad - based studies of habits of top- performers .
Adopt at least one new habit a month .
Create systems for gathering feedback .
Interview customers , competitors , analysts , and others in your industry to know how your company and products are perceived .
Make sure you ’re gathering feedback that will disconfirm your beliefs about the world , as much as confirms it .
For example , if you think you ’re # 1 in your market , do n’t just ask customers why they like your products .
Ask what other products they use , and how your products fall short .
Spend time learning about the fundamentals of a CEO ’s job :
Setting strategy .
The strategy and vision for the company determine where everyone will focus their efforts .
Find a vision and strategy and use it to align your entire company .
Creating the corporate culture .
Your culture will determine what people do and do n’t try , who will stay , who will leave , and how business will get done .
Culture starts with you .
Decide how you want people to act and start modeling the behavior publicly .
Capital allocation .
Every dollar you raise and spend should produce more than $ 1 of return for the company , or it ’s a waste of money .
Learn how to make these judgements .
Hiring and Firing .
The job of executives is primarily team and culture building .
Hiring and firing are must - have skills .
Read , take classes , and review past hiring successes and mistakes .
Do whatever you can to hone your abilities .
Raise the Bar
Hold yourself to higher standards next year than you did this year .
Challenge yourself to learn to get more done with fewer hours and fewer resources while creating a more balanced life for yourself .
These are just a few of the things you can do to increase your chances for success as a senior executive .
I also believe in working with a coach to identify and overcome ( or compensate for ) blocks in your performance .
Success can be had with many different skill sets .
The more you learn about yourself and your capabilities , the better you will be able to shape a job that works for you .
The more you learn about the capabilities of those around you , the better you will be able to build teams that produce spectacular results .
Do Great Things !
Footnotes for Part 4
(1) Social psychology has shown that rewarding desired behavior is far more effective than punishing bad behavior or non-performance .
For reasons that are n’t entirely clear , our culture has evolved around using punishment as the main way of controlling behavior .
Unfortunately , punishment does n’t work very well .
Interestingly , animal trainers have known this for years .

Mr Olmert quit as prime minister in September 2008
The former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been indicted in three corruption cases , the attorney general 's office says .
Mr Olmert has been embroiled in a number of corruption scandals but denies any wrongdoing in all the cases .
The former head of the Kadima party was replaced as prime minister by Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu following general elections in February .
The series of probes was a key factor in Mr Olmert 's resignation last year .
The charges relate to the periods when Mr Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem and a cabinet minister , but before he became prime minister in 2006 .
On Sunday he issued a statement through a spokesman that said : " Olmert is convinced that in the court he will be able to prove his innocence once and for all . "
Talansky case
The office of Attorney General Menahem Mazuz confirmed in a statement he had decided to press charges and that the charge sheet had been presented on Sunday in Jerusalem district court .
ANALYSIS Tim Franks , BBC News , Jerusalem
Ehud Olmert became prime minister in 2006 .
That year , he took Israel to war against the Islamist Hezbollah movement in Lebanon - and largely as a result of the way in which that war was waged , his popularity in Israel nosedived .
He won back some support in the wake of the three - week war in Gaza this year .
He also spent a good deal of his time in office in negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , at the end of which there was no visible progress .
Israelis are split over what this episode tells them about their politicians .
Many believe that the political class is the lousiest in Israel 's short history .
But some insist the very fact a prime minister can be pushed to resign over allegations of corruption shows a robust democracy .
The 61 - page charge sheet lays out accusations of " fraud , breach of trust , registering false corporate documents and concealing fraudulent earnings " .
Mr Olmert is the first former prime minister in Israeli history to face criminal charges , the office said .
Mr Olmert 's personal secretary , Shula Zaken , has also been charged with corruption .
One of the charges against Mr Olmert is that he accepted cash envelopes from US businessman Morris Talansky with sums amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Mr Olmert admits taking money , but insists the funds were legal donations to help his campaigns for re-election as mayor of Jerusalem and for the leadership of the Likud , his former party .
In the second case , Mr Olmert is accused of duplicating funding for his trips abroad .
Police have said they suspect the " considerable sums " that remained after the travel expenses were paid for were transferred by Mr Olmert to a special account his travel agency administered for him .
EHUD OLMERT'S POLITICAL LIFE 1993 : Begins 10 - year stint as mayor of Jerusalem 2005 : Leaves right - wing Likud party with former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to form Kadima 2006 : Takes over as leader when Ariel Sharon suffers a stroke 2007 : Helps re-launch Israeli - Palestinian peace talks after seven - year hiatus 2008 : Announces plans to resign March 2009 : Replaced as PM by Benjamin Netanyahu
Profile : Ehud Olmert
The third case involves alleged conflict of interest .
Officials have alleged Mr Olmert arranged investment opportunities for a friend , Uri Messner , while he was industry minister .
This summer , the attorney - general closed a number of other corruption cases against Mr Olmert , citing lack of evidence .
Israel 's justice ministry has refused to confirm the length of sentence Mr Olmert could face if found guilty .
However , the BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says two former cabinet ministers were recently sentenced to several years in jail for bribery and embezzlement , so Mr Olmert could face years in prison if convicted .
Mr Olmert became prime minister in May 2006 after serving for several months as acting PM when Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke and entered a coma .

A cackle and a giggle can mean different things .
Scientists say there are two types of laughter : the kind that comes from pure glee , and the kind that 's meant to send a social message .
New research suggests autistic children do n't often express the latter type , a finding that could reveal more about the nature of human laughter .
From the beginning
Laughter probably predates human speech by millions of years , scientists think .
It likely evolved as an early form of communication to help people negotiate group dynamics and establish hierarchy , said William Hudenko , a psychologist at Ithaca College who led the new study .
Babies usually learn to laugh before they learn to speak .
" We think it 's so hardwired that even infants start to use laughter in order to promote affiliation and bonding with caregivers , " Hudenko told LiveScience .
People are about 30 times more likely to laugh in the presence of others than alone , reinforcing the idea that laughter is a social phenomenon .
And though we associate laughter with humor , a large proportion of laughs are n't in response to anything remotely funny .
Rather , they are often just affirmations , communications , or expressions of joy .
We laugh " to kind of grease the social wheels , " Hudenko said .
Two types
Laughter mainly comes in two types , researchers think : voiced , and unvoiced .
" We need more research to be done to understand the function of voice versus unvoiced laughter , but our best hypothesis is that unvoiced laughs are probably used more to negotiate social interactions , and voiced might be more linked to a positive internal state , " Hudenko said .
So voiced laughter — the prototypical , belly - laugh type , that sounds more like sing - song — is usually spontaneous .
We create the sound with our vocal chords ( hence the name ) , and usually laugh this way naturally and spontaneously .
Unvoiced laughter , however , is more of a conscious expression .
We make these panting , grunting , snorting noises when we are trying on purpose to laugh , usually for a social purpose , such as to ease conversation or make friends .
For adults , each type of laughter represents about 50 percent of the total .
Young children may express more voiced than unvoiced laughter , as they have n't yet learned to purposely laugh .
But strikingly , Hudenko and team found that autistic children almost never produce unvoiced laughs .
They monitored kids between ages 8 and 10 playing in a lab , and set up situations that would elicit laughter , such as falling block towers and squeaky balloons .
The test group of autistic children laughed just about as often as the non-autistic kids , but the autistic children 's laughter was 98 percent voiced , while non-autistic children produced both types .
" We take this as some preliminary evidence that children with autism might not be using laughter the same way , " Hudenko said .
" Our hypothesis is that typically - developing children , through the course of development , learn a large repertoire of laugh sounds in order to negotiate social circumstances .
We suspect the children with autism are not attuned to the same social subtleties . "
Developing skills
The finding helps underscore the different purposes of the two kinds of laughter .
It could also help researchers design better ways to help kids with autism navigate social situations .
" The idea is that we might be able to help them to express laughter more readily during social interactions , " Hudenko said .
" This shows that these children with autism have a really fantastic skill that might help them to promote relationships with individuals . "
In fact , research shows that most people prefer to listen to voiced laughter more than unvoiced .
Call it our suspicious nature :
We react better to laughter that is spontaneously produced , rather than laughter that is calculated to send a message .
This fact could prove beneficial to autistic children , who tend to produce the more popular variety of laughter .
" We at least know they 're producing sounds that other people like to hear , " Hudenko said .
" We think this is a powerful first start to look at ways we might be able to use emotional capacities these children already have instead of trying to teach them some new skill . "
One of the most provocative ideas about business in this decade so far surfaced in a most unlikely place .
The forum was n’t the Harvard Business School or one of those $ 4,000 - a- head conferences where Silicon Valley ’s venture capitalists search for the next big thing .
It was a convention of Canadian cops in the far - flung province of Newfoundland .
The speaker , a 71 - year - old professor emeritus from the University of British Columbia , remains virtually unknown in the business realm .
But he ’s renowned in his own field : criminal psychology .
Robert Hare is the creator of the Psychopathy Checklist .
The 20 - item personality evaluation has exerted enormous influence in its quarter - century history .
It ’s the standard tool for making clinical diagnoses of psychopaths — the 1 % of the general population that is n’t burdened by conscience .
Psychopaths have a profound lack of empathy .
They use other people callously and remorselessly for their own ends .
They seduce victims with a hypnotic charm that masks their true nature as pathological liars , master con artists , and heartless manipulators .
Easily bored , they crave constant stimulation , so they seek thrills from real - life “ games ” they can win — and take pleasure from their power over other people .

On that August day in 2002 , Hare gave a talk on psychopathy to about 150 police and law - enforcement officials .
He was a legendary figure to that crowd .
The FBI and the British justice system have long relied on his advice .
He created the P - Scan , a test widely used by police departments to screen new recruits for psychopathy , and his ideas have inspired the testing of firefighters , teachers , and operators of nuclear power plants .
According to the Canadian Press and Toronto Sun reporters who rescued the moment from obscurity , Hare began by talking about Mafia hit men and sex offenders , whose photos were projected on a large screen behind him .
But then those images were replaced by pictures of top executives from WorldCom , which had just declared bankruptcy , and Enron , which imploded only months earlier .
The securities frauds would eventually lead to long prison sentences for WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and Enron CFO Andrew Fastow .
“ These are callous , cold - blooded individuals , ” Hare said .
“ They do n’t care that you have thoughts and feelings .
They have no sense of guilt or remorse . ”
He talked about the pain and suffering the corporate rogues had inflicted on thousands of people who had lost their jobs , or their life ’s savings .
Some of those victims would succumb to heart attacks or commit suicide , he said .
Then Hare came out with a startling proposal .
He said that the recent corporate scandals could have been prevented if CEOs were screened for psychopathic behavior .
“ Why would n’t we want to screen them ? ” he asked .
“ We screen police officers , teachers .
Why not people who are going to handle billions of dollars ? ”
It ’s Hare ’s latest contribution to the public awareness of “ corporate psychopathy . ”
He appeared in the 2003 documentary The Corporation , giving authority to the film ’s premise that corporations are “ sociopathic ” ( a synonym for “ psychopathic ” ) because they ruthlessly seek their own selfish interests — “ shareholder value ” — without regard for the harms they cause to others , such as environmental damage .

Is Hare right ?
Are corporations fundamentally psychopathic organizations that attract similarly disposed people ?
It ’s a compelling idea , especially given the recent evidence .
Such scandals as Enron and WorldCom are n’t just aberrations ; they represent what can happen when some basic currents in our business culture turn malignant .
We ’re worshipful of top executives who seem charismatic , visionary , and tough .
So long as they ’re lifting profits and stock prices , we ’re willing to overlook that they can also be callous , conning , manipulative , deceitful , verbally and psychologically abusive , remorseless , exploitative , self - delusional , irresponsible , and megalomaniacal .
So we collude in the elevation of leaders who are sadly insensitive to hurting others and society at large .
But wait , you say :
Do n’t bona fide psychopaths become serial killers or other kinds of violent criminals , rather than the guys in the next cubicle or the corner office ?
That was the conventional wisdom .
Indeed ,
Hare began his work by studying men in prison .
Granted , that ’s still an unusually good place to look for the conscience - impaired .
The average Psychopathy Checklist score for incarcerated male offenders in North America is 23.3 , out of a possible 40 .
A score of around 20 qualifies as “ moderately psychopathic . ”
Only 1 % of the general population would score 30 or above , which is “ highly psychopathic , ” the range for the most violent offenders .
Hare has said that the typical citizen would score a 3 or 4 , while anything below that is “ sliding into sainthood . ”
On the broad continuum between the ethical everyman and the predatory killer , there ’s plenty of room for people who are ruthless but not violent .
This is where you ’re likely to find such people as Ebbers , Fastow , ImClone CEO Sam Waksal , and hotelier Leona Helmsley .
We put several big - name CEOs through the checklist , and they scored as “ moderately psychopathic ” ; our quiz on page 48 lets you try a similar exercise with your favorite boss .
And this summer , together with New York industrial psychologist Paul Babiak , Hare begins marketing the B - Scan , a personality test that companies can use to spot job candidates who may have an MBA but lack a conscience .
“ I always said that if I was n’t studying psychopaths in prison , I ’d do it at the stock exchange , ” Hare told Fast Company .
“ There are certainly more people in the business world who would score high in the psychopathic dimension than in the general population .
You ’ll find them in any organization where , by the nature of one ’s position , you have power and control over other people and the opportunity to get something . ”
There ’s evidence that the business climate has become even more hospitable to psychopaths in recent years .
In pioneering long - term studies of psychopaths in the workplace , Babiak focused on a half - dozen unnamed companies :
One was a fast - growing high - tech firm , and the others were large multinationals undergoing dramatic organizational changes — severe downsizing , restructuring , mergers and acquisitions , and joint ventures .
That ’s just the sort of corporate tumult that has increasingly characterized the U.S. business landscape in the last couple of decades .
And just as wars can produce exciting opportunities for murderous psychopaths to shine ( think of Serbia ’s Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic ) , Babiak found that these organizational shake - ups created a welcoming environment for the corporate killer .
“ The psychopath has no difficulty dealing with the consequences of rapid change ; in fact , he or she thrives on it , ” Babiak claims .
“ Organizational chaos provides both the necessary stimulation for psychopathic thrill seeking and sufficient cover for psychopathic manipulation and abusive behavior . ”
And you can make a compelling case that the New Economy , with its rule - breaking and roller - coaster results , is just dandy for folks with psychopathic traits too .
A slow - moving old - economy corporation would be too boring for a psychopath , who needs constant stimulation .
Its rigid structures and processes and predictable ways might stymie his unethical scheming .
But a charge - ahead New Economy maverick — an Enron , for instance — would seem the ideal place for this kind of operator .
But how can we recognize psychopathic types ?
Hare has revised his Psychopathy Checklist ( known as the PCL -R , or simply “ the Hare ” ) to make it easier to identify so - called subcriminal or corporate psychopaths .
He has broken down the 20 personality characteristics into two subsets , or “ factors . ”
Corporate psychopaths score high on Factor 1 , the “ selfish , callous , and remorseless use of others ” category .
It includes eight traits : glibness and superficial charm ; grandiose sense of self - worth ; pathological lying ; conning and manipulativeness ; lack of remorse or guilt ; shallow affect ( i.e. , a coldness covered up by dramatic emotional displays that are actually playacting ) ; callousness and lack of empathy ; and the failure to accept responsibility for one ’s own actions .
Sound like anyone you know ?
( Corporate psychopaths score only low to moderate on Factor 2 , which pinpoints “ chronically unstable , antisocial , and socially deviant lifestyle , ” the hallmarks of people who wind up in jail for rougher crimes than creative accounting . )
advertisement
This view is supported by research by psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the University of Surrey , who interviewed and gave personality tests to 39 high - level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminals and psychiatric patients .
The executives were even more likely to be superficially charming , egocentric , insincere , and manipulative , and just as likely to be grandiose , exploitative , and lacking in empathy .
Board and Fritzon concluded that the businesspeople they studied might be called “ successful psychopaths . ”
In contrast , the criminals — the “ unsuccessful psychopaths ” — were more impulsive and physically aggressive .
The Factor 1 psychopathic traits seem like the playbook of many corporate power brokers through the decades .
Manipulative ?
Louis B. Mayer was said to be a better actor than any of the stars he employed at MGM , able to turn on the tears at will to evoke sympathy during salary negotiations with his actors .
Callous ?
Henry Ford hired thugs to crush union organizers , deployed machine guns at his plants , and stockpiled tear gas .
He cheated on his wife with his teenage personal assistant and then had the younger woman marry his chauffeur as a cover .
Lacking empathy ?
Hotel magnate Leona Helmsley shouted profanities at and summarily fired hundreds of employees allegedly for trivialities , like a maid missing a piece of lint .
Remorseless ?
Soon after Martin Davis ascended to the top position at Gulf & Western , a visitor asked why half the offices were empty on the top floor of the company ’s Manhattan skyscraper .
“ Those were my enemies , ” Davis said .
“ I got rid of them . ”
Deceitful ?
Oil baron Armand Hammer laundered money to pay for Soviet espionage .
Grandiosity ?
Thy name is Trump .
In the most recent wave of scandals , Enron ’s Fastow displayed many of the corporate psychopath ’s traits .
He pressured his bosses for a promotion to CFO even though he had a shaky grasp of the position ’s basic responsibilities , such as accounting and treasury operations .
Suffering delusions of grandeur after just a little time on the job , Fastow ordered Enron ’s PR people to lobby CFO magazine to make him its CFO of the Year .
But Fastow ’s master manipulation was a scheme to loot Enron .
He set up separate partnerships , secretly run by himself , to engage in deals with Enron .
The deals quickly made tens of millions of dollars for Fastow — and prettified Enron ’s financials in the short run by taking unwanted assets off its books .
But they left Enron with time bombs that would ultimately cause the company ’s total implosion — and lose shareholders billions .
When Enron ’s scandals were exposed , Fastow pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to pay back nearly $ 24 million and serve 10 years in prison .
“ Chainsaw ” Al Dunlap might score impressively on the corporate Psychopathy Checklist too .
What do you say about a guy who did n’t attend his own parents ’ funerals ?
He allegedly threatened his first wife with guns and knives .
She charged that he left her with no food and no access to their money while he was away for days .
His divorce was granted on grounds of “ extreme cruelty . ”
That ’s the characteristic that endeared him to Wall Street , which applauded when he fired 11,000 workers at Scott Paper , then another 6,000 ( half the labor force ) at Sunbeam .
Chainsaw hurled a chair at his human - resources chief , the very man who approved the handgun and bulletproof vest on his expense report .
Dunlap needed the protection because so many people despised him .
His plant closings kept up his reputation for ruthlessness but made no sense economically , and Sunbeam ’s financial gains were really the result of Dunlap ’s alleged book cooking .
When he was finally exposed and booted , Dunlap had the nerve to demand severance pay and insist that the board reprice his stock options .
Talk about failure to accept responsibility for one ’s own actions .
While knaves such as Fastow and Dunlap make the headlines , most horror stories of workplace psychopathy remain the stuff of frightened whispers .
Insiders in the New York media business say the publisher of one of the nation ’s most famous magazines broke the nose of one of his female sales reps in the 1990s .
But he was considered so valuable to the organization that the incident did n’t impede his career .
Most criminals — whether psychopathic or not — are shaped by poverty and often childhood abuse as well .
In contrast , corporate psychopaths typically grew up in stable , loving families that were middle class or affluent .
But because they ’re pathological liars , they tell romanticized tales of rising from tough , impoverished backgrounds .
Dunlap pretended that he grew up as the son of a laid - off dockworker ; in truth , his father worked steadily and raised his family in suburban comfort .
The corporate psychopaths whom Babiak studied all went to college , and a couple even had PhDs .
Their ruthless pursuit of self - interest was more easily accomplished in the white - collar realm , which their backgrounds had groomed them for , rather than the criminal one , which comes with much lousier odds .

Psychopaths succeed in conventional society in large measure because few of us grasp that they are fundamentally different from ourselves .
We assume that they , too , care about other people ’s feelings .
This makes it easier for them to “ play ” us .
Although they lack empathy , they develop an actor ’s expertise in evoking ours .
While they do n’t care about us , “ they have an element of emotional intelligence , of being able to see our emotions very clearly and manipulate them , ” says Michael Maccoby , a psychotherapist who has consulted for major corporations .
Psychopaths are typically very likable .
They make us believe that they reciprocate our loyalty and friendship .
When we realize that they were conning us all along , we feel betrayed and foolish .
“ People see sociopathy in their personal lives , and they do n’t have a clue that it has a label or that others have encountered it , ” says Martha Stout , a psychologist at the Harvard Medical School and the author of the recent best - seller The Sociopath Next Door : The Ruthless Versus the Rest of Us ( Broadway Books , 2005 ) .
“ It makes them feel crazy or alone .
It goes against our intuition that a small percentage of people can be so different from the rest of us — and so evil .
Good people do n’t want to believe it . ”
Of course , cynics might say that it can be an advantage to lack a conscience .
That ’s probably why major investors installed Dunlap as the CEO of Sunbeam :
He had no qualms about decimating the workforce to impress Wall Street .
One reason outside executives get brought into troubled companies is that they lack the emotional stake in either the enterprise or its people .
It ’s easier for them to act callously and remorselessly , which is exactly what their backers want .
The obvious danger of the new B - Scan test for psychopathic tendencies is that companies will hire or promote people with high scores rather than screen them out .
Even Babiak , the test ’s codeveloper , says that while “ a high score is a red flag , sometimes middle scores are okay .
Perhaps you do n’t want the most honest and upfront salesman . ”
Indeed , not every aberrant boss is necessarily a corporate psychopath .
There ’s another personality that ’s often found in the executive suite : the narcissist .
While many psychologists would call narcissism a disorder , this trait can be quite beneficial for top bosses , and it ’s certainly less pathological than psychopathy .
Maccoby ’s book The Productive Narcissist : The Promise and Perils of Visionary Leadership ( Broadway Books , 2003 ) portrays the narcissistic CEO as a grandiose egotist who is on a mission to help humanity in the abstract even though he ’s often insensitive to the real people around him .
Maccoby counts Apple ’s Steve Jobs , General Electric ’s Jack Welch , Intel ’s Andy Grove , Microsoft ’s Bill Gates , and Southwest Airlines ’ Herb Kelleher as “ productive narcissists , ” or PNs .
Narcissists are visionaries who attract hordes of followers , which can make them excel as innovators , but they ’re poor listeners and they can be awfully touchy about criticism .
“ These people do n’t have much empathy , ” Maccoby says .
“ When Bill Gates tells someone , ‘ That ’s the stupidest thing I ’ve ever heard , ’ or Steve Jobs calls someone a bozo , they ’re not concerned about people ’s feelings .
They see other people as a means toward their ends .
But they do have a sense of changing the world — in their eyes , improving the world .
They build their own view of what the world should be and get others recruited to their vision .
Psychopaths , in contrast , are only interested in self . ”
Maccoby concedes that productive narcissists can become “ drunk with power ” and turn destructive .
The trick , he thinks , is to pair a productive narcissist with a “ productive obsessive , ” or conscientious , control - minded manager .
Think of Grove when he was matched with chief operating officer Craig Barrett , Gates with president Steve Ballmer , Kelleher with COO Colleen Barrett , and Oracle ’s Larry Ellison with COO Ray Lane and CFO Jeff Henley .
In his remarkably successful second tour of duty at Apple , Jobs has been balanced by steady , competent behind - the - scenes players such as Timothy Cook , his executive vice president for sales and operations .
But our culture ’s embrace of narcissism as the hallmark of admired business leaders is dangerous , Babiak maintains , since “ individuals who are really psychopaths are often mistaken for narcissists and chosen by the organization for leadership positions . ”
How does he distinguish the difference between the two types ?
“ In the case of a narcissist , everything is me , me , me , ” Babiak explains .
“ With a psychopath , it ’s ‘ Is it thrilling , is it a game I can win , and does it hurt others ? ’
My belief is a psychopath enjoys hurting others . ”

Intriguingly , Babiak believes that it ’s extremely unlikely for an entrepreneurial founder - CEO to be a corporate psychopath because the company is an extension of his own ego — something he promotes rather than plunders .
“ The psychopath has no allegiance to the company at all , just to self , ” Babiak says .
“ A psychopath is playing a short - term parasitic game . ”
That was the profile of Fastow and Dunlap — guys out to profit for themselves without any concern for the companies and lives they were wrecking .
In contrast , Jobs and Ellison want their own companies to thrive forever — indeed , to dominate their industries and take over other fields as well .
“ An entrepreneurial founder - CEO might have a narcissistic tendency that looks like psychopathy , ” Babiak says .
“ But they have a vested interest :
Their identity is wrapped up with the company ’s existence .
They ’re loyal to the company . ”
So these types are ruthless not only for themselves but also for their companies , their extensions of self .
The issue is whether we will continue to elevate , celebrate , and reward so many executives who , however charismatic , remain indifferent to hurting other people .
Babiak says that while the first line of defense against psychopaths in the workplace is screening job candidates , the second line is a “ culture of openness and trust , especially when the company is undergoing intense , chaotic change . ”
Europe is far ahead of the United States in trying to deal with psychological abuse and manipulation at work .
The “ antibullying ” movement in Europe has produced new laws in France and Sweden .
Harvard ’s
Stout suggests that the relentlessly individualistic culture of the United States contributes a lot to our problems .
She points out that psychopathy has a dramatically lower incidence in certain Asian cultures , where the heritage has emphasized community bonds rather than glorified self - interest .
“ If we continue to go this way in our Western culture , ” she says , “ evolutionarily speaking , it does n’t end well . ”
The good news is that we can do something about corporate psychopaths .
Scientific consensus says that only about 50 % of personality is influenced by genetics , so psychopaths are molded by our culture just as much as they are born among us .
But unless American business makes a dramatic shift , we ’ll get more Enrons — and deserve them .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Improvements in cancer screening and better treatments have resulted in steady declines in cancer death rates over the past three decades , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

They said younger adults -- those aged 35 to 45 years old -- have experienced the steepest declines in cancer death rates , but all age groups have shown some improvement .
“ Essentially , the younger you are , the faster your rates are declining , ” said Dr. Eric Kort of the Helen DeVos Children ’s Hospital in Grand Rapids , Michigan , whose study appears in the journal Cancer Research .
The study uses a different way of looking at cancer death rates that measures improvements in cancer deaths by age .
U.S. government estimates suggest there had been little improvement in cancer death rates throughout the 20th century , with rates only beginning to improve in the mid-1990s , Kort said .
But that does not tell the whole story , he said .
“ The way that these statistics are traditionally reported is they have averaged all of the age groups together to get a composite rate , ” Kort said in a telephone interview .
“ The problem with that is because most cancer deaths occur in older Americans , the average heavily emphasizes the experiences of older people .
It ’s like watching the caboose of the train to tell when the train is changing direction , ” he said .
Instead , Kort ’s team looked at improvements in cancer deaths among groups of individuals born in five - year intervals starting in 1925 .
Using that method , Kort said , “ Everyone born since the 1930s has enjoyed a decreased risk of cancer death , at every age . ”
People in the youngest age group -- those aged 35 to 45 -- had a greater than 25 percent decline per decade in cancer deaths , he said .
Kort said cancer prevention -- including smoking cessation efforts -- have played an important role in these trends .
“ We ’re also benefiting in profound ways from progress we ’re making in early detection and better treatments .
Some of these advances benefit younger people first , ” he said .
In childhood cancers , advances in treatments for leukemia and lymphoma mean many more people can survive cancers that were once considered a death sentence .
And better screening for cancers that occur in older age , such as mammography in breast cancer and colonoscopy for colon cancer are spotting cancers at an earlier stage , when they are easier to treat .
Cancer remains the No. 2 killer of Americans , with about 560,000 deaths annually , topped only by heart disease , according to the American Cancer Society .
If you follow the Royals you probably know how this story plays out before we even get started .
There is no way to sugar coat this one .
It ’s bad , real bad .
Read on to see how the division shapes up in terms of team OBP and how each team ’s top 5 OBP players stack up with one another .
The AL Central ranking for team on - base percentage is a tale of 3 tiers .
The first tier features a close race between the Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins .
The second tier is a close race for 3rd between the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers .
The third tier features the Kansas City Royals , all by themselves , in last place .
Considering about half of the season has been played , the gap between the 1st and 2nd tier of 0.010 is very significant .
The 0.017 gap between the team OBP of the 4th place Tigers and the Royals , is the largest spread between any 2 teams in the division .
Not only are the Royals in last place , they are in last place by a mile .
Even with significant changes and improvements to the roster during the second half of the season , it would be almost impossible for the Royals to even sniff 4th place in team OBP .
The stats listed are updated through the games played on Saturday July 4th .
Players were required to have a minimum of 100 AB to qualify for their team ’s top 5 .
0.345
Cleveland holds a slim lead of 0.003 over the Minnesota Twins .
The fact that the Indians rank 1st in OBP and yet have the worst W - L in the division highlights how woefully awful their pitching has been this season .
OF - Shin Soo Choo ( 27 ) leads the team with a 0.406 OBP in 289 AB .
DH - Travis Hafner ( 32 ) .0396 in 113 AB , C/1B - Victor Martinez ( 31 ) 0.387 in 305 AB , 2B - Jamey Carroll ( 35 ) 0.381 in 127 AB , and 2B / SS - Asdrubal Cabrera ( 23 ) 0.367 in 223 AB round out the Indians top 5 .
The average age of the Indians top 5 is 29.6 with ranks 3rd within the division .
0.342
In 2nd place we have the Minnesota Twins who are led by C - Joe Mauer ( 26 ) .
Mauer ’s 0.464 OBP in 213 AB leads the division by a large margin aver Choo ’s 0.406 .
The Twins are far from relying solely on their MVP caliber catcher however .
1B - Justin Morneau ( 28 ) 0.398 in 309 AB , OF - Denard Span ( 25 ) 0.377 in 264 AB , RF - Michael Cuddyer ( 30 ) 0.361 in 278 AB , and DH - Jason Kubel ( 27 ) 0.358 in 254 AB complete the team ’s top 5 .
The Twins have the youngest OBP core within the division with an average age of 27.2 .
0.332
The Chicago White Sox are in 3rd place and are led by DH - Jim Thome ’s 0.400 OBP in 199 AB .
Thome is 38 and in the final stages of his career , yet he remains an OBP machine for the White Sox .
In fact , his 0.400 OBP ranks him 3rd in the division behind only Mauer and Choo.
OF - Scott Podsednik ( 33 ) 0.368 in 231 AB , RF - Jermaine Dye ( 35 ) 0.362 in 265 AB , 1B - Paul Konerko ( 33 ) 0.349 in 288 AB , and C - A.J. Pierzynski ( 32 ) 0.331 in 244 AB round out the White Sox top 5 .
The White Sox top 5 has an average age of 34.2 making them the oldest core in the division by a whopping 4.4 years .
All 5 of the above listed players are on the wrong side of 32 years old and the team , offensively , is in desperate need of an overhaul this offseason .
0.328
The Detroit Tigers rank 4th in the AL Central , led by 1B - Miguel Cabrera ( 26 ) 0.387 in 296 AB .
3B - Brandon Inge ( 32 ) 0.363 in 275 AB , OF - Ryan Raburn ( 28 ) 0.359 in 104 AB , CF - Curtis Granderson ( 28 ) 0.339 in 314 AB , and RF - Magglio Ordonez ( 35 ) 0.333 in 252 AB comprise the rest of the team ’s top 5 . 29.8 is the average age of the Tigers top 5 , but that includes 35 year old Magglio Ordonez and his rapidly declining career .
Dropping Ordonez from their average would drop their age to 28.5 .
0.311
In last pace we have the Kansas City Royals who are led by 2B - Alberto Callaspo ( 26 ) 0.354 in 272 AB .
I need to restate that for emphasis .
The Royals are led by Callaspo ’s 0.354 OBP .
Take a look back at the other team ’s listed above and see where AC ’s 0.354 would rank our offense first 2B .
That ’s right folks , Callaspo would fail to crack Cleveland ’s top 5 , would be 5th on the Twins , 4th on the White Sox , and 4th on the Tigers .
The rest of the Royals top 5 is comprised of 3B / OF - Mark Teahen ( 27 ) 0.350 in 280 AB , 1B - Billy Butler ( 23 ) 0.338 in 287 AB , RF - Jose Guillen ( 33 ) 0.322 in 234 AB , and utility player Willie Bloomquist ( 31 ) 0.319 in 192 AB .
Since CF - Coco Crisp ( 29 ) is done for the season , I did not include his 0.336 OBP in 180 AB .
Had I included him , he would have ranked 4th on the Royals list .
Kansas City ’s top 5 has an average age of 28.0 while their top 3 of Callaspo , Teahen , and Butler averages 25.3 years of age .
Only the Twins have more youth at the top of their list .
Hey , I found a positive !
2009 OBP compared to Career OBP :
One of the other things I looked at when researching for this article was the difference between each player ’s 2009 OBP and their career OBP .
When I rolled this variance back up to the team level , the Royals , yet again , finished dead last .
The Minnesota Twins are collectively +139 .
This somewhat expected since all 5 of the Twins included are either in the upswing of their careers or in the “ prime ” of their career ( Cuddyer ) .
Mauer ’s career OBP of 0.405 , which is the 2nd highest career OBP in the division behind Jim Thome ’s 0.406 , makes his 2009 0.464 OBP a whopping +59 .
Also of note , Morneau ’s +45 is the 3rd biggest variance in the division .
Span - 6 , Cuddyer +15 , and +26 complete the Twins 5 .
The Cleveland Indians are collectively +82 and are led by Jamey Carroll ’s + 28 .
Choo +18 , Martinez +16 , Cabrera +14 , and Hafner +6 round out the Indians top 5 .
The Detroit Tigers +57 feature Inge +55 , Raburn +41 , Cabrera +6 , Granderson - 9 , and Ordonez - 36 .
The White Sox are +48 as a team .
Podsednik +29 , Dye +23 , and Pierzynski +5 are the 3 Chicago players in the positive .
Thome - 6 and Konerko - 3 are the two in the negative .
Finally we have the Royals who are +36 as a team .
Callaspo leads the way again with a + 21 .
He is followed by Teahen +16 , Butler +3 , Guillen - 1 , and Bloomquist - 3 .
Even with Wee Willie B hitting like Ted Williams to start the season he still has a - 3 on the season .
Having a - 3 is n’t so bad if your career OBP is 0.350 or so .
Unfortunately for Willie and Royals fans , his career OBP is 0.322 .
Other Thoughts :
The youngest players to appear in this 25 player group , are Asdrubal Cabrera of the Indians and Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals .
Both Cabrera and Butler are only 23 and both look like they have long and promising careers ahead of them .
The oldest players to appear in the above are Chicago ’s Jim Thome ( 38 ) and Jermaine Dye ( 35 ) , Cleveland ’s Jamey Carroll ( 35 ) , and Detroit ’s Magglio Ordonez ( 35 ) .
All in all , the OBP rankings paint a very bleak landscape for the Kansas City Royals .
The good news is that their top 3 are players are key players on my 2011 playoff team .
Sadly , that is where the good news ends with respect to OBP .
Callaspo is still a well - below average fielder with sub -par range .
Teahen will probably end up being traded by the deadline , though I am hoping and praying he remains a member of this team .
Guillen and his $ 12 million 2010 salary will probably remain on the team limiting their offseason payroll flexibility .
Finally Willie Bloomquist is forced to play every day thanks to the Aviles injury and the historic offensive ineptitude to TPJ .
Since Bloomquist is being overused hit 2009 offensive numbers will most likely continue to erode .
It ’s bad , real bad .
Flashback to a day of unadulterated insanity .
You can thank Obama and the Senate for the monster who still roams the Fed .
---
Proving that job performance is irrelevant in Washington , Obama today reappointed Bernanke to a new 7 - year term as Fed Chairman .
Ca n't say that this is surprising news , given the signals of late .
But still it is remarkable in the context of Bernanke 's massive failure as the architect of the U.S. financial collapse .
On a day when most are praising the Fed chairman , we will look at his many and massive failures instead .
As you will hear in the collection of videos and stories linked below :
B - 52 failed to recognize asset bubbles of all types , and even encouraged irresponsible 2/28 mortgages and low teaser rates in 2007 at the start of the sub - prime implosion .
Failed to shut off the free - money spigot still gushing from the Greenspan years .
Failed to provide a framework for adequate regulatory oversight of Wall Street ( yet Obama now wants to give the Fed more oversight and regulatory authority ) .
Failed to control or even understand the build - up of risk within the system caused by derivatives and securitization .
Failed to reform the inherently conflicted credit- rating structure that perpetuated the risk and securitization build - up .
Failed to understand the nature of the crisis when it first broke in the Spring of 2007 ( Bear Stearns sub - prime , hedge fund implosion ) .
The famous meltdown clip from Cramer on Bernanke sums this failure up rather nicely .
Failed to understand that housing prices might actually decline in value after such a dramatic rise ( seriously , even my mother knew that banks providing new mortgages on massively - inflated housing was not going to turn out well )
Failed to negotiate with AIG counterparties ; instead choosing to pay all claims at 100 cents on the dollar without asking for any compensation ( preferred shares ) in return .
Failed the American people with his decision to support and reward the failed banks and the bankers for their malfeasance , excessive risk - taking and criminality .
Failed to protect taxpayer 's interests in deals with AIG , JPM , and Bear Stearns , ( with Maiden Lane I , II and III ) and the still un - detailed asset guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America .
Ultimately Benjamin Bernanke , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve failed by choosing to reward failure in others .

We 've seen some cool augmented reality apps shown off that will point you towards the closest subway or find your mom , but this TAT Augmented ID app takes it to the next level .
It 's mindblowing , but it leaves me conflicted .

Really , the video does a better job of showing how it works than I can describe it , so why do n't you go watch it .
Done ?
Good .
Clearly , this is n't something we 're going to see in the App Store anytime soon .
It 's a next - gen idea , but one that I think we 'll be seeing sooner rather than later .
The tech is all just about there , it 's just going to be contingent on a platform or program that everyone voluntarily signs up for and uses .
But at some point in our lives , we 'll be using phones in a fashion similar to this .
Of course , whether or not it 'll be a good thing that strangers will be able to point their phones in our faces and get a rundown of our online lives is debatable .
There 's probably a lot to be said for learning about someone via conversation , but it 's not like people do n't go home from bars and Google and Facebook search the people they met that night .
This just takes it to the logical extreme .
Good ?
Bad ?
Probably somewhere in between .
But it 's definitely interesting .

A businessman who was held and mistreated in the United Arab Emirates following the London bombings believes he has evidence that British consular officials asked permission from the UK's own security services to visit him while he was detained .
Heavily redacted documents seen by the Guardian appear to indicate that the request to visit Alam Ghafoor was made to an unidentified British intelligence officer and not to officials in the UAE .
Ghafoor is one of several British men who allege there has been British complicity in their detention and torture while abroad .
The businessman , who is 38 and from Huddersfield , West Yorkshire , was detained and tortured while on a business trip to Dubai following the London bombings in July 2005 .
Ghafoor and his business partner , Mohammed Rafiq Siddique , flew to the UAE on 4 July .
They were dragged out of a restaurant as they dined on 21 July .
The two British Muslims say they were threatened with torture , deprived of sleep , subjected to stress positions and told they would be killed and fed to dogs .
Ghafoor has obtained copies of correspondence from consular officials to the Foreign Office in London while he was in custody that show those officials were asking someone other than the UAE authorities for permission to see him .
Who that person is , and who they represented , is unclear , as their name was censored before the copies were handed over .
Some of the reports were so heavily redacted by the time Ghafoor received them that the only words not blanked are his name .
In one email , dated 25 July , 2005 , a consular official wrote : " Today I phoned [ name withheld ] trying to get permission to see them .
First [...] told me that there was no need because they would be deported soon .
I asked if we could see them today or tomorrow . [...] told me that [...] would check with the UAE authorities ... and would let me know .
I did n't hear from [...] since then .
Tomorrow I 'll speak to [...] again . "
Ghafoor , who was released without charge on 30 July , is convinced that the individual to which consular officials were turning for permission to see him was a British intelligence officer .
At the time of his interrogation , Ghafoor was told that British security services had requested his questioning .
MI5 and MI6 officers who question terrorism suspects they know are being tortured , are acting in line with a secret government interrogation policy , drawn up after the 9/11 attacks .
The policy states : " we can not be party to such ill treatment nor can we be seen to condone it " and that " it is important that you do not engage in any activity yourself that involves inhumane or degrading treatment of prisoners . "
It also advises intelligence officers that if detainees " are not within our custody or control , the law does not require you to intervene " to prevent torture .
According to Philippe Sands , QC , one of the world 's leading experts in international human rights law , the policy almost certainly breaches international human rights .
When Ghafoor asked why he had been picked up , he was shown a photograph and told he resembled one of the 7/7 suicide bombers and must be related to him .
His business partner , Siddique , who was also detained and tortured , says he was told he must have been involved in the bombings – not only did he share a name with the bombers – but he lived in Dewsbury , the same Yorkshire town .
Ghafoor said his interrogators questioned his sexuality , as he is not married , and insulted him because he was unable to wash , saying he smelled .
He was also punched in the groin .
One interrogator said to him : " In the morning you will be thrown into a pit and the dogs will tear you to bits and I will watch it and enjoy it . "
Eventually , he agreed to sign a false confession admitting he was a friend of the bombers and had organised the London attacks .
" I wrote a false confession and put crazy things in it like ' I have constant contact with Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden ' , " he said .
He was told he would be shot by a firing squad the following morning .
When Ghafoor returned home , he was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
His relationship with his partner broke down and he suffered nightmares , anxiety and paranoia .
Ghafoor is furious that there has been no explanation for his treatment , nor an apology .
" I would like to know why I was put through this hell and I would like someone to be accountable . "
Clive Stafford - Smith , the legal director of Reprieve , a not - for - profit human rights organisation , said : " It is impossible for the victims of torture to move on without truth and reconciliation , yet the British government seems intent on covering up what it has done . "
He added : " Until recently , the British security services were told to effectively turn a blind eye to torture . "
The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ghafoor and Siddique were not detained at Britain 's request .
" British consular staff visited them on July 30 , 2005 to ensure their welfare needs were being addressed .
Their detention was a matter for the Dubai authorities ... they were not detained at the request of the UK government .
We do not participate in , solicit , encourage or condone the use of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment for any purpose .
" Wherever allegations of wrongdoing are made , they are taken seriously and investigated as appropriate . "
San Francisco electro artist Moldover , like Beck before him , figured out a way to make physical music purchases superior to digital : Embrace the physical .
In Moldover 's case , that meant cramming an actual working theremin into the CD case .

Moldover really went all - out with this one .
The CD case theremin features a headphone jack as well as a speaker , and the wiring on the theremin itself spells out the artist name , track names , and " album art , " such as it is .
He even includes a tiny pocket - sized version of the theremin so you 're never without that odd organic screechy sound .
The album costs $ 50 , which actually seems pretty cheap considering it 's packaged inside a musical instrument .

After closely watching the way that the Canadian copyright debate has proceeded ( from a new copyright bill drafted in secret and off - limits to input by Canadian artists , librarians , ISPs and scholars ; to a plagiarized " independent " report that used faked - up research and US lobby - group talking - points to " prove " Canada 's copyright pariah statement ) , Michael Geist has created this handy chart showing how the copyright lobby in Canada uses a variety of fronts to subvert the legislative process .
The whole report is a must - read , untangling the web of circular references — one organization creates a push poll , a second one inflates its results , and a third points to the second as evidence of a consenus — and sleazy manipulation that is used to cook the books on copyright in Canada .
Although there are many groups involved in copyright lobbying , at the heart of the strategy are two organizations – the Canadian Recording Industry Association and the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association .
CRIA 's board is made up the four major music labels plus its director , while the CMPDA 's board is comprised of representatives of the Hollywood movie studios .
Those same studios and music labels provide support for the International Intellectual Property Association , which influences Canadian copyright policy by supporting U.S. government copyright lobby efforts .
In addition to their active individual lobbying ( described here ) , CRIA and CMPDA have provided financial support for three associations newly active on copyright lobbying – the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network , the Canadian Chamber of Commerce 's IP Council , and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce ( there are other funders including pharmaceutical companies and law firms ) .
Those groups have issued virtually identical reports and in turn supported seemingly independent sources such as the Conference Board of Canada and paid polling efforts through Environics .
The net effect has been a steady stream of reports that all say basically the same thing , cite to the same sources , make the same recommendations , and often rely on each other to substantiate the manufactured consensus on copyright reform .

There have a been some large earthquakes in Japan recently to go with the hundreds of years of earthquake activity Japan has experienced .
In 1923 when the Great Kanto Earthquake hit Tokyo , the people did n’t have internet and communication devices that could easily carry messages around the globe .
They did n’t even have accurate ways to measure the intensity of the earthquake and communicate that to local areas .
A lot of technological improvement has been made on the communication side of things and we can measure earths movements better now as well .
The forecasting has n’t yet made any large breakthroughs ( excuse the pun ) .
In the last earthquake post I showed a web image from weathernews as below .
They were using a networked service called the Yure Project ( yureプロジェクト ) to pull data over the internet from over 1,000 points in Japan and then show it back live through the web .
Through the project you can sign up for a paid service YEN 315 per month ( $ 3 ) and get advance notice of an earthquake .
You can either get the warning on your mobile phone , PC or have one of these devices attached that flashes as well .
If you are in an office or factory it could be pretty handy .
If you are asleep in bed , maybe not so much .
Actually , the advance notice is only slightly advanced , and the service is called ‘ The Last 10 second ’ .
I think ’ 10 second Warning ’ might have been a better name .
‘ The Last 10 second ’ sounds like the name of a movie where someone did n’t make it .
It is also possible to be a monitor in the yure project from your own house or at work .
Here is a video showing the warning and feedback system .
The countdown here is from around 14 seconds .
and the web software version without the flashing lights
If you are a monitor in the program you need to leave your computer on all the time and have to set up the software to relay data from the equipment back to the Center .

Gordon Brown does not see the environment as important and spent years as Chancellor preventing British domestic action on climate change , the Government 's chief environmental adviser says today .
In a remarkably frank interview with The Independent Jonathon Porritt says that during his time at the Treasury Mr Brown did not " get " climate change and saw the environment as " middle class stuff " .
Since Mr Brown became Prime Minister , Sir Jonathon thinks that the environment " is no more important to him now than it was when he was Chancellor " .
He criticises the Prime Minister in particular for backing the third runway at Heathrow , which he says was a " ludicrous decision , with no serious intellectual , economic rationale " .
Asked why he thought Mr Brown was so keen on a third runway , Sir Jonathon said : " He 's got some incredibly fixed ideas about some of these things .
He genuinely feels that a successful competitive economy of the future has to be growing its aviation business in order to make UK plc more productive , and so on .
And you can put the evidence about minimal economic benefit of a third runway in front of him – it wo n't go through the Brown brain . "
But , he says , over the past 18 months Mr Brown has come to understand the seriousness of the climate change issue specifically , and has taken a number of important steps , such as setting up the new Energy and Climate Change Department under Ed Miliband .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This has injected a " completely unprecedented level of energy " into the climate debate , Sir Jonathon says .
He adds it is ironic to be leaving his post just at the moment when real changes in the system are starting to happen .
He retires on Monday after nine years as chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission , the Government 's main environmental advisory body .
Sir Jonathon says that while Tony Blair was trying to put the issue of global warming high on the international agenda , Mr Brown " held the levers of power domestically " and failed to deliver appropriate climate policy measures at home .
For Mr Blair to have Mr Brown in such a position was " a very unfortunate combination " , he says , and it was " a tragedy " that Mr Blair was unable to match what Sir Jonathon calls his " inspirational " leadership on the climate issue internationally , with action taken in Britain .
As a result , the gap between Mr Blair 's rhetoric on climate change and the lack of actual measures taken to counter it in Britain became so great that environmentalists began to lose faith in him .
" Environment has never been Gordon Brown 's strong suit , " he says .
Sir Jonathon is a serious player in green thinking , and for nearly a decade at the head of the SDC has been the official " candid friend " to the Government on green matters , running a body which has tried to get the notion of sustainable development – environmental concern , in other words – embedded in every department and policy .
It has given him a uniquely intimate view of the Labour Government 's environmental successes and failures , one of the most obvious of the latter being the lack of measures taken to counter climate change in Britain during the years between 2000 and 2007 when Tony Blair was proclaiming the seriousness of the threat .
" Tony Blair fully understood the risk of climate change , and whatever you may think about him , his commitment on that was completely genuine , " he says .
But , he goes on , the Blair - Brown partnership was the problem .
" It was a very unfortunate combination , with Tony Blair having the unquestioned leadership role globally , but not having the levers to make things happen domestically .
And the sort of informal deal they [ Blair and Brown ] did , meant that far more of that went to the Treasury . "
Although Mr Blair " got " climate change , Mr Brown , at that time , " absolutely didn't , " Sir Jonathon says .
" I rather suspect – although I 'm sure he would deny this completely – that the environment was in many respects seen by Gordon Brown as part of that middle - class stuff going on over there , while we do the serious business of sorting out equity issues and entitlements , and how to make the economy really efficient . "
Mr Brown , he says , is a man " of great intellectual strengths and integrity , " but if you looked back into his personal history , his mentors , and his view of the world , the environment had not been part of the growth of his ideas .
He did not see it as central .
But he had now changed his view on the climate issue not least because he could see its potential impact on areas which had always mattered to him , such as global poverty and Africa .
" I do n't think he had thought terribly deeply about it when he became Prime Minister , but to be fair , he 's now much better informed , and he 's really got his head around these things , " he says .
" At the recent G8 meeting and the subsequent meeting with China and India he was playing an extremely significant role in the negotiations . "
Sir Jonathon says he wonders whether , if Mr Brown had to take the Heathrow third runway decision now rather than a year ago , he would still approve it .
" He wo n't go back on it now because he 's not that kind of politician .
But I have watched how over the last 18 months his leadership on climate change has deepened . "
Sir Jonathon is optimistic that the world community can reach a new deal at the Copenhagen climate conference in December to cut carbon emissions and check the progress of global warming before it becomes disastrous , although he thinks that over the coming years the world is in for some " serious shocks " either from climate change or resources such as food and water .
However , he believes they may be what is needed to galvanise action from governments and citizens and will not necessarily be terminal .
He says that the dire predictions of James Lovelock , founder of the Gaia theory of the world as a single organism – " that the world is headed into some eco - hell - hole " – are too pessimistic .
" Though I say that with some hesitation as I do have a huge amount of respect for that guy . "
After he leaves the SDC on Monday he will spend most of his time working for the think - tank he founded with Sarah Parkin , Forum for The Future , and also for the Green Party .
At the forefront of green campaigning
* Sir Jonathon Porritt , 59 is the doyen of Britain 's environmentalists , the first green campaigner to become nationally famous .
He is a former director of Friends of the Earth .
* He is the son of Arthur Porritt , the New Zealand athlete and surgeon who won the 100 metres bronze medal in the famous " Chariots of Fire " race at the 1924 Olympics .
His father also went on to become Lord Porritt and New Zealand 's Governor - General .
* Educated at Eton and Oxford , Porritt is in theory doubly - titled – he is " Hon " as the son of a life peer , and also Sir Jonathon Porritt , Bart , having inherited the baronetcy which was also awarded to his father .
But he makes little of any of this and is a very different creature from the aristo - greens and celebrity - greens who pop up from time to time on Britain 's environmental scene .
* He does not own a car , but has two bikes – one for home in Cheltenham and one for work in London .

Today we 're going to take a second look at a pop culture trend that first caught my attention because it so flagrantly waves many of the red flags that characterize pseudoscience : Organic agriculture .
I once gave a 15 - point checklist of things to look for to help you spot bad science .
Organic agriculture is promoted mainly through the mass media , rarely through scientific channels .
It 's supported by political and cultural campaigns .
It relies largely on the " all natural " fallacy .
The people promoting it generally have questionable scientific credentials , and they support their claim primarily by pointing out flaws in the norm .
These are all characteristic of pseudoscience .
Scientifically , the term " organic food " is meaningless .
It 's like saying a " human person " .
All food is organic .
All plants and animals are organic .
Traditionally , an organic compound is one produced by life processes ; chemically , it 's any carbon - containing molecule with a carbon - hydrogen bond .
Plastic and coal are organic , a diamond is not .
So when we refer to organic food in such a way to exclude similar foods that are just as organic chemically , we 're outside of any meaningful scientific use of the word , and are using it as a marketing label .
When we try to find common ground , we all agree that healthy food and sustainable production are the goal .
So , fundamentally , we 're all on the same team , looking for the same thing .
Where we split is in our analysis of the history of food production , specifically the role of science in increasing crop yields .
Science has brought us crop strains that increase output by factors of 10 and even 20 times even in poor soil , and given us a plethora of tools to combat losses to pests and disease .
Generally , science ( and the hungry people who benefit ) applaud these improvements .
Organic proponents ( mainly well - fed people ) have opposed them , saying they 're bad for the environment .
To support this position , organic proponents have continued heaping on all sorts of claims about the dangers of modern agriculture :
That the food is unhealthy , or that it requires toxic chemicals that poison consumers , ravage the soil , and pollute the oceans with runoff .
They poison the well by referring to modern agriculture using weasel words like " chemical farming " and " industrial agriculture " .
The natural inference we are supposed to make is that organic crops are free from these dangers .
I want to stress that I am not opposed to organic food .
It is generally a perfectly fine product .
I do have objections to the way it 's marketed :
It 's an identical product , sold at a premium , justified by baseless alarmism about standard food .
Whether you agree or not that this alarmism is baseless , you should at least agree that that would be an unethical way to promote a product that offers no real benefit .
I choose not to reward this with my food - buying dollar .
People who willfully seek out the organic label when buying food are being taken advantage of by marketers employing unethical tactics .
It 's a seductive message .
Everyone loves to hear that corporations are bad , that all - natural is good , that chemicals and synthetic compounds are poisons .
This is not a message that 's difficult to sell .
It 's little wonder that organics have been the fastest growing agricultural market segment over the past decade .
It 's an ironic little secret that those very same corporate food producers taking our money to sell us organic foods are the same ones spending it on the ad agencies to stoke the anticorporate message that drives them .
Nearly 100 % of organic food in supermarkets comes from a producer owned by one of the major food companies that also sells regular food .
Do n't think for a minute that any well - managed food company has not already been on this bandwagon since it started rolling .
I 've been pointing out the fallacies of the organic label for some time , so it 's frequently assumed that I 'm on the payroll of Big Agriculture .
Since Big Agriculture are the ones selling nearly all of the organic food in this country , do you know how stupid that accusation sounds ?
My motivation is to help people think critically and scientifically , and not simply accept pop culture trends because they sound satisfying , or have been greenwashed with clever marketing .
OK , so I 've made some statements about the safety of conventional agriculture , and about the equivalency of organic and conventional produce .
It 's time to back those up .
First , understand that mine is not the extraordinary claim .
I 'm saying the claims made by organic proponents — that we 're all being poisoned — are the extraordinary claims lacking evidence .
But since many people seem to prefer the reverse , that the default assumption should be that the entire world population is poisoned with toxic chemicals from conventional agriculture , I 'll go ahead and support my " outrageous alarmist claim " that this holocaust does n't seem to exist .
The biggest misconception is that organic farming does not use fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides .
Of course it does .
Fertilizer is essentially chemical nutrient , and the organic version delivers exactly the same chemical load as the synthetic .
It has to , otherwise it would n't function .
All plant fertilizers , organic and synthetic , consist of the same three elements : nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium .
Referring to one as a " chemical " and implying that the other is not , is the worst kind of duplicity , and no intelligent person should tolerate it .
The difference between the two is the source of the chemicals .
To make the high - volume commercial versions of both organic and synthetic fertilizer , the source materials are processed in factories and reduced to just the desired chemicals , and the end product , these days , is virtually indistinguishable .
Small organic farmers , and home organic farmers , might use fish meal , bone meal , bat guano , or earthworm castings .
These are fine products and do indeed deliver the required nutrients .
They 're just not useful for high volume farming because they 're ( a ) far too expensive , and ( b ) contain too much ballast , or inactive ingredient , that the crops do n't use and merely increase the energy requirements of moving and delivering them .
To make synthetic fertilizer , we start with nitrogen , which we extract from the atmosphere .
This process is infinitely sustainable and produces no waste .
The potassium is mined from ancient ocean deposits .
The phosphorus we get from surface mining of phosphate rock .
Although we have centuries of reserves of phosphate rock and millenia of reserves of potassium salts , mining is not sustainable , as these reserves will eventually run out .
So , increasingly , producers are turning to seawater extraction for both .
This forms a completely sustainable cycle , as the oceans are the ultimate destination of all plant matter and farm runoff .
But clean , sustainable atmospheric and seawater extraction are both taboo for organic certification , which I find astonishing .
The chemicals for organic fertilizer must be sourced from post - consumer and animal waste , which is fine but the restriction strikes me as completely arbitrary .
Food waste , animal manure , and other organic recyclables collectively provide all the needed ingredients to make refined , high quality fertilizer .
The refining process is necessarily a little bit different , but the end product is comparable .
Do n't get me wrong —
I think fertilizer is a fine use for post - consumer waste .
It 's certainly better than putting it into a landfill .
I 'm completely in favor of using all of our restaurant waste , cow manure , or whatever we have in as recyclable and sustainable a way as is practical ; and I can't think of a better use than fertilizer .
Unfortunately we do n't have nearly enough high - quality organic waste to satisfy a meaningful percentage of our food production needs , and developing countries have even less or even none at all ; so we 're going to need to continue to supplement with sustainably - derived synthetics .
Why do so many people consider this immoral ?
I do n't know .
Some in the organic lobby have said that organic farming reduces or eliminates the need for added nutrients by rotating crops and better managing the soil .
This is true , but it 's always been true of all farming , and is in no way unique to organics .
Soil management is something all farmers have always done : Describing it as part of the organic process dishonestly implies that the strategy is not also employed by mainstream agriculture .
Corn , wheat , and soybeans are the main crops that U.S. farmers rotate .
This improves nitrogen content in the soil and reduces the proliferation of pests that thrive on a particular crop .
When some farms do practice monoculture , in which only a single crop is grown season after season , it all comes down to a cost - benefit equation .
Every farm prefers to avoid the expense of spraying anything they do n't have to .
On to pesticides and herbicides .
All crops are subject to disease and infestation , and all farmers have to do something about it .
Because organic herbicides and pesticides depend on toxic plant - derived chemicals like rotenone and pyrethrin , they 've had a tougher time meeting the same standards , making them safe for farm workers and for human consumption , that synthetic versions have already met for decades .
Organic versions do meet the standards and are just as safe , but doing so makes them considerably less efficient .
According to one winemaker interviewed by the Los Angeles Times , most vineyards do not get certified organic because some of the rules emphasize the ideology over the science .
Vineyards need fungicide .
Organic fungicide lasts 7 days , while superior synthetic fungicide lasts 21 days .
This means two fewer tractors pass through the vineyard spewing diesel exhaust and compacting the soil .
Despite claims in the organic community , there 's never yet been a confirmed case of anyone becoming ill from consuming produce contaminated with residue from pesticides or herbicides , either organic or synthetic .
Both are certified safe for human exposure , and both are applied at trace levels well below safety standards .
In no way does limiting yourself to organic produce decrease your risk of dangerous levels of exposure to pesticides .
The risk is practically zero either way .
Everyone has traces of these compounds in their body , no matter what they eat , at ridiculously low parts per billion or even parts per trillion .
People who eat conventional produce will usually have safe but detectable levels of conventional pesticides in their body .
Organic proponents love to point this out , but somehow they always forget to mention that people who eat only organic produce also end up with safe but detectable levels of organic pesticides in their bodies .
If you eat it , it 's going to end up in your body , so I 'm not sure why this should surprise anyone .
Just existing on the planet means that we all naturally have safe but detectable levels of practically every toxic substance imaginable , somewhere in our system .
It 's too easy to frighten people with such sensationalism .
We have to understand the difference between what 's safe and normal , and what 's harmful .
What harm exists is usually among farm workers who mishandle pesticides , and their plight is among the organic proponents ' main arguments against conventional agriculture .
Hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed around the world each year , tens of thousands are hospitalized , thousands die , and it is indeed a real problem that requires increased attention .
But there are three very important qualifiers that the organic proponents never seem to mention :
Two thirds of these cases are deliberate suicides and suicide attempts .
In Malaysia it 's 73 % .
Illnesses from occupational exposure to organic pesticides are proportional to those from conventional pesticides .
Almost all of these cases are from developing countries like Indonesia that lack or ignore safety guidelines .
Less than 1 % of all such illnesses occur in the United States .
The takeaway is that organic practices in no way mitigate such injuries .
Buying organic produce does not protect a single farm worker .
Following proper safety procedures does protect all farm workers , and this is where resources would be better applied , not in promoting fear about conventional agriculture .
We should choose farming methods that truly address our real concerns — safety and sustainability — not simply methods that satisfy an arbitrary marketing label .
To whatever extent these practices include methods that are permitted under organic rules , that 's just fine ; but there 's never a case when a safe , more efficient , and sustainable modern technology that feeds more people worldwide should be disallowed for no logical reason .
Buy whatever produce you see in the market that you like and that 's cheap , and do n't reward the people who are profiteering by selling you fear .

Mars may have once been both cold and wet , researchers said today , suggesting a freezing Martian landscape could still have produced water needed to sustain life .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There has been debate over the issue because with some researchers believing water likely formed many features of the planet 's landscape and others pointing to evidence indicating that early Mars was cold with temperatures well below the freezing point of water .
Using a computer model , Alberto Fairen of Universidad Autonoma in Madrid and colleagues showed that both could have been possible because fluids containing dissolved minerals would have remained liquid at temperatures well below 273 degrees Kelvin - the freezing point of pure water .
" Our results are compatible with Mars lander and orbiter data and with climate modelling , and suggest a cold and wet early Mars , " they wrote in the journal Nature .
The presence of water on Mars is a hot topic for scientists .
They have presented strong evidence of huge deposits of frozen water at the Martian poles and point to geological features that indicate large bodies of water have flowed on the planet 's surface in the distant past .
Other scientists have said images and computer simulations strongly suggest a landslide of sand and gravel are more likely explanations for the bright deposits in gullies that have been proposed as strong evidence of water flow .
Water is a key to the question of whether life , even in the form of microbes , ever existed on Mars .
On Earth , all known forms of life require water .
Feiren and colleagues , including scientists from NASA 's Ames Research Center in California , chose compositions based on weathered basalts for the Martian fluids in their model to match the chemical compositions of rock found at Mars landing sites .
This analysis showed that a number of minerals could have lowered the melting point of water in a frozen Martian environment and help explain the early Mars climate paradox , they said .
" The stability against freezing of Martian fluids can explain saline water activity on the surface of Mars at mean global temperatures well below 273 Kelvin , " they wrote .
ANN ARBOR — College students who major in the social sciences and humanities are likely to become less religious , while those majoring in education are likely to become more religious .
But students majoring in biology and physical sciences remain just about as religious as they were when they started college .
Those are among key findings of a University of Michigan study on the connection between college attendance , college major and religiosity released this week ( July 27 ) by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
The study , funded by the John Templeton Foundation , is based on long - term data from the Monitoring the Future Study conducted by the U - M Institute for Social Research ( ISR ) .
“ Education majors are clearly safe havens for the religious , ” said U - M economist Miles Kimball , who co-authored the study .
“ Highly religious people seem to prefer education majors , tend to stay in that major , and tend to become more religious by the time they graduate . ”
For the study , Kimball and colleagues Colter Mitchell , Arland Thornton and Linda Young DeMarco analyzed data on approximately 26,200 individuals who graduated from high school between 1976 and 1996 .
They reviewed information on religious attitudes and college attendance and major for a period of six years .
Among the questions participants were asked :
How often do you attend religious services ?
How important is religion in your life ?
How good or bad a job is being done for the country as a whole by churches and religious organizations ?
Of those who did not attend college right away , those who were more religious were more likely to attend college eventually .
One of the reasons for this might be a “ nagging effect ” of church friends who ask repeatedly about college attendance plans , the researchers speculate .
For the analysis of impact of college major on religiosity , the researchers used business majors as a reference point .
“ We wanted a major that was culturally neutral and that attracted a large number of students , ” Kimball said .
“ The content of most business courses does not touch on values . ”
The authors theorize that three powerful streams of thought interact with choice of college majors to amplify the impact on religiosity .
These are science , developmentalism ( the belief in progress ) , and postmodernism ( the belief that everything is relative ) .
“ There are important differences among the college majors in world views and overall philosophies of life , ” Kimball said .
“ At the same time , students recognize to some degree the differences among majors and chose a major based , at least in part , on religiosity .
“ Our results suggest that it is Postmodernism , not Science , that is the b
Cases in pigs are not thought to have spread beyond the farm A herd of pigs in Canada has tested positive for swine flu , apparently after being infected by a farm worker recently returned from Mexico .
The herd , in the western province of Alberta , has been quarantined .
Officials said there was no risk of contracting the illness by consuming pork , and chances of a human getting infected by a pig were remote .
Meanwhile a spate of new cases among humans were confirmed in Canada , raising the total number from 35 to 85 .
The largest number of cases was in Nova Scotia .
Many of them were at a school in the town of Windsor where an outbreak earlier in the week led to Canada 's first cases of secondary transmission of the virus .
' No concerns ' Brian Evans , a senior official from Canada 's food safety agency , told journalists up to 200 pigs had been infected at the Alberta farm .
Both the man and the pigs were recovering , he added , saying that the virus did not seem to have spread beyond the farm .
" I want to be clear - there is no food safety concern related to this finding , " he said .
" The chance that these pigs could transfer virus to a person is remote . "
US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he was satisfied that Canada had taken all necessary measures to contain the outbreak , adding that there were no cases of infected pigs in the US .

As you ’re probably well aware , Glenn Beck claimed that President Obama is a racist and has a “ deep seated hatred toward white people . ”
Yesterday , the Sr. Vice President of Programming at Fox News , Bill Shine , issued the following statement :
SHINE : During Fox & Friends this morning , Glenn Beck expressed a personal opinion which represented his own views , not those of the Fox News Channel .
And as with all commentators in the cable news arena , he is given the freedom to express his opinions .
Translation :
This morning Glenn Beck said something idiotic and untrue , but rather than take corrective action like a responsible news organization , Fox News Channel will do nothing .
We are not in the business of reporting the news , we are in the business of making money on the backs of opinionated nut jobs like Beck .
In other words :
F U America !

Flying to the moon is not easy feat but communicating with as well as relaying information to and from rocketing space probes is the most critical part of the mission .
NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) mission launched June 18 is using modified General Dynamics Advanced Multi-Mode Transceivers that support data rates of up to 512 kbps to send health and status updates and receive command instructions from NASA .
LRO will communicate at S - Band frequencies through the NASA Ground Network and Deep Space Network ( DSN ) .
The S band ranges between 2 GHz and 4 GHz and is the usual frequency for many satellites .
NASA 's DSN is made up of myriad systems .
It includes an international network of antennas that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the solar system and the universe .
The DSN currently includes of three deep - space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the world : at Goldstone , in California 's Mojave Desert ; near Madrid , Spain ; and near Canberra , Australia .
This placement permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates , and helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world , NASA said .
In a white paper issued last Fall , NASA said the DSN will be modified to meet new performance and interoperability requirements for its planned moon shots .
NASA stated : A small constellation of Lunar Relay Satellites ( LRS ) will be placed into orbits with long term stability that provide periodic coverage of the entire surface of the Moon as well as Low Lunar Orbit ( LLO ) .
Two LRSs provide periodic coverage of the entire Moon for sortie support .
Medium and high rate links will be provided between the LRS and Lunar Communication Terminals ( LCT ) at the Outpost .
Lunar surface communications will use commercial IP network technologies running for interplanetary communications based on an open , standards - based architecture .
S- and Ka-bands are employed for both the Earth - Moon long haul links and the lunar orbit - to - surface links .
S- , K - and Ka- bands are used for primary surface - to - surface links while S - band is used for contingency voice channels .
Standards will be coordinated with other national space agencies to ensure international interoperability .
NASA said the Interplanetary Internet must be tough enough to withstand delays , disruptions and disconnections in space .
Glitches can happen when a spacecraft moves behind a planet , or when solar storms and long communication delays occur .
The delay in sending or receiving data from Mars takes between three - and - a - half to 20 minutes at the speed of light , NASA said .
Unlike TCP / IP on Earth , the DTN does not assume a continuous end - to - end connection , NASA said .
In its design , if a destination path cannot be found , the data packets are not discarded .
Instead , each network node keeps the information as long as necessary until it can communicate safely with another node .
This store - and - forward method means information does not get lost when no immediate path to the destination exists .
Eventually , the information is delivered to the end station .
For its primary mission , LRO will orbit above the moon at about 31 miles , or 50 kilometers , for one year .
The spacecraft 's instruments will help scientists compile high resolution , three - dimensional maps of the lunar surface and also survey it at many spectral wavelengths .
A series of four engine burns through June 27 will finalize LRO 's initial orbit .
During this phase , each of its seven instruments is checked out and brought online .
The satellite will explore the moon 's deepest craters , examining permanently sunlit and shadowed regions , and provide understanding of the effects of lunar radiation on humans .
LRO will return more data about the moon than any previous mission .
The LRO was launched in tandem with the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , or LCROSS which will ultimately slam into the moon on Oct.
9 . The satellite will search for water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon 's south pole .
LCROSS and its attached Centaur upper stage rocket are now in a long , looping polar orbit around Earth and the moon .
Each orbit will be roughly perpendicular to the moon 's orbit around Earth and take about 37 days to complete .
Before impact , the spacecraft and Centaur will make approximately three orbits .

Court says government background security checks go too far
In what must be one of the most hypocritical statements in recent history , former VP Dick Cheney accused president Obama of using the Justice department to launch politically motivated investigations against CIA personnel for their use of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” ( i.e. , torture ) .
This is triply hypocritical : Firstly , how can he accuse Obama of playing politics with the Justice Department ?
The Bush / Cheney administration put huge amounts of pressure on Justice Department attorneys to launch politically - motivated investigations against Democrats , and even fired nine attorneys when they refused .
Secondly , the Justice Department is launching this investigation against Obama ’s wishes .
Obama does not want to investigate the use of torture , but Attorney General Eric Holder had little choice but to investigate based on a newly released report by the CIA inspector general , which says that some investigators went too far , using techniques beyond what was authorized .
Thirdly , Cheney claims that the inspector general ’s report proves that the use of torture “ saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks “ , which is wrong .
In fact , the report casts doubts on the effectiveness of enhanced interrogation techniques , including waterboarding .
But Cheney puts the icing on the cake when he ends by saying that this “ serves as a reminder , if any were needed , of why so many Americans have doubts about this Administration ’s ability to be responsible for our nation ’s security . ”
Yes , this is from the administration that ignored all the warnings about 9/11 , and allowed the worst terrorist attack against the US to happen during their watch .
And afterwards responded by lying us into a war in Iraq , which had nothing to do with 9/11 .
UPDATE : After posting this , I heard on the radio a GOP congressman say that these CIA agents “ should be given medals ” not prosecuted for torture .
This makes me sick .
Let me be clear .
If a CIA agent was ordered to use certain “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” by his superiors , which he was told were legal by Bush ’s justice department ( even though those legal opinions were later reversed ) , then I say that we should not prosecute the agents , even if they performed what we now believe to be torture .
Instead , we can investigate and prosecute those who authorized the torture , up to and including the president .
But if a CIA agent went beyond what was authorized , no matter what their motivation , then they must be investigated .
Threatening someone with a power drill in their face , raping them , torturing their children , and other acts that we absolutely know were done are not “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” .
They are torture , they are illegal , and they are immoral .
These same congressmen who want to hand out medals would be howling for us to drop nuclear weapons on any country who did anything like this to our citizens or soldiers .
What they are saying is that our government has unilateral power to detain people without arrest , warrant , or charges , hold them indefinitely , and torture them , even kill them .
Once upon a time , some Americans accused the Soviet Union and other dictatorships of doing the same thing , and called them evil .
They applauded the demise of the Soviet Union as a victory of good over evil .
If we do n’t hold ourselves to the same standard , then we deserve no better .

The investment slump continued in Q2 ...
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Residential investment ( RI ) has been declining for 14 consecutive quarters , and the decline in Q2 was still very large - a 29.3 % annual rate in Q2 .
This puts RI as a percent of GDP at 2.4 % , by far the lowest level since WWII .
The second graph shows non-residential investment as a percent of GDP .
All areas of investment are declining .
Business investment in equipment and software was off 9.0 % ( annualized ) and has declined for 6 consecutive quarters .
Investment in non-residential structures was only off 8.9 % ( annualized ) and will probably fall sharply over the next year or so .
The third graph shows the contribution to GDP from residential investment , equipment and software , and nonresidential structures .
The graph shows the rolling 4 quarters for each investment category .
This is important to follow because residential tends to lead the economy , equipment and software is generally coincident , and nonresidential structure investment trails the economy .
Residential investment ( red ) has been a huge drag on the economy for the last three and a half years .
The good news is the drag on GDP will probably end soon .
The bad news is any rebound in residential investment will probably be small because of the huge overhang of existing inventory .
As expected , nonresidential investment - both structures ( blue ) , and equipment and software ( green ) - declined in Q2 .
If there is a surprise it is how well nonresidential investment in structures held up in Q2 ( although we could see this in the construction spending data ) .
This investment will decline sharply soon as many major projects are completed , and few new projects are started .
In previous downturns the economy recovered long before nonresidential investment in structures recovered - and that will probably be true again this time .
As always , residential investment is the most important investment area to follow - and I expect it to turn slightly positive in the second half of 2009 .
There 's nothing smart about taking a kid with epilepsy to see fireworks .
So we do it .
We stay up hours past her bedtime and explode lights in her face , like participants in a demented researcher 's clinical study .
We load her up with sugar , too , going for broke .
It 's not smart .
We 're not in this for smart .
She can be smart when she has her own kids .
But I doubt she will .
When the show starts , when the classic rock cover band stops asking us to c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon and touch them baby , when the explosions fill the sky , I watch her face .
I look for eye rolls , for locked jaws .
For tremors .
She watches the sky .
I watch her .
Her face is blue .
Red .
White .
Sparkling .
When the big ones launch , she holds her breath .
She holds it until the blast lights her face .
Twice she reaches up , fluttering her fingers between her and the sparks .
We 're close enough to the fireworks to smell them .
She never looks over at me .
I rarely look away from her .
I 've seen fireworks before .
I 've never seen them like this before .
The finale comes , wave after wave of sound and light .
She rocks up on her knees .
There 's no way this can be seen with mere sitting .
It keeps going , flashing and pounding , blasts compressing the air between us and the sky .
I watch her face .
She claps .
Her eyes stay forward .
The tremors never come .
There 's nothing smart about taking a kid with epilepsy to see fireworks .
There wo n't be next year either .
But we 're not in this for smart .
The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Monday in Los Angeles that he has ended quotas on a controversial program designed to go after illegal immigrants with outstanding deportation orders .
John Morton , a career prosecutor who took over as assistant secretary of Homeland Security in May , said during a meeting with reporters that he planned to make more changes soon .
The “ fugitive operations ” program , he said , should do what it was created to do -- target absconders who have already had their day in court .
“ The fugitive operations program needs to focus first and foremost on people who have knowingly flouted an immigration removal order and within that category , obviously , we will focus first on criminals , ” he said .
Beginning in 2003 , the immigration agency dispatched teams around the country to arrest and deport immigrants who had criminal records , who had ignored deportation orders or who had been deported and illegally reentered the United States .

Between March 1 , 2003 , and April 30 , 2009 , fugitive operations teams made more than 12,300 arrests in Los Angeles and surrounding counties .
During widely publicized sweeps , armed agents showed up at homes and apartment buildings and arrested tens of thousands of immigrants .
Immigrant rights groups have criticized the raids , saying they divided families , created fear and resulted in the arrests of people without criminal convictions or outstanding deportation orders .
A report by the Migration Policy Institute earlier this year showed that 73 % of the nearly 97,000 people arrested by immigration teams between 2003 and early 2008 did not have criminal records .
The report also showed that in 2006 the agency stopped requiring that two - thirds of those arrested be criminals and allowed the teams to include non-fugitives in their tally .
Also in 2006 , the teams were expected to increase their annual arrests from 125 to 1,000 , according to internal memos cited in the report .

Morton said Monday that there was nothing wrong with targets but that hard quotas do n’t make sense .
“ I just do n’t think that a law enforcement program should be based on a hard number that must be met , ” he said .
“ I just do n’t think that ’s a good way to go about it .
So we do n’t have quotas anymore . ”
He said , however , that he would n’t stop enforcing the law against immigrants who have fought their cases and lost .
“ I am not signaling in any way that we are not going to enforce the law against noncriminal fugitives , ” he said .
The immigration agency received $ 226 million for the program this year , up from $ 9 million in 2003 .
There are 104 fugitive operation teams nationwide , up from eight when the program started .
Eight of the teams are based locally .

Margot Mendelson , who co-wrote the Migration Policy Institute report , said that eliminating quotas was an exciting first step but that she would like to see written guidance for agents .
Without that , undocumented immigrants without criminal records or outstanding deportation orders are likely to continue being arrested during operations .
“ Although eliminating quotas is absolutely necessary , it is certainly not sufficient to bring this program in line with its congressional mandates , ” she said .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement also announced Monday that the agency had identified 10 people who died while in immigration custody and were not previously included on the official list of deaths .
The total number of deaths in agency custody since October 2003 now stands at 104 .
Morton directed his staff to review all documents and databases to ensure that deaths are being tracked .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which sued the agency to obtain documents related to deaths of immigrant detainees , said that many of the deaths were due to inadequate healthcare .

Insert a new table body , discarding the old one
Insert some number of table rows after some given row
very bad performance !
Inserting table rows after a row
Replacing a table body with a new table body
Note : html does not include the actual tbody tag , just the rows and columns .
Caveats of using these functions :
On browsers that dont support scriptEval , scripts that are inserted into the table body will not be executed upon insertion .
You will need to deal with them yourself .
I usually include them in a hidden input with a predefined ID , and then eval the value of that input after insertion .
Leading and trailing whitespace counts as a DOM node in IE , and will have weird effects if the html used in these methods contains it .
If you are in charge of creating the html you insert , make sure it doesnt have unneeded whitespace between and around nodes .
I dont know if liveQuery plugin will know about these dom modifications .
If you write lots of javascript , there will someday come a time when you need to do one of the following DOM manipulations :
This can be easily accomplished using a javascript library like jQuery , but there is a major downside to this : ( for big chunks of html ) The reason for this is that a library like jQuery must preform all sorts of checks for all sorts of corner cases , such as checking if the html you are inserting contains script blocks and running them if your browser does not support script eval ( IE6 - 7 ) .
It must clean each string before turning it into DOM objects .
For this reason , it is better to use plain javascript to write all the table manipulation functions , and make assumptions about the html you will be inserting ( so you dont have to clean it ) .
Here is a collection of such functions that i have used in production code .
They are on average 2 or 3 times faster than using jQuery for the same insert .
Example Usage : You can insert 1 or more rows this way .
Another function that I often use is a helper function for replacing the table body to be used with jQuery 's ajax functions :
July 17 , 2009 -- U.S. News & World Report has released its annual " honor roll " of America 's best medical centers , and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore is at the top of the list for the 19th straight year .
The top 21 hospitals all earned high scores in at least six of 16 specialties , ranging from cancer and geriatric care to orthopaedics and urology .
Scores were based on both objective measures -- such as mortality rates , patient safety , and other care - related factors -- and subjective measures , such as reputation .
" I think these rankings are extremely meaningful to an extremely small number of patients , relatively speaking , who represent a very small piece of the patient population but whose need for a very high quality of care is extreme , " Avery Comarow , the U.S. News & World Report statistician who compiled and analyzed the data , tells WebMD .
" These rankings are not at all intended for those who need relatively routine procedures . "

Space telescope may have glimpsed hint of mystery particles .
New data from two experiments — one in space , one on a balloon floating above Antarctica — hint at a tantalizing detection of dark matter , the mysterious stuff comprising 85 % of the universe 's matter .
The evidence is a reported excess of high - energy electrons and their antimatter counterparts , positrons , which could be created as dark matter particles annihilate or decay .
The signal from Fermi , the orbiting gamma-ray telescope , is subtle , whereas that claimed by the balloon - borne Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter ( ATIC ) is much more pronounced .
The differences are puzzling , but the findings — according to some — could herald the birth of a new age of dark matter exploration .
Fermi's true insight into dark matter may come from its gamma ray studies .
NASA
" We may very well be seeing the beginning of the discovery era , " says Dan Hooper , a theorist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois , who is not affiliated with either of the experiments .
Peter Michelson , principal investigator for the instrument on Fermi that made the detection , cautions that his group is not yet claiming to have found a smoking gun for dark matter .
The signal could also come from more mundane sources nearby , such as pulsars , the spinning remnants of supernovae .
" But if it is n't pulsars , it is some new physics , " says Michelson , of Stanford University in California .
The Fermi results were presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Denver , Colorado , on 2 May , and published this week in Physical Review Letters .
1
The ATIC results , published in Nature in November2 , are more provocative .
They show a specific spike in the energy of excess electrons between 300 and 800 gigaelectronvolts ( GeV ) , a peak that could point to the mass of any associated dark matter particle .
At first , the Fermi and ATIC results would seem incompatible , because Fermi does n't see that same sharp increase in the 300 to 800 GeV range .
With the Fermi data , " this [ ATIC result ] now seems unreasonable , " says Mark Pearce of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology and a team member on a related experiment , PAMELA ( Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ) .
But ATIC is n't backing down from its claims .
The work published in November was based on two balloon flights .
On 4 May , T. Gregory Guzik , of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , presented preliminary results from a third flight in December 2007 , made with a better detector .
The sharp peak was still there .
He is not , in any event , sure that the two results really are incompatible ; ATIC has more certainty in knowing the energy of its electrons in its sharp peak , while Fermi has trapped far more of them in building its subtle bump .
" My suspicion is that we might come down and Fermi might go up , " says Guzik .
The third experiment , PAMELA , seems more consistent with the Fermi results so far .
It has spotted a rise in the fraction of positrons , which being more rare could be a clearer signal for dark matter .
3
But PAMELA has only reported data up to energies of 100 GeV , not as high as Fermi or ATIC .
The effect of gamma rays
All of the experiments so far have probed dark matter only indirectly .
And the signal can be blurry and smeared , since electrons whizzing through space lose energy as they are whipped around by galactic magnetic fields .
One way around that problem would be to study gamma rays , which are also produced in many dark matter annihiliation and decay scenarios but are immune to magnetic fields .
So many think that Fermi scientists , who made their first dark matter claims based on electron data , will actually do the definitive work with its gamma-ray detectors , which could not only determine the mass of dark matter particles more precisely , but also determine where the signal is coming from in space .
The strongest gamma-ray signal is expected at the centre of the Milky Way , but that is also where separating the signal from confounding sources will be the most difficult .
Fermi is also looking for clumps of dark matter hovering near the plane of the Milky Way – where researchers on 3 May reported tantalizing evidence of a ' hotspot ' of gamma rays , which is likely to disappear with further scrutiny but hints at the gamma -ray findings to come .
And finally , Fermi may also turn its eyes to the galactic poles and stare off into extragalactic space , where it may find evidence for a faint web of dark matter .
This could be the most important in constraining the cosmological models that predict the growth of structure in the universe — how galaxies coalesced around initial dark matter seeds .
ADVERTISEMENT
But all of that will require at least a year 's harvest of Fermi data .
And for now , the electron data seems to be nourishing the community just fine .
By Monday , theorists had already readjusted their dark - matter models to be consistent with the new results from Fermi .
For many years , models commonly predicted that the energy of dark matter particles centered around 100 GeV .
But the new data — especially Fermi's — are favouring models that would produce particles at least an order of magnitude heavier , on the scale of teraelectronvolts .
That not only means that Fermi , with its ability to probe in that energy range , will be crucial in nailing down dark matter , but it also has implications for particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva , Switzerland .
Many at the LHC were hoping to generate a few particles in their collisions .
But the higher the mass , the harder it will be for the LHC to see them .
If the current Fermi results stand up , says Hooper , " whatever is behind dark matter will be very hard for the LHC to see . "
British embassy employee Hossein Rassam is accused of spying
European nations have strongly criticised the latest trials in Iran over the unrest that followed the disputed presidential poll .
Iranian workers at the French and British embassies and a French national were among dozens of detainees to appear in court in Tehran .
The EU presidency said action against any EU national or embassy would be seen as an act against the whole bloc .
The UK and France also spoke out against the trial .
This is the second group trial of those accused of taking part in the mass protests that erupted after the 12 June election .
Last week more than 100 people , including leading reformers , appeared in court in Tehran on charges including conspiracy .
' Spying for foreigners '
The group that appeared in court in Tehran on Saturday included reformist lawmakers and journalists , all wearing grey prison clothes .
They are accused of crimes including rioting , spying and plotting to overthrow the government .
Hossein Rassam , the most senior Iranian employee at the British embassy , stands accused of " spying for foreigners " .
Prosecutors accuse him of monitoring the riots on the ground along with two UK diplomats who have since been expelled .
An Iranian employee of the French embassy , Nazak Afshar , was also in the dock , as was 24 year - old French teacher Clotilde Reiss .
She has been charged with acting against national security by joining protests and gathering information .
Iranian state media reported that all three apologised to the court for their actions .
European nations reacted with anger .
" This is obviously a show trial directed against the EU , " Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told Reuters news agency .
The Swedish EU presidency said the trial was an act against the entire bloc .
" Actions against one EU country , citizen or embassy staff is considered an action against all of the EU , and will be treated accordingly , " it said in a statement .
British Foreign Minister David Miliband criticised what he called " unjustified charges " against a member of embassy staff " going about his legitimate duties " .
France 's Foreign Ministry described charges against Ms Reiss as " devoid of foundation " .
Ones against Nazak Afshar were " non-existent " , it said .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says it is now up to the EU whether they can agree new diplomatic measures , such as the withdrawal of ambassadors , or perhaps new financial sanctions .
At least 30 people were killed in the violence that followed the 12 June poll .
Official results gave victory to incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but the opposition says the poll was rigged .
The Iranian government has accused Western nations of fuelling the violence .
Human rights groups say the Iranian government has detained hundreds of reformers , journalists and opposition supporters since the poll .
Mr Ahmadinejad was sworn in earlier this week , but a number of top Iranian officials did not attend .
The Intel Atom 2 Processor
On March 15 , 2008 , we revealed details of Intel 's new Atom processors , based on the Diamondville and Silverthorne cores , as well as the new Centrino Atom platform .
Since then , the Intel Atoms have gone on to heights of success that belied their tiny size .
Although the likes of ARM and VIA also offer competing products that in some ways are superior to the Intel Atoms , it is the Atoms that have driven the remarkable surge in the netbook market .
Although the Intel Atom processors represent a new level of energy - efficiency ( with a TDP of just 2 - 4 W ) , the chipsets they are paired with are actually older mobile chipsets that consume a lot of power .
These chipsets , in a way , has hobbled the energy - efficiency of the Intel Atom processor .
You will recall that the current Intel Centrino Atom platform is a rather antiquated 3 - chip solution made up of the Intel Atom processor , an Intel 945 GC / GSE graphics and memory controller hub ( north bridge ) and an Intel IC7 / 7 M south bridge .
The reliance on the older mobile chipsets have resulted in a much higher power consumption than Intel would readily admit .
Take for example , the Intel Atom N270 processor which has a TDP of just 2.5 W . In contrast , the Intel 945GSE Express chipset which is often used with it has a maximum TDP of 9.3 W .
In short , the chipset consumes almost 4X more power than the Intel Atom processor .
Today , Intel shared with us some details of their forthcoming Atom 2 processor ( codenamed Pineview ) and Centrino Atom 2 platform ( codenamed Pine Trail ) .
The new platform will finally feature a simpler two - chip solution , which is more efficient and more cost - effective .
Although Intel did not give us a fixed date for the launch , they said that it will be in the market by the end of 2009 .
Let 's take a look at the preliminary details ...

Last month , the House Intelligence Committee complained that the Department of Defense has blurred the distinction between traditional intelligence collection , which is subject to intelligence committee oversight , and clandestine military operations , which are not .
Because they are labeled in a misleading manner , some DoD clandestine operations that are substantively the same as intelligence activities are evading the congressional oversight they are supposed to receive .
“ In categorizing its clandestine activities , ” the Committee said in its report on the 2010 intelligence bill , “ DoD frequently labels them as ‘ Operational Preparation of the Environment ’ ( OPE ) to distinguish particular operations as traditional military activities and not as intelligence functions .
The Committee observes , though , that overuse of the term has made the distinction all but meaningless . ”
Operational Preparation of the Environment ( OPE ) is an elusive , somewhat mysterious concept , variously described as a form of foreign intelligence collection , covert action , unconventional warfare , or a prelude to any of these .
The phrase does not appear in the otherwise comprehensive DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms ( pdf ) .
It was mentioned in passing in the 2006 Posture Statement ( pdf ) of the U.S. Special Operations Command , but not in subsequent posture statements .
Some say OPE closely resembles human intelligence collection .
OPE refers to “ the ability of Defense to get into an area and know it prior to the conduct of military operations , ” said Gen. Michael Hayden at his 2006 confirmation hearing to be Director of CIA .
“ An awful lot of those [ OPE ] activities … are not , in terms of tradecraft or other aspects , recognizably different than collecting human intelligence for a foreign intelligence purpose , ” he said .
“ They look very much the same .
Different authorities ; somewhat different purposes ; mostly indistinguishable activities . ”
From another point of view , OPE is more akin to covert action .
“ There is often not a bright line between [ covert action and ] military activities to prepare the battlefield or the environment , ” said DNI Dennis C. Blair in a written response to questions ( pdf ) about OPE in advance of his confirmation earlier this year ( pp. 15 - 16 ) .
Though it was neither intelligence collection nor covert action , “ U.S. support to and in some cases leadership of irregular resistance to Japanese forces in the Philippine archipelago [ in 1942 - 1945 ] … stands as a premier example of what military planners today call operational preparation of the environment , ” according to a historical survey of unconventional warfare in the September 2007 Irregular Warfare Joint Operating Concept ( pdf ) .
Perhaps the most extensive unclassified treatment of OPE ( then still known as “ operational preparation of the battlespace ” or OPB ) appears in a 2003 U.S. Army War College research paper , which noted that the term is “ seldom used outside of Special Operations Forces channels . ”
OPE “ consists of both pre-crisis activities ( PCA ) and , when authorized , advance force operations ( AFO ) , ” both of which are described by the author at some length .
See “ Combating Terrorism with Preparation of the Battlespace ” ( pdf ) by Michael S. Repass , U.S. Army War College , April 2003 .
Further discussion appeared in “ Leveraging Operational Preparation of the Environment in the GWOT ” ( pdf ) by Maj .
Michael T. Kenny , U.S. Army Command and General Staff College , 2006 .
OPE should be reconceived as a stand - alone mission with its own doctrine , argued another research paper .
See “ Ending the Debate : Unconventional Warfare , Foreign Internal Defense , and Why Words Matter ” ( pdf ) by D. Jones , U.S. Army Command and General Staff College , 2006 .
In any event , “ DoD has shown a propensity to apply the OPE label where the slightest nexus of a theoretical , distant military operation might one day exist , ” according to the House Intelligence Committee report last month .
“ Consequently , these activities often escape the scrutiny of the intelligence committees … .
In the future , if DoD does not meet its obligations to inform the Committee of intelligence activities , ” the House report concluded weakly , “ the Committee will consider legislative action clarifying the Department ’s obligation to do so . ”
Look at the large , member - driven organizations , he argued .
Groups such as MoveOn.org or True Majority .
They 're all in favor of efforts to address poverty , but it's not the core item on the agenda , and that 's because their constituencies fundamentally are n't poor ...
Conversely , the groups that spend a lot of time on poverty — think the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities , or Families USA — are n't member - driven .
They 're advocacy organizations , they tend to rely on foundation grants or endowments , and they tend to play a bit more of an inside Washington game , because they do n't have funding sources or a membership structure that lends itself to grass - roots pressure ...
People living just above the poverty line do n't tend to send in $ 100 when you tell them subsidies in a bill are about to be cut .
YESTERDAY Ezra Klein had a great post noting this Alec McGillis article about the fact that few politicians , even liberal ones , want to talk about poverty , and that few Americans want to hear about it .
Mr Klein summarised a conversation he'd had with a " smart social - policy advocate " about the structural reasons for this .
This is true .
But the fact that poor people do n't have the money to back membership - driven political organisations is n't the only reason there are n't more such groups .
For example , if there is one group in America today that is most like a national membership organisation of poor people , it would probably be ACORN .
ACORN got started as an alliance of Arkansas community groups in 1970 , and by the early 1990s it had 350,000 member families across the country .
Its funding does n't come from members , because they 're poor .
The funding mainly comes from SEIU , foundations , and occasionally from the government , on certain projects .
But the group has concerned itself exclusively with poor people 's issues — first welfare rights , then affordable housing , the minimum wage , and so forth .
It also conducts voter registration drives among poor people .
And we all know the rest of the story .
Over the past eight years , the Republican Party has systematically attempted to destroy ACORN with accusations of voter fraud .
The accusations are without merit .
Some of the $ 8 - an - hour voter registration workers ACORN employs sometimes fill out made - up names because they are too lazy to register real ones .
The organisation itself vets and discards these fake names to the best of its abilities ; no one has ever found a case in which anyone voted under a fake identity registered by ACORN .
In 2006 David Yglesias , the US attorney for New Mexico appointed by George Bush , refused to prosecute ACORN on these charges .
He was removed from his job after complaints by Republican party officials and lawmakers .
A cottage industry of ACORN - smearers has sprouted up across the internet , and the group 's name now evokes the same fearful loathing amongst the conservative right that organisations like the Trilateral Commission and the ACLU did in earlier eras .
It even figures in the insane blackboard charts Glenn Beck uses to try to prove that Barack Obama is a secret Communist .
I have no doubt that conservative commenters will respond to the above statements with outrage .
But the fact is that ACORN does not commit voter fraud .
The worst one can say about the group is that it is sometimes a bit astroturfy , that it ought to do more to stop lazy temps from filling out fake voter applications , and that the founder 's brother embezzled a lot of money before he was found out in 1999 .
But basically , ACORN is one of the few authentic national poor people 's groups in America .
The Republican attack against ACORN grew out of the party 's efforts to stop it from registering poor people to vote , because most poor people vote for Democrats .
And that 's what is missing from Mr Klein 's analysis .
Poor people lack a voice in American politics not just because they do not have money , but because many people who do have money do n't want poor people to have a voice in American politics .
Just try signing up a few million poor people to vote , and see what happens to you .
Boy , am I going to enjoy the comment thread to this post .

The mystery of why people swing their arms while walking rather than holding them still and rigid like the famous silly walk of John Cleese in his Monty Python sketch appears to have been solved .
An experiment involving making a group of volunteers take equally silly walks in a laboratory setting has confirmed that arm swinging makes walking more efficient and easier .
Although it may seem obvious why people swing each of their arms in opposition to their legs , scientists have puzzled over the practice for many decades because it seemed to serve no mechanical function given that the arms do not touch the ground .
One extreme theory even proposed that arm swinging while walking was hard - wired into the human nervous system and served no modern purpose because it was a vestigial relic left over from when our animal ancestors walked on all fours .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , a study based on the movements of 10 volunteers who were asked to perform a series of unnatural walks under experimental conditions has shown that swinging the arms in opposition to the legs significantly increases the efficiency of walking .
Steven Collins , a biomechanical engineer at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands , said normal arm swinging while walking requires little effort and makes it easier than keeping the arms still .
" This puts to rest the theory that arm swinging is a vestigial relic from our quadrupedal ancestors . "
In order to answer the question of why humans swing their arms while walking , Dr Collins and his colleagues set up an experiment where people were studied as they walked in a variety of poses – normally with the arms swinging in opposition to each leg , with their arms at their sides either tied or held there voluntarily , or with each arm unnaturally forced to move in synchrony with each leg .
First , the scientists found that arm swinging – either normally or abnormally – actually required very little effort from the shoulder muscles because the movements tended to arise naturally from the twisting movement of the body as it walked .
" Further , our results showed that normal arm swinging made walking much easier .
Holding the arms at one 's sides increased the effort of walking – measured by metabolic rate – by 12 per cent , which is quite a lot of walking , about the same as walking 20 per cent faster or carrying a 10 kg backpack , " Dr Collins said .
The study , published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , also found that the natural swinging motion of the arms tended to counteract the twisting motion or " torque " of the body , created by the movement of the two legs along a straight path .
Der Beamte ist sehr gründlich .
Er filzt mich penibler , als ich das vom penibelsten Flughafen - Check kenne .
In der Kleiderkammer nimmt er mir mit routinierter Freundlichkeit meine Privatsachen weg .
Er lässt mich das Handy ausschalten , zählt mein Geld , sichtet meine Aktentasche , stopft das alles zusammen in die Plastikbox Nummer 103 , die er mit der Plombe Nummer 92958 versiegelt .
Knast ist registrierte Ordnung .
Immerhin : Man ist dort keine Nummer , man hat einen Namen .
Der Beamte sagt nicht » Häftling « zu mir , er sagt » Herr Prantl « .
Trotzdem ist die Entkleidung und Neueinkleidung eine Prozedur der Selbstentfremdung .
Es ist , als lasse man seine bürgerliche Existenz in der Kleiderkammer zurück .
Neben den Zellentüren sind durchsichtige Plastikschilder an die Wand geschraubt , darunter Papierstreifen geschoben .
Auf meinem steht nicht » Nummer 103 « , sondern » Heribert Prantl « .
Im Studenten - und im Altersheim sehen die Schilder ähnlich aus ; aber es ist anders , seinen Namen neben der 15 Zentimeter dicken Stahltür zu lesen mit den vielen Riegeln und der Kostklappe .
Man steht vor der beschrifteten Gefängniszelle wie vor dem eigenen Grabstein .
» Ein Stück Tod mitten im Leben « sei die Haft , hat der Rechtsphilosoph Gustav Radbruch vor hundert Jahren geschrieben .
Der moderne Strafvollzug soll aber nicht nur ein Stück Tod sein ; er soll , so steht es im Gesetz , funktionieren wie eine Wiederauferstehung zu einem » Leben ohne Straftaten « .
Tut er das ?
Kann er das ?
Aufnahmestation , Zelle 5 : Hierher werde ich , schon in schlabbrigen Anstaltsklamotten , von zwei Beamten geführt , ich ziehe das Wägelchen mit der Gefängnis - Grundausstattung und der Gefängniswäsche hinter mir her : ein billiges Besteck ( » Messer ungehärtet « ) , ein Trinkbecher , ein Frühstücksbrettchen , ein tiefer Teller ; Zahnpasta , Zahnbürste , Einwegrasierer , ein Stück Rasierseife , ein Pinsel mit wenigen harten Borsten ; vier Paar Wollsocken , Handtuch , Geschirrhandtuch , ein abgetragener Trainingsanzug , ein Schlafanzug mit der Aufschrift » Baseball High 35 « , Bettwäsche , Wolldecke , eine blaue Latzhose ; Duschlatschen , Arbeitsschuhe , vier Unterhosen , vier Unterhemden , fein gerippt und mit dem ausgewaschenen Eindruck » JVA Oldenburg « .
Das ist meine neue Habe .
Ich bin im » Alcatraz des Nordens « , einem Männergefängnis der Hochsicherheitsstufe , 310 Häftlinge , die eine Hälfte Straf - , die andere Untersuchungsgefangene .
Außen herum eine Mauer , fast zwei Kilometer lang , sechseinhalb Meter hoch ; zwei Meter versetzt nach innen ein zweiter Zaun aus Gittergeflecht , sensorgesichert ; 220 Videokameras innen und außen .
Fluchtversuche zwecklos .
Nur kurz nach der Eröffnung der Anstalt vor neun Jahren hat es ein Betrüger geschafft ; er hatte sich an die Unterseite eines ausfahrenden Bollerwagens geklammert , so wie Odysseus an das Bauchfell eines Schafs , als er aus Polyphems Höhle entfloh .
Der geflüchtete Häftling hatte einen Beamten bestochen ; die Kollegen schämen sich heute noch .
Zwischen mir und der Freiheit liegen zwanzig Türen und Gitter .
» Spüren Sie doch einmal am eigenen Leib , wie sich das anfühlt « , hat Gefängnisdirektor Gerd Koop im November 2008 zu mir gesagt .
Da hatte ich auf der jährlichen Tagung der Gefängnisspezialisten in der Katholischen Akademie von Stapelfeld einen Vortrag gehalten ; das Thema hieß , ein wenig neckisch : » Wohin fährt der Strafvollzug ? «
Ich habe die Einladung ins Gefängnis angenommen ; nun sitze ich drin .
Keine Sonderbedingungen für Prantl , hat der Direktor sein Personal angewiesen .
Immerhin wissen die Vollzugsbeamten , dass ich nicht so richtig zu ihrer Klientel gehöre : kein Betrüger , kein Totschläger , kein Räuber , kein Drogist .
Nur Journalist – der früher drei Jahre bayeri- scher Richter , dann drei Jahre bayerischer Staatsanwalt gewesen ist .
Lesen
Sie auf der nächsten Seite , warum die ersten Tage in U - Haft die schlimmsten sind .
» Neun Jahre « – das war das höchste Urteil , das ich einst als Richter gefällt habe ; auf » 13 Jahre « lautete mein höchster Strafantrag als Staatsanwalt .
Länger als eine Stunde war ich damals , als Justizjurist , nie im Gefängnis gewesen – immer nur kurz , zu einer Anhörung , zu einer Vernehmung .
Der Richter straft , aber er kennt die Strafe nicht , die er ausspricht .
Jetzt , als Journalist , bin ich vier
Tage lang da : zunächst als unechter Häftling und dann als Praktikant , der das Vollzugspersonal bei der Arbeit begleitet .
Wenn Wände reden könnten , die Zellenwände würden reden von Resignation , Wut , Gleichgültigkeit , von Melancholie , Misstrauen , Feindseligkeit , von Angst , Hass und Hoffnung .
Gegen solche Gefühle hilft der Alarmknopf neben der Tür nicht .
Der Knopf hat zwar neulich einem Strafgefangenen das Leben gerettet , der einen Herzinfarkt hatte .
Der Knopf löst aber keinen Alarm aus , wenn ein Untersuchungshäftling sich aus seinem Bettzeug eine Schlinge dreht .
Die ersten Tage in U - Haft sind die schlimmsten .
Der Untersuchungsgefangene gilt zwar vor dem Gesetz als unschuldig .
Aber was hilft ihm das , wenn sein bisheriges Leben zusammenbricht , wenn seine Zukunft nach Gefängniskost schmeckt , wenn er nicht weiß , was aus ihm , Frau , Kind und Arbeit wird ?
Diese Gefühle lassen sich nicht auf Einladung des Gefängnisdirektors simulieren .
Gut situierte Häftlinge , solche wie ich , quälen sich mit der Frage , ob sie sich werden freikaufen können .
Meistens klappt es. Die Gefängnispopulation ist auch deswegen nicht ein Abbild der Gesellschaft , sondern ein Abbild ihrer Unterschicht .
Das Gefängnis als Ort des sozialen Lernens ?
Meine » Hütte « , wie man im Jargon sagt , riecht verqualmt : Gefängniszellen gehören zu den wenigen Orten in Deutschland , wo geraucht werden darf .
Aber die achteinhalb Quadratmeter sind viel sauberer als erwartet : gestrichener Betonfußboden , Schrank , Tisch , Pritsche , Regal , das alles nicht aus Metall , sondern aus Holz ; eine hölzerne Wandleiste gibt es zum Bilderaufhängen , Bilder direkt an die Wand zu kleben ist streng verboten – als Verstoß gegen das erste Gebot dieses Gefängnisses : » Die Anstalt muss immer sauber sein . «
Der Anstaltschef glaubt an den » unmittelbaren Zusammenhang zwischen Dreck und Aggression « .
Die Wandleiste ist allerdings voll von weißen Flecken : Man nimmt hier Zahnpasta zum Ankleben der Bilder , meist herausgerissen aus der nur noch im Knast beliebten Erotikillustrierten Coupé .
Kugelschreiber - Kritzeleien findet man auch auf der Bilderleiste : ein paar Zeichen auf Arabisch und ein ordentlich gereimter Zweizeiler auf Deutsch : » Der Papa sitzt im Zuchthaus – wie / im Hühnerstall das Federvieh « .
Ein kleiner Fernseher steht vor dem Bett , Standard bei Untersuchungsgefangenen , das mindert die Selbstmordgefahr .
In einer Ecke der Zelle führt die Tür zum abgetrennten ,
1,2 Quadratmeter kleinen Klosett mit Waschbecken .
Menschenwürde im Knast beginnt mit A – wie Abort .
Es riecht zwar etwas streng , aber es gibt fließend warmes und kaltes Wasser .
Warmwasser ist Knastkomfort , in den älteren Gefängnissen nicht vorhanden .
Die Justizvollzugsanstalt
Oldenburg ist ziemlich neu , vor neun Jahren wurde sie eröffnet , und es steckt viel Erfahrung darin : Sie ist vom Direktor und dem Personal selbst geplant worden .
16 Stationen mit jeweils 21 Haftplätzen , jede Station eine Art Wohngruppe mit Freizeitküche , jeweils etliche Stationen von einer Wachstation aus gut einsehbar .
Die alten Zuchthäuser waren Stein gewordener Irrtum .
Dieses Gefängnis ist gemauerte Reform , es ist ein Vollzugsreformhaus .
Ich lese die drei DIN - A4 - Zettel an der Innenseite meiner Zellentür , eine Art Haus - und Zellenordnung : » Sie haben die Anordnungen der Vollzugsbeamten zu befolgen , auch wenn Sie sich dadurch beschwert fühlen . «
Ich sitze in einer Zelle im Erdgeschoss , vergitterter Blick auf ein paar Masten mit Videokameras , auf vier Obstbäume und auf den martialischen , auch nach oben vergitterten » Bärenkäfig « .
Das ist der Auslauf für die zehn besonders gefährlichen Häftlinge der Sicherheitsstation , deren Zellen 23 Stunden am Tag verriegelt sind .
Ich werde eingeschlossen und bin nun froh drum .
Ich kann zwar nicht hinaus , es kann aber auch keiner von denen herein , die draußen im Gefängnishof ihre letzten Runden drehen .
In diesem Gefängnishof haben fast alle Verbrecher ihre Runden gedreht , die man aus den Zeitungen kennt : der Holzklotzmörder ; der siebenfache Mörder vom China - Restaurant in Sittensen ; der Heimleiter , der die ihm anvertrauten Kinder missbraucht hat ; der Vater von Kevin , der sein Kind verhungern ließ .
» Wegen was bist du da ? « , ruft einer mit russischem Akzent in meine Zelle .
» Sag ich nicht « , sag ich .
Am nächsten Tag , bei der Arbeit im Gefängnisbetrieb , lerne ich von Dimitri , wie man auf solche Fragen elegant antwortet .
Er sitzt für sechseinhalb Jahre .
» Wegen was ? « , frage ich ihn .
Er grinst : » Ohne Ticket gefahren . «
Dimitri hat internationale Knasterfahrung , er kennt die russischen Gefängnisse .
» Kein Vergleich « , sagt er , » eher Sport hier . «
Es klopft und rappelt an der Tür. Jemand hält ein Tablett mit dem Abendessen herein : drei Scheiben Brot , drei Scheiben Käse und zwei Scheiben Wurst .
Dazu werden eine Packung Frühstücksmargarine gereicht , Marke Goldquelle , und 250 Gramm Marmelade Sauerkirsch extra , » fruchtige Qualität aus Mecklenburg « .
Wie lange soll ich damit haushalten ?
Bevor ich fragen kann , ist die Tür schon wieder zu .
Es wird Nacht , aber nicht richtig dunkel ; das Licht vom Gefängnishof ist gleißend .
Es hebt jetzt ein merkwürdiges Nachtleben an : Es klopft , hämmert , gluckert , es blubbert und furzt .
Raue Rufe hallen über den Hof , von Gitterfenster zu Gitterfenster , Wortfetzen in Türkruss - arabischdeutsch .
Meine Zelle ist eine schützende Wabe .
Lesen Sie auf der nächsten Seite : Geiselnahme – das ist die heimliche , die verdrängte Angst des Personals .
Um halb sieben beginnt die Arbeit .
Strafgefangene müssen , Untersuchungsgefangene können arbeiten ; die zehn Häftlinge der Sicherheitsstation dürfen nicht .
Ich komme in eine Halle mit langen Werkbänken : Eine Firma von draußen lässt hier Kabelbäume zusammenbauen , Stecker fürs Auto löten , Kleinteile für Pipelines montieren ; an die sechzig Mann werkeln heute , es herrscht irritierend ruhige Geschäftigkeit .
Mir schießt eine schauerliche Geschichte aus der JVA Uelzen durch den Kopf : Vor neun Jahren nahm dort ein Häftling , der Küchendienst hatte , das größte Messer – er schnitt damit dem Gefängnisdirektor , der das Mittagessen vorkostete , die Kehle durch und erstach dann den Küchenchef .
Sicherheit im Knast ist immer prekäre Sicherheit , auch in der besten Anstalt .
Ich wäre lieber in die Tischlerei gekommen ; aber die ist das Revier der Langzeithäftlinge , an den Fräs - und Sägemaschinen stehen ein paar hundert Jahre .
Auch nicht schlecht wäre die gehobene Bastel - atmosphäre der Schlosserei gewesen , wo der praktischste Grill hergestellt wird , den ich je gesehen habe .
Die Ausbruchfantasien der Gefangenen sind in das » Modell Oldenburg « umgeleitet worden .
800 Vorbestellungen , der Verkaufsschlager der JVA , dank einer wunderbaren Höhenverstellung für das Grillgut .
Aber ich bin zum Löten von kleinen Schaltern eingeteilt , das Soll liegt bei 1200 Stück am Tag , die Endabnahme ist streng , meine Brille hinderlich .
Der Vorarbeiter – Räuber ?
Mörder ?
Betrüger ?
– weist mich bedächtig ein .
Ich bin kein Meister des Lötkolbens , aber der Nebenmann , gefährliche Körperverletzung , erbarmt sich meiner mit freundlichem Akzent ; ich produziere trotzdem nur Ausschuss .
Das sei ganz normal , sagt mein Gegenüber , wegen Drogen in U - Haft .
Er selbst habe eine gute Woche gebraucht , bis seine Arbeit brauchbar war .
Die Arbeit bringt durchschnittlich elf Euro am Tag – bei sehr sorgfältiger Produktion .
Das ist wenig , aber besser als nichts .
Drei Siebtel davon , an die 70 Euro pro Monat , dürfen für Einkäufe ausgegeben werden ; der Rest dient als Rücklage , zur Schuldentilgung und für die Opferentschädigung .
Ich habe das Gefühl , dass ich es auch nach zwei Wochen hier mit meiner Hände Arbeit nur auf 50 Cent täglich bringen würde .
An der Decke über den Arbeitsplätzen lugen , wie fast überall in der Anstalt , Kamera - Augen .
Die Sicherheitszentrale passt auf , dass nicht nebenbei Gerätschaften produziert oder geklaut werden , die für eine Geiselnahme taugen .
( Soeben hat im bayerischen Straubing ein verurteilter Gefangener die Psychologin in seine Gewalt gebracht : Der Vergewaltiger war irgendwie an ein Messer gekommen . )
Geiselnahme – das ist die heimliche , die verdrängte Angst des Personals .
Dagegen helfen Zellenkontrollen , Leibesvisitation und der » Sicherheitsblick « , den sich Vollzugsbeamte und Sozialarbeiter angewöhnt haben .
Wenn sie jeden
Tag mit schlotternden Knien zur Arbeit kämen , könnten sie hier nicht arbeiten .
» Ich habe mehr Angst , wenn ich abends mit dem Fahrrad durch Oldenburg nach Hause fahre « , sagt Nikola Framme , eine selbstbewusste junge Frau , studierte Diplomverwaltungswirtin , Vollzugsabteilungsleiterin , Frauenbeauftragte im Gefängnis .
Fast ein Drittel des Personals im
Männerknast ist weiblich .
Das hat den
Ton und das Klima verändert in der Anstalt .
Die Männer stehen nicht mehr im Unterhemd auf dem Flur .
Und dass er seine » Bremsstreifen « im Klo wegbürsten soll , das lässt sich auch der Hartgesottenste von einer Frau nicht gern sagen .
» Anmache « gibt es angeblich kaum .
Nikola Frammes Arbeit beginnt , wenn sie sich den » Tauchergürtel « umbindet .
So nennt man das Koppel , an dem das JVA - Equipment hängt – dazu gehört tagsüber , wenn die meisten Zellen offen sind , keine Schusswaffe ( » wäre viel zu gefährlich « ) , dazu gehört kein Schlagstock ( » würde nur provozieren « ) ; da hängen nur die vielen großen Schlüssel mit dem Doppelbart ; und da hängt vor allem das kleine schwarze Gerät mit dem roten Alarmknopf .
Sechsmal wurde im vergangenen Jahr Hauptalarm ausgelöst , Raufereien unter den Gefangenen zumeist .
Dann sind binnen drei Minuten ein halbes Dutzend Vollzugsbeamte da ; Kampfsportnaturen , die das aber nicht raushängen lassen .
Der Sicherheitsbeamte Ralf Klein erinnert sich , wie er angefangen hat : » Ich stand da wie John Wayne , durfte aber nicht John Wayne sein . «
Es habe lange gedauert , bis er wirklich begriffen hatte , dass es im Haftalltag nicht darum geht , Kraft zu demonstrieren , sondern darum , mit den Gefangenen ins Gespräch zu kommen .
Die Vollzugsbeamten , die Abteilungsleiterinnen zumal , suchen den richtigen
Ton wie mit einer Stimmgabel : freundlich - zugewandt , rustikal - mahnend , aber nie kumpelig .
Im Vollzug herrscht zwar ein besonderes Gewaltverhältnis , aber das muss der Staat den Gefangenen gegenüber nicht dadurch demonstrieren , dass er sich selbst gewalttätig aufführt .
Vor dreißig Jahren hat Anstaltschef Koop als junger Beamter erlebt , wie eine tobende Frau von den Kollegen an den Haaren in den » Sauerkrautkeller « geschleift , geschlagen und getreten wurde .
Demütigung erzeugt Hass ; Hass erzeugt Straftaten .
Anstalten , die wie ein Brutkasten für Straftaten funktionieren – und die gibt es immer noch – , müssten daher als gemeingefährlich geschlossen werden .
Lesen
Sie auf der nächsten Seite , wie in der JVA Oldenburg eine liberale und zugleich konsequente Haltung praktiziert wird .
Der Sauerkrautkeller von früher heißt heute » BGH « – nicht » Bundesgerichtshof « , sondern » Besonders gesicherter Haftraum « : eine geflieste Großzelle , in der Mitte eine Matte ; ein roter Punkt markiert die Stelle , wo der Kopf liegen soll ; im Boden verankert die Fesseln .
Um zu gewährleisten , dass dieser BGH wirklich nur im extremen Ausnahmefall eingesetzt wird , hat Direktor Koop den » Händchenhalte - Erlass « ausgegeben :
Es muss ständig ein Beamter neben dem gefesselten Häftling sitzen .
Das verhindert , dass ein Häftling » vergessen « wird .
» Manche Leute draußen glauben ja , wir sollten die Gefangenen in der Haft besonders quälen « , sagt Koop .
» Aber : Das hilft keinem Opfer . «
Nur sechsmal Hauptalarm pro Jahr – das ist sehr wenig für ein Gefängnis , das ( wegen der Untersuchungshäftlinge ) auch eine Art Umschlagbahnhof ist .
Das hat mit der verblüffend einfachen , aber klugen Vollzugsphilosophie des Gerd Koop zu tun : » Liberal und konsequent « , heißt sie .
In vielen Gefängnissen ist es so , dass sich die Gefangenen die Vergünstigungen erst im Laufe der Zeit durch Wohlverhalten verdienen : den Aufschluss , also die Öffnung der Zellen tagsüber ; das Telefonieren in der Telefonzelle ; Radio und Fernseher in der Zelle , das absperrbare Fach im Kühlschrank auf der Stationsküche .
In der JVA Oldenburg gibt es all diese Vergünstigungen von Anfang an .
Das ist das Liberale .
Und all diese Vergünstigungen fallen sofort weg , wenn etwas vorkommt – zum Beispiel Drogenrückstände im Urin .
Das ist das Konsequente .
In dieses System gehört auch die Sauberkeit : Die Zellenübergabe wird zelebriert wie eine Wohnungsübergabe .
Der Gefangene hat das Recht , jeden Mangel zu rügen und beseitigen zu lassen .
Das ist das Liberale .
Jede Beschädigung der Zelle wird ihm vom Lohn abgezogen .
Das ist das Konsequente .
Vollzugsplankonferenz – ich bin als » Praktikant « dabei .
Vollzugsplankonferenz ist im Knast das , was in der Welt draußen » Mitarbeitergespräch « heißt .
Hier im Knast reden die zuständigen Sozialarbeiter , Vollzugsbeamten und Psychologen erst über den Gefangenen , dann mit ihm ; und ich bin erstaunt , mit welcher Gründlichkeit dies geschieht .
Noch erstaunter bin ich darüber , mit welcher Sprache der Totschläger mit der gebrochenen Nase , der in der Haft neben der Arbeit eine Realschulausbildung macht , über sich spricht : » Schön , dass Sie sich für mich interessieren « , beginnt er das Gespräch und fährt dann fort , dass er » wieder mehr ich « sein und » den geraden Weg gehen « will .
Es sind die Sozialarbeiter - und Psychologenphrasen , die er da übernommen hat .
Seine Betreuer leugnen das nicht , geben aber zu bedenken , dass dieser Mann zum ersten Mal über sich und seine Probleme reden kann – er hat die Sprache dafür gelernt wie eine Fremdsprache .
Die sogenannte Resozialisierung hat so oft mit » Re « nichts zu tun , viele Häftlinge waren nie sozialisiert .
Und bei anderen ist die sogenannte Resozialisierung der Versuch , die weitere Desozialisierung zu verhindern .
» Wärter « sagt man landläufig zum Gefängnispersonal .
Das ist nicht nur beleidigend , das ist auch grundfalsch .
Im Gefängnis arbeiten keine Wärter , sondern Leute mit souveräner Leidenschaft und hoher Frustrationsschwelle .
Leute , für die ein
Tag gut ist , weil der renitente Gefangene sich endlich ein » guten Morgen « abquetscht .
Hier im Gefängnis findet man einen Direktor , der begeistert ist , wenn er Häftlinge vom geschlossenen in den offenen Vollzug übergeben kann .
Gerd Koop ist ein Haft - Manager ( kein Jurist , sondern Sozialarbeiter mit Management - Ausbildung ) , der das Gefängnis als » Brücke ins Leben « betrachtet .
Auf dieser Brücke steht er wie ein kleiner Franz von Assisi und spricht mit missionarischer Inbrunst .
Er ersteigert eine Augenarztpraxis bei Ebay und staffiert eine Arrestzelle damit aus ( die Gefangenen brauchen dann nicht in die Stadt » ausgeführt « zu werden , das ist riskant und teuer ) ; er baut für eine Million eine neue Tischlereihalle ( die Gefängnisprodukte sollen auf dem Markt bestehen können ) ; er macht aus dem offenen Vollzug
der Gefängnisaußenstelle Wilhelmshaven ein Resozialisierungs -Schmuckstück .
Das alles funktioniert auch deswegen , weil die Gefängnisse in Niedersachsen » budgetiert « sind ; das heißt :
Sie können finanziell weitgehend selbstständig arbeiten .
Das beflügelt , das bringt einen neuen Geist in die Gefängnisse .
Wenn Vollzugsbeamte gut sind , behandeln sie die Häftlinge als Staatsbürger hinter Gittern .
Die allermeisten Gefangenen bleiben nicht ewig Gefangene .
Morgen sind sie wieder unsere Nachbarn .
Diese Erkenntnis kann Gefängnisse verändern .

• Watercooler - worthy bits Marijuana use and reckless driving are interconnected , say Canadian researchers .
" We observed that dangerous driving behaviors are interrelated .
Individuals scoring high on impulsivity or sensation - seeking scales demonstrated an elevated risk of driving under the influence of cannabis , " study senior author Jacques Bergeron , a professor in the department of psychology at the Universite de Montreal , said in a school news release .
BETTER LIFE : Testicular cancer linked to marijuana use " To our knowledge , this is the first study to investigate the association between driving under the influence of cannabis and a wide range of dangerous driving behaviors . "
Bergeron and colleagues asked 83 men , aged 17 to 49 , about their driving history and observed them in driving simulators .
Men were chosen for the study because they more often engage in dangerous driving and driving under the influence of marijuana , the researchers explained .
They found that 35 % of the participants had been involved in one or more road crashes with material damage in the previous three years .
Thirty percent admitted to using marijuana , and 80 % of those said they drove under the influence of marijuana at least once in the previous year .
" Our study found that men with self - reported DUIC ( driving under the influence of cannabis ) tend to be associated with an increased risk of being involved in a car accident , " study author Isabelle Richer , a doctoral candidate in the psychology department , said in the news release .

In a softy of an interview today Fox News host Neil Cavuto sat down with his boss News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch .
Cavuto asked his boss about allegations that Fox News is n’t fair and balanced .
Murdoch said people love us because we are fair and balanced .
My question is why do you love or hate Fox News .
Here is the video from Think Progress :

Cavuto asked Murdock about fair and balanced , and the boss maintained his favorite lie , “ If we were n’t fair and balanced , we would n’t have the number one network in news — by a very wide margin .
People believe we ’re fair and balanced , and they love us . ”
However , if FNC is so fair and balanced why are all of their hosts sympathetic to the Republican cause ?
Fox
News does not feature a single liberal host .
This does n’t seem either fair or balanced .
It has been proven over and over again that FNC is the mouthpiece of the GOP , and in my mind there is nothing wrong with that .
MSNBC is the home of the Democrats and there is nothing wrong with that either .
I contend that FNC ’s dominance of the ratings is not an indication of their balance , but it is a reflection of their business model .
While CNN and MSNBC split non conservative viewership , Fox News has the market cornered on conservative news and commentary .
It is a brilliant business model .
I think Murdoch loves the fair and balanced claim because it drives the people who hate FNC crazy .
Personally , I do n’t love or hate Fox News or MSNBC .
Because I am a liberal , MSNBC suits my tastes , but I satisfy my jones for a newscast with BBC America or PBS .
In my opinion , both FNC and MSNBC are entertainment networks that talk about politics .
I am capable of getting just as tired of Olbermann ’s bluster as I am of O’Reilly’s .
One of the things I have noticed since I started writing about cable news and politics is that viewers tend to project and extrapolate their beliefs about the state of our country based on which cable news network is doing well in the ratings .
The cable news networks play a huge role in American politics , and people do feel strongly about them , so my question is why do love or hate Fox News , MSNBC , or CNN ?
Despite the popularity of music downloads and streaming , music fans still seem to love an old standby : the CD .
A new survey conducted in the UK by The Leading Question and Music Ally Speakerbox has found that music customers of all ages still prefer the CD to downloading , a pattern that extends into the lucrative teenage demographic .
That 's not to say online offerings are n't important , though — those who use subscription or streaming services tend to buy more CDs than others , so online music discovery is clearly helping to keep those sales alive .
The firms conducted a thousand face - to - face interviews with UK music lovers between the ages of 14 and 64 , all of whom have broadband connections .
Seventy - three percent of the group reported being happier buying CDs than downloading , with 66 percent of those between the ages of 14 and 18 being among that group .
Over half ( 59 percent ) reported listening to CDs every day .
All those CDs that go for spins every day may not represent purchases , however .
According to the report , CD burning is the number one " sharing activity " ( at 23 percent ) , ranking above " bluetoothing " and filesharing ( 18 and 17 percent , respectively ) .
This is the same info that was mentioned in The Leading Question 's file sharing report from earlier this week —
P2P use appears to be down among all ages in the UK , but ripping and burning CDs remains popular .
That 's probably because it 's still one of the easiest ways to get high - quality rips of music without the hassle of DRM .
You can never rely on those P2P folks to rip anything the right way , much less label it correctly .
Still , subscription and music streaming services are apparently doing their part to help people decide which music ( CD or otherwise ) to buy .
According to The Leading Question 's research , those who pay for a subscription service such as Napster spend more on CDs than the average music buyer ( �16.87 per month , compared to � 11.37 ) .
The same applies to people who listen to streaming music — those people spend � 12.17 per month on CDs and � 7.02 per month on downloads , compared to � 3.81 per month spent on downloads by the average music fan .
" While we fully expect that digital will eventually replace most physical consumption , this is not a clear cut replacement cycle like the change from vinyl to CD .
It ’s particularly encouraging that those who are listening to streamed music on their computers are actually buying more music on both CDs and downloads than the average music fan , " Music Ally CEO Paul Brindley said in a statement .
" This suggests that digital can and is being used as a way of sampling new music which users may then go on to purchase . "
This much we already knew — it 's precisely what makes music pirates some of the biggest buyers of music .
Being able to " sample " music before committing to a purchase has always been the go - to way to hook music lovers .
In this case , it 's clear that whatever life CDs still have left , it 's being prolonged in part due to the proliferation of online music offerings .
With fewer and fewer people buying CDs these days and iTunes becoming the number one music retailer in the US , though , the CD 's golden days are certainly behind it , even if music fans are still turning to their ( home - burned ) physical discs .
By Robert Samuelson - July 13 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
The question that President Obama ought to be asking -- that we all should be asking -- is this :
How big a government do we want ?
Without anyone much noticing , our national government is on the verge of a permanent expansion that would endure long after the present economic crisis has ( presumably ) passed and that would exceed anything ever experienced in peacetime .
This expansion may not be good for us , but we are not contemplating the adverse consequences or how we might minimize them .
We face an unprecedented collision between Americans ' desire for more government services and their almost - equal unwillingness to be taxed .
The conflict is obscured and deferred by today 's depressed economy , which has given license to all manner of emergency programs , but its dimensions can not be doubted .
A new report from the Congressional Budget Office ( " The Long - Term Budget Outlook " ) makes that crystal clear .
The easiest way to measure the size of government is to compare the federal budget to the overall economy , or gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
The CBO 's estimates are daunting .
For the past half - century , federal spending has averaged about 20 percent of GDP , federal taxes about 18 percent of GDP , and the budget deficit 2 percent of GDP .
The CBO 's projection for 2020 -- which assumes the economy has returned to " full employment " -- puts spending at 26 percent of GDP , taxes at a bit less than 19 percent of GDP , and a deficit above 7 percent of GDP .
Future spending and deficit figures continue to grow .
What this means is that balancing the budget in 2020 would require a tax increase of almost 50 percent from the last half - century 's average .
Remember , that average was 18 percent of GDP .
To get from there to 26 percent of GDP ( spending in 2020 ) would require another 8 percent of GDP in taxes .
In today 's dollars , that would be about $ 1.1 trillion , a 44 percent annual tax increase .
Even these figures may be optimistic , because CBO 's projections for defense and " nondefense discretionary " spending may be unrealistically low .
This last category covers much of what government does : environmental regulation , aid to education , highway construction , law enforcement , homeland security .
Whatever the case , the major causes of the budget blowout are well - known : an aging population and rapid increases in health spending .
In 2000 , Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid -- the main programs providing income and health care for the 65 and over population -- totaled nearly 8 percent of GDP .
In 2020 , CBO projects that will reach almost 12 percent of GDP .
But the deeper source of our predicament is a self - indulgent political culture that avoids a rigorous discussion of government 's role .
Everyone favors benefits and opposes burdens ( taxes ) .
Republicans want to cut taxes without cutting spending .
Democrats want to increase spending without increasing taxes , except on the rich .
The differences between the parties are shades of gray .
Hardly anyone asks the hard questions of who does n't need benefits , which programs are expendable and what taxes might cover remaining deficits .
What long sustained this system was falling defense spending and routine , though usually modest , deficits .
As defense declined -- from 9 percent of GDP in the late 1960s to 3 percent in 2000 -- social spending could rise without big tax increases .
Deficits provided extra leeway .
But these expedients have exhausted themselves .
Deficits have risen to alarming proportions ; in a risky world , defense cannot drop indefinitely .
Obama would make matters worse .
He talks about controlling " entitlement " spending ( mainly Social Security and Medicare ) but has n't done so .
He 's proposing just the opposite .
His health care proposal would increase federal spending .
He says he will " pay for " the added outlays with tax increases or other spending cuts , but what people forget is that every penny of this " payment " could be used ( and should be ) to close the existing long - term deficit -- not raise future spending and taxes .
The latest excuse for avoidance is the economic crisis .
True , deep spending cuts or big tax increases would be undesirable now ; they would further depress an already depressed economy .
But that does n't preclude action .
Changes could be legislated now that would begin later and be phased in -- a gradual increase in eligibility ages for Social Security and Medicare ; gradual increases in energy taxes ; gradual elimination of some programs .
Such steps might improve confidence by reducing uncertainty about huge budget deficits .
There is little appetite for any of this , and so we face the consequences of much bigger government .
Certainly higher taxes for future Americans .
Probably a less robust economy .
The CBO notes that elevated deficits would penalize saving , investment and income , while unprecedented tax burdens could " slow the growth of the economy , making the ( government 's ) spending burden harder to bear . "
To such warnings , Americans ' collective response is :
Go away .
Whether they 're an " elaborate " hoax or not , one thing is absolutely certain : the Flat Earth Society forums are fucking crap .
Why does it always seem like reality is n't crazy enough for my tastes ?
* punches face * Welcome to Earth .
Ah , the clock argument .
Works every time .
You hear that Japan ?
Stop imagining things .

My photo story which exposes the illegal wildlife trade taking place on both sides of the Burma - China border was published in The Guardian newspaper today .
http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/-sp-endangered-species-on-sale-along-burmachina-border
They used eleven of my photos in their Environment section .
Here 's the full set .
Illegal Wildlife Trade in Mong La , Shan State Special Region Four , Burma
MONG LA , SHAN STATE SPECIAL REGION FOUR , BURMA - The town of Mong La in Burma 's Shan state , close to the border with China , is at the crossroads of illegal wildlife trade routes that are sucking the forests , jungles and plains of India , Burma , Laos and Thailand dry of their native animals and plants – many of them endangered .
Mong
La is a notorious sin city of a border town , a lawless black hole where the trafficking of arms , drugs and women is rife .
In order to reach it , you have to travel illegally by motorbike across an international border , along a bumpy dirt track that winds its way through rubber plantations and leafy jungle .
It takes around 20 minutes , and along the way you pass impromptu checkpoints set up by local people , ethnic militia and the National Democratic Alliance army , before finally being admitted by Burmese government troops .
I spent the day exploring the illegal wildlife markets and restaurants , but it was only after exiting Burma in the late afternoon that I realised that the real story was to be found on the Chinese side of the border .
At the market in Mong La , a Noah 's ark of endangered animal products can be bought , including tiger skins , thick chunks of elephant hide and tusks , pangolin scales , clouded leopard pelts , flying squirrels , masked palmed civet cat , Asiatic moon bear skins , and Tibetan antelope skulls .
For example a tiger skin for sale in Mong La can be bought for around RMB50,000 ( £ 4,700 ) .
But over the border in China , that same skin can fetch upwards of RMB200,000 ( £ 18,900 ) .
Many of those same items were also available in the Chinese border town of Daluo , but marked up significantly .
The illegal wildlife trade in Burma is nothing new .
For decades , NGOs and governments have known the Burmese border regions with China are a problem area .
[ Elephant hide . ]
[ Pangolin scales . ]
[ Masked palm civet , sold as bushmeat . ]
[ A giant flying squirrel and green pigeons .
Both endangered . ]
[ Flying squirrel . ]
[ Ivory for sale . ]
[ Blocks of ivory for sale as investment . ]
[ Tiger claws made of ivory , with Burmese and Thai currency notes . ]
[ A general view of the town of Mong La . ]
[ Asiatic black bear , with clouded leaopard cat . ]
[ A monkey for sale as a menu item at a wildlife restaurant in Mong La . ]
Illegal Wildlife Trade in Daluo , Yunnan Province , China
DALUO , YUNNAN PROVINCE , CHINA - What 's not known , however , is how a thriving illegal market in the body parts of critically endangered species for Chinese medicine can flourish within just a few metres from China 's official border crossing with Burma – on the Chinese side .
[ Tourist guides offer tours of the " Golden Triangle Scenic Area " , just in front of the Chinese border post at Daluo . ]
[ Pangolin scales . ]
The inconvenience and risk of getting to Mong La has prompted this parallel market in illegal wildlife trade products to spring up , catering to disappointed tourists who may feel comfortable buying illegal wildlife products , but are averse to evading the China government 's formalities of immigration and customs checks .
[ Fake tiger claw , bear gall bladder and sex pills . ]
The Chinese government has for decades has been a friend and ally of the ethnic militias along its Burmese border .
But since the opening up of Burma , and the arrival of a more open government , China 's traditional support for those militias has waned , and so now China is supporting the official Burmese government in Naypiydaw .
[ Fake tiger paw . ]
[ Bear bile , bear gall bladder ( top ) and elephant skin for sale in Daluo . ]
This shift has seen Mong La dropped from the list of designated tourist destinations approved by the tourism bureau of the Chinese province that borders Burma , Yunnan .
Consequently , disappointed tourists headed to Mong La are being turned back at the border , and instead some of them make do with the market in Daluo to buy their illegal wildlife products .
[ Slow loris feet key rings . ]
One trader in Daluo , who refused to give her name , said : “ If the police come , we just hide these things .
As long as [ these illegal wildlife parts ] are not on public view it is OK .
We just put it all back out for sale when the police have gone . ”
ALEX HOFFORD : BURMA CHINA BORDER ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE PHOTOJOURNALIST
Working from my home office is nice , even when the babies are pounding on the door screaming , but sometimes I really miss random hallway chatter .
The sense of folks around ... stopping by your office and saying " hey , I was in the neighborhood . "
Chris Sells is in the same boat .
For a while we tried to build robots and even lash laptops to the top of Roomba Vacuums .
We 've tabled those ideas with concerns over security and battery life .
Instead , Phil ( in Washington ) and I ( in Oregon ) are trying an experiment .
I 'm going to be his office mate for a little while .
We 've each setup dedicated machines in our respective offices with inexpensive but high - res web - cams on each monitor .
We 'll keep them going during work hours so folks can stop by 42/3839 ( his office number ) and say hello .
Certainly we 'll mute it here and there when appropriate , for privacy .
How To Make It Less Creepy
Here are some important points to make , although it might be obvious to you , they were n't initially .
We dedicated a machine / camera each to this exercise , rather than using our existing machines .
This is important because it reinforces the " Portal " aspect .
This is an appliance , a hole in space , not my main , or even secondary computer .
, rather than using our existing machines .
This is important because it reinforces the " Portal " aspect .
This is an appliance , a hole in space , not my main , or even secondary computer .
The cameras do n't point at our faces .
Because that would be creepy .
If he 's my cube - mate , when I look over , I should see the side of his head .
In both cases we set it up so we have to push our chairs back and turn our heads to see the other person .
Just like a cubicle .
Steps to Making a Portal
We 're using Skype for this example , but you can use your favorite Video Calling software , of course .
We 're NOT using Office Communicator because our machines are not on the domain and they are very locked down .
Single - purpose appliances , really .
First , we setup local users , not administrators on each machine .
We did n't domain - join the machines , and we set the users to only be allowed to run Skype using Windows 7 Family Controls .
Second , we made two Skype Users , for example PortalDude1 and PortalDude2 .
On each desktop we made a new shortcut in the format callto :// PortalDude1 and callto:// PortalDude2 and set the icons to be large .
This way if the connection is dropped , anyone can stop by and start it .
Third , each user should add the other to their contact list and have only one contact .
Fourth , next , go into Skype Options and into Privacy .
Set the options such that these are true :
" Only allow people who are in my contact list to contact me "
and
" Automatically answer calls from people who are in my Contact List "
and finally , and most importantly :
" Automatically Send Video "
These are the magic three options .
With this setup , your will have one contact , you , and when you call each other the call will be auto - answered and the video will start .
Also , be sure to change your Power Options to make sure the machine does n't fall asleep !
If you have a fast machine and good bandwidth you 'll get 640x480 ( DVD quality - ish ) although congestion on the network and make this quality level come and go .
We 're still experimenting with me being VPN 'ed in or not and if it improves the portal .

I want DNA test ( just to be sure I really am the father ) demands Jude Law
Jude Law is to demand a DNA test to check he is the father of a pregnant model 's child .
The actor has vowed to stand by Samantha Burke if she is carrying his baby , but has apparently told friends he wants to be ' 100 per cent certain ' that the child is his .
His demands for a paternity test have angered the American model 's family , who insist he is the father and said his behaviour was not up to the standards of an ' English gentleman ' .
Who 's the daddy : Jude Law has wants model Samantha Burke , seen here at her parent 's Florida home , to take a paternity test to prove she is carrying his child
Miss Burke 's grandmother said he had taken advantage of the ' young , innocent and silly girl ' whose father had ' read him the riot act ' .
Delores Burke said : ' To say this family is mad at that man is an understatement .
' He has behaved as less than a gentleman .
My son Denis is hopping mad .
He feels that Jude Law took advantage of his little girl . '
The paternity test could be carried out while Miss Burke , 24 , is pregnant but carries a risk of harming the baby or even bringing on early labour .
Fling : Jude Law , pictured last night after a performance of Hamlet , met Samantha while filming Sherlock Holmes in New York
Instead Miss Burke , who is seven months pregnant , has told relatives the DNA tests will be carried out once the baby , said to be a girl , is born .
Reports last week suggested that Law , 36 , would not insist on a paternity test and Miss Burke 's lawyers released a statement saying he had been ' nothing but supportive ' .
But he was said to have told friends that he was not certain he was the father of the child , whose mother has already named her Sophia .
A friend told the News of the World : ' At the moment Jude does n't know for sure he is the father .
He thinks he is - but he wants to be 100 per cent certain .
There has been a lot of speculation .
But if it is his baby girl he 'll be there for her every step of the way . '
Model behaviour : Samantha 's grandmother spoken out against Jude saying he took advantage of the 24 - year - old
Miss Burke 's lawyers have indicated that she wants a sizeable payout from Law , including a percentage of his future earnings .
He makes around £ 3 million a movie and such a deal , which would cost him millions , could be a factor in his apparent change of heart over the DNA test .
He has already paid a £ 6 million lump sum to his ex-wife Sadie Frost , the mother of his three children .
Miss Burke , who is staying with her mother Lea in Pensacola , Florida , was said to have told Law about their child in a letter within the past month .
The pair had a brief fling in New York last December while he was on location during the filming of his latest movie , Sherlock Holmes .
Unveiled : Samantha Burke appeared with her attorney on Saturday at her mother 's home in Pensacola , Florida , with her bump bulging
Law was reported to have told Miss Frost , 44 , that he only slept with the model once after a drunken party .
He said last week that he ' intends to be a fully supportive part of the child 's life ' , but Delores Burke said he had not been in contact with her granddaughter .
Mrs Burke , 80 , of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , said the relationship between the model and Law had lasted a fortnight before he returned to Britain and ' dumped her cold ' .
She added : ' She has n't heard from him at all . '
Law 's spokesman refused to comment on the paternity testing .
Miss Burke last night attempted to distance herself from her grandmother 's outspoken attack on Law .
In a statement , she said : ' Samantha , her mom , and her family can affirm that Jude has been responsive and supportive throughout the relationship and pregnancy , and know that he will remain so as a father once Baby Sophia is born .
' Jude and Samantha remain committed to the health and well - being of this child . '

Um , no they do n't .
As , I have written Obama 's numbers are in decline because of Democrats and Independents due to unclarity of the health care issue , not because of Republicans .
Also , note in every poll the Republican Party has not gained anything due to their attacks on Obama .
In fact , I believe that the more the public sees many undertones , overtly racist rhetoric from the GOP , people do n't want to be bothered with that party .
So , while Obama 's numbers are in decline , what is the Republican Party offering to the public ?
NOTHING .
The public does not believe anything coming from the Republican Party on health care reform .
Believe me , the country knows they do n't want it .

U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. is poised to appoint a criminal prosecutor to investigate alleged CIA abuses committed during the interrogation of terrorism suspects , current and former U.S. government officials said .
A senior Justice Department official said that Holder envisioned an inquiry that would be narrow in scope , focusing on “ whether people went beyond the techniques that were authorized ” in Bush administration memos that liberally interpreted anti-torture laws .
Current and former CIA and Justice Department officials who have firsthand knowledge of the interrogation files contend that criminal convictions will be difficult to obtain because the quality of evidence is poor and the legal underpinnings have never been tested .
Some cases have not previously been disclosed , including an instance in which a CIA operative brought a gun into an interrogation booth to force a detainee to talk , officials said .
Advertisement
Other potentially criminal abuses have already come to light , including the waterboarding of prisoners in excess of Justice Department guidelines , and the deaths of detainees in CIA custody in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 .
Opening a criminal investigation is something Holder “ has come reluctantly to consider , ” the Justice Department official said , emphasizing that Holder had not reached a final decision but noting that , “ as attorney general , he has the obligation to follow the law . ”
Others familiar with Holder ’s thinking say that such an investigation seems all but certain , and that a prosecutor will probably be selected from a short list that Holder asked subordinates to assemble .
Such a prosecutor would examine cases that are generally at least five years old , and probably some that were previously reviewed by career prosecutors who concluded that they could not be pursued .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t blame them for wanting to look into it , ” said a former high - ranking Justice Department official familiar with the details of the program .
“ But if they appoint a special prosecutor , it would ultimately be unsuccessful , and it would go on forever and cause enormous collateral damage on the way to getting that unsuccessful result . ”
Bracing for the worst , a small number of CIA officials have put off plans to retire or leave the agency so that they can maintain their access to classified files and be in a better position to defend against a Justice investigation .
“ Once you ’re out , it gets a lot harder , ” said a retired CIA official who said he had spoken recently with former colleagues .
The inquiry would probably also target private contractors who worked for the CIA during the interrogations .
Current and former U.S. officials interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy that still surrounds Holder ’s deliberations and the details of the interrogation files .

President Obama has repeatedly expressed reluctance to launch a criminal investigation of the interrogation program , but has left room for the prosecution of individuals who may have broken the law .
Obama and Holder have both said that they believe waterboarding constitutes torture .
But an investigation would pose thorny political problems for the administration , and probably draw criticism over questions of fairness .
“ An investigation that focuses only on low - ranking operators would be , I think , worse than doing nothing at all , ” said Tom Malinowski , Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch .
An inquiry also would probably drive a new wedge between the CIA and the Justice Department , agencies with a fractious history that have struggled to work more closely together since the Sept. 11 attacks .

Holder ’s interest in appointing a prosecutor to mount an investigation reportedly surged after he recently read a still - classified 2004 report by the CIA ’s inspector general citing extensive problems and abuses in the agency ’s interrogation program .
The bulk of the report is expected to be released this month .
Former CIA officials said the most disturbing section deals with waterboarding , a technique in which prisoners are made to feel they are drowning .
The Justice Department authorized waterboarding in an August 2002 memo that contained a caveat that could prove crucial to any criminal investigation .
Although it allowed the approved methods to be “ used more than once , ” the memo stipulated that “ repetition will not be substantial because the techniques generally lose their effectiveness after several repetitions . ”
One passage of the CIA report declassified this year said that the method had been used “ at least 83 times during August 2002 " on Abu Zubaydah , the first senior Al Qaeda figure captured by the agency .
Waterboarding was then employed “ 183 times during March 2003 " on Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the self - proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks .
Advertisement
The inspector general also voiced alarm over how much water was being used .
Rather than dripping liquid from a canteen , as the 2002 memo envisioned , CIA interrogators “ applied large volumes of water , ” raising questions about whether the method “ was either efficacious or medically safe . ”
Because of such documented discrepancies , Justice Department officials and legal experts regard the waterboarding abuses as cases that hold the most promise for prosecution .
Even so , the cases are hampered by legal and logistical complications .
The U.S. anti-torture statute requires proving that an interrogator “ specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering ” -- a daunting legal threshold .

Officials said it was n’t clear that any CIA interrogators were ever informed of the limits laid out in the Justice Department memo .
“ A number of people could say honestly , correctly , ‘ I did n’t know what was in it , ’ ” said a former senior U.S. intelligence official familiar with the inner workings of the interrogation program .
The CIA report also cites cases in which interrogators engaged in potentially illegal improvisations .
One interrogator brandished a gun , former CIA officials said .
Other prisoners were reportedly threatened with bodily harm , including being buried alive .
Agency spokesman Paul Gimigliano said that the CIA cooperated extensively in “ referring actions for potential prosecution , and in dealing with career prosecutors who decided if and when specific cases would be pursued in court . ”

To date , only one case has been .
In 2007 , a CIA paramilitary contractor , David A. Passaro , was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of using a flashlight to beat an Afghan detainee who later died .
In addition to the sweeping 2004 document , former CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson , who recently retired , also produced a dozen or more follow - up reports that could motivate the Justice Department investigation .
Among them are examinations of other cases that involved prisoners ’ deaths while in agency custody .
In 2002 , an Afghan prisoner died of hypothermia after being stripped , doused with water and left overnight in a frigid CIA lockup near Kabul , the Afghan capital .

One CIA officer faced internal sanctions over the episode , but the undercover operative in charge of the facility was later promoted to chief of station in Baghdad , former CIA officials said .
A year later , an Iraqi prisoner died of asphyxiation after being captured in a raid by Navy SEALS and then having his arms chained behind his back in a CIA interrogation cell at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad .
The leader of the SEAL team was later acquitted of criminal charges .
The CIA interrogator , Mark Swanner , has not faced prosecution .
The two cases are believed to have been among 19 examined by a Justice Department task force set up in Alexandria , Va. , in 2004 to investigate possible CIA abuses .
The panel did not investigate the use of waterboarding .

Former Justice officials familiar with the effort said that 17 of the cases were rejected by mid-2006 .
It is not clear what became of the other two .
Official cited a host of problems , including difficulty locating witnesses and identifying documents -- such as clinical examinations or autopsies -- that could withstand scrutiny in federal court .
“ We wanted to make these cases , ” said a former Justice official familiar with the matter .
“ We looked at them as hard as we could , and they just were n’t there .
“ They were n’t there because of the way they were investigated , because of the facts , because of the lack of witnesses and evidence . ”

A report details a secret visit to North Korea by a high - level Burmese delegation last year .
Pictures were taken showing military sites and signing ceremonies .
BANGKOK — A leaked report purportedly drafted by authorities in Burma ’s military government describes a top - secret visit to North Korea late last year by Burma 's top brass , during which the two sides pledged to significantly expand cooperation in military training and arms production .
The 37 - page report in Burmese claims to contain details of a Nov. 22-29 visit to North Korea by 17 Burmese officials , billed as a goodwill visit to China and reportedly led by Gen.
Thura Shwe Mann , Burma 's third - ranked leader and armed forces chief of staff .
It also contains 118 photos said to have been taken in North Korea and 64 said to have been taken in China , from where the group was said to have traveled to North Korea .
The two countries will cooperate to modernize military arms and equipment and will exchange experiences on such matters . "
Burmese report
Photographs in the report show a Burmese delegation in uniform in China but in civilian clothing in North Korea , suggesting a bid to keep the visit to North Korea low - profile .
Exile Burmese media have voiced alarm in recent days at reports of growing ties between Burma and nuclear - armed North Korea , both highly reclusive pariah states targeted by international sanctions , and have warned that this warming relationship indicates Burma 's own nuclear ambitions .
The report is titled “ Report of the High - Level Burmese Military delegation led by SPDC member and Military Chief General Thura Shwe Mann to the DPRK [ Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ] and the PRC [ People 's Republic of China ] from Nov. 21 - Dec. 2 , 2008 . ”
SPDC , denoting the State Peace and Development Council , is the Burmese junta 's formal name .
The report says the delegation left Burma ’s remote new capital , Naypyidaw , on a special aircraft Nov. 21 at the invitation of Chinese Defense Ministry Central Commission member and armed forces Chief of Staff Gen.
Chen Bingde and North Korean Defense Ministry Chief of General Staff Gen. Kim Kyok Sik .
The report was transmitted to RFA 's Burmese service through a knowledgeable source in Burma 's former capital , Rangoon .
Out in the cold
The report surfaced just as both regimes find themselves farther out in the wilderness than ever before .
North Korea recently launched a long - range missile over Japan and conducted a second nuclear test , prompting a new round of U.N. sanctions and an international outcry , even from longtime allies in Moscow and Beijing .
It test - fired four short - range missiles on Tuesday .
Burma has meanwhile brought a bizarre criminal case to trial against detained opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and renewed a military offensive against ethnic rebels in the east , forcing thousands to seek refuge in Thailand .
Over the last week , U.S. officials tracked a North Korean ship , the Kang Nam I , suspected of heading toward Burma with illicit weapons on board in violation of new U.N. sanctions .
The ship turned around and headed back north on Sunday .
The Bangkok - based Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner , an authority on North Korea , said the report may have been fabricated and leaked to discredit the Burmese exile press .
But he added that it could also indicate “ there are people within the military establishment not very happy with its cooperation with North Korea . ”
If the latter is true , “ They leaked the information in order to make it known to the international community , especially the U.N. Security Council , which has imposed sanctions on new North Korea arm exports , ” Lintner said .
Htay Aung , a researcher at the Thai - based Burmese opposition group Network for Democracy and Development , said he believed the report was authentic , and either sold by mid- to low - level officers or leaked by opponents of cooperation with Pyongyang .
The latter group “ seems unhappy with projects to equip the military with costly weapons and technologies as the country goes deeper into poverty , ” Htay Aung said .
Aim to modernize
The stated aim of the visit was “ to modernize the Burmese military and increase its capabilities through visiting and studying the militaries ” of China and North Korea .
The group reportedly included Gen. Thura Shwe Mann , Lt. Gen. Myint Hlaing ( anti- air defense chief ) , Maj. General Hla Htay Win ( training ) , Maj. General Khin Aung Myint ( air force ) , Maj. General Thein Htay ( vice chief of staff , ordnance ) , Maj. Gen. Mya Win ( munitions ) , Brig .
Gen. Hla Myint ( tanks ) , Brig .
Gen. Kyaw Nyunt ( military communications ) , Brig .
Gen. Nyan Tun ( engineering ) , and staff officers .
After signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the North Korean side on Nov. 27 , according to the report , the Burmese delegation deemed the visit a success .
The report concludes :
" 1 . The two militaries will cooperate in the teaching and training of military science .
The Burmese military will focus on studying special forces training , military security training , training in tunnel warfare , air defense training , and language training for both countries .
2 . The two militaries will cooperate in the building of tunnels for aircraft and ships as well as other underground military installations .
The two countries will cooperate to modernize military arms and equipment and will exchange experiences on such matters .
As such , the objective and aim of the high - level visit is deemed to be successful . "
The report makes reference to several appendices that are omitted from the text obtained by RFA .
Outings and visits
A detailed account in the report includes discussions with North Korean Chief of General Staff Gen. Kim Kyok Sik , visits to weapons and radar factories , and a missile launch site .
About one - quarter of the report is devoted to comparing the Chinese and North Korean militaries .
It makes no specific mention of any actual or planned military purchases .
The report says the Burmese delegation was shown North Korean surface - to - air missiles and rockets , along with naval and air defense systems and tunnel construction , including how Pyongyang stores aircraft and ships underground to protect them from aerial attack .
It also describes a Nov. 23 visit to North Korea ’s National Air Defense Control Center and a Nov. 24 visit to a North Korean naval unit in Nampo .
Subsequent outings included tours of an armored division of the North Korean Aerial Defense Corps , the AA Weapons & Rockets Factory , and three underground missile factories , according to the report .
North Korean officials also showed the Burmese delegation the USS Pueblo warship , seized by North Korea in 1968 and now docked in the North Korean capital , Pyongyang .
The tour included visits to Pyongyang and to Myohyang , where the government has dug secret tunnels to store jet aircraft , missiles , tanks , and weapons .
The delegation also visited a Scud tactical ballistic missile factory outside Pyongyang , the report said .
Pyongyang has since the 1980s been a major supplier of Scud missiles to Iran , Egypt , and Syria .
Market for North Korea
Another recent report by Lintner , the Swedish journalist , claims that North Korean engineers have been actively building a vast network of underground tunnels in Burma .
Lintner , author of Blood Brothers : The Criminal Underworld of Asia and Great Leader , Dear Leader : Demystifying North Korea under the Kim Clan , reported that the Burmese junta began tunnel construction with North Korean assistance as early as 2005 , when the country 's capital was moved to Naypyidaw from Rangoon .
Lintner said he regards the report as further evidence of deepening ties between Burma and North Korea , with China — unwilling to sell arms to Burma for fear of alienating major powers — now playing the role of broker .
North Korea is likely looking for new arms buyers now that its arms sales to Libya and Pakistan have dried up , he said .
“ North Korea has a lot of things to offer , and they are willing to sell anyone who can pay for it , ” Lintner said .
“ They are looking for a new customer .
And Burma seems to be the perfect one . ”

US prosecutors have filed sexual assault charges against four boys aged nine to 14 , alleging they brutally attacked an eight - year - old girl in Phoenix , Arizona , after luring her to a shed with chewing gum .
Police said the girl 's parents criticised her , blaming her for bringing shame on the family .
All five children are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia .
The boys held the girl down while they took turns assaulting her , police said .
" She was brutally sexually assaulted for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes , " police Sergeant Andy Hill said , calling it one of the worst cases the department had investigated .
The 14 - year - old boy was charged on Wednesday as an adult with two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping , the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office said .
He is being held without bond .
When it comes to the First Amendment , Team Obama believes in Global Chilling .
Cass Sunstein , a Harvard Law professor who has been appointed to a shadowy post that will grant him powers that are merely mind - boggling , explicitly supports using the courts to impose a “ chilling effect ” on speech that might hurt someone ’s feelings .
He thinks that the bloggers have been rampaging out of control and that new laws need to be written to corral them .
Advance copies of Sunstein ’s new book , “ On Rumors : How Falsehoods Spread , Why We Believe Them , What Can Be Done , ” have gone out to reviewers ahead of its September publication date , but considering the prominence with which Sunstein is about to be endowed , his worrying views are fair game now .
Sunstein is President Obama ’s choice to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs .
It ’s the bland titles that should scare you the most .
“ Although obscure , ” reported the Wall Street Journal , “ the post wields outsize power .
It oversees regulations throughout the government , from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
Obama aides have said the job will be crucial as the new administration overhauls financial - services regulations , attempts to pass universal health care and tries to forge a new approach to controlling emissions of greenhouse gases . ”
Sunstein was appointed , no doubt , off the success of “ Nudge , ” his previous book , which suggests that government ought to gently force people to be better human beings .
Czar is too mild a world for what Sunstein is about to become .
How about “ regulator in chief ” ?
How about “ lawgiver ” ?
He is Obama ’s Obama .
In “ On Rumors , ” Sunstein reviews how views get cemented in one camp even when people are presented with persuasive evidence to the contrary .
He worries that we are headed for a future in which “ people ’s beliefs are a product of social networks working as echo chambers in which false rumors spread like wildfire . ”
That future , though , is already here , according to Sunstein .
“ We hardly need to imagine a world , however , in which people and institutions are being harmed by the rapid spread of damaging falsehoods via the Internet , ” he writes .
“ We live in that world .
What might be done to reduce the harm ? ”
Sunstein questions the current libel standard – which requires proving “ actual malice ” against those who write about public figures , including celebrities .
Mere “ negligence ” is n’t libelous , but Sunstein wonders , “ Is it so important to provide breathing space for damaging falsehoods about entertainers ? ”
Celeb rags , get ready to hire more lawyers .
Sunstein also believes that – whether you ’re a blogger , The New York Times or a Web hosting service – you should be held responsible even for what your commenters say .
Currently you ’re immune under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .
“ Reasonable people , ” he says , “ might object that this is not the right rule , ” though he admits that imposing liability for commenters on service providers would be “ a considerable burden . ”
But who cares about a burden when insults are being bandied about ?
“ A ‘ chilling effect ’ on those who would spread destructive falsehoods can be an excellent idea , ” he says .
“ As we have seen , ” Sunstein writes , having shown us no such thing , “ falsehoods can undermine democracy itself . ”
What Sunstein means by that sentence is pretty clear :
He does n’t like so - called false rumors about his longtime University of Chicago friend and colleague , Barack Obama .
He alludes on page 3 ( and on page 13 , and 14 , and 45 , and 54 – the book is only 87 pages ) to the supposedly insidious lie that “ Barack Obama pals around with terrorists . ”
Since Sunstein intends to impose his Big Chill on such talk , I ’d better get this in while I can .
The “ rumor , ” i.e. , “ fact , ” about the palsy - walsiness of Obama and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers ( Ayers referred to Obama as a “ family friend ” in a memoir ) did not “ undermine democracy , ” i.e. , prevent Obama ’s election .
The facts got out , voters weighed them and ruled that they were n’t disqualifying .
Sunstein calls for a “ notice and take down ” law that would require bloggers and service providers to “ take down falsehoods upon notice , ” even those made by commenters – but without apparent penalty .
Consider how well this nudge would work .
You blog about Obama - Ayers .
You get a letter claiming that your facts are wrong so you should remove your post .
You refuse .
If , after a court proceeding proves simply that you are wrong ( but not that you committed libel , which when a public figure is the target is almost impossible ) , you lose , the penalty is . . . you must take down your post .
How long would it take for a court to sort out the truth ?
Sasha and Malia will be running for president by then .
Nobody will care anymore .
But it will give politicians the ability to tie up their online critics in court .
Sunstein , trying to fair , argues that libel awards should be capped at $ 15,000 , or at least limited for anyone demonstrating financial hardship .
But $ 15 K is the limit you ’d pay to your opponent .
The legal bill is the scary part , and the reason bloggers already have plenty of reason to be careful about what they say , even if they do n’t much fear a libel conviction .
Sunstein dreams of an impossibly virtuous America : “ We could also imagine a future in which those who spread false rumors are categorized as such , discounted and marginalized . . . people would approach rumors skeptically even they provide comfort and fit their own biases . ”
But if his chilling wind does n’t work , Sunstein may try to make good on the implicit threat that runs through his book : that he would redefine libel as the spread of false information and hold everyone up the ladder responsible .
If this happened , the blogosphere would turn into Pluto overnight .
Comments sections would slam shut .
Every writer would work on a leash shorter than a shoelace .
Sunstein is an enemy to every news organization and blogger .
We should return the favor and declare war on him .

Military develops flying hummingbird spy cameras
Reseachers have recently unveiled a small robot that looks like a hummingbird and flies like a hummingbird , but is sure a hell of lot more expensive than a hummingbird .
Darpa , one of the technology arms of the Pentagon , has just recently given AeroVironment , the makers of the hummingbird drone , a hefty $ 2.1 million to continue development of the hummingbird spy cam .
The current model can stay aloft for about 20 - seconds at a time .
It ’s a small timeframe , but it does validate the possibility of constructing robots themed for nature that can actually serve functions that can be useful in tight situations .
Like , well , spying .
Darpa ultimately wants “ an approximately 10 - gram aircraft that can hover for extended periods , can fly at forward speeds up to 10 meters per second , can withstand 2.5 - meter - per - second wind gusts . ”
The little bugger should also be operable indoors , and from up to a kilometer away .
Visualizing the Fourth Dimension Using Color
But what about dimension 8 ½ ?
Color can be used for more than exploring special relativity .
Assigning color to every point on a surface is a way to envision higher dimensions .
Let 's start with a simple example : a disc with concentric colors .
If we map hue to height linearly , the result is a cone .
We get a cone because we chose a linear mapping .
If we 'd picked a different mapping , we would have gotten another shape , such as a hemisphere .
More exotic mappings are possible .
A more interesting example is a shape that intersects itself , such as the figure eight on the left below .
Again , identify each hue with a different height .
A shape will intersect itself only if it contains two points which have both the same three - dimensional position and the same color .
In this case , the bluer the region , the further it is below the plane containing the figure ; the redder it is , the higher it is above the same plane .
It 's as if we pulled the red parts of the figure up while pulling the blue parts down .
The resulting figure shows that the shape can be embedded in a three - dimensional space without self - intersection .
( In the illustrations , I 've given the figures some thickness to make self - intersections more obvious . )
This technique is particularly handy when dealing with knots .
For example , the planar trefoil knot on the left can be embedded in 3D space without self - intersection , as shown in the second illustration .
Unknotting a Knot Using Four Dimensions
This mental tool really starts to shine when we kick everything up a dimension .
Rather than measuring depth in three - dimensional space , color will now measure depth in four - dimensional space .
With this , we can perform a neat trick : if we embed a knot in a space with four physical dimensions , we can undo it without cutting .
The trick is to move a loop of it " around " another loop in a direction perpendicular to our 3D directions .
( The 4D directions are called ana and kata , and they 're analogous to the familiar left / right , up / down , and forward / back directions of 3D space . )
To us , moving in the ana or kata direction will appear as changing color .
Taking again the trefoil knot , let white indicate a point in our 3D space .
The deeper green the point , the further it is in 4D space ( in the ana direction ) from our 3D space .
The first step in undoing the knot is to lift a loop in the ana direction .
To us , the loop turns green .
Next , pull the now - 4D ( green ) loop through another part of the knot still in ( white ) 3D space .
Remember , the green and white parts of the knot occupy different locations in four - dimensional space , so they do n't intersect each other .
Finally , move the loop in the kata direction to return it to our 3D space .
( The green loop becomes white again . )
Voilà : what was a knot is now an unknotted closed loop .
What would we see if you watched this happen in real life ?
Since we can't see anything outside our 3D slice of 4D space , from our perspective the moving ( green ) loop would disappear , to reappear later in the unknotted position .
By the way , this technique works for all knotted closed loops .
Any knotted closed loop can be unknotted by embedding it in 4D space .
Color and Complex Surfaces
Employing color to indicate 4D depth may be most useful when envisioning surfaces that can't be embedded in 3D space without self - intersection .
The simplest example is the Klein bottle , a closed surface with only one side ( unlike , say , a sphere 's surface , which has an inside and an outside ) .
Using color to distinguish four - dimensional depth makes clear how a Klein bottle can exist in four dimensions without self - intersection .
The era of the huge conglomerate is over . *
Illustration : Andy Gilmore *
As the Internet was taking shape in the late 1980s , an MIT professor named Tom Malone started thinking about how it could change the structure of industries .
In a series of papers , he predicted that the big top - down companies of the 20th century would soon " decentralize and externalize " into industry ecosystems .
" Imagine an AT&T that breaks up into not two or three different companies but two or three hundred thousand different companies , " Malone told Wired in a July 1998 interview .
" This sort of voluntary , radical disaggregation is an attractive alternative for some large organizations . "
It simply stood to reason : Huge vertically integrated conglomerates were created to minimize what economist Ronald Coase called transaction costs between teams and up and down the supply chain .
Now distributed - information networks would do the same outside the walls of a single company .
The Web would be globalization taken to the extreme .
Projects would be open to the best of breed anywhere , creating virtual flash firms of suppliers and workers that would come together for one product and then re-form for another .
" Small pieces , loosely joined " was the mantra .
But out in the reality of the world 's great industries , the opposite seemed to happen .
Corporations just kept getting bigger .
On Wall Street , Goldman Sachs was pulling in almost $ 90 billion a year , tripling annual revenue in less than a decade .
The pharmaceutical industry consolidated through hundreds of mergers and acquisitions .
The Fortune 10 , which today includes Wal - Mart and General Electric , more than tripled in size since 1990 .
And AT&T , far from breaking up into 300,000 different companies , became even bigger than before and , once again — at least for iPhone users — a monopoly .
And then last September it all came toppling down .
Those big financial firms turned out to have been inflated by debt at levels never before seen ( and hopefully never repeated ) .
The big car companies crashed head - on into skyrocketing oil prices and plummeting consumer demand .
Big Pharma ran out of blockbusters .
Wal - Mart kept closing stores , while GE tried to sell off divisions .
( OK , AT&T is still an iPhone monopoly , but give it time ! )
So now , in the graveyard of giants , it 's worth asking : Was Malone right ?
Was his age of nimble mammals simply delayed by the final march of corporate dinosaurs into the tar pits ?
This crisis is not just the trough of a cycle but the end of an era .
We will come out not just wiser but different .
What we have discovered over the past nine months are growing diseconomies of scale .
Bigger firms are harder to run on cash flow alone , so they need more debt ( oops ! ) .
Bigger companies have to place bigger bets but have less and less control over distribution and competition in an increasingly diverse marketplace .
Those bets get riskier and the payoffs lower .
And as Wall Street firms are learning , bigger companies are going to get more regulated , limiting their flexibility .
The stars of finance are fleeing for smaller firms ; it 's the only place they can imagine getting anything interesting done .
As venture capitalist Paul Graham put it , " It turns out the rule ' large and disciplined organizations win' needs to have a qualification appended : 'at games that change slowly . '
No one knew till change reached a sufficient speed . "
The result is that the next new economy , the one rising from the ashes of this latest meltdown , will favor the small .
Take Detroit .
The only way for the Big Three to survive , Charles C. Mann writes in " Beyond Detroit " , is to harness the innovation of the myriad startups working on automotive technology .
Or take Google .
As Steven Levy explores in " The Secrets of Googlenomics " , the company deploys a bottom - up model for ad sales , dictated not by firm handshakes but by hard math .
Or even society at large .
A century ago , mass collective action could be organized only by the state .
Now we have the Web.
Kevin Kelly resurrects socialism — without the state — in " The New Socialism " .
To all the usual reasons why small companies have an advantage , from nimbleness to risk - taking , add these new ones :
The rise of cloud computing means that young firms no longer have to buy their own IT equipment , which helps them avoid having to raise money or take on debt .
Likewise , the webification of the supply chain in many industries , from electronics to apparel , means that even the tiniest companies can now order globally , just like the giants .
In the same way a musician with just a laptop and some gumption can accomplish most of what a record label does , an ambitious engineer can invent and produce a gadget with little more than that same laptop .
" Involuntary entrepreneurship " is now creating tens of thousands of small businesses and a huge market of contract and freelance labor .
Many will take full - time jobs again once they become available , but many others will choose not to .
The crisis may have turned our economy into small pieces , loosely joined , but it will be the collective action of millions of workers hungry for change that keeps it that way .

David Laibson : Tweak Human Behavior to Fix the Economy
The New Yorker magazine has an article on hemispherectomies – surgical procedures which remove half of the cortex , usually in an attempt to cure otherwise life - threating epilepsy .
These operations are usually carried out on children , as remarkably , those in their early years can often develop normal adult skills and abilities if surgery is carried out early enough .
For example , a 2001 book by Antonio Battro ( sample chapter : pdf ) describes a three year old boy named ‘ Nico ’ who had the whole of his right hemisphere removed to control life - threatening epilepsy .
Nevertheless , he has developed with very little impairment and has turned out to be a bright and engaging child , despite the fact that a similar operation in adults would be profoundly disabling .
The New Yorker article charts the development of this procedure from the first operation on a human in 1923 , to the latest in neurosurgical technology and practice .
Two of the pioneers of the procedure , Dr John Freeman and Dr Ben Carson are also featured , who explain how the team at John Hopkins first tackled a left hemispherectomy .
Potentially hazardous , because the left side of the cortex has the majority of the language function in most people .
The article also introduces us to some of the patients who have had the procedure .
Christina now drives , graduated from high - school and is studying at university , despite on having only one hemisphere of her brain left .
