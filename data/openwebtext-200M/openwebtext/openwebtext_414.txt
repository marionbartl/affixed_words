ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
The top State Department officials responsible for the alliance with Pakistan met leaders of the new government on Tuesday , and received what amounted to a public dressing - down from one of them , as well as the first direct indication that the United States relationship with Pakistan would have to change .
On the day that the new prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gillani , was sworn in , Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte and the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs , Richard A. Boucher , also met with the Pakistani president , Pervez Musharraf , whom they had embraced as their partner in the campaign against terrorism over the past seven years but whose power is quickly ebbing .
The leader of the second biggest party in the new Parliament , Nawaz Sharif , said after meeting the two American diplomats that it was unacceptable that Pakistan had become a “ killing field . ”
“ If America wants to see itself clean of terrorists , we also want that our villages and towns should not be bombed , ” he said at a news conference here .
Mr. Sharif , a former prime minister , added he was unable to give Mr. Negroponte “ a commitment ” on fighting terrorism .
There may be a pandemic , but you do n’t have to give up outdoor movies–or at least not entirely .
Clever pop -up series have shifted from crowding parks with viewers on picnic blankets to setting up massive parking - lot screens inspired by classic American drive - in movie theaters .
Sure , the logistics will be a little more challenging , but these pop -up drive - in movie series might just be the biggest entertainment events of the season .
American Legion Post 43 in Hollywood is establishing this 30 - car drive - in with plans to show films seven days a week .
The theater is set up with a state of the art 4 K projection system–under the loving care of the Hollywood Legion Theater ’s chief projectionist–and there are plans to screen 35 mm analog film , beloved by cinephiles , in the future .

Opera is complaining to the European Commission that Microsoft is continuing to abuse its dominant position by tying its browser to its operating system and by not following web protocols .
Jon von Tetzchner , CEO of Opera , said : " We are filing this complaint on behalf of all consumers who are tired of having a monopolist make choices for them . "
Opera is calling on the European Competition Commission to instigate two remedies on the software giant .
Firstly , it wants Microsoft to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows or to include another , alternative browser .
Secondly it asks the Commission to ensure Microsoft to follow open Web standards :
The complaint calls on Microsoft to adhere to its own public pronouncements to support these standards , instead of stifling them with its notorious ' Embrace , Extend and Extinguish ' strategy .
Microsoft 's unilateral control over standards in some markets creates a de facto standard that is more costly to support , harder to maintain , and technologically inferior and that can even expose users to security risks .
Microsoft in October accepted defeat over an earlier Commission action , which found it guilty of abusing its monopoly position with regards to tying of its media player with its operating system and interoperability of work group servers .
The software giant chose not to appeal the decision .

Marine scientists led by Dr. Lothar Stramma from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences ( IFM - GEOMAR ) in Kiel , Germany say they have made an alarming new discovery - in some regions of the world oceans , oxygen essential for marine organisms is declining .
The new study documents that the oxygen values in tropical oceans at a depth of 300 to 700 meters have declined during the past 50 years .
As large marine organisms can either no longer exist in these areas or they would avoid them , the expanding oxygen minimum zones may have substantial biological and economical consequences .
The oxygen distribution in the ocean is not homogenous .
At the eastern boundaries of the tropical oceans at depths between 200 and 800 metres , there are areas with reduced oxygen , the so - called oxygen minimum zones ( OMZ ) .
Rising CO2 levels are causing a temperature increase of the ocean and a general decline of oxygen solubility in the water .
Atlantic ocean oxygen distribution plus time - depth section of oxygen distribution in the eastern tropical Atlantic ocean .
A reduction of oxygen - rich deep water production in polar regions also leads to a reduced oxygen supply in the deep ocean .
The expected impacts on subtropical and subpolar regions are larger than in the Tropics .
In higher latitudes , the reduction of oxygen has already been proven by observational data .
In the Tropics , this was not possible to date due to the lack of sufficient observational data .
An international team of researchers - Stramma , Dr. Gregory Johnson NOAA , Seattle , Dr. Janet Sprintall from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and Dr. Volker Mohrholz from the Institute for Baltic Sea Research in Warnemünde , Germany - selected areas with higher data density to document the decline in oxygen .
“ We found the largest reduction in a depth of 300 - 700 m in the tropical northeast Atlantic , whereas the changes in the eastern Indian Ocean were much less pronounced ” , explains Dr. Stramma .
“ Whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved ” , Stramma continues .
The reduction in oxygen may also be caused by natural processes on shorter time scales ”
Nevertheless , the results are consistent with model results which predict a further decline in the future .
If this trend continues , it will be of particular importance for the tropical regions investigated in this study , because the oxygen concentrations are quite low and a further reduction may lead to existential problems for marine organisms and to changing biogeochemical conditions .
The results of this study are an important milestone for the ongoing work of the new Collaborative Research Centre ( SFB 754 ) “ Climate – Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean ” funded by the German Research Foundation , which started its first phase in January 2008 in close cooperation with the University of Kiel .
The SFB aims to better define the interactions between climate and biogeochemistry on a quantitative basis .

George Packer , who ’s blogging now at The New Yorker website , has a post this week about Kentucky — Inez , Kentucky , specifically , the small town where Lyndon Johnson announced the War on Poverty more than 40 years ago and where John McCain made a campaign stop last week .
Packer ’s point is how Democrats can and cannot appeal to the working class and rural white voters we ’ve been discussing so much for the last two months .
But the background of the piece is just how readily many white Kentuckians admit that they simply wo n’t vote for a black man for president .
“ I ’ve talked to people–a woman who was chair of county elections last year , she said she would n’t vote for a black man , ” J.K. Patrick told Packer .
And he wo n’t either .
“ I really do n’t want an African - American as President … I thought about it .
I think he would put too many minorities in positions over the white race .
That ’s my opinion .
After 1964 , you saw what the South did …
There ’s a lot of white people that just would n’t vote for a colored person .
Especially older people . ”
With frankness like this , it was probably no accident that it was Kentucky Rep. Geoff Davis ( R - KY ) who got in trouble two weeks ago for calling Obama “ that boy ” at a GOP party dinner in his home district — a comment for which he later apologized .
And the pattern Packer is as observable statistically as it is anecdotally , where I ’ve been noting it for a month or more .
SurveyUSA has conducted three polls of the primary race in Kentucky over the last month .
In each Hillary Clinton beats Obama by roughly a 2 - 1 margin .
That in itself I do not think tells us that much on the topic of racialized voting .
Each candidate has states where they greatly outpoll the other , though that is a steep margin .
Where the contrast becomes stark is in the match ups against McCain .
Again , we need to rely exclusively on polls from SurveyUSA .
Each sounding shows Clinton losing to John McCain .
That ’s not surprising since Kentucky is a strongly Republican state , though in mid-April , the most recent poll , she was in a statistical tie with him — 48 % - 46 % .
But while Clinton is competitive , McCain beats Obama by a 2 to 1 margins — 63 % to 29 % in the poll taken last week .
I do n’t know any state where either Democrat runs that much better than the other .
And I think the conclusion that race is the primary factor in the difference is inescapable .
Kentucky itself is n’t that big a deal since it will almost certainly go Republican in November .
But it will be a big win for Clinton later this month .
And you only need to look at a map to see that Kentucky makes up the southern border of Ohio and Indiana .
CHICAGO  James A. Johnson , the consummate Washington insider whom Senator Barack Obama tapped to head his vice - presidential search effort , resigned abruptly on Wednesday to try to silence a growing furor over his business activities .
Mr. Johnson ’s departure deprives Mr. Obama of decades of experience and access to Washington ’s power elite .
Mr. Johnson has been a fixture in Washington political and legal circles for three decades , and he led the vice - presidential search team for Senator John Kerry , the Democrats ’ presidential nominee in 2004 .
His resignation , at the start of a general election contest in which the candidates have pledged to run issue - based campaigns , came after days of intense scrutiny from the news media and attacks from Senator John McCain and Republican Party officials over mortgages Mr. Johnson , a former chief executive of Fannie Mae , received on favorable terms from the Countrywide Financial Corporation , the mortgage company that was a central player in the subprime lending crisis .
Mr. Johnson also faced questions about his role on compensation committees that awarded large payouts to corporate executives .
His resignation highlights the difficulties for Mr. Obama ’s campaign in trying to live up to his promises to remain independent of the Washington establishment and the special interests that populate it .
MOSCOW ( AP )  A Russian news agency says the crew of the Soyuz capsule that landed in Kazakhstan this weekend after an unexpectedly severe descent was in serious danger .
Interfax quotes an unnamed space official as saying that the capsule entered the atmosphere improperly , with the hatch first , instead of with heat shields leading the way .
RELATED ARTICLE : South Korean astronaut describes scary return to Earth
The official says the hatch suffered significant damage .
The official also says the capsule 's antenna burned up during the descent , meaning the crew could not communicate properly .
Space officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday 's report .
The crew , which included South Korea 's first astronaut , endured severe gravitational forces because it took a steeper - than - usual trajectory .

Since the 2008 Beijing Olympics are coming up in only a couple of months , we decided to take a look at the ancient Chinese city through the magical powers of Google Earth .
What we found was much like a Chinese Dragon , both beautiful and terrible .
The preponderance of Geographic Web content on the digital globe has us thinking a trip there would be most awesome , but the traffic and interchanges would make a New Englander cringe .

Though the Goog has n't managed to lay out all the road maps there yet , we took some snaps of six of the most confounding or amazingly complex interchanges around the Forbidden City .
As you can see , there is some very impressive spaghetti action over there .
We found exactly zero traditional cloverleaf interchanges on major freeways and at least one traffic jam stretching almost 3 miles — without an accident , and this is just one snapshot by a passing satellite .
We just hope all the drivers plopped into various cross - branded VW New Beetles have Olympic - level skills .

More than 140 mourners at a funeral in northern Thailand are reported to have been taken ill after eating a dish that appears to have contained puffer fish .
The mourners were rushed to hospital after being served soup containing fish balls bought at a local market in Nan province , the Bangkok Post reports .
They started vomiting and complained of numb tongues and shortness of breath .
Doctors said the symptoms were consistent with puffer fish poisoning , which can be fatal even after cooking .
The fish contains a poison known as tetrodotoxin , which paralyses the diner 's muscles .
There is no antidote .
The fish is prized as a delicacy in Japan - known as fugu - and chefs are specially trained to prepare it safely .
Puffer fish meat is sometimes used illegally in Thailand to produce fish balls because it is cheaper than most other fish meat , the Bangkok Post reports .
Seven of those taken to hospital are reported to be in a serious condition .
Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea
As huge fans of Miyazaki ’s films , we take leave of the weird for a moment to mention his upcoming movie .

The German chemist August Kekulé fell asleep in his study after a fruitless struggle to identify the chemical structure of benzene .
He dreamed of a snake eating its own tail and awoke instantly .
The dream gave him , through the ancient language of symbolism , the circular structure of the benzene ring that had eluded his conscious mind .
The dream may have had its basis in Kekulé ’s experiments , but it was the nonrational that brought him his discovery .
Many physicists see “ string theory ” — in which the structure of the universe is made up of resonating , one - dimensional submicroscopic strings — as plausible .
Yet no scientist has ever seen a string .
No direct experimentation has established a firm ground for strings .
Cosmology routinely bases arguments on things that cannot be seen in order to explain things that can , as in the case of “ dark matter , ” whose effects can be seen .
Quantum physics demolished the assumption that physical elements are governed by fixed laws .
Science is often as inexact and intuitive as theology , philosophy and every other human endeavor .
A mirror demonstrates the randomness of nature .
A mirror reflects about 95 percent of light hitting it .
The other 5 percent passes through the mirror .
Photons , which are invisible , are either reflected or pass through the mirror ’s surface .
But there is no way of knowing which photons will be reflected and which will be absorbed .
Electrons are also subject to these quantum effects .
This led Werner Heisenberg to formulate his “ uncertainty principle . ”
This principle states that we cannot know everything about a particle .
If we can determine a particle ’s position we cannot determine its momentum .
We can measure momentum , but in this measurement we lose the particle ’s exact position .
We can know a particle ’s momentum or its position .
We cannot know both with definitive accuracy .
Science is not always directly empirical .
Science is not governed by absolute , immutable laws .
Science , and especially quantum mechanics , far from telling us we can know everything , tells us there will always be things we cannot know .
No one ultimately understands .
Science affirms the complexity and mystery of the universe .
Science , like the religious impulse , opens us up to a world where we face mystery .
There are forces in the universe that will always lie beyond the capacity of the human mind .
The New Atheist writers from Richard Dawkins to E.O. Wilson to Sam Harris have become the high priests not of science but the cult of science .
Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore , for example , call religious beliefs “ memes . ”
Memes are defined as cultural artifacts — prototypical ideas — that invade and restructure minds in order to reproduce themselves .
A meme replicates in human minds , they argue , the way genes replicate in human bodies .
Memes include a word , belief , thought , religious ritual , dance , poem or any of the myriad of behaviors that are copied and reproduced in human societies .
Although memes , unlike genes , are not identifiable physical structures , Dawkins uses the image of a virus to describe them .
Religion , for Dawkins , is equated with a disease , and the religiously inclined are disease carriers .
The attempt to equate patterns of human society with the behavior of genes , while it sounds plausible , and may even be instructive in some settings , is part of this cult of science .
The genetic coding that permits the transfer of DNA - encoded units of information is fairly precise .
But this model fails to work for the transfer of cultural , social , ethical and political behavior .
Patterns of morality are easily reversed or erased , especially in ages of revolutionary fervor , war , anarchy , fear , social decline and despotism .
Those who are schooled in identical religious texts , even within the same communities , have different views of morality and ethics .
It is possible to transfer literal meaning .
It is possible to transfer genetic information .
It is possible to pass on heritable characteristics mediated by hard - and - fast rules of chemistry and physics .
These rules , however , have no counterpart in the dissemination of ideas .
Ideas do not replicate like genes .
Ideas are snuffed out or forgotten , often for centuries .
Ideas that prevail are often not the best ideas but more often ideas backed by power .
The rise of Christianity owed more to the brutality of Constantine and the Holy Roman Empire than it did its particular theology .
Those who advocate the theory of memes ignore the role of power , repression , persecution and force in human history , as well as the inherent chaos and irrationality of human thought .
Human thought cannot be treated like an object in a laboratory .
There is no scientific mechanism that explains cultural evolution .
Those who endorse the meme theory speak of memetic engineering .
This memetic engineering would involve the conscious manipulation of intellectual evolution by disseminating good memes and curtailing bad ones .
The question of who decides which memes are good and which bad is not raised .
Dennett has argued that human evolution can be shaped and directed through memetic engineering .
He advocates not science but indoctrination , an updated version of thought control .
The theory of memes and memetic engineering , like the idea of the new man , is another form of magical thinking .
It is not real .
It has no more scientific validity than Intelligent Design .
And , should it ever be adopted it would result in anti-intellectualism , a war on science and democratic freedom and a silencing of those who fail to conform .
The world the high priests of memetic engineering propose is as repugnant as the fundamentalist utopia advocated by the radical Christian right .
Einstein ’s quest for a unified field theory explaining subatomic structure or the Big Bang no more undermined religious contemplation than evolutionary biology .
The questions of science are not the questions of religion .
Science does not attempt to address , nor is it capable of addressing , the final mystery of existence , our moments of transcendence , the moral life , love , our search for meaning and our mortality .
Science , limited to what can be proved and disproved , is a morally neutral discipline .
It serves human needs and human ambitions .
There are times when it protects and advances life .
There are times when it empowers ambitions that are immoral and deadly .
Science , like all human endeavors , comes with good and bad , possibilities of hope and possibilities of destruction .
When Darwin published “ On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life ” in 1859 , he named natural selection as the mechanism that drives and defines life .
Evolutionary science , however , swiftly became for many a surrogate religion .
It was used to promote racism and pseudo - science , such as eugenics , a theory of biological determinism invented by Francis Galton , Darwin ’s cousin .
It was turned like a club on religion and used to justify exploitation and neglect of the poor and disadvantaged .
There are unfortunate implications in Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
Darwin believes in the possibility of compassion and benevolence .
He argues that these adaptations give one species advantage over another .
He uses compassion to insist that sooner or later the “ superior ” races — those with compassion — will exterminate the “ more savage ” races .
Compassion , he implies , does not exist , or certainly not in the same abundance , in others as it does in us .
But Darwin left the championing of these implications to others such as Herbert Spencer , a utopian and a doctrinaire Malthusian .
It was Spencer , not Darwin , who argued that step by step we were progressing as a species and would end with the perfect human being .
And it was Spencer who coined the phrase “ survival of the fittest . ”
The atheists , while they do not endorse the hierarchy of races or espouse the crude racist doctrines of earlier Social Darwinists , continue to argue that natural selection is social selection .
They continue to create moral hierarchies among human beings and use these hierarchies to sanction violence .
They do this because they insist we are moving toward a final good .
This is not a position supported by human history , human nature or evolutionary biology .
Wilson , in his book “ On Human Nature , ” uses evolutionary biology to justify power structures such as the subjugation of women and social inequality .
All behavior in society , he argues , has a genetic basis .
Religious belief exists , he writes , only because it gives humans a biological advantage .
Religion helps “ congeal identity , ” provides “ unquestioned membership in a group claiming great powers ” and gives to a human being “ a driving purpose in life compatible with his self - interest . ”
Wilson , while correct in assuming that many of the laws that govern animals also govern the behavior and habits of the human species , goes much further .
He leaps from science to the unscientific propositions that evolution means we can , as a species , morally advance .
He dreams of a day when the human race , having jettisoned religion and embraced science and reason , will be able to alter human nature and control its own destiny :
“… [ G]enetic evolution is about to become conscious and volitional , and usher in a new epoch in the history of life . …
The prospect of this ‘ volitional evolution ’ — a species deciding what to do about its own heredity — will present the most profound intellectual and ethical choices humanity ever faced … humanity will be positioned godlike to take control of its own ultimate fate .
It can , if it chooses , alter not just the anatomy and intelligence of the species but also the emotions and creative drive that compose the very core of human nature . ”
Dawkins writes that the human species , unlike other animals , can transcend its biological map .
“ We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines , but we have the power to turn against our creators .
We , alone on earth , can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators , ” he says .
This leap by Wilson and Dawkins is not science .
It certainly is not Darwinian science .
Darwin wrote nothing to indicate that the human species had risen above its biological composition .
He argued that human morality was linked to the behavior of animals .
The social instincts that constitute humankind ’s understanding of moral behavior can be found , he wrote , in monkeys , pelicans and dogs , as well as other animals .
Wilson and Dawkins build their vision of human perfectibility out of the legitimate theory that human beings are shaped by the laws of heredity and natural selection .
They depart from this position when they assert that we can leave that determinism behind .
There is nothing in science that implies that our genetic makeup allows us to perfect ourselves .
Those who , in the name of science , claim that we can overcome our imperfect human nature make a leap of faith .
In this leap they leave the realm of science .
They operate on a belief system that functions like religion .
It gives meaning .
It gives purpose and hope .
But it is a myth .
It is not true .
And there is nothing , when you cut through their scientific jargon , which supports their absurd proposition .
The attempt to impose the methodology of science onto collective and personal relationships also has grave consequences .
If a scientific hypothesis does not work it is discarded .
Pluralism has no place in science .
Neither do competing truths .
Science , when set up as a model for our moral and social existence , implicitly banishes compromise and tolerance .
Scientific ideas , because they can be demonstrated or disproved , are embraced or rejected on quantifiable evidence .
But human relationships and social organizations interact and function effectively when they are not rigid , accept morally ambiguity and take into account the irrational .
Politics , for example , is about channeling and managing human drives and desires .
It is only fitfully in contact with reason .
This profound understanding of the irrational element in politics led Sigmund Freud to write his masterpiece “ Civilization and Its Discontents . ”
The secular fundamentalists , in a gross misuse of Darwin and of science , turn biological evolution into a methodology to champion moral progress for the human race .
They seek to give to their arguments the patina of unassailable truth .
But what they sell are myths , bizarre utopian visions of a new heaven and a new earth dressed up in the language of scientific rationalism .

Here we are the third installment of Enumerating Enumerable , my attempt to do a better job of documenting Ruby ’s Enumerable module than RubyDoc.org does .
In this installment , I cover Enumerable #collect and its syntactic sugar twin ( and the one I prefer ) , Enumerable #map .
In case you missed the earlier installments , they ’re listed ( and linked ) below :
Enumerable #collect/ Enumerable#map Quick Summary
In the simplest possible terms Create a new array by performing some operation on every item in the given collection .
collect and map are synonyms — you can use either .
I personally prefer map as it ’s shorter and makes sense if you think of the method as being like functional mapping .
Ruby version 1.8 and 1.9 Expects
A block containing the criteria .
This block is optional , but you ’re likely to use one in most cases .
Returns
An array made up of items created by performing some operation on the given collection .
RubyDoc.org ’s entry Enumerable #collect / Enumerable#map
Enumerable #collect / Enumerable #map and Arrays
When used on an array and a block is provided , collect / map passes each item to the block , where the operation in the block is performed on the item and the result is then added to the result array .
Note the the result array has the same number of elements as the given array .
[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .map { |number| number ** 2} => [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 ] [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ] .map { |adjective| adjective + " man "} => [ " Aquaman " , " Batman " , " Superman " , " Wonder Woman " ] 1 2 3 4 5 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . map { | number | number * * 2 } = > [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 ] [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ] . map { | adjective | adjective + " man " } = > [ " Aquaman " , " Batman " , " Superman " , " Wonder Woman " ]
When the block is omitted , collect / map uses this implied block : { |item| item} , which means when applied on an array without a block , collect / map is the identity function — the resulting array is the same as the given array .
[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .map => [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ] .map => [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ] 1 2 3 4 5 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . map = > [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ] . map = > [ " Aqua " , " Bat " , " Super " , " Wonder Wo " ]
Enumerable #collect / Enumerable #map and Hashes
When used on a hash and a block is provided , collect and map pass each key / value pair in the hash to the block , which you can “ catch ” as either :
A two - element array , with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1 , or Two separate items , with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item .
Each key / value pair is passed to the block , where the operation in the block is performed on the item and the result is then added to the result array .
Note the the result array has the same number of elements as the given array .
burgers = { " Big Mac " => 300 , " Whopper with cheese " => 450 , " Wendy 's Double with cheese " => 320} # What if I had just half a burger ?
burgers.map { |burger| burger [ 1 ] / 2} => [ 160 , 150 , 225 ] burgers.map { |sandwich , calories | calories / 2} => [ 160 , 150 , 225 ] burgers.map { |burger|
" Have a tasty #{burger [ 0 ] } ! " } =>
[ " Have a tasty Wendy 's Double with cheese ! " , " Have a tasty Big Mac ! " , " Have a tasty Whopper with cheese ! " ] burgers.map { |sandwich , calories |
" Have a tasty #{sandwich} ! " } =>
[ " Have a tasty Wendy 's Double with cheese ! " , " Have a tasty Big Mac ! " , " Have a tasty Whopper with cheese ! " ] burgers.map { |sandwich , calories | [ " Half a # {sandwich} " , calories / 2 ] } => [ [ " Half a Wendy 's Double with cheese " , 160 ] , [ " Half a Big Mac " , 150 ] , [ " Half a Whopper with cheese " , 225 ] ]
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 burgers = { " Big Mac " = > 300 , " Whopper with cheese " = > 450 , " Wendy 's Double with cheese " = > 320 } #
What if I had just half a burger ?
burgers .
map { | burger | burger [ 1 ] / 2 } = > [ 160 , 150 , 225 ] burgers . map { | sandwich , calories | calories / 2 } = > [ 160 , 150 , 225 ] burgers .
map { | burger | " Have a tasty #{burger [ 0 ]} ! " } = > [
" Have a tasty Wendy 's Double with cheese ! " , " Have a tasty Big Mac ! " , " Have a tasty Whopper with cheese ! " ] burgers .
map { | sandwich , calories |
" Have a tasty #{sandwich} ! " } = > [
" Have a tasty Wendy 's Double with cheese ! " , " Have a tasty Big Mac ! " , " Have a tasty Whopper with cheese ! " ] burgers .
map { | sandwich , calories | [ " Half a # {sandwich} " , calories / 2 ] } = > [ [ " Half a Wendy 's Double with cheese " , 160 ] , [ " Half a Big Mac " , 150 ] , [ " Half a Whopper with cheese " , 225 ] ]
When the block is omitted , collect / map uses this implied block : { |item| item} , which means when applied on an hash without a block , collect / map returns an array containing a set of two - item arrays , one for each key / value pair in the hash .
For each two - item array , item 0 is the key and item 1 is the corresponding value .
burgers = { " Big Mac " => 300 , " Whopper with cheese " => 450 , " Wendy 's Double with cheese " => 320} burgers.map => [ [ " Wendy 's Double with cheese " , 320 ] , [ " Big Mac " , 300 ] , [ " Whopper with cheese " , 450 ] ] 1 2 3 4 burgers = { " Big Mac " = > 300 , " Whopper with cheese " = > 450 , " Wendy 's Double with cheese " = > 320 } burgers . map = > [ [ " Wendy 's Double with cheese " , 320 ] , [ " Big Mac " , 300 ] , [ " Whopper with cheese " , 450 ] ]
Special Case : Using Enumerable #collect / Enumerable #map on Empty Arrays and Hashes
When applied to an empty array or hash , with or without a block , collect and map always return an empty array .
I have been looking at a lot of the different databases that are working outside the traditional SQL style RDBMS ( and I want to point out that having a true RDBMS might actually be something very different to what we have now ) .
I have spent a lot of time with CouchDB compared to the others because it seems to occupy a special niche in data storage .
It also builds in a REST interface right off the bat which effectively decouples the storage mechanism from the delivery and makes the whole system very language neutral .
CouchDB represents the first serious contact I have had with JSON and in deciding whether CouchDB is right for your project you really need to understand what JSON does and does n’t offer .
The first important thing is that JSON offers a kind of compromise from the heavy data definition in SQL or XML Schema and totally typeless data of something like flat files or Amazon SimpleDB .
However to achieve that simplicity there are two consequences .
Firstly data integrity is palmed off onto client applications and you will need to check data going in and coming out .
I do n’t personally believe that there is ever an application that does n’t have some explicit or implicit data integrity .
Second JSON documents can be very rich and complex but they cannot have detailed field structures , a telephone number is simply going to decompose into two numbers and its hard to get much finer grain description of the data .
As a rule of thumb if you would normally create a well - formed XML document for the data or you would define a SQL data definition that would simply declare all the types of the column using all the defaults and never specifying a NOT NULL column then you probably have a good match .
JSON also favours dynamic languages over static types like Java .
You need to decide if you are going to be able to take advantage of the full set of features in your chosen client language .
XML might remain a better choice for static languages as you describe document instances declaratively .
Other good features about CouchDB include the fact that its incubating for Apache and will be a good addition to the projects there .
It also leverages existing Javascript skills which are probably more common than people who know XPath , XQuery or even XML Schema and Relax NG .
It has excellent support for incremental data and also fits well with highly irregular data like CMS page content .
It also has an excellent UI that makes it easy to interact with the data .
Finally it seems to have a good solution for scalability without doing anything too esoteric .
The negative features are tricky because we obviously have an alpha project here that is probably closer to the start of the public testing phase than the end .
Some of these cons may well be addressed before the first release candidate .
The first obvious omission for a server product is that there is no security built into the server .
Just supporting optional HTTP Authentication would be enough to make it practical to start running some experimental servers for something more than sandbox exercises .
One thing that is a major difference to the feature set in the standard pseudo - RDBMS is that there is no way of interacting with sets of data .
There is a method for changing multiple documents in one pass but what you really want to be able to do is apply a set of changes to documents identified by a query , the equivalent of SQL’s UPDATE .
Related to this is the fact that data in CouchDB is currently heavily based on silos .
If I have a set of data referring to authors and a set of data relating to books then I currently need to duplicate data in both .
One of the problems that the developers are going to face in evolving CouchDB is how to address this without introducing a solution so complex that you ask why you are not using an RDBMS ?
Similarly I notice in the roadmap there is an item about data validation .
If you start introducing data validation and rules for validating data then before long there is going to be a question as to why you do n’t simply use one of the existing document systems as all the current simplicity will have gone .
One thing that definitely needs improvement is error logging and reporting .
Often the only error feedback you have is a Javascript popup that says “ undefined ” and a log message that tells you that the Erlang process terminated .
There needs to be some more human - readable issue logging that points you towards what is going wrong .
Osama bin Laden sits during an interview with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir ( not pictured ) in an image supplied by the respected Dawn newspaper November 10 , 2001 .
REUTERS / Hamid Mir / Editor / Ausaf Newspaper for Daily Dawn
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is expected to release a new message within the next two days , the U.S. - based terrorism monitoring service SITE Institute said on Wednesday .
The message is entitled , “ The Response Will Be What You See , Not What You Hear , ” SITE said in a release .
It said an announcement of the pending message was posted on Wednesday , the fifth anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , by the administrator of the al Qaeda - affiliated Al - Ekhlaas Internet forum .
The message is likely to be posted by Thursday or Friday at the latest , SITE senior analyst Adam Raisman said .
He based his judgment on past practice and announcement language describing the message ’s posting as “ urgent , ” “ shortly ” and “ Allah willing . ”
He said the announcement did not carry the usual banner but rather was made in plain text .
Based on recent practice , Raisman said he expects the upcoming message to include an audio track illustrated with an image .
The message apparently is the first by bin Laden since November 29 when he urged European countries to end military participation with U.S. forces in the Afghan conflict .
How would you like to find THIS in your bunch of bananas ?
The five - inch beetle who sailed to Britain from Costa Rica
He 's not the sort of creature that could easily scuttle about unnoticed .
But somehow
Bill the elephant beetle managed to sneak into a crate of bananas in Costa Rica and smuggle himself over here .
The beetle - which at 5in long is the size of a hamster - was discovered by workers at a fruit wholesalers .
They were amazed he had survived the two - week journey in chilly temperatures .
Discovery : A male elephant beetle , the size of a hamster , was found in fruit from Costa Rica
Bill would also have been sprayed with pesticides designed to kill stowaways like him .
He was taken to Linton Zoo near Cambridge , where staff gave him his name .
Spokesman Kim Simmons said : " It 's a very lucky and tough insect .
These beetles are able to maintain their body temperature , but he was chilled to the extent that he was immobilised . "
She added : " He looks quite aggressive but he 's actually quite placid . "
" He was kept at the fruit wholesalers for a couple of days but once he arrived here we warmed him up a bit and he became active .
" They are one of the biggest beetles in the world and when he first turned up he was 35g .
" He 's been munching his way through bananas , mangoes and other fruit since then so I imagine he is probably a lot more than that .
" All that headgear is actually used to fight off rival males to protect his territory and fight for females .
They fight the same way as deer - by locking horns . "
Adult elephant beetles typically grow up to three - and - a - half inches long .
Males are up to three times bigger than females .
They are found in Central and South American rainforests , southern parts of Mexico and Texas and Australia .
They are an endangered species because slash and burn policies in rain forests have reduced their mating grounds .
Females lay eggs in large , decaying logs where they take around three weeks to develop into larvae .
These large , white grubs , which have brown heads and six legs , spend 29 weeks gorging themselves on organic matter before entering a five - week pupal stage .
Adults , which eat sap and bark from certain trees or ripened fallen fruits , have a life - span of just four months .
With time running out for Bill , Linton Zoo yesterday appealed for any private collectors who have a female to get in contact .
Miss Simmons added : " It would be a shame for him to come all this way over here and die as a single creature .
" We are hoping someone out there has got a wonderful female to go with our Billy bug . "
Ian Myers , of fresh produce distributor Chiquita Brands International , said : " Bananas are transported green at temperatures as low as two degrees C which keeps them in stasis .
" The odd locust or cricket comes over from the Tropics but I 've never heard an elephant beetle mentioned before . "
FACT FILE
The Elephant Beetle can carry an astonishing 850 times its own weight - the equivalent of a 13st man lifting a 60 - tonne Boeing 737 airliner .
Stephan Schuster lab , Penn State
This is not any old hairball .
It is a very old hairball .
It comes from a woolly mammoth that was buried in the Siberian permafrost .
An analysis of its DNA , and the DNA from 17 other mammoths , by Stephan Schuster , of Pennsylvania State University and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggests the species was composed of two genetically distinct groups .
One of these groups became extinct 45,000 years ago , well before people arrived in the area mammoths inhabited .
That re-opens the question of whether it was people or climate change that finally did the species in .
Top 10 : Worst Male - Bashing Ads
Page 1 of 3
You ’ve seen him plenty of times on sitcoms ; he ’s the dumb , bumbling , idiot dad , husband and boyfriend who appears useless at everything but bringing home a paycheck .
The message : Guys are dumb and women have to lead them around .
This , of course , cues the laugh track .
Yet a survey from an organization called Children Now found that two - thirds of kid respondents described men on TV as angry , while respondents from another group ’s survey said men were portrayed as corrupt on TV by a 17 to 1 margin .
Clearly , this is no laughing matter .
To highlight companies pushing anti-guy messages , we ’ve compiled a list of the worst male - bashing ads from 2007 and 2008 .
Whether husbands are portrayed as useless , stereotypical men or absolute airheads , our list of worst male - bashing ads exposes them all .
Check out which worst male - bashing ads are the main offenders .
Number 10
Pizza Hut
Number 9
Magasin
Need to cook a meal ?
Better call for pizza because you surely can’t do it on your own .
In this worst male - bashing ad , Pizza Hut rolls out the tired stereotype that men are completely useless in the kitchen .
Take a look at the real world , however , and you ’ll see a much different picture than the one painted in this worst male - bashing ad : Men still dominate professional kitchens as chefs .
You can take your pick from the tons of male celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver .
Of course you use the microwave , but you can also boil an egg , grill a great steak and even prepare vegetables .
You may have grown up on your mother 's cooking , but now that you are grown up you can be the master of your kitchen — even if advertising insists you can ’t .
Apparently , men are pushovers and women are the superior voice in relationships .
It ’s unclear what product or service this No. 9 worst male - bashing ad is pitching , but its cliched message comes in loud and clear .
You ’ve seen this script play out on sitcoms likeandall the time .
The formula in this worst male - bashing ad is simple : Man + Outside World = Dumb .
Clearly , whomever came up with the concept was n’t doing much heavy lifting for an idea ; they simply repackaged the “ dumb man ” character as a more literal representation — a caveman .
Warning : blood may boil after repeated viewings .
Number 8
AT&T
A guy is in Las Vegas , probably for a convention , and he ’s never gambled before .
He gets a taste for it , and loses money at the tables .
Sounds like it could happen , right ?
Now here ’s the AT&T version : same setup , but the guy calls his wife to report how much fun he ’s having and explains in the naive tone of a kid going to school for the first time that he lost “ chips ” he was n’t aware were worth money .
Believable ?
Sure , as a science - fiction plot in which men are house pets .
In the real world , even the crazy guy who bets his life savings has brains enough to know he ’s not playing Monopoly .
These worst male - bashing ads will get you riled up …
Google Earth has exceeded everyone ’s expectations .
The program was supposed to be a simple one that could help users get directions or take a look at a location for their upcoming holiday .
However , it appears that some people have been using Google Earth for higher purposes .
In the past the program has helped researchers make some important discoveries and it appears that things wo n’t stop there .
A while ago , Google Earth imagery was used to determine some vital information about the forests of the planet .
Now , another important discovery was made thanks to the help of satellite imagery , and this time it is an archaeological one .
Mysterious gates found in the Saudi Arabia
Google Earth became an important tool for Prof David Kennedy from the University of Western Australia .
He used it in order to analyse the deserts of Saudi Arabia , and what he discovered baffled everyone .
It appears that there are some ancient structures , and the professor managed to identify 400 .
While no one knows anything exactly , the structures were probably built between 2,000 and 9,000 years ago .
This means that researchers have a lot to discover about the populations that have lived in that region .
Kennedy published his findings in a paper that appeared in the journal Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy .
“ I refer to them as gates because when you view them from above , they look like a simple field gate lying flat , two upright posts on the sides , connected by one or more long bars , ” he declared .
Kennedy explains that this area has been researched for 40 years but nothing was discovered until now .
“ They do n’t look like structures where people would have lived nor do they look like animal traps or for disposing of dead bodies .
It ’s a mystery as to what their purpose would have been , ” he added .
HOUSTON  Responding to an accusation of sexual abuse of a 16 - year - old girl , Texas enforcement officers and child welfare investigators raided a West Texas ranch founded by the convicted polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs and removed 52 children , officials said Friday .
All were girls .
Eighteen of the children , ages 6 months to 17 years , were believed to have been abused or at risk of abuse and were placed in foster care by Child Protective Services , said Darrell Azar , communications manager for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services .
Thirty - four were taken to a nearby civic center for questioning , Mr. Azar said .
There were no immediate arrests and no resistance , officials said .
But state troopers , Texas Rangers and other investigators with search and arrest warrants late Friday were still inside the 1,700 - acre compound , the Yearning for Zion Ranch of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , a breakaway Mormon sect .
The compound is in Eldorado , roughly 160 miles northwest of San Antonio .

The FISA Amendments Act , H.R. 6304 , in part provides legal immunity to the nation 's telecommunications companies who helped the federal government with a warrantless surveillance program , which in part gathers information about the phone records of American citizens .
According to a May 11 , 2006 report by USA Today , " The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans  most of whom are n't suspected of any crime .
" Since the surveillance program became public there have been close to 50 lawsuits filed against the companies involved and the government .
The immunity , in addition to freeing the telecommunications companies from further legal woes , would have the effect of killing the legal discovery process which could reveal more details regarding the timeline of the program and how the information was gathered and used .
The immunity clause has been sought by the Bush Administration and Republican law makers .
Public outcry to the immunity has been sufficient enough to foil the move up until today 's announcement .
Proponents of the surveillance program say it is in response to the attacks on 9/11 and necessary to combat terrorism .
However , the Washington Post reported on Oct. 13 , 2007 that former Qwest executive Joseph Nacchio said in court papers , " the NSA approached Qwest more than six months before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . " Qwest is the one telecommunications company who reportedly refused to cooperate with the NSA on the grounds they believed doing so would have been illegal .
In a press release issued around Noon today regarding the compromise bill , Hoyer made no mention of the immunity provision .
The statement was jointly issued by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John  Jay Rockefeller ( WV ) , Senate Intelligence Committee Vice - Chair Kit Bond ( MO ) , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( MD ) , and House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( MO ) .
This bipartisan bill balances the needs of our intelligence community with Americans  civil liberties , and provides critical new oversight and accountability requirements ,  said Hoyer in the press release .
 It is the result of compromise , and like any compromise is not perfect , but I believe it strikes a sound balance .
Furthermore , we have ensured that Congress can revisit these issues because the legislation will sunset at the end of 2012 .
The FISA Amendments Act , H.R. 6304 , is expected to be voted on in the House on Friday .

Wii or Vii – what ’s the difference ?
Gameking I and Gameking II
One is made to look like Nintendo ’s Game Boy Advance and other looks like Sony ’s PlayStation Portable .
The quality of its games , graphics wise , can be compared to some of the best built - in cell phone games ( excluding Java games ) , while their playing speed ( scrolling etc. ) and audio is far superior to those found on cell phones ( multi - channel music and digitized samples and voices are quite common in GameKing games ) .
Treamcast
Treamcast is a Dreamcast clone from China .
This small system with its fold - down display resembled the revised PlayStation .
The Treamcast can read CD - Rs and play MP3s and Video CDs with special software .
It also contains pirated Dreamcast firmware , enabling it to play Dreamcast games .
Sega accused the company of copyright violations and was able to halt sale through various websites .
Popstation
Pop Station design was shamelessly stolen from the Sony PlayStation Portable .
It is limited to a single game , running on a LCD screen .

“ The Revolution Will Be Fabulous : A Weapons of Mass Designer Show ”
A new show opened up the other night at Gallery 1988 in LA featuring weapons designed by Peter Gronquist … Pretty dope
By Martin Patience
BBC News , Jisr az - Zarqa
Mariam Amash views the world 's ' oldest ' woman as a youngster
She offers Islamic blessings for the week - old baby - a traditional Arabic custom .
It is a ritual that Mrs Amash has performed many times in her life .
According to Mrs Amash , she was born 120 years ago - a claim , if confirmed , that would make her the oldest person in the world .
The Guinness Book of Records currently lists 114 - year - old Edna Parker of Shelbyville , Indiana , as holding the title .
But Mrs Amash - who lives in the predominantly Arab town of Jisr az - Zarqa in northern Israel - views her rival as a relative youngster .
Huge family
" Yes , I am the oldest person in the world , " she says , her family crowding around her .
" I eat , I drink , and I take showers .
I hope to keep going for another 10 years . "
Mrs Amash has 10 children , 120 grandchildren , 250 great - grandchildren , and 30 great - great - grandchildren , according to relatives .
The discovery that she may be the oldest person in the world came by chance when she applied for a new Israeli identity card .
They ( younger generations ) drink too much Arak
Mariam Amash
The Israeli authorities say they issued the identity card based on a birth document issued by the Ottoman authorities who ruled the region at the time .
Mrs Amash , of Bedouin descent , says that the secret to her longevity is a healthy diet - she eats lots of vegetables .
For all her years , she is remarkably sprightly .
A devout Muslim , Mrs Amash has made five pilgrimages to Mecca , the last trip in 1990 , relatives say .
Long - term memory
" She rises every morning around five for prayers , " says one of her grandsons , Majid Amash , 46 , an engineer .
" She then goes for a walk and then spends most of her day with the family .
She recognises all of us . "
But , he adds , her grandmother 's long - term memory is fuzzy .
For her part , Mrs Amash has one piece of cautionary advice for younger generations .
" They drink too much Arak ( an Arabic alcoholic drink ) , " she says .
In order for Mrs Amash to be officially declared the oldest person in the World she must submit documentation to the Guinness Book of Records .
A spokesman in London for the publication says the family has yet to do that .
Women who sexually abuse children and youths
The Ultimate Taboo : Child Sexual abuse by women
The Sexual Abuse by Women of Children and Teenagers
Summary of UK TV programme - Panorama - BBC1 - 10 pm Monday , October 6th , 1997
Warning :
This programme contains explicit descriptions of attacks and the emotional and physical damage they have caused , which some viewers may find distressing .
The sexual abuse of children by women was once thought to be so rare it could be ignored .
In this programme the victims tell a different story .
Summary
This was a vivid and horrific programme in which the victims of sexual abuse by women told disturbing stories of emotional and physical damage :
Rape and attempted murder of a 12 year old boy by a 19 year old girl
Rape and abuse of a 12 year old boy over a two year period by a 28 year old mother of four
Rape and abuse of boys by their mother
Rape and abuse of girls by their mother
Women taking a lead role in pornographic violence and abuse
Children abused by nun
Children abused at playgroup
Boy abused by lesbians
It was acknowledged that the scale and nature of these attacks had been severely underestimated and there were examples of women using excessive force with implements such as chair legs and cutlery .
A surprising 86 % of survivors of sexual abuse were not believed when they said the abuser was a woman .
Many myths were exposed , such as the one that women only sexually abused when coerced by men - they in fact played the lead part .
Also the myth that women are incapable of cruelty - what was shown was beyond belief .
But despite the seriousness of these offences , women generally escaped custodial sentences .
Statistics
The programme claimed that :
Women commit 25 % of all child sexual abuse
250,000 children in UK have been sexually abused by women
People find it difficult to believe .
The issue strikes at the core of what women perceive themselves to be :
The whole view of women is of nurturers , carers , protectors - people who do anything to look after children
The crime seems so unnatural it offends against all instincts , so society is reluctant to even associate women with sexual abuse
It 's easier to think that it 's men - men the enemy , somehow - but it can't be women - it 's one thing women can't do
Society excuses female abusers
What tends to happen is that the female sexual abuser is excused in some way .
" She must have been misguided " , or it was a " chronicled affair " .
We would n't have said that about a man .
And what happens is that the sentences are Read More .. nient .
The judges might even think " Well a woman really could n't have done this - it must have been a mistake " .
And they usually get probation or they walk free .
A man doing that would be locked up .
their testimony shatters the myth that women only sexually abuse if coerced by men .
Women are seen as victims
Women are seen as victims rather than enemies or perpetrators of any abuse .
Women in our society have been portrayed as victims , but somewhere within their victimisation they have learned that to abuse children gave them a sense of power , control , agency , and therefore they use the abuse of children to gain those things .
Disbelief the biggest trauma
The biggest trauma for some victims is disbelief .
A survey of 127 survivors by the children 's charity Kidscape showed 86 % were not believed at first when they named a woman as their abuser .
The fact that we are not expecting women in our society to do this - not expecting that women our society do this actually has profound effects on the victims , often making the experience go on much longer than it would have done in other cases , but also making them feel Read More .. igmatised , Read More .. fferent , Read More .. trayed , Read More .. werless .
Read More ..aumatic to be sexually abused by a woman
It was Read More .. aumatic to be sexually abused by a woman - children feel Read More .. trayed , they feel very angry , they feel the woman should have cared for them , should have loved them instead of abusing them .
Violent and sadistic attacks
The violence that often accompanies the abuse is unexpected of a woman .
Victims often report excessive force equivalent to if not greater than that of a man .
Women are supposed to be the gentler sex , women are supposed to be incapable of cruelty in a sense .
Many of the abusers have been very sadistic - cruelty that is almost unimaginable .
Half the women in a recent survey of 50 convicted female sexual abusers said they derived sadistic pleasure from inflicting pain on victims .
Across the board
The research showed neither class nor age were barriers to their behaviour .
We can't make assumptions about the type of woman who will sexually abuse a child - sexual abuse is committed by :
Women of any age from young teenagers to grandmothers
Women from any class - from women who barely had a house to live in during their life to women with very large houses .
Women from any level of education - women who can barely read and write to women who 've got degrees .
Female abusers acquire positions of trust
Some children are n't just at risk from the people they live with ; they are vulnerable targets when they leave their homes .
Out in the community female sexual abusers can manoeuvre with even Read More .. se than men into positions of trust with authority over lost of children .
Eternal victims
Some of those abused become eternal victims and never recover from that .
Other children will mask their confusions and go into adulthood and never really be able to sustain relationships , or have very distorted relationships because of their enormous confusions .
And there are other children who will go on to hurt not only other children in their own childhood but in adulthood .
The need for Read More ..rk
There 's very very little being done to look at the issue of female sexual abuse .
We have no programmes in this country that are aimed at working with female sexual offenders specifically .
Quite a lot of professionals are picking up women offenders now .
What they 're not doing is having the resources to help them deal with these women offenders .
It 's because so many professionals are now getting to pick up women offenders that we are now getting to realise some of the extent of the problem throughout the country .
Few abusers ever volunteer their guilt , and behind closed doors it is difficult to prove .
A woman 's traditional role in the home as a mother often puts her above suspicion , and medical evidence is hard to obtain .
But as Read More ..d Read More .. women 's victims come forward and speak out they may just force us to face up to the ultimate taboo .
The Sexual Abuse by Women of Children and Teenagers
UK TV Programme - Panorama - BBC1 - 10 pm Monday 6th October 1997
Warning :
This programme contains explicit descriptions of attacks and the emotional and physical damage they have caused , which some viewers may find distressing .
Narrator :
The sexual abuse of children by women was once thought to be so rare it could be ignored .
Today the victims tell a different story .
Woman :
You knew when my mum was being really nice , you knew something was going to happen - you were going to get raped .
Man : Imagine your worst nightmare come true .
It probably does n't even come close to it .
Narrator : Tonight Panorama reveals how the scale and nature of this sexual taboo has been severely underestimated .
Boy :
We used to play football together , go for walks , we were just friends .
Cheryl :
Narrator :
Cheryl 's friend was just a 12 year old schoolboy .
She was 19 .
Walking with him one evening she committed such a serious act of sexual indecency she went to prison for it .
Cheryl :
So I says to him , I says , we 'll walk the field way .
So we started walking the field way and I sat down ; he sat down .
I pushed him back , pulled his trousers down , pulled mine down , then I had sexual intercourse with him ... until someone was walking past with a dog .
Interviewer :
And how long did this assault go on for ?
Cheryl :
About 15 minutes
Interviewer :
Why did you do it in the first place ?
Cheryl :
' Cause I were feeling aroused .
He was crying , shouting for his mum , he wanted to go home .
Interviewer :
And what did you think when you saw him crying ?
Cheryl :
At that time I could n't think straight , so I just carried on .
Narrator :
After she had raped the child , Cheryl realised that as a woman who had abused , she had broken one of society 's most serious taboos .
She marched him to a railway bridge , believing there was only one option left to her .
Cheryl :
Then I looked round to see if anything were coming .. such as transport , and there was nothing and I just pushed him over .
I were thinking what have I done wrong ?
Interviewer :
Why did you push him ?
Cheryl :
Trying to frighten him - scare him so he would n't tell what happened .
Interviewer :
You could have killed him .
Did you know that when you pushed him ?
Cheryl :
Yes
Narrator :
The boy survived his fall from the bridge .
Cheryl was sentenced to 18 months for indecent assault and grievous bodily harm .
Narrator :
Sexual abuse by anyone is appalling , but when the perpetrator is a woman the crime seems so unnatural it offends against all instincts .
It 's thought that 10 % of the population are abused as children ; it is hard to accept that some of their tormentors are women
Jacqui Saradjiam : ( clinical psychologist )
I think people find it so difficult to see that women sexually abuse children because the whole view of women is of nurturers , carers , protectors - people who do anything to look after children - and they see the women as victims rather than enemies or perpetrators of any abuse .
Michelle Elliott : ( Director - children 's charity Kidscape )
I think the issue strikes at the core of what we perceive ourselves as women to be .
I think that it 's easier to think that it 's men - men the enemy , somehow - but it can't be women - it 's one thing women can't do .
Women can be equal , we can be free , we can be in charge of companies , but we can't sexually abuse children - That 's a load of rubbish .
Tina :
Narrator :
Reaction to 28 year old Tina Purser 's relationship with another 12 year old boy demonstrates society 's reluctance to even associate women with sexual abuse .
Purser , a trained nurse and mother of four secretly abused the 12 year old for two years .
Interviewer :
When did she make her first sexual approach ?
How did she do it ?
Mother :
Apparently not long after he was 12 .
Her own children she 'd sent round to the local park to play .
Our son was in the house and she was just doing her housework and apparently while she was cleaning the bathroom she just turned around to our son and said how would you like this and actually abused him - she masturbated him on that first occasion , with him apparently leaning against the door .
Afterwards he just cleaned himself up and she said " You 'd better pop off and play with the children now and I 'll finish the housework and see you later . "
Interviewer :
Do you think she targeted him ?
Mother : Definitely .
She went for that blonde gorgeous little boy .
She used her son to get him .
She used her son to get him over to play .
She used her son to do the things that our son liked doing .
If our son liked certain videos , she 'd get her son to like them too .
Interviewer :
On any level do you understand what she was getting out of a relationship with a 12 year old boy ?
Mother :
None whatsoever .
If he'd have been a Chippendale , yes , but a 12 year old boy , no .
I can only presume that she was getting from it sex , and did n't have the problems of a grown up man and demands of a grown up man and a full blown relationship .
This was just easy sex .
Narrator :
It took secret tape recordings by a private detective to convince the authorities that Tina Purser was abusing the boy , albeit he appeared to consent .
The family were distressed the media reported the relationship as an affair .
Interviewer :
Would you say what they were having was an affair ?
Mother :
No .
She raped him .
She raped him hundreds of times and robbed him of six years of his childhood .
I had a gorgeous little boy and now I 've got a very aggressive moody teenager .
Narrator :
Tina Purser was found guilty of two indecent assault charges , but the sentence was just two years probation and the judge said he did n't see Purser as a future risk to children .
Society excuses female abusers
Michelle Elliott :
What tends to happen is that the female sexual abuser is excused in a way .
" She must have been misguided " , or it was a " chronicled affair " .
For example an affair with a 34 year old woman and a ten year old boy .
I mean we would n't have said that about a man .
And what happens is that the sentences are Read More .. lenient .
The judges might even think " Well a woman really could n't have done this - it must have been a mistake " .
And they usually get probation or they walk free .
A man doing that would be locked up .
Narrator :
That 's because men have long been seen as both capable of sexual abusing children and as being the main perpetrators .
That still holds true ; they are , but there is increasing evidence that far Read More .. men sexually abuse children than previously thought .
Michelle Elliott :
In the past the statistics have indicated that perhaps 2 - 5 % of abusers are female .
I think , based on the people who 've contacted me , that that is probably much higher , maybe as high as 25 % .
Chris
Narrator :
Chris Roberts , seen here in the 1980's in a foster home , was removed from his own home because of physical abuse by his father .
What the authorities did n't even consider at the time was that his mother might be sexually abusing him .
Chris :
There 's no way you can describe how unpleasant it was .
You could n't put it into words .
Imagine your worst nightmare come true ; it probably does n't even come close to it .
The earliest memory would be when I was probably about two and a half or three years old .
Beatings , physical and sexual abuse , mental abuse , from both my mother and father .
My mother would keep us away from playschool and my other two brothers from school and use us for her sexual perversions whilst our father was at work .
When I was three I remember I was put into a children 's home .
Narrator :
But Chris 's abuse was not to end there .
On the weekly visits they were allowed to the home , his parents continued the abuse .
Chris :
The supervision order was n't enforced .
We'd be taken into a play room and our father would ram a chair up against the door and the abuse would carry on - on the property of the children 's home .
Interviewer :
What sort of abuses happened in the home ?
Chris :
At this point in time my mother had lost a set of twins ... can I stop for a minute please ?
[ breaks down ] .
Narrator :
Chris was told he was to blame for the twins death .
His feelings of guilt helped ensure he would submit to yet Read More ..use .
Chris :
There were many forms of abuse - physically , mentally and sexually .
I had a mixture of mentally and sexually would be putting pornographic magazines into the children 's home where we'd be made to sit and look at the magazines whilst performing sexual acts with our mother , and our father joining in as well .
Narrator :
Approximately one in every hundred girls in the population and one in every hundred boys in the population are sexually abused in their childhood by a woman .
And that 's a vast number of victims that we are avoiding if we are not looking at the issue of women as sexual abusers .
Victims trapped in the custody of their mothers as children , often only speak out after they 've escaped .
When they do , much of their testimony shatters the myth that women only sexually abuse if coerced by men .
Lucy
Narrator :
Lucy Jenner had a single mother .
Lucy took the place of a husband in the bed she had to share every night .
Lucy :
She would lock the door and after a certain time she would snap on the lights .
Sometimes I tried to pretend to be asleep and it would n't happen , but it did n't make any difference .
My mother would be behind me and I would be facing the wall .
My mother would be around me and she pulled up a chair and she would say that she loved me and various other things and she would penetrate me vaginally and rectally with whatever she had .
Narrator :
There was lasting damage , causing pain and bleeding even today a legacy of the abuse she 'd endured .
Lucy :
I think mainly it was the abuse that affected my bowel .
I have a rectal prolapse which was a direct result of being penetrated with objects whatever when I was a child and was sexually abused by my mother .
Disbelief the biggest trauma
Narrator :
The biggest trauma for some victims though is disbelief .
A survey of 127 survivors by the children 's charity Kidscape showed 86 % were not believed at first when they named a woman as their abuser .
Jacqui Saradjiam :
The fact that we are not expecting women in our society to do this - not expecting that women our society do this actually has profound effects on the victims , often making the experience go on much longer than it would have done in other cases , but also making them feel Read More .. igmatised , Read More .. fferent , Read More .. betrayed , Read More .. werless .
Sandra & Lesley
Narrator :
For 20 years no one saw what Sandra and Lesley Wilson endured .
their mother started to abuse them aged 5 and six , and continued even after they were married .
When they threatened to go to the police she threatened to abuse their children .
Sandra and Lesley 's mother was accompanied by their father in the abuse , but it was she who took the lead .
Sister :
Mother always used to come in the bedroom and drag us out of bed .
She never had any clothes on .
You knew what was going to happen .
I was made to do things .
I was frightened .
I was crying .
I was told to shut up and I just had to get used to it .
Sister :
You 'd know when my mum was being really nice - you knew something was going to happen - you were going to get raped .
It felt like it was every night - 2 or three times a week they both raped me .
Interviewer :
Who started these sessions ?
Who was the dominant partner ?
Sister :
My mother .
My mother always came to get me .
Sister : My dad was at work .
I was cleaning the bath out and everything .
All of a sudden my mum come in the bathroom and she pushed me flying , she grabbed my hair and dragged me into the bedroom and she made me do things you know to her satisfaction .
Sister : I could n't understand how your own mother ...
You 've got no one else to turn to .
If it 's your dad doing it at least you 've got some chance - your mother to try and talk to if she 's a good mum .
But when you 've got your mother doing it as well what chance have you got ?
No one 's going to believe you .
There was no escape .
Narrator :
Sandra and Lesley 's father John Wildman was eventually sent to prison for 22 years .
Maureen Wildman died shortly after being charged .
It 's her abuse the girls say hurt them most .
Michelle Elliott :
Those survivors who tell me they have been sexually abused by both a woman and a man always tell me that it was more traumatic to be sexually abused by a woman - they feel more betrayed , they feel very angry , they feel the woman should have cared for them , should have loved them instead of abusing them .
For some reason they expected it almost of the man , but never of the woman .
Louise
Narrator :
The violence that often accompanies the abuse is also unexpected of a woman .
Victims often report excessive force equivalent to if not greater than that of a man .
This was the experience in a Newcastle taxi a year ago of a 15 year old girl .
Her 33 year old aunt held her down and forced her to submit to oral sex by the driver as payment in kind .
Angered by that and other sexual attacks by her aunt Paula Belisle , the victim has decided to speak out publicly about the abuse .
Louise :
I was sitting watching the telly and I thought she was going into the toilet because she went out in the passage , She came back in and she had this chair leg cause it was on top of the electrical rad and then she just come over on the settee and put her hand over me mouth and pulling me pants down had her legs over my legs and she 's got like big fat legs , you know what I mean , well really really tight on my legs and I could n't move .
She had a hand on me shoulder and a hand on me mouth and everything - just one hand though , and she was shoving the chair leg up us really really hard and I could n't hardly scream because she had her hand over me mouth .
It was very painful , it was like I was having a bairn [ baby ] .
And I was just crying - I was really upset I did n't want me own aunty to do it to us .
I thought men were animals , but women are just as bad - especially my own aunty doing that .
I hate her .
If I had the chance I 'd kill her .
I can't stand her .
Narrator :
Paula Belisle is now on probation .
Louise says she has since threatened to kill her for going to the police .
Michelle Elliott :
Women are supposed to be the gentler sex , women are supposed to be incapable of cruelty in a sense , and I would like as a woman to believe that .
Unfortunately my experience with the survivors tells me that many of their abusers have been very sadistic to them .
Cruelty that is almost unimaginable South Wales
Narrator :
In the early hours of one morning in South Wales last year the authorities drew up in a quiet street to a neat looking terrace house , looking to arrest a male abuser .
Nothing prepared them for what they found .
Child Protection
Officers were to stumble on a den of professional paedophiles , but a den in which the mother was the prime abuser .
Margaret Harris : ( South Wales Probation )
It had all the appearances of a normal sort of terrace house from the outside , in a very ordinary community - a very proud community .
And as you went in the front door it changed dramatically .
The house was full of rubble and rubbish from floor to ceiling .
The walls had been taken away right through to the point that you could see bare wires hanging down as though the house was still under construction .
It gave the appearance of a house that was just designed really to completely disorientate the children .
In the room where the family actually lived - that was where they videoing the children - they used two different cameras .
The room where the computer was kept was full of rubbish and yet in this corner in a particular corner which had been sectioned off from the rest of the room was the most sophisticated equipment that you could imagine .
There was a kitchen area where in the larder there were videos - pornographic videos .
Hardly any food , just videos upon videos upon videos .
We also then found under the floorboards home - made videos of the abuse of the children .
They did what would almost be construed as a professional video , which we assumed would be for selling .
Narrator :
The husband had filmed the videos , but his wife did the abusing .
She took a lead role , sometimes reading from scripts , acting out scenes .
Most of them involved her daughter videoed between the ages of eight and thirteen .
Margaret Harris :
The older child was naked .
Mother was naked .
They strung up the older child and tied her , gagged her and string her up from a hook in the ceiling and beat her something like 100 times in about four minutes .
They then laid her on the bed and further abused her .
All the time mother was doing this , father was videoing the actual abuse .
At the end of it all , at one point when the child was lying on the bed almost unconscious , mother and father sat on the edge of the bed and had a cup of tea together .
I think that portrays very graphically the awful nature of this .
To give it the name sexual abuse belies what actually happened in that house .
It was torture .
It was the most abhorrent torture I have ever seen .
Narrator :
The mother used the Internet to feed her fantasies .
Links to the North of England and the United States were stark evidence of leading female involvement in the sort of network of abusers normally associated with men .
The father was taken away and jailed for life .
The mother got a lesser 15 year sentence .
Without the exceptional video evidence the authorities say because she was a woman she may not have been implicated at all .
Margaret Harris :
Often when children are trying to tell us what 's happening to them , we are dependent on their stories and I do wonder with this child , if we had n't found the videos , and this child had simply told us what had happened it would have been beyond belief , and I do worry that no on would in fact have believed her .
And I wonder therefore how many other children has this happened to , where they 've either been too afraid to tell or if they have tried to tell they felt they were n't being believed and have held back .
Because what we know we know from the videos .
The children still have n't talked i n full about the horrors that they encountered .
Narrator :
Half the women in a recent survey of 50 convicted female sexual abusers said they derived sadistic pleasure from inflicting pain on victims .
The research showed neither class nor age were barriers to their behaviour .
Jacqui Saradjiam :
In my research I 've come across women of any age from young teenagers to grandmothers , from any class - from women who barely had a house to live in during their life to women with very large houses .
And from any level of education - women who can barely read and write to women who 've got degrees .
We can't make assumptions about the type of woman who will sexually abuse a child .
Children 's home
Narrator :
More than 40 people are now alleging abuse including sexual abuse at this former children 's home in Aberdeen .
The orphanage was run by the Poor Sisters of Nazareth .
The complaints the police are now investigating were until recently dismissed as impossible .
They range over a period of 30 years in which individual nuns are alleged to have abused .
Boy :
I was about 7 or 8 at the time and she was in charge of our group , and just one day out of the blue she came along and asked me would I like to learn the time .
And I just said yes , I 'd like to learn the time .
She told me that her watch was inside her breasts underneath her cassock which they used to wear .
So I put my hand in - obviously I was fondling her breasts to look for the watch and I found it and while I was doing that - pulling the watch out - she would put her hand next to my penis and she would just gently squeeze it and that would get me excited .
I could tell she was
getting excited cause her face was pure red an d her speech was pretty excited speech .
Narrator :
This sort of incident happened on several occasions but the boy felt powerless .
Boy :
I knew it was wrong to do it , but I just did it because I had to do it or I got punished .
Female abusers acquire positions of trust
Narrator :
Some children are n't just at risk from the people they live with ; they are vulnerable targets when they leave their homes .
Out in the community female sexual abusers can manoeuvre with even more ease than men into positions of trust with authority over lost of children .
Dawn Read and Christopher Lilley
Narrator :
Dawn Read and Christopher Lilley worked together as qualified teachers at a nursery in Newcastle .
About 120 two to four year olds passed through their classes .
Their mothers suspected nothing .
Mother :
I really liked her .
She just came across really as a nice person , always laughing , smiling and wanting to talk to you , and just made us feel at ease .
Narrator :
It took two years for trusting parents to find out that their children were being repeatedly sexually abused at the nursery .
Lilley and Read were never tried in court , making the parents determined to stand up in public and draw attention to the abuse .
Mother :
My daughter was sitting at the lunch table and said she did n't want her lunch , so Dawn got a knife and fork and took my daughter to the toilet which was in the classroom and sat her on the floor and inserted the knife and fork into her vagina .
Chris was there and they were both laughing .
Narrator :
What did your daughter tell you about that , about how she felt ?
Mother :
Well she said it hurt and there was blood and that they had to get a towel when she got washed , and the towel had blood on .
But they seem to have done it a few times .
Narrator :
This child was one of more than 20 others who went on to tell their mothers what Dawn Read had done to them .
At first they could n't grasp what they were hearing .
Mother :
I 'm angry with her .
I can't understand where she was coming from when she was doing this to the children .
I can't believe , as a mother I trusted her and I can't believe that a woman would let people trust her and then go out and misuse that trust .
Narrator :
Dawn Read and Christopher Lilley persistently misused parents trust at the nursery and at other addresses in Newcastle .
Interviewer :
What were they asking you to do ?
Girl :
Pull my pants down .
If I had a dress , lift my dress up .
Interviewer :
Did anyone take any photographs of you ?
Girl :
Yeah , there was a camera man there .
Interviewer :
Tell me about that
Girl :
He was just like taking pictures when they were being nasty to her and everything .
I was like crying and just a lot of upset like .
Screaming and saying I wanted to go back to the nursery and me mam and everything .
And they would n't take any notice and they'd be laughing at me .
Interviewer :
When you had to join in with them , what did you have to do ?
Girl :
I can remember when Chris put his privates into mine .
Interviewer :
And what was Dawn doing while Chris was doing this ?
Girl :
Looking at the other children , being rude to the other children .
Interviewer :
She was being rude to the other children ?
What was she doing to the other children ?
Girl :
Making them lift their dresses and take their clothes off
Mother :
Medically there was tearing of the tissues , bleeding trauma , extensive damage to the hymen .
She has since underwent STD tests for sexually transmitted diseases .
She has also had an HIV test .
Narrator :
Dawn Reed and Christopher Lilley were never brought to justice because the judge thought the child witnesses too young to be heard in court .
There was an outcry on behalf of the children .
The parents formed a protest group to support each other and publicise fully Reed and Lilley 's abuse .
Some children are still showing signs of trauma .
Mother :
She was always trying to make play with herself and I used to think that 's just what children do .
I did ask the health visitor a couple of times and she said " She 's just exploring her own body and a lot of children do this " .
But as she started to get older it did n't just settle with her .
I 've had a lot of counselling about it because I 've got a fear of her growing up to being an abuser herself .
What the therapist said was that a child who comes from a loving home who is being abused does n't necessarily go on to be an abuser .
But that 's not to say it can't happen .
Therapy for abused children
Narrator :
The Sexual Abuse Child Consultancy Service is one of the few organisations attempting to break this cycle .
In specially designed rooms long term play therapy helps children explore feelings and relationships .
Half the children who pass through here have been abused by a woman - like this 10 year old boy .
Therapist :
His abusers were involved in a lesbian relationship and he was also abused by men too , so actually he 's quite a confused little boy , which is shown very often in his play where he does n't really know whether he 's a woman or whether he 's a man .
[ shots of boy who has made a montage of a pretty girl with lots of diamonds and an engagement ring ]
Therapist :
He was out of control .
Sometimes he'd be physically violent and sometimes that would develop then into spitting , sometimes weeing in a playroom , sometimes weeing over the therapist .
He was also highly eroticised , both with adults and with the other children , which meant that there would be a lot of sexual wriggling - he would get his penis out and wave it around - that kind of sexualised stuff , and trying to do very sexy kisses with the other children and with staff .
[ shots of boy hugging with baby doll , saying he had a baby in the night , and then kissing it on the mouth ]
Therapist :
He understands about nice kissing and safe kissing , but when he was holding the baby clearly the kissing started to get very unsafe .
He had looked to me to make sure that I had understood that the kissing was unsafe .
So an issue for him is unsafe kissing with babies - which of course was his experience .
Therapist :
Some of them become eternal victims and never recover from that .
Other children like this little boy will mask their confusions and go into adulthood and never really be able to sustain relationships or have very distorted relationships because of their enormous confusions .
And there are other children who will go on to hurt not only other children in their own childhood but in adulthood .
250,000 children abused by women
Narrator :
It 's thought more than 250,000 people in this country have been abused as children by women .
While not everyone who has been harmed goes on to abuse , it is thought about 5 % do .
So what is it that makes them do it and others not ?
Jacqui :
Women in our society have been portrayed as victims .
And yes I 'm not disputing that nearly all women who sexually abuse children were in my research were themselves very victimised , but somewhere within their victimisation they learned that to abuse children gave them a sense of power , control , agency , that they 'd not had any other in their life .
And therefore they used the abuse of children to gain those things .
Zoe
Narrator :
The natural compulsion of a mother to love and protect her child can be destroyed by years of abuse .
One such woman who went on to abuse claims she saw her baby as a mere object .
Zoe :
I was about 22 , I 'd just divorced my husband .
My sons - one was two and the other was a babe in arms - and the eldest son , I changed his nappy and masturbated him - once .
I felt sick at what I was doing .
I felt angry at what I was doing .
I did n't do it for pleasure , it was more our anger for what their dad had done to me .
It was a day when I had just finished decorating the bedroom with my eldest brother .
He had sexually abused me and I was so angry at what he had done that the anger came out by masturbating my son .
Interviewer :
What effect has what you did consequently had on your sons ?
Zoe :
Both my sons are sexual abusers .
My eldest son is in prison now for what he 's done .
Interviewer :
What has he done ?
Zoe :
Sexually abused a nine year old boy .
Interviewer :
Do you feel responsible for the way he 's turned out ?
Zoe :
Badly
Interviewer :
Why 's that ?
Zoe :
Because if I had n't done what I 'd done to him he would n't be like he is now .
Narrator :
Zoe was jailed for four years on three counts of indecent assault .
While she was in prison she was ostracised but not treated .
Now she 's back in the community and still considered a risk to children .
Concluding comments
Jacqui :
There 's very very little being done to look at the issue of female sexual abuse .
We have no programmes in this country that are aimed at working with female sexual offenders specifically .
Quite a lot of professionals are picking up women offenders now .
What they 're not doing is having the resources to help them deal with these women offenders .
It 's because so many professionals are now getting to pick up women offenders that we are now getting to realise some of the extent of the problem throughout the country .
Narrator :
Few abusers ever volunteer their guilt , and behind closed doors it is difficult to prove .
A woman 's traditional role in the home as a mother often puts her above suspicion , and medical evidence is hard to obtain .
But as more and more women 's victims come forward and speak out they may just force us to face up to the ultimate taboo .
Reuters : Bush urges halt of CO2 emission growth by 2025
Background
President Bush , several months after the Bali climate conference , has announced the United States of America ’s new climate policy : he wants our emissions to stop growing by the year 2025 .
That ’s right , he wants them to stop growing .
Not to go down , but to stop growing .
Make sure you understand that part .
Also note , the president announced little ( if any ) plans that would actually stop emissions from growing .
Analysis
Now , there are principally three reasons for this :
1 . To pressure China , India and other developing countries to start thinking about climate change
2 . To speed up talks on a new international emissions treaty
Also , the initiative builds on the Administration ’s new willingness to take a chance with an international treaty .
More needs to be done
This proposal obviously lacks any substance .
First of all , only stopping emissions from growing by 2025 is too little , too late .
The other problem , of course , is that Bush did n’t actually give any ideas on how to actually reduce emissions .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A consumer advocacy group petitioned the government Thursday to pull the birth control patch off the market , calling it far riskier than the pill .
“ Ortho - Evra is a poor choice for women , ” Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the group , Public Citizen , wrote the Food and Drug Administration .
Warnings about the Ortho - Evra weekly patch have escalated since a 2005 investigation by The Associated Press found that patch users had higher rates of life - threatening blood clots than did women who took birth control pills .
Blood clots are a rare side effect for estrogen - related products .
Some studies of the risk suggest that patch users have twice the risk of clots in the legs and lungs as do women who swallow the pill because patients absorb up to 60 percent more estrogen with the patch .
The Food and Drug Administration updated the patch ’s label in 2005 , 2006 and earlier this year with clot warnings .

Double standards when it comes to children are pretty appalling — especially when it comes to “ our ” kids vs. “ their ” kids , but here in America they are n’t limited to just right - wingers .
Take reaction to the US Supreme Court ’s latest ruling that you cannot execute rapists — even those who rape children — on the theory that only killing someone justifies execution .
Politicians who make their careers by promoting state sponsored murder have been quick to condemn this latest “ liberal outrage ” by calling for more laws that would make execution the punishment for raping a child ( admittedly a monstrous crime ) .
" Anybody in the country who cares about children should be outraged that we have a Supreme Court that would issue a decision like this , " says Republican Alabama Attorney General Troy King , who said the court ’s 5 - 4 decision makes America “ a less safe place to grow up . ”
Even Barack Obama has weighed in , along with John McCain , in condemning the court ’s decision , saying that states should be free to pass death statutes for child rape .
Texas Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst , supporting death for “ repeat child molesters , says , “ Our top priority remains protecting our most precious resource — our children . "
( Huh ?
I thought in Texas it was oil . )
Then there ’s the FBI ’s latest sweeping busts of child prostitution rings , which rescued 21 juveniles from sex - selling rings .
In announcing the arrests of some 300 people , FBI Director Robert Mueller said , " Our top priority in these cases has always been to identify children victims and move swiftly to remove them from these dangerous environments . ”
" These kids are victims , ” said Ernie Allen , president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
“ They lack the ability to walk away .
This is the 21st - century slavery . "
The question is , where are Mueller and Allen and these allegedly concerned politicians when it comes to children who are forced or lured into fighting against the US , whether in Afghanistan or Iraq ?
Where are they when those children are captured by US military forces and incarcerated with adult captives in hell - holes like Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan , Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , or Guantanamo , where there was a special children ’s section called Camp Iguana ?
I certainly have n’t heard a word from either Obama or that famous POW John McCain in defense of America ’s child war prisoners .
Take Omar Khadr , shot and then captured and tortured by US forces at the tender age of 15 in 2002 in Afghanistan and held for six years in Guantanamo .
Last week , I reported on his story and on plans to try him by military tribunal as a terrorist because he had dared , allegedly , to toss a grenade at US Special Forces troops who had called in an air strike on him and several adult fighters , killing one US soldier ( at least one witness to the incident , a US soldier , says it was not Khadr who three the grenade ) .
Nobody ’s saying that Khadr was a victim .
Nobody ’s saying that he “ lacked the ability to walk away ” from the Taliban forces that his father and older brothers had him join at the age of 14 a year before .
Nobody ’s saying he should be “ identified ” and “ removed from these dangerous environments . ”
Nobody in government or in child protection organizations is even investigating to see if Khadr , as a 15 - year - old captive , was tortured !
Indeed , the US has been blocking both Khadr ’s military defense attorney and his Canadian lawyer ( Khadr is a Canadian citizen ) from getting military records giving the details of his capture and subsequent treatment .
Canadian journalist Chris Cook reports that the Canadian government actually argued in Canadian court against releasing the US reports in its possession fearing that doing so might “ upset relations ” between Canada and the United States .
( The Canadian Supreme Court in May rejected that pathetically subservient claim by a 9 - 0 vote , ordering full disclosure . )
The thing is , Khadr is just one of at least 2500 children who have been captured and held as “ enemy combatants ” by the US in the Bush / Cheney so - called “ War ” on Terror .
Like child prostitutes , these captives , if they were even actually involved in operations against the US ( who would know , since they ’ve never been given hearings in court , and since in many cases the evidence , such as it is , against them is the result of torture , either of the children themselves , or of others ) , are at worst child soldiers , who can not be held responsible for their actions .
Indeed , under the UN Charter and the Geneva Convention , as amended by a protocol signed by the US in 2002 , any of them who , at the time of their capture , were under 18 , as was Khadr , are to be considered not POWs or “ enemy combatants , ” but rather victims , who need care and treatment .
Aside from Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , who has filed an article of impeachment against President Bush , charging him with a war crime for holding these children , and for authorizing rules of engagement that have encouraged the killing of children as young as 14 , who are “ presumed ” to be combatants , and for the six other members of the House who have co-signed his impeachment bill ( Rep. Robert Wexler , D-FL , Rep. Barbara Lee , D- CA , Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D- CA , Rep. Tammy Baldwin , D - WI , Rep. Maurice Hinchey , D-NY , and Rep. Sam Farr , D - CA ) , no members of Congress have called for the protection of children captured or held by US military forces .

OPW INTERVIEW -- Apr 25 -- Ashley Madison is for those already in relationships to find a ' bit on the side ' as we say in England .
Its the site I most love to hate , but , bless 'em , they fulfill a need and make great money doing so .
We asked the CEO of Ashley Madison if he'd be OK with his wife using Ashley Madison .
See his answer below ... - Mark Brooks
What is Ashley Madison , who are your members , and how did the name come about ?
Ashley Madison is the largest dating service of its kind catering to like minded adults who are already in a committed relationship .
Our members are people who find themselves attached at this stage in their lives , and in many instances , in otherwise very happy marriages or with great family situations , but they 're physically or emotionally unfulfilled .
What they seek at Ashley Madison is someone who understands those needs .
The name is fictitious and based on the two most popular girl 's names in 2001 when the founder of the service , Darren Morgenstern , came up with the concept .
What makes your site stand out from the competition ?
I think we 're unique , one of the only sites in this niche , and we 're definitely the originator .
The genesis of the business itself was a report that stated that upwards of 30 to 35 percent of people on singles dating services were actually attached , and so we thought ' what if you could create a site where you did n't have to lie about your personal circumstances ? '
You could put your hand up and say ' this is who I am ; this is my situation in life .
I 'm still looking to meet someone else to fill a void and not create any additional risks for myself . '
That 's the uniqueness of the Ashley Madison model .
How does your service help people improve the quality of their lives ?
Ironically , we 've actually preserved a number of relationships and marriages in the sense that many people suffer from a lack of physical or emotional intimacy .
Other aspects of their lives are going well , great career , incredible children , extended family , but there is just a certain critical element to their life that they 're not happy with .
With Ashley Madison , they have a chance to explain that and not be judged for it , because everybody knows the nature of the service when they join .
Here 's a chance to meet someone like - minded .
All of a sudden , when that void is filled , they can be an even better parent , a better spouse or partner to whomever they 're with in their life .
But why would anyone who was n't looking for a marital split want to openly broadcast their cheating ?
Statistics show that approximately 60 % of people are somehow involved in cheating in their relationship .
It 's almost a DNA pull , a fact of life , and we battle against it all the time .
People wrestle with the whole notion .
When they 've finally made the determination that this is what they need to do for themselves , the next move can be challenging .
The work place is fraught with problems .
Someone could lose his or her job ; you could misread a cue .
If you visit a prostitute , you could end up with an STD .
You could have a stigma attached to you for breaking the law .
There are so many problems .
If you come to a service like ours , you can at least mitigate the risks .
You still take a risk ; I want to be clear .
Anytime you do this you take a risk , but if you 've been thinking about it , then you tend to approach it in a different way .
How do you check for fraudulence ?
We review every single profile and photo prior to releasing it to our membership base .
We remove anyone that we find to be fraudulent , solicitous , or problematic .
Soliciting is veiled prostitution .
We just wo n't allow that kind of behavior to take place .
We have a fraud check system that we 've built up over years and a huge customer care staff who monitor 24/ 7 .
We know what our members need and we need to protect them .
How do you protect members ( who post photos ) from their snoopy spouses ?
Many singles will post a public photo but very few attached people do so .
Most photos are posted to a private showcase section .
The release of those require a key in exchange with another member only after you 've built a relationship and have a sense of who they are and what they 're about .
I 've never , in all of our existence , come across one story of a spouse catching another spouse on Ashley Madison .
When they do get caught , it 's for other reasons .
It could be that they did n't clear their cookie on their computer , or the like .
Have you used your own service ?
I 'm married with two kids , and I hope that I 'm not one of those people who find a need for a service like mine – but clearly it 's out there .
Would you be okay with your wife using your service ?
No .
If my wife were using my service , or any dating service , or if I even found her on Facebook chatting with former boyfriends and not telling me about it , I would be emotionally hurt beyond belief , and would feel that our relationship had severe problems .
To me , a healthy relationship is one where there is communication and honesty and emotional and physical connectivity .
I would hope that that is what is going on in my current relationship , and if not , I 'd have to look at myself , and my responsibilities .
But if my wife were engaging in such a service , then clearly our relationship would be in trouble .
Is there anything that you want a perspective client to know ?
We do our research .
We try to understand what you need , and refine our products and services for that .
This is n't about judging , it 's an open platform , and what you 'll find is that no matter who you are , the housewife who just has n't been complimented or paid attention to in ages , the woman who just really likes being with married men because that 's what she wants , or you 're with someone you do n't want to marry , maybe you want to trade up ; if you relate , then you 're going to find someone compatible .
It 's a wide slice of life with real people , and I think that 's the great part of our service .
It has the elements of a thriller : a shadowy group of right - wing former soldiers , a mafia don , extremist lawyers and politicians ; hand - grenades in a rucksack ; plots to kill the Prime Minister and a Nobel - prize winning writer ; allegedly planted evidence and falsified wire taps .
Even the name of the villains - the Ergenekon network - has an airport paperback flavour , and the stakes involved are high : the stability of one of the world 's most strategically important countries .
This highly charged political reality is splitting Turkey .
In the coming days the Ergenekon investigation will reach its climax .
According to newspaper reports , a long - awaited indictment will be issued by the state prosecutor .
After successive waves of arrests , 47 people are in custody .
They include senior figures in the ultra - right - wing Workers '
Party , a dozen retired senior army officers , journalists and a lawyer accused of launching legal attacks that drove Nobel award - winning writer Orhan Pamuk from his homeland .
Crimes being blamed on Ergenekon include a series of murderous bomb blasts , a grenade attack on a newspaper , the murder of an Italian bishop and the killing last year of Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink - all aimed , investigators believe , at creating a climate of terror and chaos propitious to a military coup that would depose Turkey 's moderate Islamist government .
The coup attempt has revealed deep divisions in Turkey 's 73 million - strong population over the country 's identity : pro-European or anti-European , fiercely nationalist , ethnically homogeneous and militaristic , or globalised and pro-Western , more or less Islamic , more or less sunk in historical bitterness and dark conspiracy theories .
' The cleavage is deep : every institution , every social class , everybody is divided , ' said Professor Murat Belge of Bigli University , Istanbul , an analyst .
' I am deeply apprehensive about what is going on now and what might happen . '
But for Mehmet Demirlek , a lawyer defending a colleague accused of being a key member of Ergenekon , the allegations are ' imaginary ' .
' There is not a shred of truth in them , ' he said .
' This is 100 per cent political .
It has all been cooked up by the government and by the imperialist powers , the CIA , Mossad and the Jewish lobby and the European Union to eliminate Turkish nationalism .
There is no such thing as Ergenekon . '
His imprisoned client , Kemal Kerincsiz , told The Observer in an interview prior to his arrest he was a ' patriot fighting the disintegration of the nation ' .
For Fethiye Cetin , a lawyer representing Hrant Dink 's family , Ergenekon has ' existed for years ' .
' A small part of what has been previously hidden is being exposed .
Call it the " deep state " . '
An investigation was launched by state prosecutors after 27 hand - grenades , said to be the make used by the military , were found in a home in a rundown part of Istanbul last June .
Investigators claim that they later uncovered an underground network dedicated to extremist nationalist agitation .
Wire taps led to further finds of explosives , weapons and documents listing security arrangements of senior political and military figures and death lists .
The papers supposedly proving Ergenekon - the name of a mythic mountain in Asia where the ancestors of the Turkic peoples escaped the Mongols - was set up in 1999 as a clandestine and violent organisation aimed of maintaining a reactionary , purist vision of a strong , militaristic Turkey , the heritage , the extremists believed , of the founder of the nation , Kemal Ataturk .
The plotters tap ' into a psyche that is based on a new and extreme nationalism ' , said Cengiz Candar , one of Turkey 's most prominent journalists .
' The idea is that to preserve Turkey it is necessary and legitimate to resist in any way .
And anyone who is pro-European , liberal , who argues for increased rights for minorities and so on is a traitor . '
According to Candar , this new nationalism is the result of a coincidence of factors : the difficulties of Turkey 's accession to the European Union , soul - searching over nation identity generated by the debate on Europe , the emergence of a strong , semi-autonomous Kurdish state in post - Saddam Iraq with all the potential implications that has for Turkey 's large Kurdish population , and , perhaps most importantly , the continuing electoral success of the AKP , the Justice and Development party , the moderate Islamist party led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan to power in 2002 .
' With no way of ousting them through democratic means , other means become attractive to the extremist nationalists .
This country has a long tradition of such actions , ' said Candar .
Turkey 's political history has been marked by interventions by the army , each preceded by a period of violent instability and each justified by the need to preserve the constitution and the nation .
The repeated electoral success of the AKP , its social and economic policies , its pro-European , pro-free market stance , the growth of newly wealthy , religiously conservative middle classes who vote for Erdogan and his colleagues and the party 's break with Turkey 's fiercely secular ideology - all threaten the nation 's powerful military and bureaucratic establishment .
A legal bid to ban the party - on the grounds that it wants to impose Sharia law on Turkey and thus overturn the constitution - is one tactic , AKP party loyalists say .
Violence and the activities of Ergenekon is another .
' How long are these people going to keep their power when it is incompatible with a European , fully democratic Turkey ? ' asked Belge .
' And how big is Ergenekon ?
Who are they ?
How high does it go ?'
No official military spokesman would comment but General Haldun Solmazturk , who retired three years ago , told The Observer ' the Ergenekon group is trivial , barely worthy of attention ' , saying that though ' it was possible ' a few military officers might have become involved in the group , the vast majority of Turkish soldiers were ' committed to maintaining democracy ' .
Solmazturk , who said that his own views ' reflected those of most senior soldiers ' , insisted ' there are far more grave problems facing Turkey than a handful of right - wing crazies ' .
Instead , he said , it was the government that worried him .
' The AKP are a concern .
There is no such thing as moderate Islam .
Either a government is influenced by religion or it is n't .
And if it is , then it is not secular and not democratic , ' he said .
' We want to move democracy forward , they want to move it back and we are approaching a point of no return . '
In a rundown working - class suburb of Istanbul , far from the tourist sights of the historic centre , the deputy chairman of the Nationalist Action Party in the city , Nazmi Celenk , made an effort to show his party 's moderate side .
' In Turkey we are on the front line of the clash of civilisations , ' he said .
' We are the natural allies of America and Britain in this region .
Our future is in Europe - but not necessarily in the European Union . '
Yet Celenk was critical of last week 's reform of Turkey 's strict rules on ' insulting Turkishness ' , pushed through parliament in the face of fierce resistance from the 70 deputies from his own party .
If he was in power , Celenk said , the tight laws on freedom of expression would be maintained .
And , if he had the power , he would invade Syria and split the state between Turkey and Iraq .
The violent Kurdish activism in the south - east of his country would be solved ' in 24 hours ' .
A street away , a group of mechanics and local shopkeepers played backgammon .
They said they were worried by rising crime , drug use and low wages , but would not vote for the nationalists .
' They try and cause fights between us to get votes , ' Hikmet , a bus owner , said .
Fethiye Cetin , the Dink family lawyer , is still optimistic despite the tensions .
She discovered her own minority roots - an Armenian grandmother - at the age of 25 .
' This period is the peak of aggressive nationalism in Turkey , but there is still peace , ' she said in her small office on a hill above the blue waters of the Sea of Marmara .
' But everyone always focuses on the negative side and never on the tens of millions who live together without any trouble at all . '
Victim of the plot ?
Hrant Dink was a 52 - year - old journalist , assassinated in January 2007 .
As co-founder of Agos , a newspaper published in both Turkish and Armenian , he became a prominent member of the Armenian minority in Turkey and pushed for Turkish - Armenian reconciliation and human rights .
Dink was shot in Istanbul by Ogün Samast , a 17 - year old Turkish nationalist .
100,000 mourners turned out to Dink 's funeral to chant : ' We are all Armenians ' .
When people ask me how they should get into blogging as a part time or full time job , I think carefully before I answer as I have seen great success as a network backed blogger , while only receiving what I consider moderate success on my own outside of the network .
Being a blogger backed by a network can be a great experience , but sometimes it can also be very frustrating .
My days are filled with posting quotas that I did n’t set myself , with posting requirements on sites that I do n’t particularly enjoy , writing content that I do n’t control , and hoping that it does well enough that the company keeps me on .
All the while dealing with the fact that I do n’t control how the site functions or the advertising that goes next to the words I write .
I consider it to be very similar to working as a reporter for a newspaper .
Blogging for myself , I get to chose how often I post , and where I post .
I get to chose how the sites function , and how they are monetized and promoted .
It is a very different feeling , but you can also see the advantages of blogging for a network .
I never have to worry about servers , advertising , monetization , WordPress upgrades , design , branding , or promotion .
My key focus is content , and everything else is someone else ’s problem .
It allows me to create more , and worry less , all the while knowing I will get paid for the effort I put in .
I do n’t know many bloggers working for themselves that after a month can expect the type of pay checks that network backed bloggers will receive .
As the web gets more competitive , and more blogs are added , I feel like I can recommend blogging as a business on your own , less and less .
While there are many sacrifices being made as a blog network backed blogger , I do n’t know if I would be where I am today if it was n’t for Darren Rowse , Paul Scrivens , Jacob Gower , and Mark Saunders .
If you want more details on what it is like to be a network backed blogger , I suggest you check out Jennifer Chait ’s and Deborah Ng ’s Network Blogging Tips .

" Relax , Celebrate Victory , " by Richard Perle
( Op - ed article in USA Today ) ( 520 ) ( This byliner by Richard Perle , a member of the Defense Policy Board , first appeared in USA Today May 2 and is in the public domain .
No republication restrictions . ) ( begin byliner ) Relax , Celebrate Victory Richard Perle From start to finish , President Bush has led the United States and its coalition partners to the most important military victory since World War II .
And like the allied victory over the axis powers , the liberation of Iraq is more than the end of a brutal dictatorship :
It is the foundation for a decent , humane government that will represent all the people of Iraq .
This was a war worth fighting .
It ended quickly with few civilian casualties and with little damage to Iraq 's cities , towns or infrastructure .
It ended without the Arab world rising up against us , as the war 's critics feared , without the quagmire they predicted , without the heavy losses in house - to - house fighting they warned us to expect .
It was conducted with immense skill and selfless courage by men and women who will remain until Iraqis are safe , and who will return home as heroes .
In full retreat , the war 's opponents have now taken up new defensive positions : " Yes , it was a military victory , but you have n't found Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . "
Or , " Yes , we destroyed Saddam 's regime , but now other dictators will try even harder to develop weapons of mass destruction to make sure they will not fall to some future American preemptive strike . "
We will find Saddam 's well - hidden chemical and biological weapons programs , but only when people who know come forward and tell us where to look .
While Saddam was in power , even a hint about his concealment and deception was a death sentence , often by unimaginable torture against whole families .
Saddam had four years to hide things .
We have had a few weeks to find them .
Patience -- and some help from free Iraqis -- will be rewarded .
The idea that our victory over Saddam will drive other dictators to develop chemical and biological weapons misses the key point :
They are already doing so .
That 's why we may someday need to preempt rather than wait until we are attacked .
Iran , Syria , North Korea , Libya , these and other nations are relentless in their pursuit of terror weapons .
Does anyone seriously argue that they would abandon their programs if we had left Saddam in power ?
It is a little like arguing that we should not subdue knife - wielding criminals because , if we do , other criminals will go out and get guns .
Moreover , this argument , deployed by those who will not take victory for an answer , confuses cause and effect :
Does any peaceful state that neither harbors terrorists nor seeks weapons of mass destruction fear that we will launch a preemptive strike against it ?
Who are they ?
Why would they ?
Iraqis are freer today and we are safer .
Relax and enjoy it .

Archaeologists believe they have found more evidence of the 1880 gun battle between Ned Kelly 's gang and police at Glenrowan , in central Victoria .
Bullet fragments were uncovered during excavations at the former Anne Jones Inn site earlier this month .
Now archaeologists have revealed that two bullet cartridges from a Martini - Henry rifle were discovered in the northern section of the site on Friday afternoon .
Excavations Director , Adam Ford believes they came from weapons that would have been used by police at the time .
" They [ the cartridges ] were only released to the police approximately two weeks before the siege event , " he said .
" They were superseded reasonably quickly after the event .
I mean within a couple of years .
S I feel quite certain that they are physical evidence of the gun battle . "
From the Libertarian Party of North Carolina , as reported by IPR member libertypoint :
RALEIGH â€ ” A Superior Court judge ruled May 27 that â€ œthere is no fundamental right for a voter to vote for the party of their choiceâ€  and threw out the state Libertarian Partyâ€™s challenge to North Carolinaâ€™s elections laws .
Judge Robert Hobgood ruled in the lawsuit filed by the Libertarian and Green parties challenging the legality of the Stateâ€™s elections laws under the North Carolina Constitution .
â€ œWeâ€™re deeply saddened by this ruling , â€ said Barbara Howe , LPNC chair .
â€ œNot only did the judge support the Stateâ€™s power to take away our right to choose who represents us , he also upheld the Stateâ€™s assertion that North Carolina voters are not smart enough to fill out a so - called long ballot.â€ 
â€ œThis is a very sad day for representative government , â€ she said .
The judge agreed with the Stateâ€™s argument that the number of elected offices that may appear on the ballot in Presidential election years , along with the use of optical scanning equipment , can cause â€œvoter confusion.â€ 
â€ œThe more parties there are that are recognized by the State and that place candidates on the ballot , the greater the chance there is for ballots that are so long as to be unwieldy and to risk voter confusion and frustration of the electoral process , â€ Judge Hobgood wrote .
â€ œIn effect , the State says North Carolina voters are not as smart as Iraqis , who had more than 100 parties to choose from in their elections , â€ 
Howe said .
The party now has to decide whether it can afford to appeal this decision .
â€ œWe are out of money , having spent nearly $ 140,000 already to get back on the ballot , â€ she said .
â€ œWhether we appeal or not , the Libertarian Party is not going away .
We will continue to fight for our rights and the rights of all North Carolinians , â€ 
Howe concluded .

A British company has come up with a camera that surprisingly enough , goes against all things prude in Britain .
This unique camera has the special ability to detect various items such as weapons , drugs and even explosives hidden under one ’s clothes from up to 25 meters away , making this a potential breakthrough where the security industry is concerned .
Dubbed the T5000 camera from ThruVision , it utilizes “ passive imaging technology ” that helps identify objects via their natural electromagnetic rays , also known as Terahertz or T - rays which are emitted .
This high - powered camera boasts the ability to detect hidden objects from up to 80 feet away , and can work just fine even when people are moving .
For those who are extremely shy about their bodies and scream about privacy rights , rest assured – it wo n’t be able to reveal physical body details while the entire screening process is harmless .
It is inevitable that this technology will see action on both the military and civilian fronts , being used in places like crowded airports , shopping malls and sporting events .
With rampant acts of terrorism having shaken up the free world over the past years , it is imperative that security precautions need to be tightened in order to prevent a repeat of 9/11 and the London bombings .
According to Clive Beattue , CEO of ThruVision , “ Acts of terrorism have shaken the world in recent years and security precautions have been tightened globally .
The ability to see both metallic and non-metallic items on people out to 25 meters is certainly a key capability that will enhance any comprehensive security system . ”
Since everyone and all objects emit low levels of electromagnetic radiation , this camera will be able to pick up all and sundry on a person .
Depending on the type of material , they will feature different wave signatures , enabling surveillance officers to tell the difference between a block of clay and cocaine , or a knife and a bunch of keys .
Anything to make the world a safer place I guess .

Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana is a different kind of hard core right - winger .
Like any loyal Republican , he has the consistent record against abortion and for guns .
But Burton takes things a step further , into crazy - land .
In 1990 , Burton introduced legislation that would impose the death penalty on drug dealers .
( He ’s lucky it did n’t pass , because Burton ’s son would later be arrested for transporting multiple pounds of marijuana across state lines . )
When the House passed a measure prohibiting members from accepting gifts and free trips from lobbyists , the vote was 430 - 1 . Burton was the one .
Time once reported that Burton thought the Clinton White House bugged his phones , and that he was “ so afraid of catching AIDS that he brings his own scissors to the House barbershop and refuses to eat soup at public restaurants . ”
But his conservativism and his nuttiness are n’t what he ’s known for .
Burton is best known as one of the most vicious attack dogs in Congress when Bill Clinton was president .
He led the investigation into Democratic fundraising abuse , even though he has his own questions about fundraising ethics .
He called the president a “ scumbag ” and said “ no one , regardless of what branch of government they serve , should be allowed to get away with these alleged sexual improprieties , ” even though he has fathered a child out of wedlock .
In 1998 , he released edited transcripts of prison audiotape from Webster Hubbell , an act so partisan and sloppy that it brought rebuke from even Newt Gingrich .
And the coup de grâce : Burton was so dogged in his pursuit of the Vince Foster allegations that he shot a pumpkin in his backyard with a pistol , to mimic the alleged murder .
And now , finally , it appears Burton may get the boot .
The 13 - term Congressman , who routinely wins reelection by wide margins , is facing a Republican primary challenger named John McGoff , who , as a member of the National Guard , flew missions into Iraq and Afghanistan as a flight surgeon .
McGoff says that he was once an active Burton supporter , but now he ’s simply had enough .
According to the Indianopolis Star , McGoff ’s plan to put ethics at the center of his campaign is making serious headway among Indiana voters .
It helps that Burton , who has drastically outspent his opponent , has more less validated the strategy by spending $ 190,000 in taxpayers ’ dollars on constituent mailings that look suspiciously like campaign advertisements .
Perhaps instead of running a pro-ethics campaign , McGoff can run an anti-blockhead campaign .
Since I gave up hope , I feel better .
More than any time in history , mankind now faces a crossroads .
One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness , the other to total extinction .
Let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly .
— Woody Allen
Food riots , in dozens of countries , in the 21st century .
Is this what we envisioned during the post - World War Two , moon - landing 20th century as humankind ’s glorious future ?
It ’s not the end of the world , but you can almost see it from here .
American writer Henry Miller ( 1891 - 1980 ) once asserted that the role of the artist was to “ inoculate the world with disillusionment ” .
So just in case you — for whatever weird reason — cling to the belief / hope that the United States can be a positive force in ending or slowing down the new jump in world hunger , here are some disillusioning facts of life .
On December 14 , 1981 a resolution was proposed in the United Nations General Assembly which declared that “ education , work , health care , proper nourishment , national development are human rights ” .
Notice the “ proper nourishment ” .
The resolution was approved by a vote of 135 - 1 .
The United States cast the only “ No ” vote .
A year later , December 18 , 1982 , an identical resolution was proposed in the General Assembly .
It was approved by a vote of 131 - 1 .
The United States cast the only “ No ” vote .
The following year , December 16 , 1983 , the resolution was again put forth , a common practice at the United Nations .
This time it was approved by a vote of 132 - 1 .
There ’s no need to tell you who cast the sole “ No ” vote .
These votes took place under the Reagan administration .
Under the Clinton administration , in 1996 , a United Nations - sponsored World Food Summit affirmed the “ right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food ” .
The United States took issue with this , insisting that it does not recognize a “ right to food ” .
Washington instead championed free trade as the key to ending the poverty at the root of hunger , and expressed fears that recognition of a “ right to food ” could lead to lawsuits from poor nations seeking aid and special trade provisions .
The situation of course did not improve under the administration of George W. Bush .
In 2002 , in Rome , world leaders at another U.N. - sponsored World Food Summit again approved a declaration that everyone had the right to “ safe and nutritious food ” .
The United States continued to oppose the clause , again fearing it would leave them open to future legal claims by famine - stricken countries .
Along with petitioning American leaders to become decent human beings we should be trying to revive the population control movement .
Birth rates must be radically curbed .
All else being equal , a markedly reduced population count would have a markedly beneficial effect upon global warming and food and water availability ( not to mention finding a parking spot and lots of other advantages ) .
People , after all , are not eating more .
There are simply more / too many people .
Some favor limiting families to two children .
Others argue in favor of one child per family .
Still others , who spend a major part of each day digesting the awful news of the world , are calling for a limit of zero .
( The Chinese government recently announced that the country would have about 400 million more people if it was n’t for its limit of one or two children per couple . )
And as long as we ’re fighting for hopeless causes , let ’s throw in the demand that corporations involved in driving the cost of oil through the roof — and dragging food costs with it — must either immediately exhibit a conspicuous social conscience or risk being nationalized , their executives taken away in orange jumpsuits , handcuffs , and leg shackles .
The same for other corporations and politicians involved in championing the replacement of food crops with biofuel crops or exploiting any of the other steps along the food - chain system which puts bloated income ahead of putting food in people ’s mouths .
We ’re not speaking here of weather phenomena beyond the control of man , we ’re speaking of men making decisions , based not on people ’s needs but on pseudo - scientific , amoral mechanisms like supply and demand , commodity exchanges , grain futures , selling short , selling long , and other forms of speculation , all fed and multiplied by the proverbial herd mentality — a system governed by only two things : fear and greed ; not a rational way to feed a world of human beings .
The Wall Street Journal reports that grain - processing giant Archer - Daniels - Midland Co. said its quarterly profits “ jumped 42 % , including a sevenfold increase in net income in its unit that stores , transports and trades grains such as wheat , corn and soybeans .
…
Some observers think financial speculation has helped push up prices as wealthy investors in the past year have flooded the agriculture commodity markets in search of better returns . ”
At the same time , the French Agriculture Minister warned European Union officials against “ too much trust in the free market .
We must not leave the vital issue of feeding people to the mercy of market laws and international speculation . ”
It should be noted that the price of gasoline in the United States increases on a regular basis , but there ’s no shortage of supply .
There are no lines of cars waiting at gas stations .
And demand has been falling as financially - strapped drivers cut back on car use .
Intelligence agents without borders
When Andreas Papandreou assumed his ministerial duties in 1964 in the Greek government led by his father George Papandreou , he was shocked to discover an intelligence service out of control , a shadow government with powers beyond the authority of the nation ’s nominal leaders , a service more loyal to the CIA than to the Papandreou government .
This was a fact of life for many countries in the world during the Cold War , when the CIA could dazzle a foreign secret service with devices of technical wizardry , classes in spycraft , vital intelligence , unlimited money , and American mystique and propaganda .
Many of the world ’s intelligence agencies have long provided the CIA with information about their own government and citizens .
The nature of much of this information has been such that if a private citizen were to pass it to a foreign power he could be charged with treason .
Leftist Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa declared in April that Ecuador ’s intelligence systems were “ totally infiltrated and subjugated to the CIA , ” and accused senior Ecuadoran military officials of sharing intelligence with Colombia , the Bush administration ’s top ( if not only ) ally in Latin America .
The previous month missiles had been fired into a camp of the Colombian FARC rebels situated in Ecuador near the Colombian border , killing about 25 .
One of those killed was Franklin Aisalla , an Ecuadorean operative for the group .
It turned out that Ecuadorean intelligence officials had been tracking Aisalla , a fact that was not shared with the president , but apparently with Colombian forces and their American military advisers .
“ I , the president of the republic , found out about these operations by reading the newspaper , ” a visibly indignant Correa said .
“ This is not something we can tolerate . ”
He added that he planned to restructure the intelligence agencies so he would have greater direct control over them .
The FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) is routinely referred to in the world media as “ Marxist ” , but that designation has not been appropriate for many years .
The FARC has long been basically a criminal organization — kidnapings for ransom , kidnapings for no apparent reason , selling protection services to businesses , trafficking in drugs , fighting the Colombian Army to be free to continue their criminal ways or to revenge their comrades ’ deaths .
But Washington , proceeding from its declared ideology of “ If you ai n’t with us , you ’re against us ; in fact , if you ai n’t with us you ’re a terrorist ” , has designated FARC as a terrorist group .
Every stated definition of “ terrorist ” , from the FBI to the United Nations to the US criminal code makes it plain that terrorism is essentially a political act .
This should , logically , exclude FARC from that category but , in actuality , has no effect on Washington ’s thinking .
And now the Bush administration is threatening to add Venezuela to its list of “ nations that support terrorism ” , following a claim by Colombia that it had captured a computer belonging to FARC after the attack on the group ’s campsite in Ecuador .
A file allegedly found on the alleged computer , we are told , suggests that the Venezuelan government had channeled $ 300 million to FARC , and that FARC had appeared interested in acquiring 110 pounds of uranium .
What next ?
Chavez had met with Osama bin Laden at the campsite ?
Amongst the FARC members killed in the Colombian attack on Ecuador were several involved in negotiations to free Ingrid Betancourt , a former Colombian presidential candidate who also holds French citizenship and is gravely ill .
The French government and Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez have been very active in trying to win Betancourt ’s freedom .
Individuals collaborating with Chavez have twice this year escorted a total of six hostages freed by the FARC into freedom , including four former Colombian legislators .
The prestige thus acquired by Chavez has of course not made Washington ideologues happy .
If Chavez should have a role in the freeing of Betancourt — the FARC ’s most prominent prisoner — his prestige would jump yet higher .
The raid on the FARC camp has put an end to the Betancourt negotiations , at least for the near future .
The raid bore the fingerprints of the US military / CIA — a Predator drone aircraft dropped “ smart bombs ” after pinpointing the spot by monitoring a satellite phone call between a FARC leader and Chavez .
A Colombian Defense Ministry official admitted that the United States had provided his government with intelligence used in the attack , but denied that Washington had provided the weapons .
The New York Times observed that “ The predawn operation bears remarkable similarities to one carried out in late January by the United States in Pakistan . ”
So what do we have here ?
Washington has removed a couple of dozen terrorists ( or “ terrorists ” ) from the ranks of the living without any kind of judicial process .
Ingrid Betancourt continues her imprisonment , now in its sixth year , but another of Hugo Chavez ’s evil - commie plans has been thwarted .
And the CIA — as with its torture renditions — has once again demonstrated its awesome power : anyone , anywhere , anytime , anything , all laws domestic and international be damned , no lie too big .
“ After such knowledge , what forgiveness ? ” — T.S. Eliot
Barack Obama ’s pastor , Jeremiah Wright , held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington on April 28 , during which he was asked about his earlier statement that the US government had invented the HIV virus , which causes AIDS , “ as a means of genocide against people of color ” .
Wright did not offer any kind of evidence to support his claim .
Even more important , the claim makes little sense .
Why would the US government want to wipe out people of color ?
Undoubtedly , many government officials , past and present , have been racists , but the capitalist system at home and its imperialist brother abroad have no overarching ideological or realpolitik need for such a genocide .
During the seven decades of the Cold War , the American power elite was much more interested in a genocide of “ communists ” , of whatever color , wherever they might be found .
Many weapons which might further this purpose were researched , including , apparently , an HIV - like virus .
Consider this : On June 9 , 1969 , Dr. Donald M. MacArthur , Deputy Director , Research and Engineering , Department of Defense , testified before Congress :
Within the next 5 to 10 years , it would probably be possible to make a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from any known disease - causing organisms .
Most important of these is that it might be refractory [ resistant ] to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease .
Whether the United States actually developed such a microorganism and what it did with it has not been reported .
AIDS was first identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1981 .
It ’s certainly possible that the disease arose as a result of Defense Department experiments , and then spread as an unintended consequence .
If you think that our leaders , as wicked as they are , would not stoop to any kind of biological or chemical warfare against people , consider that in 1984 an anti-Castro Cuban exile , on trial in a New York court , testified that in the latter part of 1980 a ship traveled from Florida to Cuba with “ a mission to carry some germs to introduce them in Cuba to be used against the Soviets and against the Cuban economy , to begin what was called chemical war , which later on produced results that were not what we had expected , because we thought that it was going to be used against the Soviet forces , and it was used against our own people , and with that we did not agree . ”
It ’s not clear from the testimony whether the Cuban man thought that the germs would somehow be able to confine their actions to only Russians .
This was but one of many instances where the CIA or Defense Department used biological or chemical weapons against Cuba and other countries , including in the United States against Americans , at times with fatal consequences .
Breaking the media barrier
“ You take that framework of people feeling locked out , shut out , marginalized , disrespected , and you go from Iraq to Palestine to Israel , from Enron to Wall Street , from Katrina to the bungling of the Bush administration , to the complicity of the Democrats in not stopping him on the war , stopping him on the tax cuts …
If the Democrats ca n’t landslide the Republicans this year , they ought to just wrap up , close down , emerge in a different form .
You think the American people are going to vote for a pro-war John McCain who almost gives an indication he ’s the candidate of perpetual war , perpetual intervention overseas ? ”
Thus spaketh Ralph Nader as he announced his presidential candidacy to a national audience on NBC’s Meet the Press in February .
The next day his words appeared in the Washington Post , Kansas City Star , Associated Press , Fort Worth Star - Telegram , International Herald Tribune , and numerous other publications , news agencies , and websites around the world .
And other parts of his interview were also repeated , like this in the Washington Post : “ Let ’s get over it and try to have a diverse , multiple - choice , multiple - party democracy , the way they have in Western Europe and Canada . ”
This is why Ralph Nader runs for office .
To get our views a hearing in the mainstream media ( which we often , justifiably , look down upon but are forced to make use of ) , and offer Americans an alternative to the tweedledumb and tweedledumber political parties and their cookie - cutter candidates with their status - quo - long - live - the - empire souls .
Is Nader ’s campaign not eminently worthwhile ?
But as always , he faces formidable obstacles , amongst which is what H. L. Mencken once observed : “ The men the American people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars ; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth . ”

そこでテストにブラウザを使ってみよう。自動操作することで、テストの効率化をはかれる。
今回紹介するオープンソース・ソフトウェアはFirewatir、Firefoxを自動操作するソフトウェアだ。
FirewatirはIEをRubyを使って自動操作するソフトウェア、WatirのFirefox板とでも言うべきソフトウェアだ。実際、読み込むファイル等は違えども全体的な操作はWatirと同じスクリプトで動作する。
操作中のターミナ ル
実際の使い方 はFirewatirの提供するXPIをFirefoxにインストールし、JSSHを起動する。そしてGemを使ってFirewatirをインストールすると完了だ。ターミナルからFirefoxのオブジェクトと生成し、テキストボックスに入力し、サブミットすると言ったような操作も簡単にできる。
日本語が文字化けてしまう問題とFirefox3ではインストールできない問題があるものの、単なる操作であれば問題ない。繰り返しのテストに飽きる前に、irbを使って操作し、後はスクリプトでテストするようにしてしまえば開発効率が向上するだろう。

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama 's speech on race was a decisive factor in Bill Richardson 's endorsement of his presidential bid , the New Mexico governor revealed Saturday .
" I think what kind of clinched it for me , although I made a decision a week ago , was Sen .
Obama 's speech on race , " Richardson said on ABC's " Good Morning America . "
" He had this problem with his pastor .
He could have said nothing or glided through it .
Instead , he attacked the race issue head - on , talking about stereotypes , taking some very , very tough stances on this issue . "
Richardson , who had sought this year 's Democratic nomination for president himself , was referring to controversy surrounding racially charged comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's former pastor .
In his Tuesday speech , Obama denounced some of Wright 's comments but said he could not repudiate the man himself .
On Friday at a rally in Portland , Oregon , with Obama , Richardson praised the Democrat from Illinois for the speech , saying " he appealed to the best in us . "
Watch Richardson call Obama a ' once - in - a- lifetime leader ' »
Richardson , a former Clinton cabinet official , had been undecided for weeks after ending his own presidential run .
He said Saturday that he admired both former President Clinton and Sen. Hillary Clinton but that " there were a couple of times when I thought they got too negative , though . "
Another former Clinton White House aide , political strategist James Carville -- who is also a CNN political analyst -- told the New York Times in a story published Saturday that Richardson 's decision was an " act of betrayal . "
The endorsement " came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver , so I think the timing is appropriate , if ironic , " Carville said , referring to the Easter weekend .
On a Saturday conference call , Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said he did not share that assessment , telling reporters that " I do n't think it 's a question of betrayal .
Anyone is free to endorse whoever they want for whatever reasons they think are appropriate . "
He also dismissed the idea that Richardson 's decision might sway the superdelegate votes crucial to Clinton 's presidential hopes .
Wolfson said the former United Nations ambassador will not be in a position to argue that superdelegates should abide by the will of the voters , since Clinton won his home state of New Mexico .
As a governor , Richardson is a superdelegate .

The first signals from Giove - B were displayed on Esa 's giant screen Giove - B , a test satellite for Europe 's Galileo system , has sent its first navigation signals back to Earth .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) says the transmission is an " historic step " , showing that Galileo will be able to work alongside the US GPS system .
Giove - B carries the most accurate clock ever sent into orbit , key to its intended capacity of providing location information accurate to a metre .
The 30 - strong Galileo fleet is intended to be fully operational by 2013 .
These constellation satellites will closely resemble Giove - B , which was launched atop a Russian Soyuz rocket on 26 April .
This was a major step forward in creating Galileo
Dr Mike Healy , UK Astrium
The half - tonne , 2.4x1x1 m box assembled by EADS Astrium and Thales Alenia Space is the second demonstrator satellite to go into orbit following the launch of Giove - A in 2005 .
More sophisticated than its predecessor , it will test further the key Galileo technologies such as the atomic clocks that provide the precise timing underpinning all sat-nav applications .
Despite an early glitch in the system used for orienting the satellite in space , the orbiter now appears to be working well .
Under offer " Now with Giove - B broadcasting its highly accurate signal in space , we have a true representation of what Galileo will offer , " said the system 's project manager , Javier Benedicto .
The offer , he said , would include " the most advanced satellite positioning services , while ensuring compatibility and interoperability with GPS " .
GALILEO UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A European Commission and European Space Agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2013 Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real - time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety - critical roles where lives depend on service
Q&A : Europe 's Galileo project Engineers are now assessing the signal coming down to Earth .
They will be looking for any indications that it is affected by its passage through the atmosphere , and checking that it does not interfere with any systems that use neighbouring bands of the electromagnetic spectrum .
A fundamental focus in coming days will be the in - orbit behaviour of Giove - B's passive hydrogen maser clock .
It is the most stable clock ever put in permanent orbit , and is designed to keep time with an accuracy of better than one nanosecond ( billionth of a second ) in 24 hours .
As well as this and its two other atomic clocks , the demonstrator will check the generation of signals across the full spectrum that Galileo intends to use for its five sat -nav services .
Once engineers are happy with all this , the way will be clear to launch the first four satellites in the eventual constellation .
These so - called In - Orbit Validation ( IOV ) spacecraft are expected to fly in 2010 .
" We 're extremely proud of the critical role we have played on Giove - B , being responsible for the payload and ground segment , " commented Dr Mike Healy at UK Astrium .
" ' Hearing ' the new signal broadcast - this was a major step forward in creating Galileo .
It 's full speed ahead now for the IOV satellites , " he told BBC News .
The Galileo programme itself has seen its timeline slip on a number of occasions , and has come close to being abandoned .
Europe has already spent 1.6bn euros ( $ 2.5 bn ; £ 1.3 bn ) on the project , and ministers have warned that the additional 3.4bn euros ( $ 5.3bn ; £ 2.7 bn ) recently approved for sat -nav investments will be the limit on expenditure .
Galileo is envisaged as being technologically complementary to GPS , and is touted as a key high - technology venture for the EU .
Esa says that compared with using GPS alone , the combined systems " will provide higher accuracy in challenging environments where multipath and interference are present , and deeper penetration for indoor navigation " .

TEN years of watching “ Sex and the City , ” including the sanitized reruns on TBS , has trained a generation of label - and love - addled romantics not to raise an eyebrow , presuming Botox has n’t yet made that impossible , when Carrie Bradshaw dons a black Burberry coat and a trilby to go shopping , film noir style , at Duane Reade .
Or when Carrie wears a four - figure Nina Ricci sweater trimmed with hundreds of feathers while typing on a laptop in the privacy of her own home .
Or when Carrie crawls into Big ’s big bed , wearing makeup and a single strand of pearls .
With fashion , as with sex , fantasy is far more aesthetically pleasurable than the reality of , say , Alex McCord in “ The Real Housewives of New York City . ”
As far as fantasies go , “ Sex and the City , ” as a series on HBO , was to fashion what “ Hotel Erotica , ” on Cinemax , was to sex : unbelievably plastic porn , without all the messy bits or the credit card bills .
In the film version of “ Sex and the City , ” which opened on Friday , the fashion is jaw - droppingly fantastic , Herbal Essences good .
In two recent screenings in New York , the audience reacted most vocally  there literally was moaning  when Carrie , played by Sarah Jessica Parker , discovers that Mr. Big , her noncommittal boyfriend , played by Chris Noth , has built her a walk - in closet with carpeting and flattering lighting .
She hangs a single pair of $ 525 Manolo Blahnik shoes there as a dog would mark its territory .
( Oddly , this was not Mr. Blahnik ’s best effort , unless he was inspired by a foot fetish that involves blue leprechauns . )

Birds of a feather go to fashion shows together in the film , showing a more polished look than they did in the HBO series .

In the television series , broadcast from 1998 to 2004 , fashion  the industry , the designers , the clothes  was a regular character , cleverly manipulated by the stylist Patricia Field to refine the personalities of Carrie ( whimsical , eclectic ) , Miranda ( independent , biting ) , Samantha ( racy , sensational ) and Charlotte ( preppy , endearing ) .
Or maybe even 674 pages , the length of Douglas Feithâ€™s recent opus , War and Decision .
As you can imagine , Israel does not figure prominently in Feithâ€™s book , and you would never guess from reading it that , as early as 1996 , Feith â€ ” along with David Wurmser and their common mentor , Richard Perle â€ ” was already thinking that the ouster of Saddam Hussein was the key to transforming the regional balance of power decisively in favor of Israel , thus permitting a Likud - led Israel to make a â€œclean breakâ€ from the Oslo peace process and â€œsecure the realmâ€ of the West Bank , Gaza , the Golan Heights , as well as its pre-1967 borders .
I donâ€™t intend to review of the book , at least now .
But the map that appears next to Feithâ€™s â€ œIntroductionâ€  depicting Iraq and its neighbors as of 2003 offers some insight into his worldview and Israelâ€™s rightful place â€ ” or , more precisely , its size â€ ” within it :
Not much space for a Palestinian state , is there ?
Good strategic depth around Jerusalem .
Looks like the Golan isnâ€™t supposed to revert to Syria , either .
No suggestion of occupation .
Itâ€™s all Israeli .
Incidentally ,
In his book , Feith claims that it was Fred Ikle that got him the undersecretary for policy job , but I have it on excellent authority that it was Perle , the only man who Rumsfeld ( who himself referred to the West Bank and Gaza as â€œso - called occupied territoriesâ€ ) believes is his intellectual equal , whose recommendation was decisive .
And itâ€™s good to know that the Washington Post still considers Perle credible enough to give him space on its op - ed page to warn against the perils of multilateralism in dealing with Iran , as it did today .

They 've been taken for granted by political parties and candidates who stay in power by - and this was the apparent gist of Obama 's remarks - forcing attention and debate on issues tied to guns , religion and race ( precisely because such issues resonate ) rather than real problems such as health care and the economy .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - Worries about the health of the U.S. financial system , on the decline since mid-March , have snapped back as investors brace for more big loan losses at Lehman Brothers and other large investment banks .
The cost of buying insurance against bond defaults , one measure of investor fears of credit risk , have been rising for large , investment - grade companies in the last two weeks .
That 's a reversal of a trend in place since mid-March , when the Federal Reserve 's landmark decision to help bail - out Bear Stearns Cos. knocked down mounting fears of a Wall Street meltdown .
" There are some concerns rising a little bit again on the back of Lehman 's possible quarterly loss as well as the loss at British lender Bradford & Bingley ( BB ) , " said Juan Valencia , credit analyst at Societe Generale in London .
" The fears are about what banks have on their balance sheets , what they have n't disclosed , whether there are more writedowns coming , " he said .
This week , investors have homed in the possibility that Lehman Bros.
LEH , and others could report surprisingly large losses when they report earnings for their May fiscal quarter later this month , and in Lehman 's case , may need to drum up more capital to keep in good standing with creditors .
Standard & Poor 's articulated some these fears on Monday when it cut debt ratings for Lehman , Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % and Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % , citing concerns about further write - downs in their holdings of U.S. residential mortgage portfolios and residential construction loans .
Spreads on Markit 's index of North American , investment - grade credit default swaps rose to 110.5 basis points on Wednesday , or 27 % higher from their levels at the beginning of May .
Wider spreads in this index of large , mostly nonfinancial companies , indicate that investors want higher payments for insuring their counterparties against the risk a company will default on its debt , a sign of increasing nervousness .
Similarly , spreads on Markit 's iTraxx Europe index have climbed to 81 basis points , up 27 % from the start of May .
" The bias is definitely toward spreads widening again , " said Rajeev Shah , a credit portfolio strategist at BNP Paribas in London .
Investors outside the complex world of credit trades pay attention to these indexes because they can give a day - by - day snapshot of how optimistic investors are feeling about the health of financial markets .
Both indexes have fallen sharply after spiking in mid-March .
And these indexes also closely correlate with what happens in U.S. stock markets .
The S&P 500 SPX , - 0.48 % , which hit a 52 - week low on March 17 , about the time of the Bear Stearns rescue , has fallen 4 % since hitting a four - month high on May 19 .
It 's yet to retouch its 200 - day moving average .
Although the largest U.S. investment banks are n't part of the CDX or iTraxx Europe indexes , investors ' perception of their credit risk had made an outsized impact on these gauges .
That 's because their huge trading businesses make a secondary market for many types of loans and bonds .
Troubles in their own portfolios signal they could rein in some of their lending and trading activities , making it harder for companies in general to borrow .
Default risk for Lehman Brothers , which analysts say needs to raise more capital to avoid a ratings downgrade , have made the biggest jump amongst its peers .
Credit spreads widened to 274 basis points on Wednesday , up 85 % since May 1 , Markit says .
Read more on Lehman
Credit default swap spreads for Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have also widened since the start of May , though not by the same degree .
When Bear Stearns was on the brink of collapse , Lehman Brothers also faced rumors of an imminent liquidity crunch .
" Now the question being posed , " said BNP 's Shah , " is whether the Fed can come and rescue another financial institution , can sovereign wealth funds come in and rescue Lehman ? "
" These are the concerns the market is grappling with . "
Okay , okay - so this is n't the usual Daily Bunny fare , but it 's still pretty amazing ...
Check out this bunny recess gone awry , until ... the Chicken Teacher Aides step in to regulate !!
You can almost hear the bunnies get a talking - to ... and in the end , when the chickens are satisfied with their work and walk away ... priceless .

A recent Survey USA poll of New Mexico finds a tight race in the state .
Obama has a three point lead 49 % - 46 % , but that is within the margin of error , so the race is a virtual tie .
There is a big gender divide in the state , where McCain leads among men 60 % - 36 % , and Obama leads with women , 62% - 32 % .
One of the interesting trends that have been visible in numerous state and national polls is the relatively low number of undecided voters .
In New Mexico , only 5 % of voters polled called themselves undecided .
Voters age 35 - 49 will be the critical age group in the state .
Among these voters , Obama leads 50 % - 48 % .
Obama leads by 13 points with voters 18 - 34 and by 7 points with voters 50 - 64 .
McCain leads by 8 points with voters over 65 .
McCain leads with white voters , 53 % - 42 % , but it seems that at least in New Mexico , the fear that Hispanic voters would not support Obama has not proven itself to be true .
Obama leads with Hispanics 63 % - 34 % .
Obama has a 16 point lead with Independent voters in the state , 55 % - 39 % .
Obama also gets 29 % of the state ’s anti-abortion vote .

New Mexico was a critical swing state in 2004 .
George W. Bush carried the state 50 % - 49 % , and it looks like 2008 will be another tight race .
The race is currently statistically tied , and I suspect that this wo n’t change much before November .
It is a little surprising that McCain is n’t doing better in the state , but the average age of residents in the state is 34.6 years old .
This is why the 35 - 49 age group will probably be the demographic that decides the state .

Zebra striping — also known as candy striping or half - shadow — is the application of faint shading to alternate lines or rows in data tables or forms .
Examples of websites that use zebra striping include the currency site XE , the CIA World Factbook , and Monster.com .
Zebra striping on the web is actually a carryover from print days : one of the first mentions of the technique appeared in 1961 [ 1 ] .
Article Continues Below
Many believe that zebra stripes aid the reader by guiding the eye along the row .
However , despite being in use in both paper and electronic mediums for almost half a century , there is practically no evidence that it actually assists users in this way .
In June and July 2007 , I conducted an extensive review of sources such as the International Association of Paper Historians , the Business and Forms Management Association , and the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing , but found absolutely no information on the origins of or rationale behind zebra striping .
Yet applying zebra striping in an electronic medium is a nontrivial task .
A List Apart is just one publisher of an article about how to do zebra striping .
As web designers , we certainly cannot afford to be spending time coding an approach that is n’t actually helpful !
So , I decided to conduct a study to see whether zebra striping really does make things easier .
Zebra striping is used when data is presented in an essentially tabular form .
The user of that table will be looking for one or more data points .
Their aim is to get the right points and get them as quickly as possible .
Therefore , if we set a task that uses a table , and zebra striping does make things easier , then we would expect to see improvements in two things : accuracy and speed .
The experiment #section3
I designed an experiment whereby participants were given data in a tabular form and asked to use that data to answer six questions .
Three of the questions were asked when the table had zebra striping ( i.e. , was “ striped ” ) and three of the questions were asked when the table did not have zebra striping ( i.e. , was “ plain ” ) .
The questions asked when the table was striped paralleled the questions asked when the table was plain .
That is , questions were “ paired ” so that for each question there was a striped version and a plain version .
This enabled us to measure the impact of zebra striping .
Participants were randomly assigned to which format they received first , striped or plain , to remove any order effects .
The experiment was described only as “ a study of table formatting . ”
The experiment was conducted via the internet , which , while having its problems , was efficient and cost effective .
Two weeks of experimentation yielded usable data from 244 people .
The data table , shown below , had 15 rows ( including a heading row ) and nine columns .
It contained artificial data , which was loosely based on common descriptors for screws .
As an example , one of the questions was “ is the screw with minor diameter tolerance of 6g available at the factory outlet ? ”
Zebra striped data table , with 15 rows ( including a heading row ) and nine columns .
The aim was to construct a table that :
was large enough to provide a cognitive challenge for participants ,
was not so large as to require scrolling — either horizontally or vertically — in the majority of cases ,
contained data that was not particularly familiar to participants , reducing the chance that they would just “ know ” the answer without having to use the table , and
included data in a number of different forms , including numeric and alphabetic , names , symbols , prices and quantities .
Other than the presence or absence of zebra striping , there were no changes made to the table during the experiment .
Note :
There ’s lots of statistics behind these results that I wo n’t bore you with , but you can download the full - length , peer - reviewed paper ( PDF , 320K ) .
Even though I tried to make the task a little difficult , participants got most of the answers right — the error rate on all questions was 12 % or less .
Questions that had particularly low errors rates — e.g. , question one with an error rate of 2 % — were excluded from the remainder of the analysis , because the findings they yielded would be unreliable .
This left one pair of parallel questions : question three and question six .
As the graph below shows , there was essentially no difference in accuracy between the striped - table and plain - table versions of these questions .
Graph indicating difference in accuracy between the striped and plain table versions of the questions .
Further analysis of these data showed that indeed there were no statistically significant difference in accuracy between striped answers and plain answers .
Even if there were no improvement in accuracy , an improvement in speed would be beneficial .
As the chart below shows , the average observed time taken to answer questions one and two was greater when the table was zebra striped , but for the remaining four questions , the time taken was less when the table was zebra striped ( see Table 5 in the peer - reviewed paper ) .
However , only the difference in time taken for question six was statistically significant , meaning we ca n’t be sure that the other differences were n’t down to the particular sample we ended up with .
Graph indicating difference in time taken to answer questions between the striped and plain table versions .
At the end of the six questions that referred to the data table , participants were asked for their personal preference with regard to zebra striping .
Overall , the greatest proportion of participants preferred zebra striping ( 46 % ) , but a significant portion had no preference at all ( 33 % ) .
So there ’s no point in zebra striping ?
#section8
This experiment yielded no evidence that zebra striping consistently improves the accuracy or speed of tasks .
This would seem to suggest that we should n’t bother with zebra striping anymore .
However , there are a few arguments against tossing zebra striping out altogether .
Firstly , in this study there was a subjective preference for striped tables over plain .
My reading and discussions with others suggest a number of people find zebra-striped tables more aesthetically pleasing .
If many users like zebra striping ( and another large group are n’t fussed either way ) , then why not apply it ?
Secondly , this was just one experiment , with one dataset .
It is possible that the particular design of this experiment meant that zebra striping had little effect .
In other cases , particularly when there is considerable space between columns and / or the user is required to scroll horizontally , a more pronounced effect may have been observed .
Finally , and perhaps most interestingly , a number of participants in the study spontaneously reported using their finger , on or over the computer screen , to follow down columns and across rows .
Other participants used their mouse to highlight rows of interest .
These people were , in effect , creating their own “ temporary ” zebra striping .
So we may be reducing the burden on our users if we do the zebra striping for them .
The decision is yours # section9
Unfortunately , this study has n’t given us a clear answer about whether or not to continue applying zebra stripes to tabular data .
However , it did n’t give any indication that zebra striping makes things worse , and we do know that it is liked by a number of users , so it certainly does n’t seem to cause much harm .
At the end of the day , the decision about whether to use zebra striping probably comes down to a subjective assessment of likely gains versus the cost of implementation .
Participate in the follow - up study # section10
Formulate is currently conducting a follow - up study to help address some of the questions that arose from the research described in this article .
The study takes less than five minutes .
Many participants are needed to achieve valid results .

April 26 , 2007  -- Sen. John McCain , who officially announced his bid for the 2008 White House Wednesday , stopped by " Good Morning America " to talk about his campaign and ended up defending himself about a joke .
The Arizona Republican said that people upset by his comments about IEDs to Jon Stewart on Tuesday night 's " Daily Show " should " lighten up . "
After being grilled by Stewart , McCain jokingly told him that he had a present for him -- an IED that he could place under his desk .
Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa. , was furious and publicly assailed McCain on the House floor .
" Imagine a presidential candidate making a joke about IEDs when our kids are getting blown up , " he said .
Responding to Murtha 's reaction , McCain said that he was going to use comedy during his campaign , just as he did during his military duty .
" I do n't know how to react to that kind of hysteria to a comedy show , " he told Diane Sawyer on " GMA . "
" All I 'm going to say to Murtha and others .
… Lighten up and get a life . "
On Wednesday , the same day that McCain announced his presidential run , 218 members of the House voted for a bill that contained a troop withdrawal timetable .
McCain said that he would rather lose the election than abandon the conviction that a troop withdrawal from Iraq was a bad idea .
" Everything that I know . …
That I 've learned about my life … dictates that would be a disaster , " he said today .
" That opinion is shared by most national security experts . "
When asked what he would do differently than the Bush administration , McCain said , " I would certainly go to the American people and explain to them what 's at stake .
…
I do know that I do n't need on - the - job training . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. hotel heiress Paris Hilton ’s potential inheritance dramatically diminished after her grandfather Barron Hilton announced plans on Wednesday to donate 97 percent of his $ 2.3 billion ( 1.16 billion pounds ) fortune to charity .

hotel heiress Paris Hilton 's potential inheritance dramatically diminished after her grandfather Barron Hilton announced plans on Wednesday to donate 97 percent of his $ 2.3 billion ( 1.16 billion pounds ) fortune to charity .

That wealth includes $ 1.2 billion Barron Hilton stands to earn from both the recent sale of Hilton Hotels Corp. -- started by his father Conrad in 1919 when he bought a small hotel in Cisco , Texas -- and pending sale of the world ’s biggest casino company , Harrah ’s Entertainment Inc .
That money will be placed in a charitable trust that will eventually benefit the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation , raising its total value to about $ 4.5 billion , the foundation said in a statement .
Barron Hilton , chairman of the foundation , intends “ to contribute 97 percent of his entire net worth , estimated today at $ 2.3 billion , including the created trusts , at whatever value it is at the time of his passing , ” the foundation said .
Paris Hilton was not immediately available for comment on her grandfather ’s plans for his fortune .
Jerry Oppenheimer , who profiled the Hilton family in his 2006 book “ House of Hilton , ” has said Barron Hilton is embarrassed by the behaviour of his socialite granddaughter Paris and believes it has sullied the family name .
Barron Hilton , who is 80 , has not commented on Oppenheimer ’s remarks .
The foundation supports projects that provide clean water in Africa , education for blind children , and housing for the mentally ill .
Its aims , based on Conrad Hilton ’s will , are “ to relieve the suffering , the distressed and the destitute . ”
“ Speaking for the family as well as the foundation , we are all exceedingly proud and grateful for this extraordinary commitment , ” said Steven Hilton , one of Barron ’s sons and president and chief executive of the foundation .
Conrad Hilton established the foundation in 1944 and when he died in 1979 left virtually all of his fortune -- including , according to media reports at the time , a 27 percent controlling stake in Hilton Hotels -- to the charity .
But Barron Hilton challenged the will and after a nearly decade - long legal struggle reached an out - of - court settlement to split ownership of the shares with the foundation in 1988 , The New York Times reported .
The hotel group was sold for $ 20 billion in October to private equity firm Blackstone Group , while the acquisition of Harrah ’s -- of which Barron Hilton was a board member until 2006 -- is due to be completed by Apollo Management and TPG Capital in early 2008 .
Paris , a symbol of celebrity privilege in America , gained notoriety in 2003 when a home video of her having sex with a boyfriend was posted on the Internet .
She parlayed her notoriety , fuelled by tabloid headlines about her partying lifestyle , into a celebrity career that has included a reality television show , a book , a music album , and film roles .
Then this year she spent more than three weeks in jail for violating probation in a drunk - driving case .

Tom ’s commentary is here .
Answering a 217 - year old constitutional question , the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to have a gun , at least in one ’s home .
The Court , splitting 5 - 4 , struck down a District of Columbia ban on handgun possession .
Although times have changed since 1791 , Justice Antonin Scalia said for the majority , “ it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct . ”
Examining the words of the Amendment , the Court concluded “ we find they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation ” — in other words , for self - defense .
“ The inherent right of self - defense has been central to the Second Amendment right , ” it added .
The individual right interpretation , the Court said , “ is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment , ” going back to 17th Century England , as well as by gun rights laws in the states before and immediately after the Amendment was put into the U.S. Constitution .
What Congress did in drafting the Amendment , the Court said , was “ to codify a pre-existing right , rather than to fashion a new one . ”
Justice Scalia ’s opinion stressed that the Court was not casting doubt on long - standing bans on carrying a concealed gun or on gun possession by felons or the mentally retarded , on laws barring guns from schools or government buildings , and laws putting conditions on gun sales .
The Court took no position on whether the Second Amendment right restricts only federal government powers , or also curbs the power of states to regulate guns .
In a footnote , Scalia said that the issue of “ incorporating ” the Second into the Fourteenth Amendment , thus applying it to the states , was “ a question not presented by this case . ”
But the footnote said decisions in 1886 and 1894 had reaffirmed that the Amendment “ applies only to the Federal Government . ”
Whether the Court will reopen that issue thus will depend upon future cases .
The Court in essence demolished the most recent precedent on the Second Amendment — the ruling in U.S. v. Miller in 1939 , relied upon heavily by advocates of gun control ( and by the dissenting Justices on Thursday ) .
The opinion tartly remarked : “ It is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said , because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment . ”
In District of Columbia v. Heller ( 07-290 ) , the Court nullified two provisions of the city of Washington ’s strict 1976 gun control law : a flat ban on possessing a gun in one ’s home , and a requirement that any gun — except one kept at a business — must be unloaded and disassembled or have a trigger lock in place .
The Court said it was not passing on a part of the law requiring that guns be licensed .
It said that issuing a license to a handgun owner , so the weapon can be used at home , would be a sufficient remedy for the Second Amendment violation of denying any access to a handgun .
While the declaration of the individual right was clear - cut , as was the decision ’s nullification of key parts of the Washington , D.C. , law , the Court did not lay down a standard for judging the constitutionality of any other federal laws — an omission that the dissenters attacked strongly .
Even so , the opinion made it clear that , whatever ultimate test emerge , it probably would be a tough one to meet , at least when self - defense is at issue .
As Justice Scalia put it , whatever remains for “ future evaluation ” about the strength of the right , “ it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law - abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home . ”
Justice Scalia ’s recitation from the bench of the majority ’s reasoning continued for 16 minutes .
Justice John Paul Stevens followed , for seven minutes , summarizing the reasons for two dissenting opinions — his and one written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer .
The decision was the final one of the Term and , after issuing it , the Court recessed for the summer , to return on Monday , Oct.
6 . Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , said that concluding orders on pending cases will be released by the Court Clerk at 10 a.m. Friday .
* Photo : William Taylor * Picture Q as a tall blond woman with an American accent , and you 've got Porter .
Lisa Porter .
She 's the first head of America 's new Q branch , the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity — Iarpa for short — a fledgling office charged with outfitting US spooks with the highest - tech information - gathering gadgetry .
Iarpa ( just say " yarpa " ) is designed to do for the intelligence community what Darpa ( the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency ) has done for the Pentagon .
Darpa was founded back in 1958 with an unusual mandate — conduct military research outside military labs .
Its successes have included , oh , the Internet and the Global Positioning System .
No doubt Porter 's three years at Darpa helped her get a foot in the door at Iarpa .
As a senior scientist there , she added things like " helicopter - quieting program " and " drag- reduction - on - naval - ships project " to her previously bookish resume .
A Stanford PhD in applied physics , Porter had never pictured herself working for the government .
But then 9/11 happened .
" Like many Americans , " she says , " I felt a need to step up and contribute . "
In 2005 , Porter left Darpa to head up NASA 's aeronautics division , where she worked on development of the X - 51A , a vehicle that 's expected to achieve Mach 6.5 .
Her new gig at Iarpa entails directing projects on everything from cyberspace to biometrics .
The agency will sponsor research at universities , national laboratories , and other organizations to develop some really cool spy gear — which may or may not include grenade pens and gadget - sprouting Rolexes .

Health care and insurance issues have been at the forefront of the race for the White House in 2008 .
Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John McCain have all proposed different approaches to fix our broken system .
In this series we will discuss the pros and cons of each vision .
Read Why Hillary Clinton's Health Plan Will Work
Why Hillary 's Approach Will Fail
Hillary Clinton 's rhetoric states that no American will be denied insurance , renewal or gets priced out of the market , all while she decreases premiums .
Remember that old saying , " if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is , " ?
First of all , her approach states that " individuals will be required to get and keep insurance in a system where coverage is affordable and accessible . "
I hope I 'm not reading too much into this , but is she actually forcing all Americans to purchase protection ?
Those citizens that are insured because they choose to be , are they going to be forced into buying a policy ?
Is this even constitutional ?
The Dark Side of Her Approach
She intends to use income taxes in order to finance her program .
Does she intend to use existing taxes to fund her vision ?
Smart money would say she is going to have to raise taxes in order to implement it .
The idea will eliminate the burden of care for some by increasing the burden of taxes for others .
Is this really what we need in a time of bad economic conditions and skyrocketing gas prices ?
This initiative is projected to cost $ 110 billion ; this is quite a bit of money for the state of the economy .
Her idea is also set to be executed by the government .
This means the government will have to pass off on all types of medical procedures .
This could also cause you to be denied a medical procedure once the law takes effect , even if you were approved for the procedure pre-plan .
Copied Plan ?
Seven months before she laid down her approach , former 2008 presidential candidate John Edwards laid out his own , which is remarkably similar to Clinton's .
The visions are so similar that Edwards wife , Elizabeth Edwards , calls the plan " John Edward 's health care plan as delivered by Hillary Clinton . "
When questioned about it a Clinton spokesperson brought up her " experience " when it comes to care .
The campaign playing the " experience " card ?
Who would have guessed ?
Kerry : Limbaugh's ' tampering ' gave Clinton IN victory Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Obama strategist also credits Limbaugh with Clinton win After Hillary Clinton 's squeaker victory in Indiana Tuesday night , opponent Barack Obama 's advisers and surrogates are saying the only reason she won at all is because of meddling by conservative Hoosiers following the orders of talk show host Rush Limbaugh .
" If it had n't been for Republicans taking Democratic ballots , he likely would have won in Indiana , " Sen .
John Kerry ( D - MA ) said Wednesday on a conference call hosted by the Obama campaign .
" Rush Limbaugh was tampering with the primary and the GOP has clearly declared they want Clinton as a candidate . "
Kerry 's statements regarding Limbaugh 's meddling follow several e-mails from Obama 's campaign to journalists and supporters pointing to the effects of his " Operation Chaos . "
The right - wing host began encouraging listeners to vote for Clinton , with the goal of at least prolonging the Democratic primary campaign and perhaps making her the nominee .
David Axelrod , Obama 's top strategist , also attributed Clinton 's two point lead in Indiana to Limbaugh 's scheme , speaking to reporters Tuesday night , according to the Wall Street Journal .
 If we come up short , they ought to call a press conference tomorrow and thank Rush Limbaugh for the victory ,  he said .
 Because theres no doubt if they do win itll be by a margin so narrow that the Limbaugh project will have given them the margin . 
Indiana exit polls showed that four in ten Democrats who said they would vote for McCain over Clinton in a general election nonetheless voted for Clinton on Tuesday ; however , just twelve percent who would vote for McCain over Obama voted for the Illinois senator .
Citing this figure , the Obama campaign sent an e-mail to reporters Tuesday night arguing that 7 percent of the Indiana electorate could be attributed to the " Limbaugh effect " -- 41 percent of the 17 percent who said they 'd vote for McCain over Clinton but still supported Clinton .
Axelrod also told reporters that Obama would no longer focus solely on primary states during his campaign trips .
He said that he'd compete in the six remaining Democratic contests , but added that the campaign would focus on the general election " because likely Republican nominee John McCain had ' basically run free for some time now because weve been consumed with this . '
He added : ' I dont think were going to spend time solely in primary states . " "
" Pressed by reporters whether that meant the campaign would make stops in general election states over the next month , Axelrod said : ' You could infer that from what I said , ' " Timiraos added .
Axelrod would n't say whether he thought Clinton was out of the race .
 The fact that she lost a large important state by a landslide and shes struggling to hold in one where she was favored where this whole issue of white working class voters was front and center I think is pretty sobering ,  he said .
LITTLE ROCK ( AP )  Tyson Foods Inc. has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15,000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest Arkansas , state officials said Tuesday .
Tyson said preliminary tests on the flock indicated the presence of antibodies for H7N3 , a less virulent strain of the virus .
Routine blood tests conducted Friday found the possible exposure , said Jon Fitch , director of the state 's Livestock and Poultry Commission .
Further tests done by the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture found the birds did not have active infections .
Fitch said the company immediately began disposing of the birds .
" There is absolutely no human health threat , " Fitch said .
" But we take this very seriously . "
Fitch said state officials decided against announcing the infection to the general public because the birds tested positive for exposure to the H7N3 strain of the virus .
The strain that ravaged Asian poultry stocks in late 2003 was H5N1 bird flu virus .
That version of the virus has killed 240 people worldwide and scientists worry it could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people .
However , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said a 2004 outbreak of H7N3 at a poultry plant in British Columbia , Canada , did sicken two workers there .
The CDC said the two workers recovered after treatment with the antiviral medication .
Gary Mickelson , a spokesman for Springdale - based Tyson , said the hens showed no signs of sickness before their pre-slaughter blood tests .
He said the exposed birds all came from a contractor .
" As a preventive measure , Tyson is also stepping up its surveillance of avian influenza in the area , " Mickelson said in a statement .
Matt DeCample , a spokesman for Gov. Mike Beebe , said the governor was alerted about the tests Monday .
Farms within a 6.2 - mile radius of the contractor in West Fork will have their poultry checked for the bird flu strain , Fitch said .
Only one farm falls within that range .
" That 's one of the fortunate things , that there are no farms really close , " Fitch said .
The 15,000 hens will be killed by carbon - dioxide gas and buried at the farm to avoid spreading the disease , Fitch said .
So far , he said officials have a working theory about how the virus spread to the hens .
" The speculation at this point in time was that a large group of Canadian geese made home on a pond very near this facility , " Fitch said .
" Our speculation is someone stepped into some of those droppings and carried it into the poultry house . "
Fitch said it was the first outbreak of a bird - flu strain in Arkansas , which mandates bird - flu testing of all flocks bound for slaughter .
In this case , Fitch said the birds were tested Friday before a planned killing and processing Sunday night .
He acknowledged there may have been a need to make a public announcement about the cases because many have fears about bird flu .
" In retrospect , maybe we should have , " Fitch said .
Stock in Tyson , the world 's largest meat producer , fell by 8 % in trading Tuesday , down $ 1.47 to $ 16.98 per share .

It is almost 20 years since we should have started doing something about climate change .
Instead , humanity has spent that time creating a monumental work of denial and procrastination .
We have employed cod science , elaborated blame strategies , and generally messed around .
Now , we are approaching the cliff edge .
Against this backdrop , the EU 's package of climate and energy measures , agreed in principle last year , was a welcome sign we are at last moving from words to action .
Even if the level of ambition is still inadequate , some parts of the plan have real bite - including a 20 % target for renewable energy use , which could be the biggest move we have ever made towards a low - carbon economy .
But we are too often at the mercy of quack doctors peddling ineffective medicines with grim side effects .
One element of the EU package - the aggressive promotion of liquid biofuel use in cars - falls squarely into this category .
Using plant materials to supply our energy needs is , in theory , a perfectly sensible idea - if it can be done in ways that maximise energy efficiency and minimise waste across existing production cycles - and we should be working out how to do this as quickly as we can .
But requiring 10 % of the EU 's transport fuel to come from biofuels in the next decade will not help .
It will increase demand for conventional crops , push up food prices , and drive production into forests and grasslands , destroying precious wildlife and releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere .
Supporters of the 10 % target claim it can be met through productivity increases and the use of " idle land " .
I recommend a browse round the EU website , where documents written by the very same people proclaim the benefits of the policy for European farmers , in higher commodity prices .
Only since realising the embarrassing impacts of such a tactic on the poor have its architects fallen back on promises of technical advance .
Arguing that the target could be met through productivity increases is very different from ensuring it will be .
The latter would require stringent regulation of the global agricultural commodities market - an implausible project that would be opposed with vigour , by the EU 's trade commissioner and the World Trade Organisation .
Rather than crossing our fingers and hoping that the current policy is not a disaster , we should scrap it and get on with designing policies that promote the efficient use of bioenergy as part of a wider strategy , built around the cheapest , safest and most sustainable options for reducing emissions .
Those options do exist .
It is technically feasible to build cars that emit about 80 grammes of CO2 per km - half that of the average family saloon .
Why , then , are European policies on vehicle efficiency so lacking in ambition ?
The answer is : they are designed to protect the interests of the car industry , rather than protect the world 's poor or its biodiversity .
Behind all the arguments about biofuels , there is a moral choice .
High food prices punish the less well off .
Smaller cars with more efficient engines and lower fuel costs , coupled with a move away from policies that increase food prices , are , on the other hand , truly socially progressive .
How we go forward from here , will depend largely on Gordon Brown , because without the UK 's intervention there is no chance that Europe will step away from the 10 % target .
This week is the last chance Europe has to rethink its policy .
So , Mr Brown , are you going to go to demand more efficient cars , or will you rubber stamp an EU policy that will force consumers to burn the world 's food supplies and forests in their petrol tanks ?

But an Irish vote No on Thursday will mean the Treaty , which abolishes dozens of national vetoes and creates the new post of EU president , cannot come into force in any of the 27 member states .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama ’s big national lead over Hillary Clinton has all but evaporated in the U.S. presidential race , and both Democrats trail Republican John McCain , according a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
The poll showed Obama had only a statistically insignificant lead of 47 percent to 44 percent over Clinton , down sharply from a 14 point edge he held over her in February when he was riding the tide of 10 straight victories .
Illinois Sen. Obama , who would be America ’s first black president , has been buffeted by attacks in recent weeks from New York Sen .
Clinton over his fitness to serve as commander - in - chief and by a tempest over racially charged sermons given by his Chicago preacher .
The poll showed Arizona Sen. McCain , who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination , is benefiting from the lengthy campaign battle between Obama and Clinton , who are now battling to win Pennsylvania on April 22 .
McCain leads 46 percent to 40 percent in a hypothetical matchup against Obama in the November presidential election , according to the poll .
That is a sharp turnaround from the Reuters / Zogby poll from last month , which showed in a head - to - head matchup that Obama would beat McCain 47 percent to 40 percent .
“ The last couple of weeks have taken a toll on Obama and in a general election match - up , on both Democrats , ” said pollster John Zogby .
Matched up against Clinton , McCain leads 48 percent to 40 percent , narrower than his 50 to 38 percent advantage over her in February .
“ It ’s not surprising to me that McCain ’s on top because there is disarray and confusion on the Democratic side , ” Zogby said

Obama gave a speech on Tuesday rebuking his pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , for sermons sometimes laced with inflammatory tirades but said he could not disown him and it was time for Americans to bind the country ’s racial wounds .
The poll showed Obama continues to have strong support from the African - American community but that he is experiencing some slippage among moderates and independents .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Among independents , McCain led for the first time in the poll , 46 percent to 36 percent over Obama .
He was behind McCain by 21 percent among white voters .
Zogby attributed this to a combination of the fallout from Clinton ’s victory in Ohio earlier this month and the controversy over Wright ’s sermons .
“ And , just the closer he gets to the nomination , the tougher questions whites ask about an African - American candidate , ” Zogby said .
The March 13 - 14 poll surveyed 525 likely Democratic primary voters for the matchup between Clinton and Obama .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points .
For the matchup between McCain and his Democratic rivals , 1004 likely voters were surveyed .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points .

Did * The New York Times * run a hit piece on a group of former generals working as television analysts ?
Or have the networks purposely ignored a major story that implicates them in Pentagon propaganda - pushing ?
Here 's your chance to fact check the media majordomos yourself .
A few weeks back , the * Times * ran a long , long expose on the Pentagon 's relationship with ex-officers - turned - TV - commentators .
The crux of the paper 's story :
Analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders , including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters , records show .
They have been taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified intelligence ...*
* In turn , members of this group have echoed administration talking points , sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated .
Some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access . *
Many in the military community were thoroughly unimpressed with the piece – especially since several of the officers featured in the expose were vocal critics of the conduct of the Iraq war .
Liberal bloggers and media - watchers , on the other hand , were disgusted by what they saw as the latest disclosure of " the incestuous , extensive overlap between our media institutions and government officials . "
The outrage only grew , as the television networks decided not to cover the Times ' scoop .
Just today , Sen. John Kerry called for a " full investigation of this program , " which the Pentagon claims is now suspended .
But there 's no need to wait for Congress .
You can launch your own investigation , right now .
The Defense Department has released thousands of pages of documents related to this outreach effort .
Years ' worth of internal Pentagon memos , military talking points and interview tapes and transcripts with former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld are all now posted to the Pentagon 's website .
Take a look , and let us know what you find .
Drop us a line , or leave a comment , below .
UPDATE : These retired officers may have received special access in Rumsfeld 's Pentagon .
But they were fed the same happy talk and BS as the rest of us , a quick scan of the documents shows .
Inflated estimates of Iraqi troop strength were n't just for the general public , for example .
They were for the generals , too .
Check out these talking points from November 29 , 2005 and this April 22 , 2005 conference call transcript :
Similarly , the Defense Department was making blissful predictions about the insurgency melting away to anyone who would listen .
Here are some talking points from January 4th , 2006 :
Not long after , the Sunni insurgency entered its bloodiest phase of the war .
Motorists driving down Highway 40 under Tamm Avenue in the wee hours of July 19 , 2007 , reported seeing graffiti artists at work on the pristine white concrete of the overpass wall .
Before fleeing the scene , the men left their trademarks , or tags , in big bubble letters .
St. Louis police later caught two suspects north of the highway , and they also found backpacks loaded with sixteen cans of spray paint .
Both men were charged with felony property damage .
The incident set off alarm bells for south St. Louis Alderwoman Donna Baringer , who says she realized that the new overpasses and noise barriers going up along Highway 40 will be a prime target for vandals .
" Those walls will be seen as empty canvases to do artistic work , " says Baringer , who serves the 16th Ward .
" But we will have to have it removed and the state — us taxpayers — will end up paying for it . "
After doing some research into the world of graffiti , Baringer learned that the ornate , multicolored art is known as tagging and that its renegade practitioners tend to be 18 - to 25 - year - old white men .
Baringer maintains that the best way to stop them is to enact legislation that will basically treat spray paint and markers like weapons : restricting who can buy them , requiring buyers to show ID , and introducing a new criminal penalty for illegal possession .
" Is it going to stop [ graffiti ] or end it or eliminate it ?
No , " she says .
" But is it going to enhance or make it easier for police to follow up and investigate ?
Yes . "
St. Louis would n't be the first city to crack down on spray - paint sales .
Minneapolis , Albuquerque and Memphis are among the cities that have adopted anti-graffiti laws in recent years , says Bob Hills , director of the Anti-Graffiti Project of the National Council to Prevent Delinquency .
The most common approach , he says , is to ban spray - paint sales to anyone under 18 and keep it under lock and key .
Elected in 2003 , the 45 - year - old Baringer says she 's following the Anti-Graffiti Project 's lead .
If her own bill passes , she plans to talk it up among mayors throughout Missouri .
" I will turn it over to them .
They 're waiting for it , " she says .
First , though , the alderwoman has to move her Board Bill No. 86 past the Board of Alderman Public Safety Committee , where she says several members support her .
A hearing is scheduled June 5 .
The core of the bill deals with " graffiti tools , " which includes spray paint , paint sticks , fat - tipped markers and glass - etching devices .
The bill bans sales to anyone under 18 , and requires adults who want to buy three or more of the blacklisted implements to present a photo ID .
The bill puts the onus on stores to keep records of the sales and buyers ' personal information for a year , and be willing to hand that information over to police .
Shopkeepers would also have to put up signs , which the bill describes as " not less than 12 inches by 18 inches , " that state : " It is illegal for a person to purchase or possess aerosol spray paint containers or any other graffiti tool for the express illegal purpose of graffiti per St. Louis City Ordinance . "
Finally , Baringer 's measure goes so far as to make it illegal to possess " graffiti tools " on public or private property without the owner 's consent .
Illegal possession would be a misdemeanor , punishable by a $ 500 fine or up to 90 days in jail .
Earlier this year Colorado police lobbied lawmakers to make possessing " graffiti tools " a crime , akin to getting caught with burglary tools .
According to the Denver Post , the proposal died quickly , with one opposing legislator saying it would give " carte blanche for law enforcement to go after teenagers . "
While Baringer cites " broad support " among her colleagues , the chairman of the public safety committee , Alderman Terry Kennedy , is not convinced that cracking down on paint sales is the way to go , and says the idea strikes him as " rather excessive . "
Kennedy , whose 18th Ward includes part of the Central West End , adds , " I certainly understand the concern and what they 're trying to address .
Requiring people to give them ID on three cans of paint is n't going to resolve it . "
If the city regulates the sale of spray paint , Kennedy wonders , " What 's next ? "
Peat Wollaeger , a studio artist who makes graffiti - style stencils , does n't see how a city can effectively ban artists ' tools .
He says taggers are always trying new things , the latest being water cannons filled with house paint .
" That ban would do nothing to stop that type of activity . "
While Baringer arms herself with statistics and anecdotes to prove that there 's an escalating graffiti menace , Wollaeger sounds almost blasé .
" St. Louis has such a small group of graffiti artists , it 's not even worth it . "
( CNN ) --
The group controlling Internet domain names may soon decide whether to relax naming rules and potentially open up a virtual domain name gold rush .
Paul Twomey is president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers .
At a meeting in Paris Thursday , the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers will vote on two key proposals .
The first would allow domains that do not use Latin characters , meaning domain names using Chinese , Arabic or Cyrillic letters .
The other proposal would allow domains to use nearly any letter or number combination , up to 64 characters .
If ICANN approves the proposals , the world of .com and .org and country names like .jp or . fr would be opened to a much wider choice , such as .hotel or .sex .
Just the thought of .sex has bloggers predicting an auction frenzy , as almost any word in any language could become a domain name extension .
" You can almost guarantee the most highly sought - after one will , unfortunately , probably be dot- sex , " said Bryan Glick of Computing Magazine .
" All the meaningful words and meaningful names in the English language have been bought up already , " Glick said .
Watch Glick further explain the significance of such a move »
" This is why you see new companies being formed with made - up , strangely sounding names ... in order to get a unique Web domain for it . "
ICANN has turned down requests for .xxx , which would be used by adult sites , over fear of seeming to give approval of pornography sites .
Analysts say .xxx and nearly everything else would be possible if the rules are relaxed .
Among the exceptions would be trademarked domains , such as .cnn or .microsoft not being on general sale .
But the more generic .hotel or .
flight could set off a bidding war similar to when .tv was put up for sale by the Pacific island of Tuvalu .

According to an explosive 437 - page report released Monday by the Justice Department ’s Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) , FBI agents assigned to the U.S. prison camp in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , compiled what they dubbed a “ war crimes ” file documenting prisoner abuse and torture by U.S. military and intelligence personnel .
The OIG report on the role of the FBI in observing or participating in prisoner abuse was compiled from a survey of several hundred field level agents and supervisors .
FBI protests over these practices traveled up the chain of command and reached the White House–where they were ignored .
Documenting the widespread abuse and torture of detainees by CIA , Pentagon and “ private ” contractors in the employ of the U.S. Government , the file was initiated in 2002 , but was ordered shut down by high level officials at the Bureau and the White House .
FBI agents were ordered to stop keeping records of the criminal acts they had witnessed , The New York Times reports .
According to Eric Lichtblau and Scott Shane ,
The report says that the F.B.I. agents took their concerns to higher - ups , but that their concerns often fell on deaf ears : officials at senior levels at the F.B.I. , the Justice Department , the Defense Department and the National Security Council were all made aware of the F.B.I. agents ’ complaints , but little appears to have been done as a result .
Indeed , rather than shutting down the criminal CIA / Pentagon operation at Guantánamo , these sordid practices were exported to Iraq when Camp Delta commander , Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller was ordered by Pentagon officials to “ Gitmoize ” Abu Ghraib prison .
The ACLU had filed a FOIA request in April 2008 “ demanding the release of the OIG report after media reports that the investigation had been completed for months .
Today ’s report confirms that the Defense Department used its classification review to delay the release of the report , ” according to a press release by the civil liberties group .
Given the Inspector General ’s grim documentary evidence , one can see why .
Among the techniques used by military , CIA and “ private ” contractors employed as interrogators at Guantánamo , to which FBI agents objected , the vast majority were drawn from the CIA ’s KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogations manual and Special Operations Command ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program , “ reversed - engineered ” by Ft. Bragg SERE instructors and CIA - linked psychologists .
These techniques included : prolonged “ short - shackling ” in “ stress positions , ” or the shackling of the hands and feet together ; prolonged isolation ; sleep deprivation ; environmental “ adjustment ” – forced confinement in freezing or overheated cells for extended periods ; sensory disorientation –either through use of strobe lights , loud music , forced drugging –or a combination of all of the above ; humiliation ; sexual assault , including forced nudity and touching ; attacks on cultural and religious belief systems ; the use of dogs to terrorize detainees ; threats against family members ; threats of execution ; on and on .
The OIG report cites multiple cases of prisoners being beaten by interrogators and of four agents who had documented the kicking and beating to death of two prisoners in Afghanistan after their prolonged shackling in a standing position .
As I wrote in April ,
Debriefing files from the military ’s Criminal Investigation Division ( CID ) , obtained as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Defense , confirmed that Special Operations officers in Gardez admitted to using “ reverse - engineered ” Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape ( SERE ) techniques on detainees .
( “ Documents Reveal ‘ Reverse - Engineered ’ SERE Tactics Used in Afghanistan , ” Antifascist Calling … , April 22 , 2008 )
The OIG report now confirms that these abominable interrogation tactics were not only responsible for the cruel deaths of Afghan detainees , but had been reported to Washington by FBI field agents who observed the state - sanctioned murder of these prisoners .
That the FBI , a domestic arm of the national security state with a long , well - documented history of political repression , would use the term “ war crimes ” in its description of Bush regime policies , is a stunning corroboration of charges leveled against the administration since the inception of the so - called “ war on terror . ”
Although Inspector General Glenn
Fine ignores the critical issue of command responsibility , the report , nevertheless , makes it crystal clear that these were n’t aberrational acts initiated by a “ few bad apples ” but rather , state policy that emanated from the highest levels of the government –the White House , the National Security Council , the Pentagon , and indeed , from the Justice Department itself .
Readers will recall that last month ABC News revealed that top administration officials on the White House Principals ’ Committee–Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet , Attorney General John Ashcroft and National Security Council Adviser Condoleezza Rice–held high level discussions on the efficacy of “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” which “ were almost choreographed –down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic . ”
President Bush subsequently informed ABC that he was “ aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ”
As do his underlings .
In the wake of the Inspector General ’s report , official reaction from agencies directly implicated in Guantánamo war crimes were revelatory of the general atmosphere of impunity that rules Washington .
According to Pentagon spokesperson Bryan Whitman , “ there ’s nothing new here …
The department has been operating for a number of years now with new and improved guidance with respect to detention operations and interrogation procedures . ”
And Sean McCormack , a spokesperson for Secretary of State Rice told The Washington Post “ the assertions in the report were ‘ pretty vague ’ . ”
Meanwhile Rice , implicated by these explosive charges against the administration , defended the U.S. torture policy by evoking , what else , 9/11 .
According to the Associated Press , Rice said at a “ town hall meeting ” sponsored by Google , Inc. :
“ The fact is that after Sept. 11 , whatever was legal in the face of not just the attacks of Sept. 11 , but the anthrax attacks that happened , we were in an environment in which saving America from the next attack was paramount . ”
Rice went on to claim ,
“ But even in that environment , President Bush made clear that we were going to live up to our obligations at home and to our treaty obligations abroad . …
“ Now , there has been a long evolution in American policy about detainees and about interrogations , ” she said .
“ We now have in place a law that was not there in 2002 and 2003 .
So the ground is different now . ”
In other words , “ there ’s nothing to see here , move along ! ” But as Bill Van Auken writes ,
The inmates held at Guantánamo represent barely 1 percent of those detained at US prison camps and secret jails run by the military and the CIA in Iraq , Afghanistan and other points around the world .
An estimated 27,000 people are being held without charges , much less trials , many of them simply having disappeared into Washington ’s global gulag .
Some are held on prison ships , others in secret dungeons run jointly by the CIA and regimes to which it “ outsources ” detainees , like Egypt , Jordan and Morocco , where other , cruder forms of torture–being buried alive , given electric shocks or slashed with scalpels–are employed .
Despite these damning revelations , the Democratic - controlled Congress , America ’s ersatz “ opposition , ” sits quietly with its hands folded since after all , “ impeachment is off the table , ” as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) ignominiously declared shortly after the 2006 mid-term elections .
We should be clear : the Democratic leadership has neither the desire , nor the intention , of bringing the Bush regime to ground by constituting a war crimes tribunal that would punish these malefactors , the “ skinheads in nice suits , ” to borrow Günter Grass ’ apt description of the blood - soaked gang in Washington .
The Democrats , as with their Republican colleagues across the aisle , have n’t the slightest interest in pursuing the administration on the question of torture because they themselves are complicit with Bushist “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
At every turn , the Democratic leadership were briefed extensively on the criminal methods employed at Guantánamo–indeed across the entire U.S. network of secret prisons–all of which they approved and then concealed from the American people under cover of “ national security ” and “ fighting the war against terror . ”
From their shameless 2002 capitulation to the Bush gang when they gave their consent to a preemptive war of conquest against Iraq , a “ war of choice ” that resulted in the wanton slaughter of one million Iraqis , the Democrats have fully endorsed the U.S. policy of militarism and global aggression .
As the crisis engulfing the American capitalist system deepens , profound social polarization and widespread revulsion over the Iraq adventure may very lead to the creation of political conditions antithetical to the ruling class .
In this context , a highly - militarized corporate elite contemptuous of democratic norms and processes may be tempted to employ similar repressive methods–illegal detention , forced “ disappearances ” and torture–against their domestic opponents .
History , always a stern taskmistress , is replete with grim examples .

Bees across the United States have succumbed in recent years to a treacherous alien mite that invaded the country two decades ago .
But scientists have n't been able to figure out why the parasite is so destructive .
Up to 60 percent of hives in some regions have been wiped out .
Entire colonies can collapse within two weeks of being infested .
North Carolina fears it is on the verge of an agricultural crisis .
No state is immune .
A new study suggests the killing mechanism is complex .
The mites feed on bees , and they suppress the bee 's immune systems .
That opens the door for a virus that deforms bee wings to take over .
The entire hive , even its food source , gets infected .
Agricultural headache
Agriculture in the United States depends on the European honeybee .
As much as a third of the American diet is tied to their ability to pollinate crops that total in the billions of dollars every year .
The bees ' nemesis , the eight - legged Varroa destructor mite , is the size of a pin head .
It feeds on the blood of adult bees and also eats bee larvae .
The mites are resistant to pesticides .
Breeding programs designed to develop bees that can resist the mite have so far been unsuccessful .
Researchers suspect the mite arrived on Chinese honeybees around 1987 .
The Chinese bees know how to deal with the parasite .
" The native Chinese bees do not have the same problems , " said Xiaolong Yang , a post - doctoral researcher in entomology and plant pathology at Penn State who raised bees in China .
" I do not recall seeing deformed wing bees in the Chinese bee .
Chinese honeybees have grooming behavior which can remove the mites from the bees .
They get rid of the mites . "
While researchers know that the Varroa mite is behind the death of bee colonies , the mechanism causing the deaths is still unknown .
Yang and Dr. Diana L. Cox -Foster , Penn State professor of entomology , now believe that a combination of bee mites , deformed wing virus and bacteria is causing the problems occurring in hives across the country .
" Once one mite begins to feed on a developing bee , all the subsequent mites will use the same feeding location , " Cox - Foster said today .
" Yang has seen as many as 11 adult mites feeding off of one bee .
Other researchers have shown that both harmful and harmless bacteria may infect the feeding location . "
Downward spiral
European honeybees in the United States have long dealt with a virus that deforms their wings .
Alone , the virus does not threaten colonies , however .
The bee mite infestation seems to raise the number of deformed wing virus cases to about 25 percent of a population .
Yang and Cox - Foster injected bacteria into bees .
In mite - infested bees , the deformed wing virus blossomed rapidly .
In mite - free bees , it did n't change .
A final , fatal step is involved .
Worker bees put a sterilizing agent into honey and the colony 's food .
Mite - infested bees can't produce as much of the agent .
Cox -Foster suspects the honey then carries more bacteria .
" It is likely that the combination of increased mite infestation , virus infection and bacteria is the cause of the two - week death collapse of hives , " she said .
The results are detailed today in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
Meanwhile , some researchers have advocated fostering dwindling populations of wild honeybees .
Some 4,000 species are native to North America .
While most seem to resist the mite , their numbers have shrunk due to pesticide use and changes to the land .
Wild bees often nest in the ground and can't survive in an agricultural setting .

Chaldean archbishop kidnapped in Iraq , police say RAW STORY
Published : Friday February 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Gunmen on Friday kidnapped Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Faraj Rahho in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul , a provincial police officer said .
The gunmen also killed three people who were with Rahho at the time of the kidnapping after a Mass at a nearby church , said Iraqi Brigadier Gen. Khalid Abdul Sattar , a spokesman for the Ninevah province police .
According to Adnkronos International , a news agency based in Italy which covers the Arabic world , Rahho had just " finished celebrating the rite of the Via Crucis at a local church . "
" Eyewitnesses said that a group of armed men stopped the bishop as he was travelling in his car and took him by force , " the agency reports .
" Adnkronos International ( AKI ) confirmed the kidnapping with the Mosul diocese . "
An aide to Iraq 's Cardinal Emmanuel III Delly , leader of the church , said he did not know who was behind the kidnapping of the 65 - year - old archbishop , the Associated Press reports .
" We pray for his release as soon as possible , " said Archbishop Andreos Abouna .
" This act of abduction against a Christian clergy member will increase our fears and worries about the situation of Christians in Iraq . "
Last year 's International Religious Freedom Report from the U.S. State Department noted that Chaldean Catholics comprise a tiny minority of the Iraqi population , but are the largest group among the less than 1 million Christians in mostly Muslim Iraq .
Since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , Iraqi Christians have been targeted by Islamic extremists who label them " crusaders " loyal to U.S. troops .
Churches , priests and business owned by Christians have been attacked by Islamic militants and many have fled the country .
Last June , Pope Benedict XVI expressed deep concern about the plight of Christians caught in the deadly sectarian crossfire in Iraq and pressed President Bush in a meeting to keep their safety in mind .
" Particularly in Iraq , Christian families and communities are feeling increasing pressure from insecurity , aggression and a sense of abandonment , " Benedict said at the time .
The Chaldean church is an Eastern - rite denomination that recognizes the authority of the pope and is aligned with Rome .
Iraq 's Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki also pledged last fall to protect and support the Christian minority .
Though most of Iraq has witnessed a decrease of violence over the past six months , the U.S. military regards Mosul as the last urban stronghold of al - Qaida in Iraq , and is engaged in a campaign with Iraqi forces to root out extremists from the city 225 miles northwest of Baghdad .
In an interview with AsiaNews , a Vatican - affiliated missionary news agency , in November , Rahho said the situation in Mosul was not improving and " religious persecution is more noticeable than elsewhere because the city is split along religious lines . "
" Everyone is suffering from this war irrespective of religious affiliation , but in Mosul Christians face starker choices , " he told the news agency .

Stage 0 : Not Ready for Agile
— Andy Hunt 06/16/2008
Published in Andy's Blog
This last week , I was out speaking at the Better Software Conference and Expo in Las Vegas .
While I was in the area , a large , well - known company contacted me and asked if I could pop in and given them a talk about transitioning to an agile software development method — my Pragmatic Agility talk .
I had an available spot in my schedule , so I agreed .
The manager who contacted me was very excited , and announced my presentation which was scheduled for the next day .
But the Powers That Be heard a speaker was coming in , and immediately cancelled the event .
It seems they felt that the manager “ had n’t gone through proper channels ” in setting this up .
The manager pointed out that no proper channels existed ; they ’d never had an invited speaker before .
Since there was no existing procedure in place to follow to invite a speaker into the organization , they cancelled the whole thing — permanently .
For an organization trying to transition to an agile approach , I dare say they face more than a few challenges .
Agility is all about flexibility and adaptation .
If your organization is inherently inflexible , you ’re just not ready for agility .
You can read the books , hire the consultants , try the practices , but it ’s probably not going to work out .
Your organization just is n’t ready yet .
In fact , it seems to me there are at least a couple of these contra-indications .
You ’re not ready for agile if you :
behave territorially .
You mark your territory like an aggressive dog , refusing to share power or information , and let everyone know if you were n’t included in the decision .
When something new comes up , avoid it or kill it .

This is the way we ’ve always done it .

grow uncomfortable with uncertainty .
In an agile project , you will not know the project end date or even what features will be delivered in the next iteration .
You cannot stand this , and will insist on fixed dates and costs right up front .

You ca n’t trust them to think for themselves , you ’ve got to make the important decisions for them .
believe development is a linear process .
You ignore unpleasant feedback .
Rather than acting on it , you always stick to the plan , just like a politician in an ill - advised military quagmire .
If any of these descriptions are true for your organization — or for yourself — then you ’re not ready .
It ’s not time to start transitioning to agility just yet .
Agility is not about practices .
Some practices facilitate an agile approach , and some practices make it nearly impossible .
But the practices themselves are n’t that important : Agility is a mindset .
It ’s a flexible , adaptive approach to software development .
The first step in transitioning to agility is to realize that :
Agility is a mindset
Once you and your organization are okay with that , and you ’re ready to drop a lot of preconceived notions and established procedures and try a flexible , adaptable approach , then we can talk about transitioning to agility .

TAM test the new bi-prop helicopter rocket engines with incredible success
We did it again !!
TAM designed and built this patent pending bi-propellant rocket engines specially designed for helicopter use , this rocket engines are to my knowledge the most powerful rockets ever built for it 's size and weight , with an exterior chamber diameter of only 1.00 inches ( 25.4 mm ) they produced a maximum thrust of 45 kilos or 441 newtons or 99.2 pounds of thrust that is about 198.4 hp at the tip of the rotor blade .
In the pictures the rocket engine without the cooling ring and the water cooled version in the computerized test stand .
We got this performance with standard grade 70 % hydrogen peroxide and alcohol , now we are working on the design of the 50 % H2O2 version .
This rockets do n't use a catalyst and they do n't need to use " rocket grade " hydrogen peroxide anymore and we have unlimited supply of 70 % and 50 % hydrogen peroxide in any part of the world and the best is that this rocket engines will be service free with a life of about 3000 hrs. , nothing to change or wear !!
Read at this page below the history of the rocket helicopter to see the involvement of TAM in the history of this amazing machine !
TAM is the only company in the world that specialized in helicopter rocket engines , designer and builder of the most powerful rocket engines ever developed for helicopters , builder of the rocket engines for the Liteco , Atlas , Intora , Vertical UAV and now associated with Swiss Copter making the new generation of rocket engines for the entire line of Swiss Copter helicopters , with plans to make executive helicopters with this wonderful technology .
The TAM rocket engines are the only ones that have proved in the test stand and also in flight that can produce it 's maximum power with hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of only 70 % , something never before achieved and all this thanks to our proprietary formula of the penta metallic catalyst pack invented by Juan Manuel Lozano Gallegos from TAM .
Atlas two place Rocket Helicopter by Swiss Copter
SWISS COPTER THE SAFEST HELICOPTER IN THE WORLD
The benefits in safety of this kind of helicopters are many compared with a traditional helicopter design , check the nest list of benefits over any other design .
In first place they are a lot safer than any helicopter because this design do n't need a tail rotor and being 86 % of the fatal accidents in an helicopter caused by a fail of the tail rotor with just thus we eliminate 86 % of the accidents .
Since this helicopters do n't produce torque and they do n't need a tail rotor because the power is direct applied to the tips of the rotor blades , they are a lot easier to fly and with just a few hours of instruction they can be flown because this design is inherently more stable in flight and in hover than any tailed helicopter .
The new generation of rocket engines designed and built by TAM will prevents 98 % of maintenance costs because the new generation of rocket motors are virtually maintenance - free with just a self cleaning of the injectors with water and they will be ready to fly in all conditions , regardless of dust , sand or any weather phenomenon unlike a turbine that all this affects not only their performance but in its life .
TAM 's new engines having no moving parts eliminates 98 % of engine failures .
These rocket engines generate their own exhaust gases this way his performance is the same at any altitude , in fact its power increases with altitude with less resistance to air at a lower density , remember that rocket engines are designed to operate in the space where there is no atmosphere , so we do n't have any limit of power at high altitude .

Swiss Copter test fly the Dragonfly DF - 1 rocket helicopter with the TAM rocket engines
Video of the first flight of the Dragonfly DF - 1 rocket helicopter in Switzerland .
In the next video you can see the vapor trail of the rocket engines because the low ambient temperature that makes visible the water vapor produced by the hydrogen peroxide , at the beginning of the video you can see the warm up of the rocket engine number one , then it was shut off then the warm up of the rocket engine number two and then the two rockets fired , during flight you can see a very slight vapor trail and this is because the low ambient temperature of the air , note that the pilot wears a jacket , scarf and gloves .
With a little more temperature the exhaust of the rocket engines is totally invisible .
This is the comment of the test pilot after this test flight , " This is the most stable and vibration free helicopter I have flown in my life "
Videos of the Atlas and Intora Firebird Rocket Helicopters now Swiss Copter
In this video is shown the Atlas from Swiss Copter .
This is the video of the Intora Firebird that now is the Dragonfly from Swiss Copter , a new design , new rotor blades and new rocket engines made by TAM make this helicopters unique all over the world .
Atlas and Intora Firebird Rocket Helicopters with the TAM rocket engines are now Swiss Copter Dragonfly
Rocket Tip Helicopter History
The World 's First Rocket Helicopter
TAM Tecnologia Aeroespacial Mexicana is part of this history !
In 1954 an American inventor named Gilbert W. Magill of Glendale California designed and built the HR - 1 , a " mini " portable helicopter , at the tip of the rotor blades a hydrogen peroxide rocket engine impulse the rotor , this helicopter was better known as the " Pinwheel " .
Magill made his helicopter portable in a carrying box which was a success that flew incredibly well and had a fantastic performance for its size , with a maximum speed of 161 km / h ( 100 mph ) , a ceiling of 4570 meters ( 14.993 feet ) and a range of 32 km ( 20 miles ) with two tanks with a total of 20 liters of hydrogen peroxide 90 % ea
This small helicopter still holds the world´s record speed of vertical climb rate .
Later Magill built the second version by contract with the U.S. Navy 's with larger peroxide tanks and a tripod landing gear that could take off standing on legs , this is the model flown in this video .
Magill then formed the General Aerospace company in Odessa Texas and he built three prototypes of his third design under a U.S. Navy contract .
It was a small helicopter with fixed gear and landing skids with even larger peroxide tanks to give more autonomy , he wanted to sell this helicopters to the Army but it was very small and the Army needed full armed helicopters to compete with the Russians in the Vietnam War so full armed 212 Bells and Cobras where ordered by the Navy instead and Magill that spend all his money in this project broke in the mid 80's , and the creditor bank was now the owner of all the project including even the patent , the prototypes and all the parts .
After the success of the Magill´s Pinwheel , on May 13 , 1954 , the Kellet KH - 15 flew for the first time with a pair of hydrogen peroxide rockets at the tips of the rotor blades and it shown an excellent stability but this project was abandoned because the patent was granted to Magill .
This photo shows the helicopter with two spherical tanks flying " hands off " to demonstrate their stability .
Liteco
In 1987 Afibra Handels , later renamed Liteco Helicopters Systems , a Swiss company bought the patent and all the remains of Magill to creditor bank and they took the project of Maguill to develop two new rocket helicopters .
I was contacted by Liteco to design the new transverse rocket engine to be used in two new helicopters designed for Liteco by Advanced Technologies Inc. of Virginia USA , this new two helicopters was the single place Liteco and the two place Liteco Atlas .
The original Magill design of the rocket motor was very difficult to service and change the catalyst pack because you have to remove the tips of the rotor blades and the engine to change the two cartridges that were inside the main rotor blade so a more powerful rocket engine with a transversal design easier to service was developed by TAM .
Advanced Technologies in Virginia USA built two new helicopters under the designation CH1 ATI on order to Liteco , those were registered as N9042 F s/n 00001 , and N8186E s/n 00002 .
This was the first prototype rocket engine built by TAM of the new transversal rocket engine for Liteco , this design was a great challenge in design because for the centrifugal force the liquid hydrogen peroxide was forced to the outer wall of the catalyst pack and a special device was tested to eliminate this problem and it was solved , in this picture you see the first prototype with the solid nozzle and not like the final design with the lighter contour DeLaval nozzle and we built the final configuration engine but Liteco closed in 1993 after six years of very hard work and the cause was that the 90 % hydrogen peroxide was not available any more and the only company that produced it Degussa had a lot of restrictions for the supply .
This are the engines built by TAM for Liteco that they never flew in the Liteco helicopters
This is a picture of the Liteco original Maguill helicopter flying with the Maguill enclosed rocket engines at the tips , Liteco never flew the helicopters with the new TAM transversal rocket engines .
Intora
In 1998 after five years that Liteco closed , the Intora company in England bought all the parts and Liteco prototypes and N8186E was registered in the UK as G - BXZN on August 25 ( N9042 F is shown here wearing a fake / incomplete registration ) .
In this picture the now Intora Firebird was flying still with the original Maguill rocket engines , in fact in the Intora Firebird video the helicopter is shown with the original Maguill rocket engines before the rotor blades here changed for the new transversal rocket engines .
This are the first pictures of the now Intora Firebird and Intora Atlas with the new transversal rocket engines built by us .
The people from Intora company contacted me to develop a new more powerful transversal rocket engine to be used in the new Intora Atlas , the Intora Firebird and a new military version of a UAV helicopter .
The Intora Firebird flew incredibly well , in the video is seen as the helicopter takes off from a trailer behind a truck , flying low under a bridge , climb and returns to the trailer , landing with an agility and dexterity that I could not make a normal helicopter .
These are the transverse rocket engines made by TAM that produced an incredible power for its size , nobody in the world has an engine so small with the same power than the TAM rocket engines .
This is a video of the test of this rocket engine at TAM in Mexico , shown in a very primitive test stand but it work and the distortion in the image of the video is when the engine produces a supersonic shock wave at full power , in the video I had a leak in one of the o-rings of the rocket engine that was fixed after this test .
On the Dubai air show in 2000 several governments and companies were so impressed with these helicopters that large numbers of orders were placed and this caused a problem between the partners that made the company Intora close and ended in a lawsuit between partners in court .
Swiss Copter
For eight years all the parts and prototypes of the Maguill , then Liteco and then Intora was stored in an hangar in London Southend Airport in England after a very long lawsuit between the owners and partners of Intora and in 2008 Swiss Copter a branch company of Innosuisse in Switzerland bought the remains of all this subsequent companies that worked with the original Maguill design and the new owner of the company contacted me again to develop a new rocket engine to be adapted to a new aluminum rotor blade and make a more powerful rocket engine and also to develop a new bi propellant rocket engine , we signed a contract to develop a new rocket engine and I had in the contract a % of the company and also of all the sales of the helicopters , the original transversal rocket engine that used 90 % hydrogen peroxide was not able to lift the Intora helicopter because they used 95 % H2O2 to get the power and this is because when I designed this rocket engines it was for the electrolytic hydroge n peroxide that was ultra pure and had more ISP than the now organic hydrogen peroxide so I modified the original rocket engines with more catalyst area and we flew the new Swiss Copter Dragonfly with my new rocket engines and the comment from the pilot that by the way he was the original pilot for Liteco and for Intora was that this was the smoothest helicopter he have flying in his life !!
This was the first test of the bi-propellant rocket engine in TAM back yard , in the picture from left to right Hans S. the owner of Swiss Copter from Switzerland , Juan Manuel Lozano G , Ricardo C the representative of Swiss Copter in USA from Arizona USA and Ing. Alberto B .
We used a new set of aluminum rotor blades with my new rocket engines and this is a video of the very first flight with this configuration using 90 % hydrogen peroxide provided by Peroxide Propulsion in Sweden .
A plant was set in the US in Arizona to built the new generation of the Swiss Copter Firebird and it was presented at Oshkosh at the EAA air show with a great
The real problem with this helicopter was that the fuel or the 90 % hydrogen peroxide was not available and it was a problem to get it and to transport and after the accident at the plant of Peroxide Propulsion in Sweden it was almost impossible to get any peroxide in Europe , that´s why the urgency to design and develop a new rocket engine using a bi propellant to be able to use methanol and 70 % hydrogen peroxide and I did it and it worked and I was working on the development of a new rocket engine capable to run with 50 % hydrogen peroxide when the company was sold and they didn`t gave me my part so I keep the design and prototype of this new rocket engine .
In less than two years Swiss Copter closed and part of the remains are now in the US in Arizona with Ricardo C the US representative of Swiss Copter and the last thing I knew is a video I saw in kickstarter when he was trying to get founds to continue with this helicopters , it is a shame because this are a truly amazing machines , I hope some people with money invest in this project and start the production of this helicopters .
What is next ?
I don´t know I has been in this project for so many years and I have seen many companies and dreams come and go and I wish this project don´t end here because it has a huge potential !!
boing boing からですが、第二次世界大戦中 の1944年に米国 のOSS （戦略諜報局）が作成した「サボタージュ・マニュアル」なるものが存在しているのだそうです。当然敵地での話ですが（自国でやったら大変）、仕事の進みを遅らせるように人々をトレーニングするためのマニュアルとのこと。その内容が掲載されているのですが、なかなか面白いです：
■ Sabotage manual from 1944 advises acting like an average 2008 manager ( boing boing )
意訳込みでてきとーに訳してみると、こんな感じ：
以 上8ヵ条。信じられないですが、米国の国家機関が本気で作ったマニュアルです。なぜこんな活動をしていたかという理由は、マニュアルの解説部分にあります：
Acts of simple sabotage , multiplied by thousands of citizen - saboteurs , can be an effective weapon against the enemy .
Slashing tires , draining fuel tanks , starting fires , starting arguments , acting stupidly , short - circuiting electric systems ,
abrading machine parts will waste materials , manpower , and time .
Occurring on a wide scale , simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy .
無数の市民によって行われる単純なサボタージュ（※マニュアル内では、破壊活動を伴う本来の意味での「サボタージュ」と区別するためにこの言葉が使われています）は、敵に対する有効な武器となり得る。タイヤを傷つけたり、燃料タンクから燃料漏れを起こしたり、火事を起こしたり、議論を巻き起こしたり、愚かな行動を取ったり、電力をショートさせたり、機械の部品をすり減らすことで、資源や労働力、時間が無駄になるだろう。広範囲で行われることによって、単純なサボタージュは、敵の戦争行為に対する継続的かつ効果的な障害物となるのである。

An appellate court decision upended the custody case that sent more than 440 children from a polygamist sect 's ranch into foster care , but it 's not clear whether the children might soon return home .
The Third Court of Appeals in Austin said the state failed to show the youngsters were in any immediate danger , the only grounds under Texas law for taking children from their parents without court action .
Texas District Judge Barbara
Walther now has 10 days to release the youngsters from custody , but the state could appeal to the Texas Supreme Court and keep the children from immediately going back to their parents .

Texas had no right to remove polygamist sect kids
The decision Thursday in one of the biggest child - custody cases in U.S. history was a humiliating defeat for the state Child Protective Services agency .
It was hailed as vindication by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , who claim they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs .
" I just feel like I 'm coming back to life , " Nancy Dockstader , who has five children in state custody , said Friday on NBC's " Today . "
" We can be a family again .
It 's just unreal . "
Dockstader said she and the other parents have n't decided yet if they will pursue legal action against the state .
They are waiting to talk to their lawyers and to hear what they are required to do to get back their children .
" If we need to move away from the ranch , we will , " said Dockstader 's husband , James .
" We would like that to be our home .
We feel it's the safest environment for our children . "
Every child at the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado was taken into custody more than six weeks ago after someone called a hot line claiming to be a pregnant , abused teenage wife .
The girl has not been found and authorities are investigating whether the calls were a hoax .
Child - protection officials argued that five girls at the ranch had become pregnant at 15 and 16 and that the sect pushed underage girls into marriage and sex with older men and groomed boys to enter into such unions when they grew up .
But the appeals court said the state acted too hastily in sweeping up all the children and taking them away on an emergency basis without going to court first .
" Even if one views the FLDS belief system as creating a danger of sexual abuse by grooming boys to be perpetrators of sexual abuse and raising girls to be victims of sexual abuse ... there is no evidence that this danger is ' immediate ' or ' urgent , " ' the court said .
" Evidence that children raised in this particular environment may someday have their physical health and safety threatened is not evidence that the danger is imminent enough to warrant invoking the extreme measure of immediate removal , " the court said .
The court said the state failed to show that any more than five of the teenage girls were being sexually abused , and offered no evidence of sexual or physical abuse against the other children .
Half the youngsters taken from the ranch were 5 or younger .
Only a few dozen are teenage girls .
The court also said the state was wrong to consider the entire ranch as a single household and to seize all the children because some parents in the home might be abusers .
CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins said department attorneys had not decided whether to appeal .
" We are trying to assess the impact that this may have on our case , " he said .
CPS 's umbrella agency , the Department of Family and Protective Services , issued a statement defending the raid , saying it removed the children " after finding a pervasive pattern of sexual abuse that puts every child at the ranch at risk . "
" Child Protective Services has one duty — to protect children .
When we see evidence that children have been sexually abused and remain at risk of further abuse , we will act , " the department said .
The decision technically applies to only 38 of the roughly 200 parents who challenged the seizure .
But Julie Balovich , a Legal Aid attorney for some of the parents , said she expected attorneys for all the other parents to seek to join the ruling .
Balovich said the court " has stood up for the legal rights of these families and given these mothers hope that their families will be brought back together . "
Five judges in San Angelo , about 40 miles north of Eldorado , have been holding hearings on what the parents must do to regain custody .
Those hearings , which began Monday , were suspended after the ruling Thursday .
Of the 31 people the state initially said were underage mothers , at least 15 were reclassified as adults before the hearings were suspended .
One mother is 27 .
The custody case has been chaotic from the beginning .
During the first round of hearings , held two weeks after the April 3 raid , hundreds of lawyers crammed into a courtroom and nearby auditorium , queuing up to voice objections or ask questions on behalf of the mothers who were there in their trademark prairie dresses and braided hair .
CPS has struggled for weeks to establish the identities of the children and sort out their tangled family relationships .
The youngsters are in foster homes all over the sprawling state , with some brothers or sisters separated by as much as 600 miles .

Mozilla aims to make Firefox 3 a record breaker .
It wants the release of the next version of its flagship open source browser to be accompanied by a record for the most software downloads in a single 24 - hour period 1 .
Download Day - as Mozilla dubs it - will begin the minute Firefox 3 is generally available and continue for 24 hours .
Ahead of this release , expected in mid-to - late June , Mozilla has set up a website ( spreadfirefox.com/worldrecord ) .
This encourages people to organise Download Day parties , to run around collecting sign - up pledges at their university or place of work , and to place Download Day buttons on their websites .
Firefox 3 is based on Gecko 1.9 , an updated layout engine .
The browser features a cleaner layout , better bookmark handling and more stability .
And it 's faster .
RC2
Mozilla decided to release a second release candidate for Firefox 3.0 at a meeting on Tuesday , in response to the discovery of 10 performance and stability bugs .
The alternative would have been to patch these potential " showstoppers " after the browser shipped .
But another round of testing is the safer option - not least from the standpoint of public relations .
This will probably set back the official launch by five days or so .
Last November Mozilla hit back at claims that multiple bugs in its forthcoming Firefox 3 browser would be ignored in order to meet release schedules .
At that point Mozilla was grappling with 700 bugs marked as " blockers " ( i.e. a flaw serious enough to justify delaying a release , or at least merit a closer inspection ) .
Skip forward six months and we 're at the point where the browser is in fine - tuning to eliminate the last few high - priority bugs .
In a development list posting on Tuesday , Mozilla 's lead developer Mike Beltzner explained the strict patch acceptance policy for Firefox 3 RC2 .
" Just because we 've decided to product another release candidate does not mean that we are accepting new patches - only those which fix issues that have been identified as required fixes for RC2 will be accepted , and even then your patch must come with a risk assessment and tests , " he writes .
" Many of the issues to be fixed in RC2 have already been patched , reviewed , approved and landed . "
1 Mozilla is trying for a record in a new category , according to a representative of the firm .
That means it does n't have an existing mark to better .
The open source browser outfit aims to secure over 1.6 m downloads over 24 hours .
Firefox will be available from multiple locations .
We must assume the bandwidth and server capacity will be in place to service the rush . ®
The ruling in California could have an impact on the nationwide debate California 's highest court is to give a long - awaited ruling on the legality of the state 's ban on same - sex marriages .
The court 's decision may have an impact on the nationwide debate on the issue .
If the judges rule the ban - approved by voters in 2000 - unconstitutional , California could become only the second US state to allow same - sex marriage .
California 's legislature has twice passed laws to make gay marriage legal .
State Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has vetoed them each time .
California currently offers same - sex couples who register as domestic partners the same legal rights and responsibilities as married men and women .
Other states , such as Vermont and New Jersey , have similar civil union provisions .
' Huge impact '
The judges on California 's Supreme Court heard arguments for and against the legality of the ban in March .
Their decision is due by 10 am local time ( 1800 BST ) .
The law , approved by Californians in a 2000 referendum and known as Proposition 22 , states that " only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognised in California " .
Geoffrey Kors , executive director of the gay rights group Equality California , told the Associated Press news agency : " What happens in California , either way , will have a huge impact around the nation .
It will set the tone . "
Equality California joined nearly two dozen gay couples and the city of San Francisco in bringing the case after hundreds of gay marriages conducted in 2004 were ruled invalid .
In early 2004 , San Francisco became the first place in the US where gay couples were able to marry after the city 's Mayor Gavin Newsom authorised same - sex marriage licences , claiming existing legislation was discriminatory .
In August of that year , California 's Supreme Court ruled the mayor had overstepped his authority and nullified the unions .
That action prompted the lawsuit under consideration now .
Ahead of Thursday 's ruling , San Francisco chief deputy city attorney Therese Stewart told the AFP news agency that denying same - sex couples marriage rights would make California appear " indifferent " to how gay people are treated .
California Deputy Attorney General Christopher Krueger said he believed there was " a rational basis for the state to adhere to the common and traditional definition of marriage " set out in Proposition 22 .
He told AFP that registered same - sex couples were given " all the rights and benefits associated with marriage " under the current laws .

What are these ?
Want to spend a few evenings hiding under the covers in abject fear ?
Might we suggest the new nonfiction book about global warming , Six Degrees : Our Future on a Hotter Planet , released last week by National Geographic Books .
Author Mark Lynas starts with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's official estimate – that the Earth 's average temperature will rise by up to 6 degrees Celsius ( 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) by the year 2100 – and explains what the world will look like if the temperature rises 1 degree , 2 degrees and up through 6 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 , 3.6 and 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit ; all subsequent references in degrees Celsius ) .
It 's based entirely on peer - reviewed science ; Lynas spent several years combing through academic journals in search of relevant articles , and then put the pieces together for this planet - wide view .
Wired News spoke with Lynas about alarm bells and alarmism , what needs to happen to forestall civilization 's doom and why his research did n't turn him into a pessimist .
Wired News :
It 's really striking – with just 1 degree of warming , the world is a much sadder and more desperate place , with " megadroughts " across the American west , dying coral reefs and stronger hurricanes .
When you put together that picture of a 1 - degree - warmer world , were you surprised at how dramatic it was ?
Mark Lynas :
Well , we 're mainly talking about the continuation of current trends – we 're already seeing the first signs of these things .
The United States is already much drier ; there 's an extended drought going on at the moment , and has been for many years .
Coral reefs are already dying .
It 's a world that we 're going to have to get used to , because it 's pretty much unavoidable even as we speak .
WN : You write that one paper published in the scientific journal Nature in 2000 helped convince you that this book needed writing .
Can you briefly explain what that paper was , and why you reacted so strongly to it ?
Lynas :
It was a paper publishing the outputs of a computer climate model .
What was so striking about this particular model was it simulated the dieback of the Amazon rain forest .
Not all models of the Amazon show this – some do n't show it at all .
But if this becomes a reality , we would lose the most precious biosystem on the planet , and an ecosystem that drives the world 's weather .
And I thought this was something that the world should be more aware of , not buried in an academic journal , even a journal as prestigious as Nature .
It should be driving the priorities of politicians .
It should be the top of everyone 's priority list .
WN : Obviously you care deeply about this issue , and are dedicated to waking up the public to this common threat we 're all facing .
Did that dedication nudge you towards lingering on the worst - case scenarios , or playing up dangers even when the science on a particular issue is n't yet settled ?
Lynas :
That 's something I was very aware of trying to avoid .
Particularly given my background as a campaigner and environmentalist , it would be very easy for me to be accused of hype or alarmism .
With that in mind , I wanted to stick very closely to the science .
And I have not had any scientists complain about how I represented the science .
I 've had a very positive response .
Having said that , people do focus on the worst - case scenarios .
And I think people are entitled to understand the worst - case scenario .
In the same way you 're entitled to buying fire insurance on your house , without worrying every day that your house is going to burn down .
WN : To stick with that example of the possible collapse of the Amazon rain forest , you write later that the modeling results about the Amazon are inconclusive – one study found that only six out of 11 models predicted a drastic reduction in rainfall in the Amazon .
Do you think it 's fair to spend so much time describing that potential collapse , when the chance of that happening currently seems to be about 50 - 50 ?
Lynas :
But a 50 - 50 chance of an impact like that is quite high .
If they told you there 's a 50 - 50 chance that you 're going to die on an airplane , you probably would n't get on it .
The chances that people are willing to accept when it comes losing their lives is something like one in a million .
But they 'll ignore the fact that there 's a 50 - 50 chance of losing the world 's biggest and most precious ecosystem .
WN : So you 're saying that we can't wait until the science is settled to act on this .
Lynas :
The science will only be settled when you can look , and say whether the Amazon has died or not .
And obviously , by then it 's far too late .
WN : By the time you get to a 3 - degree - warmer world , we 're talking massive crop failures across the globe , and mass migrations .
Since you stick to the science , you only briefly speculate on what the societal impacts would be – but do you think war , upheaval and chaos would be inevitable ?
Lynas :
No , it 's possible we could have a very positive , philosophical approach where we all come together and try to get through this the best we can .
There 's no precedent for humans working together on a global scale , but this could be the first .
I 'm not necessarily pessimistic about this .
WN : When you get to the chapter on what life would be like on a planet that is 6 degrees warmer , you write that it gets harder to find scientific studies that make predictions .
It seems almost like we humans just can't comprehend planetary changes on that scale .
Is it a failure of imagination ?
Lynas : Slightly .
But it 's also the conservative nature of the scientific community .
I do n't think scientists want to be accused of being alarmist either , so they 're very careful to remain on the cautious side of things .
Six degrees – that 's on the worst - case scenario end of the scale predicted by the IPCC .
But if it's on the scale at all , it 's worth looking at .
That 's why I have to wind the clock back tens of millions of years to warmer periods in the planet 's history , to try to get an idea of what it would be like .
WN : In the last chapter , called " Choosing Our Future , " you talk about how , if we alter our behavior , we can aim for a " safe landing " in a 1 - or 2 - degree - warmer world .
What action did you determine needs to be taken ?
Lynas :
We need to see greenhouse gas emissions peak in the next decade or so , preferably by the year 2015 , and emissions reduced by 85 percent by 2050 .
WN : You wrote in the introduction that you were surprised to discover that some people find this subject matter incredibly depressing .
You do n't get depressed by this ?
Lynas : Everything from 2 , 3 degrees upwards is a " what if " scenario .
When people come to me and say that they stopped reading at 4 or 5 degrees because it was getting too depressing , I say , " But you should n't be depressed , because that may never happen .
There 's still something you can do about it ! "
Whether you get depressed depends on how likely you think this is to happen .
It comes down to your view of humankind .
If you think humans are innately selfish , that they do n't care about the future and just care about driving flashy cars , then you 're going to get depressed .
If your view of humanity is that we 're an intelligent species , that we can come together on an international basis and find solutions to this problem that include all the world 's people , then you 'll have more hope .
It depends on your personality , and on your politics .
Test Driven Development ( TDD ) is an agile practice that has been slowly gaining traction .
In the last year I have encountered quite a few podcasts and blog posts that touted TDD as a better way to develop high quality software .
I try to stay on top of trends in software development , and I really did attempt to use TDD , but in the end gave up as it just did n’t mesh with my own personal style .
I know many folks will say that you really need to practice TDD for 3 months to a year to start reaping the benefits , as was mentioned in this interesting discussion on the server side .
That to me is a cop out .
To me it is kind of like saying caviar is an acquired taste , when truthfully it just tastes like garbage .
For me , there is a big disconnect between everything you read on other blogs and podcasts about TDD and what you experience when actually trying to apply TDD in real life .
I think it has a lot to do with the fact that proponents of TDD compare it to writing software without testing at all , as opposed to comparing it to a more structured approach that uses tests when they make sense .
After thinking through this and other issues that I touch in this blog post , I have come to the conclusion that TDD is in fact a cargo cult .
According to Wikipedia , Cargo Cult Programming refers to over - applying a design principle blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle in the first place .
An example would be a novice being taught that commenting code is good , and then adding comments for lines that are self - explanatory or need no comment .
If you replaced “ comments ” in that last example with “ unit tests ” , you can begin to see how test driven development is a cargo cult .
Before we get in too deep , let me state empathetically that I am not against unit testing .
They are an essential tool in a developer ’s tool box .
But when testing becomes dogma , that ’s when I start to have problems .
Test First ?
How about Design First ?
My biggest problem with TDD is that if feels like “ just in time design . ”
Write a test to fulfill a single use case and design your api to satisfy one part of a use case .
When the next use case has different requirements of your objects , modify your api and refactor .
Repeat 1,000 times until you have high quality software .
I find refactoring in this fashion incredibly draining .
To me , it is a lot of work , with very little pay off .
I know there are plenty of tools that make refactoring easier , but as the complexity of your project grows , there is still a lot of pain in refactoring your code base .
Do n’t get me wrong , refactoring is a necessary part of any development process , especially when it will improve the maintainability of your codebase .
I just do n’t find it a terribly exciting task .
The other big problem I have with this approach is that when developing using TDD , you need to repeatedly switch contexts between coding and designing .
As Joel Spolsky pointed out , context switching is considered harmful .
I find that my frame of mind when designing is different than when I am coding .
Having to constantly switch back and forth between designing and coding hampers my ability to get into the “ zone : ” that awesome place where productivity increases exponentially .
I find that if I spent time upfront really thinking about what the interfaces should look like and how they interact and behave before writing a line of code , the entire process flows better .
At the very least , hashing out a class diagram and really trying to understand the responsibilities and collaborators ( via CRC cards ) of the objects you are building really provides value .
Spending that kind of time up front also helps you see the kind of patterns that might bring additional strategic value to your design .
When you are doing pure TDD , you are more in a tactical mind set , focused on solving your use cases and getting your tests to pass .
Everything Does n’t Need to Have its Own Unit Test
I will admit that if you are looking to attain 100 % code coverage , TDD is probably the way to go .
But what does 100 % code coverage actually buy you ?
It does n’t actually prove that your software is bug free .
Testing every line of your code and every execution pathway are two entirely separate things .
Test Quality is infinitely more useful than Test Quantity .
Also no amount of unit testing will ever replace user acceptance testing .
Just because you wrote your code to spec , does n’t mean that the spec did n’t make any faulty assumptions .
Another fact of life is that not all dependencies can be tested .
Maybe you do n’t know or can’t find out all the ways in which a dependency will behave .
Maybe your class has a dependency on an object that can not be instantiated outside the environment it lives .
SharePoint and other Web API ’s come to mind .
And while I am aware of Mock object frameworks , there gets to be a point where the effort required to mock an object is not worth the value it will bring from both an efficiency and quality point of view .
So why aim for 100 % code coverage ?
I have read plenty of blog posts that say the difference between 99 % code coverage and 100 % coverage is immense .
Some people will even test simple property getters and setters .
If this is n’t overkill , I do n’t know what is .
To me this epitomizes cargo cult thinking .
When I develop software , I write plenty of unit tests .
I do n’t write them first , but I also do n’t write them last .
I write them as I write code complex enough that it warrants one .
I also do n’t just sit back to run unit tests and watch them pass or fail .
I actively set breakpoints and debug them .
I do n’t always trust that a test that passes a test is actually functioning properly unless I step through it line by line .
There are plenty of tools that integrate with your IDE to make this easy .
Debugging is something that I actually enjoy .
Stepping through code , using locals and watch windows make developing fun .
Why let the testing framework have all the fun .
No Silver Bullets for Software Quality
Writing Software is Hard and I am by no means an expert in anything , let alone TDD .
If you find that TDD makes it easier for you to write software , by all means adopt it .
But I am fairly convinced that it is not a silver bullet that can be used on all projects and all situations .
As it is with everything , the real skill is in identifying where and when it makes sense to use TDD and not trying to fit a round peg into a square hole .
If you agree or disagree with anything I said , leave a comment or meet me July 1st 2008 at the Fairfield / Westchester Dot Net user group meeting where I am participating in a panel discussion on testing .
Sandvine creates deep packet inspection ( DPI ) gear that is used by ISPs like Comcast to inspect and sometimes throttle Internet traffic , and the company has been the target of a fair amount of online ire for its work .
But CEO
Dave Caputo says that it's all one big misunderstanding ; what he really wants to do with his company is focus on " improving the quality of the experience of the Internet and trying to make the world a better place . "
Caputo made the remarks in an interview with the CBC's Peter Nowak , and it 's worth reading in full .
Apart from one odd interlude where Caputo suggests that those who favor network neutrality laws also want to destroy copyright , it 's an interesting conversation that largely circles around a single point : ISP overselling .
Dave Caputo
Like operators of other networks ( road , airlines , etc. ) , just about every ISP in the world attempts to sell bandwidth to users on the assumption that it will not be used 24 / 7 .
In fact , it can't be used continuously at top speed because the ISP lacks a connection to the Internet that can handle simultaneous full - speed traffic from all users .
( We 've noted before that the Internet backbone has plenty of room at the moment ; it 's last - mile providers and their networks that are experiencing congestion issues . )
As Sandvine puts in it a white paper on net neutrality ( " A Broadband Wild West ? " ) , " This over - subscription model is observed regularly in our modern life .
For example , with water supply — everyone has experienced a hot - water scalding when another household member flushes the toilet .
This is a graphic example of the water supply unable to fulfill the simultaneous demands of different users . "
( Note to whichever Sandvine employee wrote this : please contact a professional plumber .
This should not , in fact , be happening , and your scalded back will thank me for making you fix the problem . )
When people are presented with this fact , one common response is to call the ISPs thieving bastards who should " give me what I 've paid for . "
ISPs are quite careful not to promise the speeds they advertise , though , and this response generally misses the fact that dedicated bandwidth would cost far more than people currently pay .
This realization often leads to the second response , which is , " Give me some way to pay for the bandwidth I actually want to use , do n't just hobble certain applications or block encrypted traffic or reset my BitTorrent transfers . "
This in turn usually spawns a debate about metered Internet access , which is complicated by the fact that it seems ultra -fair , on one level , but it would also likely stymie the development of new , high - bandwidth services .
For instance , I 've become a helpless devotee of Hell 's Kitchen on Hulu , the NBC / FOX joint online venture ; it 's so bad that I do n't even know when the show actually airs .
But if I paid by the gigabyte for an unthrottled , uncensored connection , I 'd find out when Hell 's Kitchen aired on TV , watch it then , and stop watching Hulu .
No big deal , except that by not watching Hulu , I would n't have discovered the flawed but still - fascinating show Startup Junkies , and I would n't be contributing to the on - demand video revolution .
Net neutrality is " laughable "
What Caputo seems to think he 's doing with Sandvine is enabling " all - you - can - eat " models at reasonable prices .
People who argue for network neutrality are " painting the service providers into a corner , " he says in the interview .
" If all packets are created equal then it 's equal utility and we should be charging on a per- packet basis , and I do n't think anybody wants to go there . "
Without traffic management , especially of P2P , the idea is that prices would either go up or congestion might reach truly terrible new heights , and Caputo believes that most users would rather just throttle P2P ; let it work , but slowly and in the background , so that ISPs do n't need to make expensive infrastructure improvements and everyone can continue eating at the buffet for $ 30 or $ 40 a month .
We might also see tiers emerge that allow P2P users free rein for , say $ 70 a month , while non -P2P users could keep paying lower prices .
Caputo insists , " it 's going to be laughable in the next two or three years that people used to say all packets should be treated equally . "
Of course , it 's probably no accident that Caputo 's vision of a tiered Internet where throttlers are the good guys just happens to need his products in every network .
And while his vision has a compelling logic too it , it 's a logic that only makes sense in a truly competitive environment where ISPs can't simply install such tools as a way to artificially hike per-bit prices and pick " winners and losers " on the ' Net .
But Caputo did n't get into the DPI business because he loved controversy ; he did it because real - time traffic identification was a " cool " problem to solve .
" We 're going to attack a problem where we can't imagine there 's a more difficult problem , " he said of setting up Sandvine .
" I take nothing away from rocket scientists or biologists who are trying to cure cancer , but in our domain we really could n't think of a more difficult problem , and that really excited us . "

If you have seen The Rock , you might remember the scene in which
Nicholas
Cage saves himself from nerve gas poisoning by jamming an atropine syringe into his chest .
If his situation were real , the protagonist would have wanted a better antidote .
In the past two months , scientists in Korea and the Czech Republic may have discovered several of them .
Both of the research teams reported their findings in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry .
Nerve gas works by inactivating an enzyme that breaks down the nerve signal - sending chemical acetylcholine .
That causes large amounts of the neurotransmitter to build up and overload the nervous system – resulting in a variety of terrible symptoms including convulsions and ending in respiratory failure .
Atropine is a drug derived from Atropa belladonna – the toxic berry better known as deadly nightshade .
It blocks the signals sent by acetylcholine , providing relief from the chemical overload caused by nerve gas , but it is only a temporary fix .
At the Faculty of Military Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove , Czech
Republic , Kamil Kuca and his collaborators looked for chemicals that can counteract the particularly tricky nerve agent tabun .
Although the chemicals they discovered could not accomplish that goal , they proved better than several established medications for mitigating the effects of paraoxon pesticide poisoning .
The other team tested several new chemicals on acetylcholine - destroying enzymes extracted from housefly brains and cow blood cells .
Young - Sik Jung and his colleagues at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology discovered a chemical that outperforms two of the standard treatments .
Both of the new medications , which belong to a family called oximes , reactivate the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine .
In other words , they directly counteract the effects of nerve gas .
Each one of them is a close relative of HI - 6 , 2 - PAM , and TMB - 4 , which are currently used alongside atropine as the standard treatments for nerve gas poisoning .
Although nerve gas attacks are rare , they do happen .
In 1995 , the Aum
Shinrikyo cult released sarin into a Tokyo subway tunnel , killing several people and injuring hundreds .
Far more common are cases of insecticide poisoning , which require the same medications .
Insecticides are made from organophosphates , the same class of chemicals as nerve agents , but they are less harmful to humans in small doses .
Neither of the recent research projects included tests on humans or animals , so there is no way of knowing if the new chemicals are toxic .
If they do prove safe for humans , I wonder whether any of them will ever be adopted by the United States for homeland security programs .
In comparison to other countries , the American level of preparedness for a chemical attack seems rather low .
Israel provides each of its citizens with an auto - injector that contains a blend of atropine and
TMB - 4 .
However , that level of preparation comes with its own set of problems .
A recent report described several incidents of kids accidentally stabbing themselves with the medicated darts .
Thankfully , none of them suffered any serious consequences .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People in Argentina , Mexico , Egypt and China are more likely than those in the United States to say it is very important for the news media to be free from government control , a survey published on Thursday found .
The survey of 20 countries by World Public Opinion.org at the University of Maryland , found strong support worldwide for a free press and opposition to government restrictions on access to the Internet .
But in the United States , where residents believed the news media already had significant freedoms , many people did not support further protections for the press , the survey showed .
More than one out of four U.S. residents said the government should have the right to prevent the media from publishing things it thinks could be politically destabilizing .
More than one in five thought the press should have fewer freedoms .
Fifty - six percent of U.S. residents said it was very important for the media to be free to publish without government control , compared to 70 percent of Argentines , 79 percent of Mexicans , 64 percent of Egyptians and 58 percent of Chinese .
In Britain , with media traditions similar to the United States , 28 percent of those surveyed said the government should have the right to prevent publication of things it thinks will be politically destabilizing .
But only 15 percent of Britons thought the press should have fewer freedoms and 65 percent said it was very important for the media to be able to publish without government controls .
Although the survey saw broad support for press freedoms worldwide , it also found people in six Muslim - majority countries and Russia strongly believe the government should have the right to restrict publication of material viewed as politically destabilizing .
Sixty - six percent of Jordanians favored such controls , as did 59 percent in the Palestinian territories , 56 percent of Indonesians and 45 percent of Iranians .
Views were sharply divided on the issue in Turkey , Egypt and Russia , with large minorities favoring restrictions .
Despite favoring limits on publishing potentially destabilizing material , however , majorities in many of the countries also favored more media freedoms in general .
Note : Chris Hedges gave this keynote address on Wednesday , May 28 , in Furman University ’s Younts Conference Center .
The address was part of protests by faculty and students over the South Carolina college ’s decision to invite George W. Bush to give the May 31 commencement address .
When it was announced in May that President Bush would deliver the commencement address , 222 students and faculty signed and posted on the school ’s Web site a statement titled “ We Object . ”
The statement cites the war in Iraq and the administration ’s “ obstructing progress on reducing greenhouse gases while favoring billions in tax breaks and subsidies to oil companies that are earning record profits . ”
“ We are ashamed of the actions of this administration .
The war in Iraq has cost the lives of over 4,000 brave and honorable U.S. military personnel , ” the statement read .
“ Because we love this country and the ideals it stands for , we accept our civic responsibility to speak out against these actions that violate American values . ”
I used to live in a country called America .
It was not a perfect country , God knows , especially if you were African - American or Native American or of Japanese descent in World War II or poor or gay or a woman or an immigrant , but it was a country I loved and honored .
This country gave me hope that it could be better .
It paid its workers wages that were envied around the world .
It made sure these workers , thanks to labor unions and champions of the working class in the Democratic Party and the press , had health benefits and pensions .
It offered good public education .
It honored basic democratic values and held in regard the rule of law , including international law , and respect for human rights .
It had social programs from Head Start to welfare to Social Security to take care of the weakest among us , the mentally ill , the elderly and the destitute .
It had a system of government that , however flawed , was dedicated to protecting the interests of its citizens .
It offered the possibility of democratic change .
It had a media that was diverse and endowed with the integrity to give a voice to all segments of society , including those beyond our borders , to impart to us unpleasant truths , to challenge the powerful , to explain ourselves to ourselves .
I am not blind to the imperfections of this America , or the failures to always meet these ideals at home and abroad .
I spent 20 years of my life in Latin America , Africa , the Middle East and the Balkans as a foreign correspondent reporting in countries where crimes and injustices were committed in our name , whether during the Contra war in Nicaragua or the brutalization of the Palestinians by Israeli occupation forces .
But there was much that was good and decent and honorable in our country .
And there was hope .
The country I live in today uses the same words to describe itself , the same patriotic symbols and iconography , the same national myths , but only the shell remains .
America , the country of my birth , the country that formed and shaped me , the country of my father , my father ’s father , and his father ’s father , stretching back to the generations of my family that were here for the country ’s founding , is so diminished as to be nearly unrecognizable .
I do not know if this America will return , even as I pray and work and strive for its return .
The “ consent of the governed ” has become an empty phrase .
Our textbooks on political science are obsolete .
Our state , our nation , has been hijacked by oligarchs , corporations and a narrow , selfish political elite , a small and privileged group which governs on behalf of moneyed interests .
We are undergoing , as John Ralston Saul wrote , “ a coup d’etat in slow motion . ”
We are being impoverished — legally , economically , spiritually and politically .
And unless we soon reverse this tide , unless we wrest the state away from corporate hands , we will be sucked into the dark and turbulent world of globalization where there are only masters and serfs , where the American dream will be no more than that — a dream , where those who work hard for a living can no longer earn a decent wage to sustain themselves or their families , whether in sweat shops in China or the decaying rust belt of Ohio , where democratic dissent is condemned as treason and ruthlessly silenced .
I single out no party .
The Democratic Party has been as guilty as the Republicans .
It was Bill Clinton who led the Democratic Party to the corporate watering trough .
Clinton argued that the party had to ditch labor unions , no longer a source of votes or power , as a political ally .
Workers , he insisted , would vote Democratic anyway .
They had no choice .
It was better , he argued , to take corporate money .
By the 1990s , the Democratic Party , under Clinton ’s leadership , had virtual fundraising parity with the Republicans .
Today the Democrats get more .
In political terms , it was a success .
In moral terms , it was a betrayal .
The North American Free Trade Agreement was sold to the country by the Clinton White House as an opportunity to raise the incomes and prosperity of the citizens of the United States , Canada and Mexico .
NAFTA would also , we were told , staunch Mexican immigration into the United States .
“ There will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home , ” President Clinton said in the spring of 1993 as he was lobbying for the bill .
But NAFTA , which took effect in 1994 , had the curious effect of reversing every one of Clinton ’s rosy predictions .
Once the Mexican government lifted price supports on corn and beans for Mexican farmers , they had to compete against the huge agribusinesses in the United States .
The Mexican farmers were swiftly bankrupted .
At least 2 million Mexican farmers have been driven off their land since 1994 .
And guess where many of them went ?
This desperate flight of poor Mexicans into the United States is now being exacerbated by large - scale factory closures along the border as manufacturers pack up and leave Mexico for the cut -rate embrace of China ’s totalitarian capitalism .
But we were assured that goods would be cheaper .
Workers would be wealthier .
Everyone would be happier .
I am not sure how these contradictory things were supposed to happen , but in a sound - bite society , reality no longer matters .
NAFTA was great if you were a corporation .
It was a disaster if you were a worker .
Clinton ’s welfare reform bill , which was signed on Aug. 22 , 1996 , obliterated the nation ’s social safety net .
It threw 6 million people , many of them single mothers , off the welfare rolls within three years .
It dumped them onto the streets without child care , rent subsidies and continued Medicaid coverage .
Families were plunged into crisis , struggling to survive on multiple jobs that paid $ 6 or $ 7 an hour , or less than $ 15,000 a year .
But these were the lucky ones .
In some states , half of those dropped from the welfare rolls could not find work .
Clinton slashed Medicare by $ 115 billion over a five - year period and cut $ 25 billion in Medicaid funding .
The booming and overcrowded prison system handled the influx of the poor , as well as our abandoned mentally ill .
And today we stand in shame with 2.3 million of our citizens behind bars , most for nonviolent drug offenses .
More than one in 100 adults in the United States is incarcerated and one in nine black men ages 20 to 34 is behind bars .
The United States , with less than 5 per cent of the global population , has almost 25 percent of the world ’s prisoners .
The growing desperation across the United States is unleashing not simply a recession — we have been in a recession for some time now — but the possibility of a depression unlike anything we have seen since the 1930s .
This desperation has provided a pool of broken people willing to work for low wages and without unions or benefits .
This is good news if you are a corporation .
It is very bad news if you work for a living .
For the bottom 90 percent of Americans , annual income has been on a slow , steady decline for three decades .
The majority ’s income peaked at $ 33,000 in 1973 .
By 2005 , according to New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston in his book “ Free Lunch , ” it had fallen to a bit more than $ 29,000 , this despite three decades of economic expansion .
And where did that money go ?
Ask ExxonMobil , the biggest U.S. oil and gas company , which made a $ 10.9 - billion profit in the first quarter of this year , leaving us to pay close to $ 4 a gallon to fill up our cars .
Or better yet , ask Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson , whose compensation rose nearly 18 percent to $ 21.7 million in 2007 , when the oil company pulled in the largest profit ever for a U.S. company .
His take - home pay package included $ 1.75 million in salary , a $ 3.36 - million bonus , and $ 16.1 million of stock and option awards , according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
He also received nearly $ 430,000 of other compensation , including $ 229,331 for personal security and $ 41,122 for use of the company aircraft .
In addition to his pay package , Tillerson , 56 , received more than $ 7.6 million from exercising options and stock awards during the year .
Exxon Mobil earned $ 40.61 billion in 2007 , up 3 percent from the previous year .
But Tillerson ’s 2007 pay was not even the highest mark for the U.S. oil and gas industry .
Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Ray Irani made $ 33.6 million and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. chief James Hackett took in $ 26.7 million over the same period .
For each dollar earned in 2005 , the top 10 percent got 48.5 cents .
That was the top 10th ’s greatest share of the income pie , Johnston writes , since 1929 , just before the Roaring ’ 20s collapsed in the Great Depression .
And within the top 10 percent , those who made more than $ 100,000 , nearly all the gains went to the top 10th of 1 percent , people like Tillerson , or Irani or Hackett , who made at least $ 1.7 million that year .
And until we have real election reform , until we make it possible to run for national office without candidates kissing the rings of Tillersons , Iranis and Hacketts to get hundreds of millions of dollars , this rape of America will continue .
While the Democrats have been very bad , George W. Bush has been even worse .
Let ’s set aside Iraq — the worst foreign policy blunder in American history .
George Bush has also done more to dismantle our Constitution , ignore or revoke our statutes and reverse regulations that protected American citizens from corporate abuse than any other president in recent American history .
The president , as the Boston Globe reported , has claimed the authority , through “ signing statements , ” to disobey more than 750 laws enacted since he took office , asserting that he has the power to set aside any statute passed by Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the Constitution .
Among the laws Bush said he can ignore are military rules and regulations , affirmative - action provisions , requirements that Congress be told about immigration services problems , ” whistle - blower ” protections for nuclear regulatory officials , and safeguards against political interference in federally funded research .
The Constitution is clear in assigning to Congress the power to write the laws and to the president a duty ” to take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ”
George Bush , however , has repeatedly declared that he does not need to ” execute ” a law he believes is unconstitutional .
The Bush administration has gutted environmental , food and product safety , and workplace safety standards along with their enforcement .
And this is why coal mines collapse , the housing bubble has blown up in our face and we are sold lead - contaminated toys imported from China .
Bush has done more than any president to hand our government directly over to corporations , which now get 40 percent of federal discretionary spending .
Over 800,000 jobs once handled by government employees have been outsourced to corporations , a move that has not only further empowered our shadow corporate government but helped destroy federal workforce unions .
Everything from federal prisons , the management of regulatory and scientific reviews , the processing or denial of Freedom of Information requests , interrogating prisoners and running the world ’s largest mercenary army in Iraq has become corporate .
And these corporations , in a perverse arrangement , make their money off of the American citizen .
Halliburton in 2003 was given a no-bid and non-compete $ 7 - billion contract to repair Iraq ’s oil fields , as well as the power to oversee and control Iraq ’s entire oil production .
This has now become $ 130 billion in contract awards to Halliburton .
And flush with taxpayer dollars , what has Haliburton done ?
It has made sure only 36 of its 143 subsidiaries are incorporated in the United States and 107 subsidiaries ( or 75 percent ) are incorporated in 30 different countries .
Halliburton is able through this arrangement to lower its tax liability on foreign income by establishing a “ controlled foreign corporation ” and subsidiaries inside low - tax , or no -tax , countries known as a “ tax havens . ”
They take our money .
They squander it .
And our corporate government not only funds them but protects them .
Halliburton — and Halliburton is just one example — is the engine of our new , rogue corporate state , serviced by people like George Bush and Dick Cheney , once the company ’s CEO .
The disparity between our oligarchy and the working class has created a new global serfdom .
Credit Suisse analysts estimates that the number of subprime foreclosures in the United States over the next two years will total 1,390,000 and that by the end of 2012 , 12.7 percent of all residential borrowers in the United States will be forced out of their homes .
The corporate state , which as an idea is an abstraction to many Americans , is very real when the pieces are carefully put together and linked to a system of corporate power that has made this poverty , the denial of our constitutional rights and a state of permanent war inevitable .
The assault on the American working class — an assault that has devastated members of my own family — is nearly complete .
The U.S. economy has 3.2 million fewer jobs today than it did when George Bush took office , including 2.5 million fewer manufacturing jobs .
In the past three years , nearly one in five U.S. workers was laid off .
Among workers laid off from full - time work , roughly one - fourth were earning less than $ 40,000 annually .
A total of 15 million U.S. workers are unemployed , underemployed or too discouraged to job hunt , according to the Labor Department .
There are whole sections of the United States which now resemble the developing world .
There has been a Weimarization of the American working class .
And the assault on the middle class is now under way .
Anything that can be put on software — from finance to architecture to engineering — can and is being outsourced to workers in countries such as India or China who accept a fraction of the pay and work without benefits .
And both the Republican and Democratic parties , beholden to corporations for money and power , allow this to happen .
Take a look at our government departments .
Who runs the Defense Department ?
The Department of Interior ?
The Department of Agriculture ?
The Food and Drug Administration ?
Who runs the Department of Labor ?
Corporations .
And in an election year where we are numbed by absurdities we hear nothing about this subordinating of the American people to corporate power .
The political debates , which have become popularity contests , are ridiculous and empty .
They do not confront the real and advanced destruction of our democracy .
They do not confront the takeover of our electoral processes .
We have watched over the past few decades the rise of a powerful web of interlocking corporate entities , a network of arrangements within subsectors , industries or other partial jurisdictions to diminish and often abolish outside control and oversight .
These corporations have neutralized national , state and judicial authority .
They dominate , for example , a bloated and wasteful defense industry which has become sacrosanct and beyond the reach of politicians , most of whom are left defending military projects in their districts , no matter how redundant , because they provide jobs .
This has permitted a military - industrial complex , which contributes lavishly to political campaigns , to spread across the country with virtual impunity .
Defense - related spending for fiscal 2008 will exceed $ 1 trillion for the first time in history .
The U.S. has become the largest single seller of arms and munitions on the planet .
The defense budget for fiscal 2008 is the largest since the Second World War even as we have more than $ 400 billion in annual deficits .
More than half of federal discretionary spending goes to defense .
This will not end when Bush leaves office .
And so we build Cold War relics like $ 3.4 - billion submarines and stealth fighters to evade radar systems the Soviets never built and spend $ 8.9 billion on ICBM missile defense that will be useless in stopping a shipping container concealing a dirty bomb .
The defense industry is able to monopolize the best scientific and research talent and squander the nation ’s resources and investment capital .
These defense industries produce nothing that is useful for society or the national trade account .
Melman , like President Eisenhower , saw the defense industry as viral , something that , as it grew , destroyed a healthy economy .
And so we produce sophisticated fighter jets while Boeing is unable to finish its new commercial plane on schedule , and our automotive industry tanks .
We sink money into research and development of weapons systems and starve technologies to fight against global warming and renewable energy .
Universities are awash in defense - related cash and grants , and struggle to find money for environmental studies .
This massive military spending , aided by this $ 3 - trillion war , is hollowing us out from the inside .
Our bridges and levees collapse , our schools decay and our safety net is taken away .
The corporate state , begun under Ronald Reagan and pushed forward by every president since , has destroyed the public and private institutions that protected workers and safeguarded citizens .
Only 7.8 per cent of workers in the private sector are unionized .
This is about the same percentage as in the early 1900s .
There are 50 million Americans in real poverty and tens of millions of Americans in a category called “ near poverty . ”
Our health care system is broken .
Eighteen thousand people die in this country , according to the Institute of Medicine , every year because they can’t afford health care .
That is six times the number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks , and these unnecessary deaths continue year after year .
But we do not hear these stories of pain and dislocation .
We are diverted by bread and circus .
News reports do little more than report on trivia and celebrity gossip .
The FCC , in an example of how far our standards have fallen , defines shows like Fox ’s celebrity gossip program “ TMZ ” and the Christian Broadcast Network ’s “ 700 Club ” as “ bona fide newscasts . ”
The economist Charlotte Twight calls this vast corporate system of spectacle and democratic collapse “ participatory fascism . ”
How did we get here ?
How did this happen ?
In a word , deregulation — the systematic dismantling of the managed capitalism that was the hallmark of the American democratic state .
Our political decline came about because of deregulation , the repeal of antitrust laws , and the radical transformation from a manufacturing economy to a capital economy .
This understanding led Franklin Delano Roosevelt on April 29 , 1938 , to send a message to Congress titled “ Recommendations to the Congress to Curb Monopolies and the Concentration of Economic Power . ”
In it , he wrote :
“ The first truth is that the liberty of democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself .
That , in its essence , is Fascism — ownership of Government by an individual , by a group , or by any other controlling private power .
The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way to sustain an acceptable standard of living . ”
The rise of the corporate state has grave political consequences , as we saw in Italy and Germany in the early part of the 20th century .
Antitrust laws not only regulate and control the marketplace , they serve as bulwarks to protect democracy .
And now that they are gone , now that we have a state that is run by and on behalf of corporations , we must expect inevitable and perhaps terrifying political consequences .
I spent two years traveling the country to write a book on the Christian right called “ American Fascists : The Christian Right and the War on America . ”
In depressed former manufacturing towns from Ohio to Kentucky it was the same .
There are tens of millions of Americans for whom the end of the world is no longer an abstraction .
They have lost hope .
Fear and instability has plunged the working class into personal and economic despair , and not surprisingly into the arms of the demagogues and charlatans of the radical Christian right who offer a belief in magic , miracles and the fiction of a utopian Christian nation .
And unless we re-enfranchise these Americans back into the economy , unless we give them hope , our democracy is doomed .
As the pressure mounts , as this despair and desperation reaches into larger and larger segments of the American populace , the mechanisms of corporate and government control are being bolstered to prevent civil unrest and instability .
It is not accidental that with the rise of the corporate state comes the rise of the security state .
This is why the Bush White House has pushed through the Patriot Act ( and its renewal ) , the suspension of habeas corpus , the practice of “ extraordinary rendition , ” the warrantless wiretapping on American citizens and the refusal to ensure free and fair elections with verifiable ballot - counting .
It is part of a package .
It comes together .
It is not about terrorism or national security .
It is about control .
It is about their control of us .
Sen . Frank Church , as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence in 1975 , investigated the government ’s massive and highly secretive National Security Agency .
He wrote :
“ That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left , such is the capability to monitor everything : telephone conversations , telegrams , it does n’t matter .
There would be no place to hide .
If this government ever became a tyranny , if a dictator ever took charge in this country , the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny , and there would be no way to fight back , because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government , no matter how privately it was done , is within the reach of the government to know .
Such is the capability of this technology .
…
I do n’t want to see this country ever go across the bridge .
I know the capability that is there to make tyranny total in America , and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision , so that we never cross over that abyss .
That is the abyss from which there is no return . … ”
When Sen . Church made this statement the NSA was not authorized to spy on American citizens .
Today it is .
In a military brig in Charleston an American citizen , Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , is being held in a black hole set up on American soil .
He was stripped on June 23 , 2003 , by George Bush of his constitutional rights and declared an “ enemy combatant . ”
He is being detained without charge , interrogated without a lawyer and held indefinitely .
Lawyers for the Bush administration claim that the president can send the military into any neighborhood , any town or suburb , capture a citizen and hold him or her in prison without charge .
They base this claim on the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress after 9/11 , that gives President Bush the power to “ use all necessary and appropriate force ” against anyone involved in planning , aiding or carrying out the attacks .
But Al - Mari was not captured in Afghanistan or Iraq .
He was arrested in Peoria , Ill. , in December 2001 .
And if the president can declare American citizens living inside the United States to be enemy combatants and order them stripped of constitutional rights , what does this mean for us ?
How long can we be held without charge ?
Without lawyers ?
Without access to the outside world ?
Maybe Al - Mari is , as the government claims , a terrorist .
I do n’t know .
But I do know that if this becomes a precedent , if it is not overturned by the courts , habeas corpus , the most important bulwark of our democratic state , will be dead .
We are fed lie after lie to mask the destruction the corporate state has wrought in our lives .
The consumer price index , for example , used by the government to measure inflation , has become meaningless .
To keep the official inflation figures low the government has been substituting basic products they once measured to check for inflation with ones that do not rise very much in price .
This trick has kept the cost - of - living increases tied to the CPI artificially low .
The disconnect between what we are told and what is actually true is worthy of the old East German state .
The New York Times ’ consumer reporter , W.P. Dunleavy , wrote that her groceries now cost $ 587 a month , up from $ 400 a year earlier .
This is a 40 percent increase .
California economist John Williams , who runs an organization called Shadow Statistics , contends that if Washington still used the CPI measurements applied back in the 1970s , inflation would be in the 10 percent range .
The advantage to the corporations is huge .
A false inflation rate , one far lower than the real rate , keeps equitable interest payments on bank accounts and certificates of deposit down .
It masks the deterioration of the American economy .
The Potemkin statistics allow corporations and the corporate state to walk away from obligations tied to real adjustments for inflation .
These statistics mean that less is paid out in Social Security and pensions .
It has reduced the interest on the multitrillion - dollar debt .
Corporations never have to pay real cost - of - living increases to their employees .
The term “ unemployment ” has also been steadily redefined .
This has rendered official data on employment worthless .
In real terms about 10 percent of the working population is unemployed , a figure that is , over the long run , unsustainable .
The economy , despite the official statistics , is not growing .
It is shrinking .
And as the nation crumbles we are awash with the terrible simplicity of false statistics .
We confuse our emotional responses , carefully manipulated by advertisers , pundits , spin doctors , television hosts , political consultants and focus groups , with knowledge .
It is how we elect presidents and those we send to Congress , how we make decisions , even decisions to go to war .
It is how we view the world .
Four media giants — AOL - Time Warner , Viacom , Disney , and Rupert Murdoch ’s NewsGroup — control nearly everything we read , see and hear .
This growing disconnect with reality is the hallmark of a totalitarian state .
“ Before they seize power and establish a world according to their doctrines , ” Hannah Arendt wrote , “ totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which is more adequate to the needs of the human mind than reality itself ; in which , through sheer imagination , uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never - ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations .
The force possessed by totalitarian propaganda — before the movements have the power to drop iron curtains to prevent anyone ’s disturbing , by the slightest reality , the gruesome quiet of an entirely imaginary world — lies in its ability to shut the masses off from the real world . ”
So what do we do ?
Voting is not enough .
If voting was that effective , to quote the activist Philip Berrigan , it would be illegal .
And voting in an age when elections are stolen by rigged ballot machines and a stacked Supreme Court willing to overturn all legal precedent to make George Bush president , will not work .
I am not saying do not vote .
We should all vote .
But that has to be the starting point if we want to reclaim America .
We must lobby , organize and advocate for the dissolution of the World Trade Organization and NAFTA .
The WTO and NAFTA have handcuffed workers , consumers and stymied our efforts to create clean environments .
These agreements are beyond the control of our courts and have crippled our weakened regulatory agencies .
The WTO forces our working class to compete with brutalized child and prison labor overseas , to be reduced to this level of slave labor or to go without meaningful work .
We need to repeal the anti-worker Taft - Hartley law of 1947 .
The act obstructs the organization of unions .
We need to transfer control of pension funds from management to workers .
If these pension funds , worth trillions of dollars , were in the hands of workers the working class would own a third of the New York Stock Exchange .
The working class has every right to be , to steal a line from Obama , bitter with liberal elites .
I am bitter .
I have seen what the loss of manufacturing jobs and the death of the labor movement did to my relatives in the former mill towns in Maine .
Their story is the story of tens of millions of Americans who can no longer find a job that supports a family and provides basic benefits .
Human beings are not commodities .
They are not goods .
They grieve , and suffer and feel despair .
They raise children and struggle to maintain communities .
The growing class divide is not understood , despite the glibness of many in the media , by complicated sets of statistics or the absurd , utopian faith in unregulated globalization and complicated trade deals .
It is understood in the eyes of a man or woman who is no longer making enough money to live with dignity and hope .
George Bush , who will be here on Saturday , has done more to shred , violate or absent the government from its obligations under domestic and international law .
He has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol , backed out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , tried to kill the International Criminal Court , walked out on negotiations on chemical and biological weapons , and defied the Geneva Convention and human rights law .
He has set up offshore penal colonies where we deny detainees basic rights and openly engage in torture .
He launched an illegal war in Iraq based on fabricated evidence we now know had been discredited even before it was made public .
And if we as citizens do not hold him accountable for these crimes , if we allow the Democratic majority in Congress to get away with its refusal to begin the process of impeachment , which appears likely , we will be complicit in the codification of a new world order , one that will have terrifying consequences .
For a world without treaties , statutes and laws is a world where any nation , from a rogue nuclear state to a great imperial power , will be able to invoke its domestic laws to annul its obligations to others .
This new order will undo five decades of international cooperation — largely put in place by the United States — destroy our own constitutional rights and thrust us into a Hobbesian nightmare .
We are one , maybe two , terrorist attacks away from a police state .
Time is running out .
We must not allow international laws and treaties — ones that set minimum standards of behavior and provide a framework for competing social , political , economic and religious groups and interests to resolve differences — to be discarded .
The exercise of power without law is tyranny .
And the consequences of George Bush ’s violation of the law , his creation of legal black holes that can swallow American citizens along with those outside our borders , run in a direct line from the White House to Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo and military brigs in cities such as Charleston .
George Bush — we now know from the leaked Downing Street memo — fabricated a legal pretext for war .
He decided to charge Saddam Hussein with the material breach of the resolution passed in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War .
He had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was in breach of this resolution .
And so he and his advisers manufactured reports of weapons of mass destruction and disseminated them to a frightened and manipulated press and public .
In short , he lied .
He lied to us and to the rest of the world .
There are tens of thousands , perhaps a few hundred thousand people , who have been killed and maimed in a war that has no legal justification , a war waged in violation of international law , a war that under the post - Nuremberg laws is defined as “ a criminal war of aggression . ”
We have blundered into nations we know little about .
We are caught between bitter rivalries and competing ethnic groups and leaders we do not understand .
We are trying to transplant a modern system of politics invented in Europe characterized , among other things , by the division of earth into independent secular states based on national citizenship in a land where the belief in a secular civil government is an alien creed .
Iraq was a cesspool for the British when they occupied it in 1917 .
It will be a cesspool for us as well .
We can either begin an orderly withdrawal or watch the mission collapse .
A rule - based world matters .
The creation of international bodies and laws , the sanctity of our constitutional rights , have allowed us to stand pre-eminent as a nation — one that seeks at its best to respect and defend the rule of law .
If we demolish the fragile and delicate domestic and international order , if we permit George Bush to create a world where diplomacy , broad cooperation , democracy and law are worthless , if we allow these international and domestic legal safeguards to unravel , our moral and political authority will plummet .
We will erode the possibility of cooperation between nation - states , including our closest allies .
We will lose our country .
And we will , in the end , see visited upon us the evils we visit on others .
Read Antigone , when the king imposes his will without listening to those he rules or Thucydides ’ history .
Read how Athens ’ expanding empire saw it become a tyrant abroad and then a tyrant at home .
How the tyranny the Athenian leadership imposed on others it finally imposed on itself .
This , Thucydides wrote , is what doomed Athenian democracy ; Athens destroyed itself .
For the primary instrument of tyranny and empire is war and war is a poison , a poison which at times we must ingest just as a cancer patient must ingest a poison to survive .
But if we do not understand the poison of war — if we do not understand how deadly that poison is — it can kill us just as surely as the disease .
Hope , St. Augustine wrote , has two beautiful daughters .
They are anger and courage .
Anger at the way things are and the courage to see they do not remain the way they are .
We stand at the verge of a massive economic dislocation , one forcing millions of families from their homes and into severe financial distress , one that threatens to rend the fabric of our society .
We are waging a war that devours lives and capital , and that cannot ultimately be won .
We are told we need to give up our rights to be safe , to be protected .
In short , we are made afraid .
We are told to hand over all that is best about our nation to those like George Bush and Dick Cheney who seek to destroy our nation .
A state of fear only engenders cruelty ; cruelty , fear , insanity , and then paralysis .
In the center of Dante ’s circle the damned remained motionless .
If we do not become angry , if we do not muster within us the courage , indeed the militancy , to challenge those in the Democratic and Republican parties who herd us towards the corporate state , we will have squandered our courage and our integrity when we need it most .
Editor ’s note : Justin Raimondo ’s column will return Friday .
The drumbeat for war with Iran is getting louder .
Determined to ensure their success , by hook or by crook , the neoconservatives inside the administration , and their supporters in Israel , have launched a three - front campaign to provoke a confrontation with Tehran .
1. The Blackmail Option : Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert held a secret meeting recently at his home .
Present were top cabinet officials and someone who has plenty of experience of the sort that interests the Israelis at the present moment : Aviam Sela , who headed up Operation Opera , the 1981 air strike against Iraq ’s Osirak nuclear facility .
It was a bold and decisive blow against Israel ’s mortal enemy , which set the Iraqis back ( though it drove them to create an underground program that actually was for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons by the time of the first Gulf War 10 years later ) .
What Olmert wanted to know was whether it could be repeated in the case of Iran .
Yet no one should assume that Israel intends to act alone .
An Israeli strike against Iran would be but a prelude to a much wider conflict , one that would invariably draw in Israel ’s one and only ally  us .
That ’s why the Israeli propaganda campaign directed at Iran has taken place on American terrain , aimed squarely at American public opinion and American lawmakers .
Speaking at a recent AIPAC conference in Washington , Olmert declared :
“ Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran , and neither should any other country in the free world .
The Iranian threat must be stopped by all possible means .
International economic and political sanctions on Iran , as crucial as they may be , are only an initial step , and must be dramatically increased .
The international community has a duty and responsibility to clarify to Iran , through drastic measures , that the repercussions of their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will be devastating . ”
There is no doubt in anyone ’s mind what “ drastic ” means , and this was underscored by his deputy prime minister , Shaul Mofaz , who recently averred that an attack on Iran is “ unavoidable . ”
The Israelis , as is well - known , cannot take out the widely dispersed Iranian target sites all by themselves .
They need U.S. cruise missiles fired from our ships in the Persian Gulf to take out the entirety of Iran ’s nuclear assets .
The whole point of this stratagem would be to embroil the U.S. in a conflict that would soon take on regional dimensions .
2. The Blockade Option : The Israel lobby is hard at work getting support for a congressional resolution that mandates a naval blockade of Iran .
This is now AIPAC ’s top priority in Washington , and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have already signed on .
The Senate version has attracted 32 cosponsors , while the House version has 220 cosponsors .
The resolution itself is typical AIPAC agitprop : at one point , it says that “ the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate reports that the Government of Iran was secretly working on the design and manufacture of a nuclear warhead until at least 2003 and that Iran could have enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon as early as late 2009 ”  deftly snipping off the conclusion of the NIE that “ We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program ” and substituting the Israeli assessment that Iran will go nuclear by 2009 , which the National Intelligence Council concluded was “ very unlikely . ”
The resolution , while containing boilerplate language to the effect that “ nothing in this resolution will be construed as authorizing military action , ” goes on to demand “ that the president lead an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the pressure on the Government of Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , among other measures , banning the importation of refined petroleum products to Iran . ”
It is typical Orwellian Newspeak : no military action is “ authorized , ” yet what else would a blockade involve but the use of American military assets to enforce it ?
This means war  and do n’t think for a moment that the Israel lobby has n’t got the power to push this war resolution through Congress .
3 . The Infiltration Option : Congress has already approved $ 400 million to destabilize the Iranian regime , the first phase of the administration ’s war moves against Tehran , and U.S. special - ops teams have been busy .
The number of violent incidents inside Iran has recently skyrocketed , and there is little doubt that the U.S. is funding and otherwise assisting terrorist activities within that country .
As Seymour Hersh reports :
“ The scale and the scope of the operations in Iran , which involve the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , have now been significantly expanded , according to the current and former officials . ”
The idea of the infiltration option is to coordinate with various minority ethnic groups , such as the Ahwazis and the Baluchis  Sunni fundamentalists of the al - Qaeda stripe who despise the Iranian Shi’ites as heretics  as well as the idiosyncratic Marxist cultists of the Mujahideen - e - Khalq ( MEK ) .
The goal is not just to gather intelligence , but also to provoke the regime into initiating a violent reaction .
This would increase the likelihood of direct U.S. involvement , as the fighting spills over Iran ’s borders into Iraq and / or Pakistan .
All three options , working in tandem over the next few months , will be more than enough to provoke the Iranians into some sort of response , which can then be used as a pretext for the Americans to attack .
As in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , there is considerable opposition gathering within U.S. military and diplomatic circles .
Hersh reports on a meeting between Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the Democratic caucus in the Senate , during which
“ Gates warned of the consequences if the Bush administration staged a preemptive strike on Iran , saying , as the senator recalled , ‘ We ’ll create generations of jihadists , and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in America . ’
Gates ’s comments stunned the Democrats at the lunch , and another senator asked whether Gates was speaking for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Gates ’s answer , the senator told me , was ‘ Let ’s just say that I ’m here speaking for myself . ' ”
The realists in the administration  foremost among them , the top military brass  know what a disaster war with Iran would soon turn into .
It would be an act of self - immolation unprecedented since Nero fiddled while Rome burned .
Yet the power of the Israel lobby is formidable , the realists have little political clout , and there is n’t much time to stop the momentum for war .
As craven as Barack Obama ’s recent performance before AIPAC was , the Lobby knows that , as president , he ’ll be unlikely to launch what would amount to World War III .
Shmuel Bar , a former top intelligence officer and Israeli government official who now works as an analyst , recently spoke to the British Guardian :
“ What is clear is that the push inside the Israeli establishment for a strike is not being driven by the timetable of Iran ’s mastery of the technical aspects alone , but by geopolitical considerations .
That point was reinforced by Bar last week when he identified a window of opportunity for a strike on Iran  ahead of the November presidential election in the United States which could see Barack Obama take power , and possibly engage with Syria and Iran .
An Obama presidency would close that window for Israel , says Bar . ”
The window of opportunity for the neocons to launch an attack will stay open only as long as this president is in the White House , and the Israelis know it .
That ’s why their propaganda campaign has recently been ratcheted up to new heights of hysteria , and why they ’re pulling in all their chits in Congress .
The clock is ticking , and the Lobby is moving fast .
Will  can  the antiwar movement move with equal speed ?
What is needed , first of all , is a decisive defeat for the Lobby on the issue of Senate Resolution 580 ( in the House , Congressional Resolution 362 ) .
A new war in the Middle East  or anywhere else  is the last thing the majority of Americans want , yet a fanatical and well - positioned minority will prevail if we do n’t act now .
Call your congressional representative today and tell them , politely and calmly , that you are urging a “ No ! ” vote on these concurrent resolutions .
There seems little doubt who and what is motivating this new push for war .
Even as “ moderate ” a commentator as Joe Klein knows that the Lobby is up to its old tricks again , and he is being pilloried for telling the truth .
In his Time column , Klein wrote :
“ The notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated , devout and ancient culture smacked  still smacks  of neocolonialist legerdemain .
The fact that a great many Jewish neoconservatives  people like Joe Lieberman and the crowd over at Commentary  plumped for this war , and now for an even more foolish assault on Iran , raised the question of divided loyalties : using U.S. military power , U.S. lives and money , to make the world safe for Israel . ”
As I have pointed out in this space many times , the great majority of American Jews oppose this administration ’s crazed foreign policy , and there would be no antiwar movement of any consequence without their active support .
Yet it can not be denied  as I wrote before a single shot had been fired  that the Iraq war was launched , as Klein notes , to make the Middle East safer for Israel , just as the current push for “ regime change ” in Iran is energized by the same motive .
This is what it means to be an empire : foreign lobbyists and satraps gather ’ round the imperial throne , scheming and plotting to gain the emperor ’s favor and the privilege of using his praetorians as an instrument to advance their own ends .
If it was n’t the Israelis , it would be someone else  perhaps the Brits , as in the two previous world wars .
In any case , until and unless we make real changes in our foreign policy  fundamental changes  we ’ll never get out of this box , and war clouds will loom large on our horizon well into the foreseeable future .
In the meantime , however , we have to make a start , and that means defeating Senate Resolution 580 and House Resolution 362 , in what would be a rare setback for the Lobby .
Go for it !
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
‘m sitting here looking at the just - published reprint of my 1993 book , Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement , and it sure is handsome !
It has a great painting by Jasper Johns on the cover , and a new introduction by Professor George W. Carey of Georgetown University .
Here ’s what Ron Paul had to say about it :
“ When I was deciding whether or not to run for president as a Republican , I re-read Justin Raimondo ’s Reclaiming the American Right , and it gave me hope  that the anti-interventionist , pro-liberty Old Right , which had once dominated the party , could and would rise again .
Here is living history : the story of an intellectual and political tradition that my campaign invoked and reawakened .
This prescient book , written in 1993 , could not be more relevant today . ”

Word has it that the farm bill congressional conferees hammered out at the end of last week would most likely be vetoed by President Bush .
The ink has not dried on the agreement , and that is why Congress had to pass an extension of the existing farm bill last week .
The extension gives lawmakers until May 2 , when they must either pass another stopgap measure or resort to the permanent 1949 agriculture law , if a new bill is not completed .
According to Ryan Grimm at Politico.com , when asked what the President would do if the current iteration of the farm bill made its way to the President ’s desk White House spokesman Scott Stanzel replied , “ as it stands now , it is not something the president would support . ”
Stanzel wrote in an email :
“ The proposal before Congress would dramatically increase spending , in part by masking additional spending in budgetary gimmicks and accounting tricks . ”
Farm bills pass – that ’s what they do
Despite the threat , there may be enough Congressional support to override the veto .
According to House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson ( D - MN ) , “ If the White House is stupid enough to veto this , they ’re going to get overridden . ”
The farm bill is a very popular funding mechanism for Congressional spending .
Every state ’s congressional delegation works extremely hard to get their slice of the agricultural pie – not doing so does not bode well in the eyes of powerful ag interests and the voters of agricultural states .
In short , farm bills do not get vetoed .
At least very rarely do they get vetoed – there are a few exceptions .
One exception to the rule is when a second term president uses a veto ( or threatens to veto ) an appropriations bill , such as a farm bill – and criticize Congress for loading it with pork and earmarks – without any serious political repercussions .
Interestingly enough , the last time a farm bill was vetoed was nearly 10 years ago , when another late second - term president successfully vetoed a farm bill – a veto which Congress made no attempt to override .
But the political climate is quite different from that of ten years ago , and I would suspect that this President does not have the political capital to successfully veto the farm bill .

Since Czech writer Karel Capek popularized the concept in 1921 , humanity has had a charming and amiable relationship with the robot .
We saw a future where helpful robots would do all the menial tasks humans would rather avoid .
The only problem ?
Some people are just dicks , and they can build robots too .
5 Bum Bot
What the Hell is That Thing ?
Designed by bar owner Rufus Terrill , the Bum Bot was built to shoo transients and drug addicts off his property without exposing himself to danger .
Terill was deeply concerned about the plight of his degenerating neighborhood , so he decided that the most logical idea was to slap some steel , plywood , old gym mats , a meat smoker , a walkie - talkie and spare parts from a 1997 Chevrolet into a fighting street robot -- a feat of technological improvisation so ingenious that it makes MacGyver seem like an Amish stroke victim by comparison .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Though why such a creative inventor went with a dull name like the Bum Bot is beyond us .
Why not load it with Peter Weller quotes and call it Hobocop ?
And that 's just off the top of our heads !
Why It 's a Dick Move
If you need it explained to you that inventing robots to harass transients is a dick move , you 're probably strangling a drifter for cheap kicks as you read this .
So , first off , way to multi-task !
Secondly , the field of terrorizing bums just does not need technological advancements .
Winter and feral dogs have that shit pretty much covered .
So if you 're the kind of guy that sinks enough money and time into manufacturing a robot that fucks with hobos , smart odds are that you probably find fucking with hobos enjoyable .

We note that Terrill also mounted a camera on the robot , and streams video of its bum - fighting antics to the high definition television back in his bar .
This is ostensibly to monitor its actions for safety reasons , but you can't help but to wonder if it's also so his patrons can laugh at the dramatically uneven bout between an armed robot and a drunken hobo .
Comments by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger
America runs its finances like a crack addict
Do n't dare explain the national debt to anyone
You can't defy the laws of gravity ... nor economics
Being right does not make you popular

As we wind our way towards an election between the professional liars that have been put forward as candidates for U.S. President , it seems to be a great time to remind us all about the issue being routinely ignored by virtually everyone ( except Ron Paul , of course , who was never really embraced by the " please lie to me " mainstream public ) .
To what issue am I referring ?
The national debt , of course .
As you can see in this bumper sticker , the way to annoy a liberal is to " get a job , " as the pop culture bumper sticker says .
To annoy a conservative , all you have to do is " defend the Constitution . "
But how do you annoy everybody ?
That 's simple : Americans do n't want to hear about the national debt .
It 's like a family living paycheck to paycheck , maxed out on their credit cards , trying to pretend the collection notices are all being lost in the mail .
They do n't want to admit they have no ability to actually pay off the debt they 've incurred by pursuing a flamboyoant lifestyle , blowing wads of cash on high - priced wines , luxury vehicles , and an occassional line of coke -- they desperately want to imagine they can keep living on money that appears from nowhere , regardless of how much they owe to everybody else and the fact that their incomes do n't even come close to matching their expenditures .
Too bad every household in America does n't have its own Federal Reserve , huh ?
If it did , we could all just print money to pay off our debt , save our skins , and ignore the fundamentals of economics .
But even in Washington today ( and New York ) , the Federal Reserve is too busy bailing out greedy , criminally - operated banks to turn much attention to the much larger issue of the United States ' national debt .
Apparently , saving the banks is more important than anything else , and the Fed is now committed toin order to prevent a few rich bankers from facing the consequences of their outrageous sub - prime lending sprees .
But let 's get back to the national debt for a moment .
The only reason it 's been able to operate for this long is because other nations and foreign central banks have been foolish enough to keep lending the U.S. government more money .
It 's like giving cash to a crack addict and hoping he will somehow seek out a drug rehab center on his own .
This is the person who never gets a job , never makes an honest living , but yet somehow manages to hit up everybody else for cash .
You know how it works : " I need to buy a car to get a job , " they say .
And then when you pony up the cash for their car , they get drunk and wreck the car , and they never try very hard to get a job in the first place .
They keep spending and spending , tossing money down the drain on blows of crack , meth , heroin or booze .
They promise to go into rehab someday , if you 'll only help them through " the next month " with a little more cash .
This is the life of a drug addict .
( Do you know one ?
Everybody does , it seems ... ) America is that drug addict .
It borrows cash from the central banks around the world , blowing it all on Medicare prescription benefits signed into law by Bush ( money for drugs , see ? ) .
It spends trillions on military campaigns that accomplish nothing positive , yet enrage the global community and recruit lifelong enemies of this nation .
Notice how the price of oil has more than tripled since the war with Iraq started ?
It 's so bad now that truck drivers are going on strike over the price of diesel .
America spends money not merely like a drunken sailor , but like a crack - addicted sailor with a wheelbarrel piled high with one - hundred dollar bills , locked in a room full of Gov.
Spitzer 's favorite hookers and a suitcase spilling over with blow .
But try to explain the simple workings of finance , debt and economics to the uninformed , and you 'll be accused of being a doomsayer , a pessimist , or -- the worst insult in today 's fear - based society -- unpatriotic !
How dare you point out the economic truths that will soon bring this country 's federal government to its knees !
Such blatant truths shall not be tolerated ... especially not in a country whose entire financial system is based on a cascade of fictional financial instruments propped up by nothing more than wishful thinking and Enron - style accounting fraud .
Let me translate all this for you in serious terms :
The United States is already broke .
The Federal Reserve is destroying the currency .
The U.S. dollar will soon be virtually worthless .
There is no saving the dollar , and there 's no saving the savings of any U.S. citizen foolish enough to be holding dollars when the music stops .
The Federal Reserve has already decided to do anything in its power to save the rich bankers ; even if it means destroying the value of all the dollars held by hard - working Americans .
The day will come , folks , when your savings accounts will all be " recalibrated " and you 'll be given ten cents on the dollar while the Fed slinks away with 90 % of your savings , using it to bail out overpaid bank owners .
And the federal government ?
Under a long string of presidential crooks -- Democratic and Republican alike -- it has decided to pursue a dangerous experiment called , " What happens if we never pay our debtors while running up more debt ? "
That experiment , not surprisingly , will end in the financial demise of this nation .
( But there 's good news : A new , better system may emerge from the dust of the greenback ... keep reading ... )
These are n't careless predictions , by the way .
These are simple observations the follow the fundamentals .
Why are the nations of the world fleeing the U.S. Treasury debt auctions ?
Why are dollars increasingly worthless everywhere except in the United States itself ?
The answer is because , even while the government is snorting yet more crack and spending unprecedented levels of increasingly - worthless dollars on drugs and war ( or , as they call it , " medication and defense " ) .
Hence the bumper sticker : Annoy everyone .
Explain the national debt .
People do n't want to hear this .
They 'd rather imagine none of these problems exist ; that debt does n't matter ; that unlimited dollars can be created out of nothing with zero impact on peoples ' savings ; that the U.S. government is wise enough to avert financial disaster .
These are the hopes of the deluded .
These are precisely the ramblings of Enron 's accountants before the crash , or dot - com stock pushers before that crash .
They 're the slobbering blatherings of all the people who said housing prices will never fall , and therefore everyone will get rich off the never - ending housing price booms !
I 've spend many years pointing out the idiocies of the deluded .
I publicly predicted the dot - com crash and began warning people to get out of the market in 1998 - 2001 .
( This is a matter of public record , not some wishful hindsight . )
I also publicly predicted the collapse of the housing market right here on this website , beginning nearly two years ago .
And now , those predictions that once seemed " radical " are the Wall Street Journal 's front page news .
What am I predicting now ?
Like I said , it 's not a prediction , it 's just an observation .
It 's like observing gravity .
If you toss something into the air , you can be confident it 's going to come falling back to the ground .
You do n't have to " predict " gravity ; it 's a law of the universe .
It works by itself , like clockwork , regardless of what you want it do to ( I 'm ignoring near - light speed travel , relativity , quantum physics , and all that fun stuff for the purposes of this metaphor , by the way , for those readers who are physicists ) .
Likewise , when you see a nation throw its dollars into the air , spending its way to oblivion , ignoring its debt and ramping up its spending to even higher levels , it does n't take much of a prediction to know that it's all going to fall back to the ground in a grand economic collapse .
So I 'm not even calling the coming collapse of the U.S. government a " prediction . "
It 's just common sense .
It 's as obvious as gravity .
If you do n't believe me , do the math .
There is no mathematical solution to the current financial crisis facing not merely the banks and the currency , but the federal government itself .
The only unknown factor is WHEN things will happen .
Can the Fed help the economy limp along in a state of near - collapse for another year ?
Perhaps .
Five years ?
Maybe .
Ten years ?
I doubt it .
Now for the good news :
The good news is that the U.S. federal government will eventually go bankrupt .
Yes , that 's the good news !
Because after the financial chaos passes ( which will not be fun , believe me ) , we have a chance to create a new society , a new currency and a new , honest system of government that actually represents the People for a change .
The current cabal of corruption and criminal behavior that sits in Washington and pretends to protect the interests of the voters is about to find itself on the receiving end of an angry mob .
The 200 + year experiment calledis in its final chapter .
But out of its failure , we can learn important lessons .
We can learn things that will help us create a better future society .
Lessons like :• Never let a private company ( the Federal Reserve ) control the money supply . •
Never let " representative " legislators vote in your place .
Insist on a DIRECT Democracy in the next society .
( We do n't need Senators and Congresspeople , folks .
The whole concept is long since outdated , and most Senators and Congresspeople are crooks . ) •
Never let a government abandon the gold standard for its currency .
If you do , that government will inevitably hyperinflate the currency and leave the people broke . •
Never let corporations run the government .
If you do , your government will become a branch of the corporations , and the regulators ( like the FDA , USDA , etc. ) will become agents of corporate - sponsored terrorism that abandon all ethics and destroy the health and safety of the People . •
Never allow the centralization of power in one branch of government .
For example , do not allow the creation of Executive Orders we 've seen signed by the President . •
Never allow one man ( the President ) to commit acts of war .
Did n't we learn this after Vietnam ? •
Never allow people from industry to take jobs in the government where they become biased , pro-corporate pushers of everything from pharmaceuticals to beef . •
Never allow politicians to censor scientists .•
Never allow the population to be dumbed - down through sub - standard public schools that only raise a generation of obedient workers , not skeptical thinkers . •
Never allow the media to control the population through advertiser - supported propaganda and violent programming . •
Never allow politicians to destroy citizens ' rights .
When they attempt to do so , march on your capitol ( in a non-violent way , of course ) .
Arrest the politicians .
Prosecute them for crimes against the People . •
Never allow corporate lobbyists to have access to lawmakers .
If you do , you 'll end up with a corrupt government that only protects corporations , not the People . •
Never allow your government to operate in secret , with secret prisons , secret wiretapping laws and secret war " evidence " that is never made public .
Secrecy breeds corruption .
Honest societies do not need to conduct their judicial processes in secret . •
Never allow corporations to play
God with the food supply by genetically modifying the crops . •
Never allow corporations to be granted intellectual property ownership over seeds , genes , animals and medicines .
If you do , you will one day wake up impoverished , " homeless on the continent your fathers conquered , " to quote Jefferson . •
Never allow banks to operate on a fractional reserve system of loans and money creation that 's just begging for a series of cascading failures ....
I could go on , but you get the point .
We have learned some very tough lessons over the last 200 + years , and once this present government collapses , it is crucial that we apply those lessons in creating a new system that abandons tyranny and embraces genuine freedom .
We will have this opportunity soon .
Many Americans will lose their life savings on the journey towards this new opportunity , but if we maintain our collective vision of a brighter future society , I believe we can create something much better out of the ashes of this failed experiment called the United States of America .
Please note :
In no way do I support violence of any kind in creating a new society in the aftermath of this current one .
I only support collaboration , openness , freedom and great respect for all living creatures as well as our sacred planet Earth .
I believe the passing of this failed government is a blessing , not a curse , and I believe the collapse of the U.S. dollar will ultimately help awaken many to the tough but rewarding decisions that will face us all in the very near future .
We must consciously decide to take back our freedoms , our rights and our futures from a system of corporate and government control that has destroyed our planet , exploited our people , and stolen our savings .
But if can make the rights decisions based on creating a more promising future for our children , then the rewards will be unimaginable .
We the People hold the power to create a new society based on the freedoms and promises once held sacred in this land .
Be ready to play your role , a constructive role , in the aftermath of this current society .
And do not be surprised when gravity kicks in and this entire fictional government charade comes crashing down along with the fractional reserve banking system , the criminal Federal Reserve , the war - mongering politicians and the endless , endless debt .
There is no way out now other than collapse and rebirth .
I can't say when it will come , or exactly how it will play out .
I only urge us all to remain positive , informed and constructive .
The coming chaos will be painful in the short term , but out of the ashes of a failed society , we can work together to rebuilt a new one based on real freedom , honest money , sensible medicine and limited government .

Consumers are reaching deeper into their pockets to pay for groceries and gas .
Last year , as many as half of all those who took out home equity loans used the money to help pay down their credit card debt , according to J. D. Power research .
But home equity is no longer an easy source of financing .
Month after month , cardholders keep falling behind on their bills .
“ This downturn is the perfect storm where the consumer is getting squeezed from all levels , ” said Michael Taiano , a credit card industry analyst at Sandler O’Neill .
He projects that credit card loss rates for lenders , now around 5.7 percent , could go as high as 10 percent in next 18 months .
That would be higher than the peak levels reached after the 2001 technology bust .
Since borrowers typically run up their balances before they stop paying , issuers have started cutting lines of credit .
Often , lenders will lower customers ’ credit limits as they pay down their debt  a technique known in the industry as “ chasing the balance . ”
This way , they are on the hook for less money if borrowers default .
“ They are trying to cut their risk exposure , ” said Bill Ryan , an analyst at Portales Partners .
“ The consumer that used to use his house as an A.T.M. is now starting to use their credit card as an A.T.M . ”
American Express is reducing credit lines for customers holding subprime mortgages and small - business customers in industries tied to the real estate market .
And Chase Card Services , the consumer arm of JPMorgan , is taking similar action on distressed borrowers , especially in places like California , Arizona and Florida , where home prices have declined sharply .
Washington Mutual , HSBC , Target and Wells Fargo all acknowledged they were pulling in lines of credit as part of broader strategy of reducing risk .
None of those lenders , as a matter of policy , would comment on individual customer accounts .
Cardholders in places like Orange County in California , Atlanta and Phoenix have noticed their credit lines shriveling up .
Welcome to the Essex Institute of Clinical Hypnosis
When you are looking for advanced hypnotherapy / hypnosis training in the UK , you can do no better than enrol with the Essex Institute of Clinical Hypnosis .
As from January 2017 , we will offer online training only on a variety of advanced and practical courses for those who have already completed a basic hypnotherapy training course .
A Genuine Institute
Although it is not generally well - known , the term ' Institute ' can only be legally used if permission has been gained from the UK Government .
Because we were able to show that we are eminent in the field of training and that we are involved in leading research , we were able to obtain the approval of the UK Secretary of State to term ourselves an ' Institute ' .
Our advanced online courses are considered as suitable for Continual Professional Development by most major associations including :
The Essex Institute was created in 1999 , first of all as the Essex College of Clinical Hypnosis , originally teaching just the one course , the Professional Practitioner Hypnothnerapy course .
Advanced courses were soon added , the first being the much - acclaimed Warriors , Settlers & Nomads , the dynamic and modern version of Parts work that can resolve all sorts of personal issues such as low self - worth in barely any time at all .
Since then , a major body of work has been created by Terence Watts , much of it unique and sufficiently scientificaly sound that we were able to earn the title ' Institute ' .

BEIJING : Beijing came out with a fresh assessment of the Tibet situation on Monday , one in which it accused the Tibetan Young Congress ( TYC ) of links with the al - Qaida and terrorist organisations involved in the East Turkmenistan movement in west China 's Xinjiang province .
The analysis , released by the official Xinhua news agency , said that Dalai Lama 's government - in - exile in India consists of several TYC leaders and cadre .
" The TYC has become a terrorist organization as concepts of violence have taken root within it , " Xinhua quoted official Tibetologist Liu Hongji as saying in an interview .
" The group 's shadow was evident when the police confiscated a large number of guns and ammunition in some monasteries in China 's Tibetan - inhabited regions after the March 14 riot , " Liu said .
The charges about TYC 's terrorist 's activities and its links with the Tibetan government - in - exile may become a strong argument among Communist Party leaders , who are opposed to any reconciliation with the Dalai Lama .
Chinese officials have demanded an assurance from Dalai Lama 's representatives that there will be no attempts by monks and their supporters to disrupt the Olympic torch relay as well as law and order in Tibet in the coming weeks , sources said .
The talks got deadlocked on Sunday as both sides refused to budge from their known stand over the March 14 riots in Lhasa .
The Chinese side rejected accusations about bad handling of the riots , saying that the Lhasa authorities had responded to violence in the most appropriate manner .
Chinese officials maintained that Dalai Lama 's supporters were responsible for instigating the riots and they must now ensure that there is no more disruption of law and order in Tibet , sources said .
This plea was rejected by the envoys from Dharamsala , who denied having a hand in the Lhasa riots .
Chinese president Hu Jintao on Sunday tried to give a push to the process of negotiations with Dalai Lama 's envoys , saying he expected it would yield " positive results " .
The main purpose behind China 's efforts to hold talks with the Dalai Lama 's envoys is to ensure the success of the Olympic torch relay as it passes through Tibet to reach Mount Everest and to make sure that western leaders , including US president George Bush , attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Games .
But there are sections in the ruling Communist Party , which are staunchly opposed to any talks with the Dalai Lama .
Despite Chinese officials agreeing to maintain dialogue with Dalai Lama , China 's state press on Monday accused the spiritual leader of " monstrous crimes " , keeping up its fiery rhetoric .
" Following the March 14 incident in Lhasa , the Dalai has not only refused to admit his monstrous crimes , but he has continued to perpetuate fraud , " an article in Monday 's state Tibet Daily said .
The article , which did not refer to the talks , described the Dalai Lama 's demands for " genuine autonomy " in Tibet and the " greater Tibetan region " as fraudulent .

During the June 6 edition of Fox News ' America 's Pulse , host E.D. Hill teased an upcoming discussion by saying , " A fist bump ?
A pound ?
A terrorist fist jab ?
The gesture everyone seems to interpret differently . "
In the ensuing discussion with Janine Driver -- whom Hill introduced as " a body language expert " --
Hill referred to the " Michelle and Barack Obama fist bump or fist pound , " adding that " people call it all sorts of things . "
Hill went on to ask Driver : " Let 's start with the Barack and Michelle Obama , because that 's what most people are writing about -- the fist thump .
Is that sort of a signal that young people get ? "
At no point during the discussion did Hill explain her earlier reference to " a terrorist fist jab . "

BAGHDAD 
Two insurgent bomb blasts struck Thursday at pro-American Iraqi targets in Anbar Province just west of Baghdad and in the northern city of Mosul .
The police said more than 30 Iraqis were killed and 80 wounded .
An American military spokesman and Iraqi police officials said that three American marines were killed in the Anbar attack and that two interpreters were also among the dead .
The American military command was preparing to hand control of the province , once considered the hotbed of the insurgency , to Iraqi forces .
The bombings extended a pattern of multiple - casualty attacks in recent days that are clearly intended to kill local Iraqi leaders , in particular those who are believed to have collaborated with American forces against insurgents .
Thursday ’s attacks were among a string of deadly episodes in the past week that broke the previous several weeks ’ lull in violence .
Most of the episodes have occurred in Sunni or mixed Sunni - Shiite areas where there has been mounting frustration over the lack of a political deal giving power to all of Iraq ’s factions .
Some were in small neighborhoods like Abu Dshir on the southern edge of Baghdad , and Madaen , which lies just to its southeast .
There was also an attack on Tuesday on the Sadr City neighborhood council which killed six Iraqis , four Americans and an Iraqi - Italian interpreter .
Or ;
What it is like to be a TCK .
... Not any religion
or cultural system .
I am not from the East
or the West , not out of the ocean or up
from the ground , not natural or ethereal , not
composed of elements at all .
I do not exist ,
am not an entity in this world or in the next ,
did not descend from Adam and Eve or any
origin story .
My place is placeless , a trace
of the traceless .
Neither body or soul .
- Jalaluddin Rumi
After finishing a writeup on Singaporean society , many people asked many questions about my background – where I was born , where I have lived and how I have been affected by my experiences in Singapore .
This node is to answer those questions , and shed some light on an entire group of people who have grown up with similar experiences as my own .
I am part of a group referred to as ' Third Culture Kids , ' those who have been exposed to many different societies during their developing years .
Whilst I have already written a fairly objective , factual account on what a TCK is , I am going to try and tell you what being a TCK is like .
It also contains more commentary on Singaporean society , commentary pertaining to what it is like to be white in Singapore .
Where do you come from ?
People often ask me where I am from , unsurprising when you consider I am white in an Asian country .
It is a difficult question for any TCK to answer , I was born in Singapore , and I have lived within this country 's borders for all of my life , yet my association with this country extends only as far as it being a place I happen to be residing in .
It is a difficult question to pose to any TCK , most of us do not associate ourselves with any particular country .
My parents moved here before I was born ; my mother originally from England , my father from Australia .
Generally people feel some sense of belonging to the country that they were born in .
We cannot , most TCKs have lived in many different countries – moving as their parents ' company decides that they would be more useful elsewhere .
When your race differs from the race of the majority of people in a country , you cannot really identify with them .
As much as the Singapore government would like to believe that Singaporean society is based on racial equality , that is not the case .
I am what the government likes to refer to as ' foreign talent , ' and I am treated as a foreigner wherever I go .
Singapore is not like Bali , or Cambodia or many countries where a few white people exist – white people will not be swamped by a torrent of locals trying to sell them trinkets every time they go out in public .
In Singapore the white people are the business - people , Singaporean society seems to be based on foreign talent .
Whether it be the Bangladeshis who do the cleaning and building , or the white people who run all the big businesses , Singapore is based upon having expatriates being the higher or lower end of the workforce .
What does that mean ?
It means that when I was younger , everyone associated my race with my parents being rich and successful – despite the fact that this is not the case .
Everyone just assumed I was another corporate brat , following his parents around the world .
As I grew older and I no longer appeared to be a child , I was assumed to be a young , successful businessman .
That is the way things work in Singapore , I can not be a part of this society regardless of how hard I might want to be .
So where do you identify with ?
My place is placeless , I identify with nowhere and everywhere at the same time .
Singapore in itself is a place which has merged a hundred different cultures into one , creating one great big bland non-culture .
Singapore is the perfect example of why globalization is bad .
The only thing I can compare it to is making a cookie – instead of mixing the dough with the chocolate chunks and marshmallows and nuts and whatever else with a spoon , you throw it in a blender .
It does n't come out as delicious chunks held together by the dough , it is one big creamy mass .
And it probably does n't look good , probably resembling poo in color and texture .
I cannot identify with this country , and generally people expect me to identify with the country where my parents were from - Australia or England .
This assumption is often made about all TCKs , but we do n't .
How can we ?
We may have lived there a brief while , but certainly not long enough to fit into the society as a whole .
We are different ; respecting all cultures , understand that any kind of discrimination is bad , knowing that not everyone can be expected to agree with all of our views .
We are willing to try anything once , and for the most part we cannot stand having to be constrained to any single place or culture .
We were born outside of any culture , and there we will stay .
The stereotypical TCK has been moving all of his life , and is all the better for it - like a well - blended cookie !
We are tolerant and understanding of any culture or race , and for the most part we want the world to have such differences between nations .
Most TCKs will continue moving all of their life - even if they did n't like it as a child , they will choose it as an adult .
I cannot live in Australia nor England , I find both societies as a whole to be very narrow - minded .
However , I think this of all societies – even Singapore .
The only thing I can identify with is other TCKs , because we all share these same feelings and cannot be repatriated .
You cannot take a person of a multi-cultural background and expect that they will be able to turn into a mono- cultural person , especially if these experiences were during their developing years .
Would you choose this life , for yourself or your children ?
This is probably the best question that has ever been posed to me when people learnt what I was like for having such a varied background .
It is probably one of the trickiest to answer .
Unlike many of the questions I am not sure whether my answer would be the same as other TCKs .
The answer is similar to the one that I would give if someone asked me whether I would have chosen this life if I had the choice - I will try and expand .
I do not want my children to grow up immersed in only a single culture - despite how much one travels to different countries the tourist experience is not the same one that you would get from living there .
Tourists only catch a glimpse , they see the culture only on the most superficial level .
Having such a multi-cultural background has made me a better person ; more tolerant , more open - minded .
We are friendly people , skilled in making friendships after having a lot of practice .
However , there are many benefits to stability in childhood – deep friendships are forged and I suppose I myself long for some sense of belonging .
Knowing where you want to spend your life is something that a lot of people take for granted - most never really consider living in a place other than where you have stayed for the majority of your life .
Even if you did move , you would associate the country you have citizenship – you may have issues with it , but for the most part you are somewhat proud of your country .
It is hard to say what I would do , as I was growing up I lost a great many of my friends .
Some people may consider it a terrible thing to have to leave all your friends behind , but the TCKs have to do it several times in their life .
In Singapore I spent most of my childhood attending a school where the average stay for a single student was usually around 2 - 3 years .
During the course of my schooling I lost my closest friends around 6 times – I may have been here all along , but they all had to leave .
Having to lose your friends so quickly and often is not good for a person , especially when you know that you are going to lose the ones you have .
We find it hard to trust people , and find it difficult to hold on to those who we may want to .
When a close friend of yours leaves the country , or you leave behind your friends , you would imagine that the friendship would live on despite the fact that you are in different countries .
So many times I have seen people lose their closest friends and seem so indifferent – your closest friend may not be so close after all .
One way or another , four months down the track and we will not even think of them anymore .
How have your experiences affected you as a person ?
Aside from not being able to identify with any place which many people feel that I should identify with , my experiences as a TCK have impacted on me in a variety of ways .
As always , it is hard to analyze oneself in an objective manner - especially when the outcome of this analysis may not be particularly complimentary .
I will try to explain what type of person I am now and how this is a result of my experiences .
I feel lost and confused .
This is a time when I have to start making decisions regarding my future and I feel I simply cannot .
I have delayed going to university because I could not choose a course I wanted to do - there is nothing that interests me , yet so many things interest me at the same time .
As a Singapore Permanent Resident I am required to serve National Service for 2 years upon turning 18 - it was a tough decision for me to make to abandon the place which I could sort - of call home , but I do not identify with this place enough to want to be trained to fight for it for 2 years .
I have been described as friendly and charismatic ; something that I , like so many like me , have learnt through necessity .
It is a trade - off in a sense ; do you have more loss in your life or do you make a more friendly person ?
I hate the way that people in similar situations as mine can abandon their closest friends , it seems so despicable to just abandon them .
Yet even having said that , I fear that I myself am guilty of it .
I do not like it , but as much as I may want to remember them and keep in contact with them , one side will always end up forgetting - they themselves are TCKs after all .
I find it hard to maintain the same group of friends - even when stability exists I seem to want to be rid of it .
I find myself hating the friends who have been around for more than two or three years , for no apparent reason .
It is as if losing my friends so often has made me expect to lose them so much that either they go or I push them away .
As hard as it may be to lose your friends once , by the fourth or fifth time you just become numb to it .
You can recognize a TCK because they , like me , will probably have a kind - of nonaccent .
My accent has been described as American , British , Australian , German , Scottish , Irish , Italian , and French - although usually only one or two at a time .
We all tend to be very clear in the way that we speak , and as has been mentioned we are good at languages .
I myself do not speak any language other than this one , but I am a lot better than most at it .
My attempts to learn Chinese while at school were crippled by the fact that every two years it was an entirely different class - we started from the beginning of the course a lot .
At the end of the day ; I may be able to use chopsticks as easily as a knife and fork , but to have to lose my friends so often and not really care seems too terrible a thing .

Virtualización con Xen 3.0.3 en Debian
Etch con kernel a medida para 32 y 64 bits
Los ordenadores actuales tienen las suficientes prestaciones como para usar la virtualización con el fin de crear la representación de muchas máquinas virtuales menos capaces , cada una ejecutando una instancia independiente de un sistema operativo .
El adecuado particionamiento de una máquina para que soporte la ejecución concurrente de múltiples sistemas operativos supone bastantes retos .
Primero , las máquinas virtuales deben estar aisladas las unas de las otras : no es aceptable que la ejecución de una afecte adversamente el rendimiento de otra .
Esto es particularmente cierto cuando las diferentes máquinas virtuales pertenecen a diferentes usuarios .
Segundo , es preciso dar soporte al máximo número de sistemas operativos existentes a fin de dar salida a la heterogeneidad de las aplicaciones más comunes .
Tercero , la sobrecarga introducida por la virtualización debe ser pequeña .
En este artículo se explica cómo instalar , configurar y utilizar Xen Hypervisor en Debian GNU / Linux .

The Italian schoolchildren 's drawings which illustrate a chilling hatred for Roma gypsies
The colours are bold and the lines simple , a typical drawing by a nine - year - old .
But the sentiments it reveals are shocking , a glimpse of the xenophobia creeping across Italy .
The picture is one of a number drawn by youngsters at a school outside Naples depicting firebomb attacks on a nearby Roma gipsy camp .
Other children at the school exposed their hatred of the immigrants in written work .
Elementary pupils ' drawings show that many children approved of the Roma gypsy camp attack
The camp was firebombed ten days ago and there have been further attacks on the now - abandoned tents and shacks .
The locals acted after a woman claimed she had caught a Roma girl trying to snatch her six - month - old baby .
The allegation reveals the distrust and fear many Italians feel towards the Roma immigrants .
The pictures by youngsters at the Istituto San Giovanni Bosco , in Ponticelli on the outskirts of Naples , show the camp ablaze with bystanders saying : ' Go away Roma ' and shouting : ' Fight , fight . '
Several other children had written essays in which they said : ' Burning the houses of the Roma is justified . '
Another child wrote : ' They steal babies and use them for begging or sell their organs for transplants . '
Regret :
One child 's drawing of the burning gypsy camp is headlined ' We were wrong '
Yet another picture , signed by a boy named Giuseppe , said : ' The people did well to burn the camps at Ponticelli .
They did n't go when asked nicely , so we had to use strong methods . '
Written at the bottom of a picture by a boy called Ugo were the words : ' We are not racist , but they have got out of control so we had to burn the camps . '
Thousands of gipsies have arrived recently from Romania and other former Eastern Bloc countries .
In national elections last month , the Centre - Right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi , which included the anti-immigration Northern League and the neo- fascist Alleanza Nazionale , swept to victory largely on a pledge to tackle illegal immigration .
But critics say the government is stoking the suspicion , and last night the Vatican weighed in with an appeal for calm .
Naples Cardinal Crescenzio
Sepe said : ' I am shocked by the drawings of these youngsters , some of whom are only nine .
Up in smoke : Firefighters watch as makeshift housing burns at a Roma camp in the Ponticelli suburb of Naples on May 14
' It shows that these young minds have been affected by an extremist ideology .
To think these children believe it is right to burn camps . '
During the attacks on the Ponticelli camp , children could be seen with the adults who hurled petrol bombs and shouted abuse .
Mariano Coppola , deputy principal at the school , said : ' It does n't matter how many of the children wrote these things or drew the pictures - and not all of them did - but even just one is bad enough . '
Yesterday Italian interior minister Roberto Maroni said Italy would get tough on the Roma and the issue of unauthorised camps would be resolved ' by the end of the year ' .
He added that police and city officials would be given new powers to deal with the camps .
According to the UN Refugee Agency , there are an estimated 170,000 gipsies living in Italy .
Devastation : A gutted gypsy camp in the Ponticelli neighborhood of Naples is now deserted
The tough measures have led to claims from charities and the EU that Italy is following a ' racist agenda ' .
A survey published by Italian newspaper La Repubblica said 75 per cent of Italians thought the Roma were ' a problem ' .
France is to spearhead a ' zero tolerance ' onslaught against illegal immigrants which it hopes will be supported by all EU nations .
Paris takes over the leadership of the EU in July and it is then that the measures will be unveiled .
They include proposals to return unlawful migrants to their country of origin ' almost immediately ' , according to government sources .
' As far as these people are concerned , then the policy should be zero tolerance , ' the source added .
The document also calls for the increased use of biometric visas to make passport fraud far more difficult and for asylum - seekers to apply for refugee status in advance .
It also asks member states to ensure that migrants allowed to stay adopt ' national and European values ' , including equal opportunities .
Spy Blog has a history of asking Questions about the treatment of various assorted people , whose views or actions we do not support , e.g. accused terrorist suspects or their families , computer hackers , etc. , but who seem to have got caught up in the complexities of our Kafkaesque bureaucratic Police and Judicial system .
We are usually worried about the precedent such cases set for the treatment of all the rest of us .
Hence our worries about the arrest of Tony Gosling , who may well be a Conspiracy Theorist , but it seems to us , one of the saner and more reasonable ones .
His long running , but not altogether successful , attempts to gather information on the secretive Bilderberg meetings of the rich and powerful , are to be commended , regardless of any of the more far fetched theories about what they may be up to in secret .
His involvement with .various conspiracy theorist populated discussion forums involving 9/11 " truthers " and " no planers " etc. and even UK " 7/7 truthers " , also appears to be relatively moderate and rational .
He is , after all , a NUJ journalist , and a pacifist peace campaigner .
According to this 911 conspiracy bulletin board discussion thread , and the same information mirrored elsewhere :
Tuesday 24th June approx .
1400 Tony Gosling and fiancee were stopped in their vehicle on the M32 motorway in Bristol by ten police officers under the authority of the Northumbria Police Major Incident Unit .
Why stop them on the motorway , an action which put all the lives of the people involved ( including the policemen ) at unnecessary risk ?
Gosling and fiancee were held at Trinity Road police station in Bristol until 1200 the next day , 25th June .
Both were heavily questioned .
They were each arrested three times , a total of six arrests .
The arrests in order were , Obstructing a Recovery Order , Theft of a Credit Card and then again for Obstructing a Recovery Order .
He was released without charge , the next day .
Was he fingerprinted , photographed and DNA sampled etc ?
What it really seems to be about is tracking down a woman called Natalie Bracht , who perhaps has mental problems , and who has gone on the run with her 5 children .
Tony Gosling had recorded a phone interview with her .
He states that he does not necessarily believe her story , but that it was of journalistic / conspiracy theory interest .
Seemingly he cooperated with the Police , and handed over the keys to his home , ( the threat seems to be - " otherwise we will kick your door down " ) and , despite the missing person and her family of 5 children obviously not being present at those premises ,
After the raid Northumbria police still have :- both my mobile phones my desktop and laptop computer full printed list of my phone contacts both my dairies etc .
None of which could have been of any use in finding Natalie since I was careful not to phone her , write down where she was or type anything about her location on the computers , nor do I now know where she is .

Lala Kent Not Sure About Future On ‘ Vanderpump Rules , ’ Says It Needs To Be The ‘ Right Situation ’
Today , the House passed the controversial PRO IP Act ( H.R. 4279 ) 410 to 11 , with 12 representatives not voting .
While Public Knowledge and other groups successfully persuaded the House to remove the most damaging provision in the bill ( seemingly written solely to increase damages in the RIAA 's file - sharing lawsuit campaign ) , the bill would nonetheless significantly expand federal enforcement of copyright law .
The most outrageous provisions would create new and unnecessary federal bureaucracies devoted to intellectual property enforcement .
None seems more ridiculous than language creating a Cabinet - level " IP enforcement czar " that would report to the President and coordinate enforcement efforts across government , a proposal that has been loudly opposed by the Department of Justice .
Why is Congress spending our tax dollars on a new layer of officialdom that the cops themselves do n't want or need ?
Moreover , the bill also includes provisions — such as expanded forfeiture penalties and language " clarifying " that copyright registration is not required for criminal enforcement of the copyright -- that could be read to open the door to increased prosecution against individuals or innovators as well as large - scale commercial pirates .
The Senate has yet to introduce a companion bill , although some IP enforcement proposals in the Senate may serve as a basis for a bill .
Stay tuned for more information should a bill turn up .
But there is a bright spot on the horizon -- Congress is finally revisiting important " orphan works " legislation that could expand the ability of technology users , archivists and libraries to store and exhibit works whose owners can't be found .
In a new blow to the Bush administration ’s troubled military commission system , a military judge has disqualified a Pentagon general who has been centrally involved in overseeing Guantánamo war crimes tribunals from any role in the first case headed for trial .
The judge said the general was too closely aligned with the prosecution , raising questions about whether he could carry out his role with the required neutrality and objectivity .
Military defense lawyers said that although the ruling was limited to one case , they expected the issue to be raised in other cases , potentially delaying prosecutions , including the death - penalty prosecution of six detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , for the Sept. 11 attacks .
Critics of the military commission system said Friday that the judge ’s decision would provide new grounds to attack the system that they say was set up to win convictions .
New and innovative products from ordinary objects are being conceived and produced all the time , but what about new ideas for already - familiar materials ?
What would it take to get you to see a well - known building material in a new light ?
Some designers are doing just that now with forward - thinking furniture and architectural features made of one of the most versatile yet familiar materials in the world : paper .
Most people think of paper as an incredibly weak and fragile material , these furniture designers , architects and artists have taken paper and cardboard to new levels by creating amazing structures from these simplest of materials .
Renowned Japanese architect Shigeru Ban can be called a leader in the paper architecture movement .
His paper and cardboard structures are known and loved around the world .
Far from being flimsy or gimmicky , his structures provide real solutions in terms of cost , eco-friendliness , and portability .
Ban ’s buildings can be erected by amateurs with no heavy machinery , sometimes in a matter of just hours .
His incredible ideas were put to use after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe , Japan to provide temporary homes and churches to displaced residents .
Not ready for an entire building made of paper ?
How about just an office ?
Robert Buss and Ute Conen of Push Design proudly introduced the world to the “ disposable office , ” a tiny office setup made entirely of recyclable paper products .
The office setup was on display in the Max Planck Institute in 2004 and now enjoys a life of internet notoriety .
After your paper office furniture has been installed , you can build on the paper office theme with paper softwall room dividers .
Unlike traditional cubicle walls , paper softwalls are easy to take down and move whenever the need arises .
If you need the office to be big and open for a client ’s visit or if you need to clean your apartment , just fold up the lightweight partition and move it out of the way .
Paper structures are not only used for their aesthetic appeal or ease of movement ; they have also been utilized for short - term emergency situations .
Like Shigeru
Ban ’s post - earthquake shelters , these structures in Rwanda ( also designed by Shigeru Ban ) were erected to address a housing shortage .
In 1994 , civil war in Rwanda displaced millions of citizens .
The United Nations supplied refugees with emergency shelters consisting of plastic sheets and paper tube supports .
Sometimes , paper structures can even be used to send a message .
UK artist Sumer Erek was disgusted at the amount of wasted paper he saw on the streets of London , so he decided to make an art piece to illustrate just how wasteful we are .
The result was a collaborative project which many people took part in and which culminated in the unveiling of The Newspaper House , made entirely of discarded newspapers .
If you ’re interested in experimenting with paper structures on your own , you do n’t have to be an artist or an architect .
In fact , all you need is some shipping boxes and tape .
One enterprising young man furnished his entire apartment with furniture made out of FedEx shipping boxes and tape .
Fire hazard or not , you ca n’t get much more affordable than furniture constructed from cardboard boxes .
On a much smaller scale , origamic architecture is the amazing art of creating pseudo - buildings from paper .
A Tokyo professor first developed this strange variation on traditional ideas of origami .
Since his initial work with a simple blade - and - ruler a number of people have taken up the task and created their own versions of origamic architecture – from realistic building to abstract Escheresque shapes .
In the breathtaking opening of the movie “ Contact ” – adaptation of the even more inspiring original Carl Sagan novel – we travel from Earth , faster than the speed of light and listening to the reverse history of our electromagnetic transmissions through the Universe .
From the Spice Girls ( 1997 … ) to the first radio broadcasts , we get farther and father from our Pale Blue Dot , seeing even bigger spaces full of billions and billions of stars in the Cosmos .
The scene is literally poetic , namely it involves a big deal of poetic license , as we listen to transmissions from decades ago while still in the outer solar system – Pluto is not that far .
It even has a small joke , as the Face on Mars make a very brief appearance .
But the cold ( and perhaps surprising ) hard fact is that the scene is impossible .
No , not only because it ’s impossible to travel faster than light , but because our radio transmissions have a very limited range , and our first radio transmissions are not in some place tens of light - years away .
In fact the range of our transmissions is just … well , if you read the title you already know it .
Two light - years for almost all of our transmissions .
After that , even ginormous antennas turned exactly to our planet and listening to the right frequencies applying the necessary corrections would not be able to capture an intelligible signal .
Even a 3.000 km antenna would n’t be enough to capture our TV transmissions from a distance greater than only 0,01 light - years away !
More details on the Astronomy FAQ or this article by Neil deGrasse Tyson .
Omicronians hooked on Ally McBeal are therefore only fiction , but keep this as a cherished secret .
That our radio bubble is very small is a celestial gift , given all the trash we air and all the perils that may be out there .
And it only reinforces the motivation for SETI .
Because if our unintentional transmissions vanish in a couple of light - years , our deliberate and specially powerful transmissions do reach out for hundreds of light - years .
And even some of our powerful unintentional transmissions , like those from high - powered radars , also go very far .
Curiously , they would be detected by our neighbors somewhat like what we already detected on SETI , as anomalous , once in a lifetime signals .
WOW .

PRINCETON , NJ --
There is a significant political divide in beliefs about the origin of human beings , with 60 % of Republicans saying humans were created in their present form by God 10,000 years ago , a belief shared by only 40 % of independents and 38 % of Democrats .
Gallup has been asking this three - part question about the origin of humans since 1982 .
Perhaps surprisingly to some , the results for the broad sample of adult Americans show very little change over the years .
Between 43 % and 47 % of Americans have agreed during this 26 - year time period with the creationist view that God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so .
Between 35 % and 40 % have agreed with the alternative explanation that humans evolved , but with God guiding the process , while 9 % to 14 % have chosen a pure secularist evolution perspective that humans evolved with no guidance by God .
The significantly higher percentage of Republicans who select the creationist view reflects in part the strong relationship between religion and views on the origin of humans .
Republicans are significantly more likely to attend church weekly than are others , and Americans who attend church weekly are highly likely to select the creationist alternative for the origin of humans .
Implications
Although it is not a front - burner issue ( particularly in light of the economy and the price of gasoline ) the issue of teaching evolution in schools came up on the campaign trail last year , and could resurface in one way or the other between now and the November election .
Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain is facing the challenge of gaining the confidence and enthusiasm of conservative Republicans .
Turnout among this group could be an important factor in determining the final vote outcome in a number of key swing states .
As seen here , Republicans are in general sympathetic to the creationist explanation of the origin of humans , and if the issue of what is taught in schools relating to evolution and creationism surfaces as a campaign issue , McCain 's response could turn out to be quite important .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,017 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 8 - 11 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The Democrats ' Reagan
Question : Name the presidential candidate described below .
An unpopular incumbent president sits in the Oval Office .
His party 's brand is badly tarnished .
The economy is in shambles , unemployment on the rise .
The housing market is in crisis .
Gasoline has become a major issue .
America is enmeshed in a protracted crisis in the Middle East with no end in sight .
We are near war footing with Iran .
The reputation of the United States is diminished world wide .
In historically high numbers , voters believe the country is on the wrong track .
The opposition party has nominated a charismatic candidate for president whose oratorical skills are compared to JFK , perhaps better .
He had been introduced to the majority of Americans by way of a spellbinding keynote speech at a previous national party convention .
He has a fervent core of supporters and has emerged as the leader of his party through an insurgency that challenged and ultimately defeated his party 's establishment .
He runs against Washington and the special interests that control the Capitol .
His message is change and hope .
If ever the public demanded change in Washington , it is in this presidential year .
It could not be a better political environment for the party out of power .
Yet with all the stars aligned perfectly for a party change in the White House , national polls show the opposition candidate barely ties , and often trails , his opponent .
There is little doubt about the voter 's desire for change , but there is plenty of doubt about this candidate who pledges to deliver it .
Who is the candidate ?
Answer ; A ) Barack Obama B ) Ronald Reagan C ) Both
The correct answer is C .
Barack Obama 's current political circumstance is eerily similar to that of Ronald Reagan in his 1980 campaign for president .
Both Obama and Reagan , from the beginning of their insurgent campaigns , were viewed as transformative political figures .
Both enjoyed passionate grassroots support .
Both men had defeated centrist establishment candidates for their party 's nomination .
Reagan defeated George H.W. Bush , who was viewed by the growing conservative base of the Republican Party as too moderate .
Obama beat Hilary Clinton whose husband had been elected twice by moving away from his party 's traditional progressive roots and running as a centrist , a path Clinton herself followed ( at least at the beginning of her campaign ) .
In 1980 most conventional political observers failed to recognize the growing grassroots power of the rock solid conservative activists who propelled Reagan to his party 's nomination .
In the 2008 presidential campaign supporters of Hillary Clinton failed to recognize the growing assertiveness of the Democrats progressive base , especially over the Iraq war which she initially supported and Obama opposed .
The failures of the Bush Administration convinced many progressives that the conservative cycle , deep into its third decade , had run its course .
These activists believed the country was ready to tack back toward more progressive and transparent government .
Barack Obama recognized and embraced this growing progressive movement .
Obama 's message that it was time to " turn the page " on politics as usual ( a not very subtle reference to both the Bush and Clinton years ) resonated with progressives .
That message coupled with his message of post - partisan , anti-polarization politics , so attractive to independent voters , provided Obama with a core of progressive activists along with a solid base of black voters and young voters energized by his youth and oratorical gifts .
But insurgency campaigns by definition run counter to the established order .
Even in years when voters clamor for change , insurgent candidates must prove that neither they nor the change they offer is perceived as too far from the mainstream .
It is this potential fear that opponents of insurgent candidates seek to exploit .
For most of the general election in 1980 Democrats succeeded in raising doubts about Reagan 's brand of conservatism .
They charged that he was too far right , and questioned his past conservative associations with the John Birch Society which , like Reagan ; had been strong supporters of Barry Goldwater in 1964 .
Democrats argued that Reagan 's brand of virulent anti-Communism coupled with his lack of foreign - policy experience was a dangerous mixture for the man whose finger would be on the proverbial " button . "
For most of the 1980 general election the attacks on Reagan raised enough doubt about him to neutralize the public 's strong desire for change .
I was managing Carter 's campaign in Texas that fall , and even in that conservative bastion , Carter led Reagan in the polls until mid-October .
Our strategy was simple :
On a risk scale of 1 to 10 ( one being no risk , 10 being far too risky ) we had managed to keep Reagan in the 7 to 8 range .
Then came the only Carter / Reagan debate and the flood gates opened .
On stage with the President of the United States , Reagan did not come across as a threatening mad bomber .
He was collegial , surefooted , and calm .
His performance shattered expectations that he was a risk , which allowed Reagan , at the end of the debate , to pivot to the state of the economy with his devastating question , " Are you better off now than you were four years ago ? "
Reagan was elected in a landslide and proceeded to transform politics in America well beyond his two terms .
The Republicans are employing the same " risk " strategy against Barack Obama in 2008 .
McCain and company have used Obama 's willingness to meet with avowed enemies of the United States like Iran as a sign of naiveté and weakness .
Republican operatives and their radio talk show allies have sought to tie Obama to the anti-American rants of his former pastor Jeremiah Wright and his neighbor William Ayers , a former ' 60s radical .
Republicans have even dragged Obama 's wife Michelle into the fight .
They cite her Princeton senior thesis , selected campaign comments , and Obama 's failure to wear an American flag lapel pin as evidence of passive patriotism .
Democrats in 1980 charged that Reagan would rip apart the social safety net for the poor , while Republicans in 2008 accuse Obama of inciting class warfare and suggest as president he will undertake a classic liberal redistribution of wealth by increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and profitable US corporations .
It is incumbent on Obama to diffuse the " risk " issue .
In some ways his will be an easier job than Reagan's .
Reagan ran against an incumbent president , always a difficult race , while Obama faces a 71 - year - old Senate veteran .
( McCain turns 72 on Aug. 29 . )
Reagan faced a president preoccupied with 52 American hostages in Iran while Obama 's opponent supports an unpopular war in Iraq that has already cost over 4000 American lives .
The " risk " factor for insurgents can best be addressed in direct candidate to candidate debates .
Insurgents tend to have low expectations in these matchups , and hence a greater upside potential .
Ronald Reagan had only one debate opportunity to counter his " risk " problem .
Obama is likely to have a minimum of three encounters with John McCain and potentially several other town hall joint appearances .
John McCain will not be irrelevant in these face - offs , but only Barack Obama can confront the question of risk .
It is an enviable position for Barack Obama
Only he can win the race for the White House , and only he can lose it .
If Obama has proved one thing in his short political career , it is that he is far more likely to win than to lose .
Bob Beckel managed Walter Mondale ’s 1984 presidential campaign .
He is a senior political analyst for the Fox News Channel and a columnist for USA Today .
Beckel is the co-author with Cal Thomas of the book " Common Ground . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Hugh D'Andrade — a professional designer and illustrator — and EFF Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry produced a great piece and podcast about why artists need to support Orphan Works legislation .
There has been an enormous amount of FUD about this — people saying things about the proposal that just are n't true .
It 's nice to have someone clear the air , finally .
The Orphan Works legislation would help resolve those fears and , in the process , encourage the display and re-use of these " lost " works .
Under the proposed law , individuals who would like to use an orphan work must put diligent effort into searching for the owner of the copyright in the work , based in part on best practices to be outlined by the Registrar of Copyright .
If that search comes up empty , they can use that work .
And , if at some future time the copyright owner comes forward to demand payment , the legislation requires the second author to negotiate with that owner in good faith to determine reasonable compensation for the use , and promptly pay that compensation .
And if the second author does n't follow the new rules under the law and simply uses the work without making a diligent search ?
The copyright owner can sue them under the current rules and potentially obtain statutory damages of up to $ 150,000 per work — just as they can now .
Congress also plans to certify searchable databases for visual works like photographs , graphic arts , and textile designs that will collect information about works and contact information for the related copyright owners .
There are not " formalities " associated with these databases .
No artist will be required to " register " with the databases , and failure to register will not result in it being considered " orphaned . "

The bully .
He alternates between jolly and grouchy — but even his jolly side is a little scary sometimes .
He enjoys " teasing " his subordinates , especially anyone who 's different in some way , like having funny - shaped ears .
" Notices " his female underlings a little too closely .
He does give an inspiring speech about risk - taking , but that 's usually just to drag you into some weird body - switching scheme that will leave you with a weird rash for a month .
He 's also the original " I want it done yesterday " boss , who 's " sick of hearing the word ' ca n't . ' "
How to handle him :
If he yells , yell back .
Say " Dammit " a lot .
If he asks how long something will take , exaggerate by at least 200 percent .
If he starts cracking jokes at you , just ignore it , and he 'll probably go away .
But never , ever make fun of him back .
( I 've totally had this boss , like twice , and thinking of him as Captain Kirk really helped . )

The father figure .
He 's your best pal , playing poker with you and listening to you whine about your holographic love life — until you piss him off , and then suddenly he 's all shouty and mean .
He 's like your nice uncle who suddenly turns vicious .
It actually startled me the first time Picard showed his bitchslapping side — and yet it should n't have .
I 've had bosses just like this .
They 're all about " nurturing , " until you do n't get their drycleaning to them on time , and then suddenly it 's the screamy echochamber for you .
He 's also incredibly long - suffering , constantly annoyed by every little thing that goes wrong .
Likes to bust out with a speech explaining the " moral " of everything that happens .
How to handle him :
Do n't ever mistake his " daddy " act for real friendship , or let your guard down around him .
If he starts quoting Shakespeare or moralizing at you , just smile and nod until he stops .
Do n't confide in him about your personal shit , or he 'll just bring it up when he 's mad at you .
He likes to nurture creativity , so go ahead and share your artsy projects with him , not to mention your bizarre schemes for getting out of whatever mess you 've all gotten into this week .

The politician .
On the surface , he 's a big swaggering warlord ... but it only takes a glance to realize he 's really just a conniving weasel .
He 'll say anything to get ahead , and always manages to wind up in charge because he maneuvers all the smarter people into destroying each other while he remains unscathed .
If you start doing too well or — worse yet — become too popular around the office , he orders you to do an impossible task and then blames you when you fail .
Or he tries to maneuver you into self - destructing somehow , by giving you contradictory or unrealistic orders .
How to handle him :
As always , Worf shows us the way .
Challenge him to a duel , and then kill him .
Or if you 're not in a state where it 's legal to kill your boss , then challenge him head - on , and destroy him .
Whatever you do , do n't try to be sneaky with him — that 's playing his game .

The cold fish .
He 's always brooding and staring into his raktagino .
When he does smile , it 's usually a bitter smile at some irony he 's spotted .
Seldom praises your work , and when he does , there 's often a bit of an edge to it .
His main other mode besides glowering is screaming rage .
But he does at least know how to laugh at himself ... in a gloomy way .
How to handle him : Keep your distance .
Learn how to read his little signals — like if he leaves his " special " baseball on his desk , that means he 's planning on coming back after lunch .
Or if he nods slightly , that means " Great job , keep it up ! "
Or maybe : " I 'm firing you after lunch . "

The blamer .
She 's always right — even when she changes her mind three times .
She 'll take a tough stand , but then change her tune if her cronies disagree .
She lectures you about her principles , but they 're all totally disposable .
She 's all like , " No , we are not going to make an alliance with the Denim , " " There is no way we are possibly going to trade technology with the Gherkins , " etc. etc .
But when it comes down to it , she 's all about expediency .
And then after one of her little ethical shortcuts blows up in her face , it 's always your fault , not hers .
If you ever go around her , she puts on her hurty face and talks about how betrayed she feels .
I 've totally had this boss , too .
How to handle her :
Do n't ever crawl out on a limb to support her principled stances , or she 'll leave you out there by yourself .
She likes it when people challenge her — so go ahead and tell her she 's wrong .
She may end up agreeing with you .
But do n't ever count on her to stick to her big principles .

The queen bee .
She claims it 's all about the group , and what 's best for the " collective . "
It 's not about her at all — in fact , just pretend she 's not there .
She 's just there to speak for the group .
And then she insists on being all showy — ooh , look at me lowering my head and spine into my slinky new body !
She has to be the center of attention , even while she 's pretending that she 's one small part of a huge collective .
She enjoys seducing you into her group , but once you join , you 'll just be one of her bees .
And if you ever get away , she 'll keep bugging you and showing up when you 're trying to chill in your regeneration alcove .
How to handle her :
Take her at her word .
Pretend you really do think she 's just one small piece of a huge organization .
That way , it should n't matter if you talk to one of her " drones " instead of her .
It 's all the same , right ?
It 'll drive her crazy , and maybe she 'll expose some weakness .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : 675-2312 or media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union responded today to a stunning new report that the NSA has effectively revived the Orwellian " Total Information Awareness " domestic - spying program that was banned by Congress in 2003 .
In response , the ACLU said that it was filing a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for more information about the spying .
And , the group announced that it was moving its " Surveillance Clock " one minute closer to midnight .
" Congress shut down TIA because it represented a massive and unjustified governmental intrusion into the personal lives of Americans , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the Washington Legislative Office of the ACLU .
" Now we find out that the security agencies are pushing ahead with the program anyway , despite that clear congressional prohibition .
The program described by current and former intelligence officials in Monday 's Wall Street Journal could be modeled on Orwell ’s Big Brother . "
The ACLU said the new report confirmed its past warnings that the NSA was engaging in extremely broad - based data mining that was violating the privacy of vast numbers of Americans .
The Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) program was a mammoth data mining program that envisioned programming computers to trawl through an extensive list of databases containing personal information about Americans – including communications , medical , travel , education and financial data – in an attempt to detect supposedly " suspicious " patterns .
Congress shut down the program amid bipartisan objections that it was the most far - reaching domestic surveillance proposal that had ever been offered .
" Year after year , we have warned that our great nation is turning into a surveillance society where our every move is tracked and monitored , " said Barry Steinhardt , Director of the ACLU ’s Technology and Liberty Project .
" Now we have before us a program that appears to do that very thing .
It brings together numerous programs that we and many others have fought for years , and it confirms what the ACLU has been saying the NSA is up to : mass surveillance of Americans . "
Last year , the ACLU created its Surveillance Clock ( www.aclu.org/clock) as a way to symbolize the nation ’s rapid descent toward a surveillance society .
Initially set to six minutes before midnight , the ACLU today moved it up to five minutes before midnight to highlight the greater threat to privacy Americans face in light of the NSA ’s activities .
According to the new Journal report , the NSA was engaging in broad domestic spying operations that involve collecting and analyzing the personal information of Americans in ways that are " essentially the same " as TIA .
The elements that reportedly make up the new spying encompass a variety of mass surveillance and data mining programs about which the ACLU has previously warned , including :
TIA and other data mining programs .
The NSA ’s illegal wiretapping program , the so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) .
The Patriot Act ’s broadening of FBI power to collect third - party personal information without a subpoena through Section 215 searches and National Security Letters .
The Treasury Department ’s expanded surveillance of financial transactions through Cash Transaction Reporting and Suspicious Activity Reporting .
The CIA ’s illegitimate access to the SWIFT database to monitor international financial transactions .
DHS ’s efforts to increase collection and monitoring of airline passenger data .
Partnerships between these government agencies and private sector entities to collect and monitor customers ’ data and transactions .
The erosion of privacy through the judicial creation of a distinction between content and " transactional data " ( such as the recipients of e-mails or phone calls and the times and dates of each communication ) through the Patriot Act and prior developments .
" Congress needs to investigate immediately whether its will has been thwarted , and the media needs to give this program the attention it deserves as a radical departure from the privacy that Americans have always expected , " said Fredrickson .
" Just how many times is Congress going to sit back and watch this administration run roughshod over its prerogatives ? "
The FOIA request the ACLU filed today is intended to gain information about the " role that the NSA plays as a hub for the collection , analysis and distribution " of " transactional information of Americans . "
It seeks information from the NSA as well as the FBI , CIA , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , and the Departments of Treasury , Justice , Defense , and Homeland Security .
In 2006 , the ACLU published a summary of what it believed the NSA was doing , based on the various media reports citing current and former intelligence officials .
In the piece , entitled " Eavesdropping 101 , " the ACLU warned that the NSA was not just carrying out warrantless wiretaps on selected individuals , but probably carrying out broader data dragnets that violated the privacy of millions of Americans .
This prospect has not always remained in focus during the debates over the agency ’s illegal spying .
" We now know that TIA lives , " said Steinhardt .
" The question is , does American privacy live ?
And will Congress defend it ?
This program will be a test case ; may we prove worthy of the freedom we have inherited . "

Last night on the " The Report , " Stephen Colbert hosted Family Research Council President Tony Perkins to discuss the recent landmark court ruling in California legalizing same sex marriages , and ended up catching the " family values " crusader in some serious contradictions in the way only Colbert can .

" I think it would really be much better for the anti-gay - marriage side if they obeyed everything in the Bible , not just the anti-gay - marriage part .
Do n't you ? "
Californians apparently agree :
A majority of registered Californian voters oppose changing the constitution of the most populous U.S. state to bar gays from marrying , according to poll released on Wednesday .
The Field Poll survey found 51 percent against approving a possible November ballot measure to prohibit gay marriage , with 43 percent in favor .
A slightly differently worded question on the same issue found 54 percent opposed and 40 percent in favor .
Markos has some of the historical data showing how far Californians have come in just the past 30 years , as well as the age breakdown that bodes very well for the future of ensuring our gay brothers and sisters receive equal treatment under the law :

In other promising news , the AP is reporting that California will start issuing same - sex marriage licenses on June 14 .
Expect the wingnuts to fight this tooth and nail , but it 's good news nonetheless :
" I started work in my new job as Technical Manager full of enthusiasm , only to be thwarted by a flabbergasting array of absurd working practices imposed by the despotic dinosaur of a Development Manager I have to report to , " Amanda L. writes .
" What makes this more fascinating is that :
" this list is not a collection of experiences or anecdotes picked up from different sources .
" this list is not an embellishment of any existing practices at this company .
" this list is a genuine and accurate description of the real working practices currently being practiced at this company — nothing here is invented , it is all true .
IT Infrastructure
" Viruses can be picked up via networks .
Hackers hack in to computers via networks .
Viruses are bad .
Hackers are bad .
" QED : networks are bad .
It 's obvious when you really think about it !
Therefore , there is no company network .
" The company diary is on the Diary PC .
We all have to log on to the PC to look at the diary .
This means having to walk to another office and hope no one else is using the aforementioned Diary PC .
Remember : there is no network .
" There 's also an Email PC !
This is another walk to a different office : all email addresses are in the same Outlook session .
No one is allowed to have email access on their own PC ( someone might download something from a hacker ) .
If you are waiting for an important email from a client you have to lurk around the PC or keep having to walk back and forth between your office and the Email PC Office .
The DM 's recommended practice is to ask the person sending the email to call us when they 've sent it .
" There is no file server , as that would encourage network usage .
Files are transferred using USB drives ( each member of staff has a USB stick or drive ) .
" Backups : not a chance !
When I started I asked about the backup procedures .
I was told that all the software was stored on the ' software notebook . '
Yes , a notebook .
After that announcement the conversation went like this :
Me : " Oh . How often is the notebook backed up ? "
DM : " Erm . .. " [
He glances at a developer . ]
Dev : " Ermmmm ... " [
Developer glances back at DM like a rabbit caught in headlights . ]
DM : " Ahhhh ... er ... "
Dev : " I think it was backed up about 3 months ago . "
Me : " Riiiight ... ok ... and how is it backed up ? "
Dev : " I think you have to run a script . "
Me : " Any idea which one ? "
Dev : " I think it's on the desktop . "
Me : " Ok , thanks . " [
At that point I decided it needed some independent investigation . ]
Configuration Management
" Source code control : heh , yeah , right ... they have this ' source code notebook ' on which all the source code is held ( no servers — networks are dangerous , remember ? ) .
They use VSS for their web product but ... they do n't ever put comments in so it 's impossible to roll back to a previous released version .
They do n't know about ' branching ' so if they need to do an urgent fix they will apply the fix to the current in - development code base and attempt to patch up anything that has n't been finished and deliver that as the fix .
" The Database .
I looked at the SQL Server database they have behind their web product and asked ' How is version control done ? '
The exact response ( not a single word of this is a lie ) :
" ' We upload a version of the database to one of the customer websites and if it works we gradually copy it over to the other customer websites .
We do n't install it on all of them so that if we need to look at an older database version we know which customer website will have it and we just copy that back . '
" Because of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) it is impossible to reproduce versions of compatible database and web software versions .
" Version control :
They only have four versions of software :
" Dev1 : This is the version number of any software that is currently in development .
" Dev2 : This the version number of any software that has been ' finished ' but not yet installed anywhere .
So , when you finish work on ' Dev1 ' it automatically becomes ' Dev2 ' by virtue of the fact that you 've finished work on it .
" AlphaTest :
If you copy a piece of ' Dev2 ' software on to a live server it becomes ' AlphaTest ' version ( but only if you copy it into the directory ' D : \AlphaTest ' ) .
Note : this is not referring to the installation of the software , merely the copying of the software into the aforementioned directory .
" BetaTest : If you install something from AlphaTest into a customer site ( and it works ) you then copy back from the customer site to the BetaTest area ( D: \BetaTest ) , overwriting the old BetaTest version .
From then on all sites are installed from BetaTest — unless of course there 's a newer AlphaTest version ( indicated by more recent timestamps on the files in the AlphaTest directory ) .
" What may not be apparent is that the BetaTest version from , say , November 2007 , is not the same as BetaTest version from , say , December 2007 .
So , if you say ' What version is installed for customer X ' the response is usually something like ' They 've got BetaTest from November 2007 ... oh hold on , I think they had an upgrade in January ... what 's that ?
They had one in February ?
Oh ... hold on , I just need to check the timestamps on the files . '
" As there is no email all communication is via word of mouth or you have to write a memo , print it out , and then walk around handing out copies or leaving copies on desks and hoping people will see them and read them .
I tried to argue for internal email using the argument that if I need to notify my team of something then it's a lot easier .
He took me to one side , and in a fatherly way , told me the way to do that was to get everyone in to the conference room so I can tell them .
I was tempted to tell him that having so many people in the same room was bound to help spread any viruses that might be going around but I thought the irony might be lost on him .
Or that he 'd sack me .

Perhaps she should email her official resignation — once the email PC is free , that is .
Senator Barack Obama has chosen to spend Tuesday night not in Kentucky or Oregon , the two states that will be holding their primaries that day , or even at his home in Chicago .
Instead , Mr. Obama ’s staff announced on Saturday , he will be returning to Iowa , where he won the Democratic caucuses way back in January and has at least two good reasons to revisit now .
Much more than nostalgia seems to have motivated that decision .
If things continue to go as well for Mr. Obama this week as they have so far this month , with a romp in North Carolina , a strong showing in Indiana and daily growth in his support among party superdelegates , he could actually end up securing a majority of pledged delegates from nominating contests sanctioned by the party .
( To truly become the presumptive nominee , however , Mr. Obama would have to win additional support from superdelegates .
And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s efforts to have the party recognize results from two disputed contests , in Florida and Michigan , could also affect the status of the delegate race . )
This achievement will depend in large part on Mr. Obama 's performance in the Kentucky and Oregon votes .
He has all but conceded Kentucky to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , the clear favorite when the race started last year , spending little time there , but is favored in Oregon , where he is making a strong effort .
On Saturday , for example , Mr. Obama appeared at a town - hall - style meeting in the southwestern Oregon town of Roseburg , talking about health care and foreign policy and then taking questions about subjects that included Oregon ’s assisted suicide law and domestic partnerships .
Implicitly acknowledging what could be at stake in Oregon , he also urged supporters who have voted for him in advance , a common practice there , to make sure that they got their ballots in to tallying centers early enough to be sure they would be counted .

It makes sense Michael Chertoff would make his latest anti-liberty comments while addressing the Heritage Foundation .
After all , the “ conservative ” foundation — read , neocon foundation — is funded by the beer magnate Joe Coors and CIA operative Richard Mellon Scaife , heir of the Mellon industrial and banking fortune .
Heritage was on the ball after 9/11 , as it created the Homeland Defense Project , a “ task force ” cranking out “ recommendations ” for Chertoff ’s police state .
“ At a speech before the Heritage Foundation this week , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the U.S. needs to have a ‘ nonpoliticized , serious discussion ’ while writing new laws to define the best way to combat terrorism , ” reports the HAI website .
Translation : Chertoff does not want “ serious discussion ” on the political aspects of further denigration of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Chertoff said that once laws are written , the public should not second - guess government actions and claim that federal officials are overstepping their authority .
He decried critics who make such accusations , despite the widespread pubic calls after the September 11 , 2001 attacks for the U.S. government to do more to protect the country .
Chertoff further said U.S. society needs to come to a determination as to what are acceptable authorities for the U.S. government versus what violates people ’s rights .
In other words , how dare the commoners , soon to be classical feudal serfs , “ second - guess ” authoritarian government actions such as illegal checkpoints , gun confiscation , CPS kidnapping , and primarily building a panopticon surveillance state all the envy of Orwell ’s Big Brother .
Chertoff is tired of wishy - washy commoners complaining about a predatory government , no different than the Mafia in the way it shakes down subjects through confiscatory taxation , in the way it imports narcotics , tortures and tasers the public , steals property , invades and occupies small defenseless countries , murders and enslaves millions of people around the world .
If the public limits what the government can do , it must accept that the risk of terrorist attacks may increase , he said .
If the public gives the government greater authorities , it should not criticize the government for using those authorities at a later date .
Chertoff is essentially telling us that if we do not allow the government to impose its fascist state and finish construction of a suffocating control grid , “ terrorist attacks may increase , ” that is to say there will be false flag terrorist attacks unleashed by the government .
Chertoff and the ruling elite understand phony terrorist attacks launched by the CIA and the Pentagon will arm - twist the unwashed masses into accepting the imposition of a police state .
Chertoff called U.S. laws “ woefully inadequate ” in the context of current technology .
He said the most significant step American society needs to take is adapting laws to the 21st Century challenge of fighting terrorism .
Changes in technology have created unique challenges for the government when it comes to intercepting communications , as well as collecting and analyzing information found in the public domain according to Chertoff .
This is so transparent as to be a bad joke .
Chertoff demands we abandon the Fourth Amendment and allow the government to install all manner of snoop technology — on our telephones , computers , in public spaces , on public streets and highways , in school classrooms , even in bathrooms and dressing rooms — and after they install this intrusive technology we have no right to complain , that is unless we want to get hit again by CIA groomed cave dwelling terrorists .
Of course , Chertoff is simply blowing smoke out of a certain orifice .
Bush — or Hillary , Obama , McCain — will impose martial law and finish installing technology soon after the next staged event , promised to come sooner or later , according to our rulers and their minions , regardless of what the commoners want .
Sadly , most people , hooked up to the idiot box and their game consoles , will scarcely notice , that it until our rulers begin disappearing their relatives and neighbors in earnest , as all fascist states invariably do .

Obama Takes Lead in Superdelegate Tally Hillary Clinton to meet with major financial backers next week .
May 9 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama moved into the lead today in the last category that Sen.
Hillary Clinton had claimed to have an edge -- support among the Democratic Party 's superdelegates .
The Illinois Democrat grabbed the superdelegate lead thanks to a switch by New Jersey Rep. Donald Payne and an endorsement from previously uncommitted Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon .
Those two votes gave Obama a 267- 266 lead over Clinton .
That is a huge shift since the days when Clinton boasted about a 60 - plus vote lead among the party 's pros back on Super Tuesday .
Clinton Fights On , Obama Focuses on McCain
While the New York Democrat is refusing to concede defeat and is hoping a victory in Tuesday 's West Virginia primary will keep her dwindling hopes alive , Obama is starting to focus instead on his Republican opponent John McCain .
ABC News ' senior political correspondent George Stephanopoulos reported on " Good Morning America " that Obama 's team is considering using some of his campaign cash to fund ads against the Arizona senator .
His camp is also planning to announce a 50 - state registration rally this weekend , a tactic geared to a November election rather than the remaining Democratic primaries .
The rest of the Democratic Party , however , is struggling with how to end Clinton 's challenge and worries that a last - ditch effort by Clinton could be damaging to Obama .
They were particularly unnerved by Clinton 's comments earlier this week that appeared to be racially insensitive or racially calculated when she said , " Sen . Obama 's support among working , hardworking Americans , white Americans , is weakening again . "
" This is exactly the kind of talk that is going to make superdelegates nervous , " Stephanopoulos said .
" Most of the uncommitted superdelegates and party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are willing to forgo pressuring her to get out of the race as long as the rhetoric stays in tact . "
Panetta Calls for Clinton to Concede
Former top Clinton administration aide Leon Panetta told KGO TV in San Francisco , " It 's pretty clear unless there 's a bolt of lightning , Barack Obama is likely to win the Democratic nomination .
She 's put up a good fight and put up a good race , but I think there 's a time now where she needs to concede and unify the party . "
If Clinton decides to fight on , Panetta advised that she " should remain on issues , they should n't engage in personal attacks . …
Whether the winner wins will depend an awful lot on how the loser loses . "
There are indications that Clinton is taking a hard look at her options .
She has scheduled a meeting Wednesday -- the day after the West Virginia primary -- with her campaign 's major financial backers at her Washington mansion .
Stephanopoulos said there was also " lots of very quiet waltzing behind the scenes with intermediaries representing Sens. Clinton and Obama " to engineer a " dream ticket " with Clinton as Obama 's vice president .
" I should say there 's an expectation that Sen .
Obama is reluctant to go down this road for a host of reasons , but others are making the case this is the most powerful ticket for the Democratic Party , " Stephanopoulos reported .
For many Democrats , however , Conan O'Brien had it right .
In discussing the states where the two candidates were favored , the comedian quipped , " Hillary is favored in the state of denial . "
ABC News ' Karen Travers contributed to this report .
Politicians
From satire to funny news to cartoons , take this opportunity to laugh at the weird , wacky world of the web .
The Cathars were a religious group who appeared in Europe in the eleventh century , their origins something of a mystery though there is reason to believe their ideas came from Persia or the Byzantine Empire , by way of the Balkans and Northern Italy .
Records from the Roman Catholic Church mention them under various names and in various places .
Catholic theologians debated with themselves for centuries whether Cathars were Christian heretics or whether they were not Christians at all .
The question is apparently still open .
Roman Catholics still refer to Cathar belief as " the Great Heresy " though the official Catholic position is that Catharism is not Christian at all .
The religion flourished in an area often referred to as the Languedoc , broadly bordered by the Mediterranean Sea , the Pyrenees , and the rivers Garonne , Tarn and Rhône - and corresponding to the new French region of Occitanie ( or the old French regions of Languedoc - Roussillon and Midi-Pyrénées )
As Dualists , Cathars believed in two principles , a good god and his evil adversary ( much like God and Satan of mainstream Christianity ) .
The good principle had created everything immaterial ( good , permanent , immutable ) while the bad principle had created everything material ( bad , temporary , perishable ) .
Cathars called themselves simply Christians ; their neighbours distinguished them as " Good Christians " .
The Catholic Church called them Albigenses , or less frequently .
Cathars .
Cathars maintained a Church hierarchy and practiced a range of ceremonies , but rejected any idea of priesthood or the use of church buildings .
They divided into ordinary believers who led ordinary medieval lives and an inner Elect of Parfaits ( men ) and Parfaites ( women ) who led extremely ascetic lives yet still worked for their living - generally in itinerant manual trades like weaving .
Cathars believed in reincarnation and refused to eat meat or other animal products .
They were strict about biblical injunctions - notably those about living in poverty , not telling lies , not killing and not swearing oaths .
Basic Cathar Tenets led to some surprising logical implications .
For example they largely regarded men and women as equals , and had no doctrinal objection to contraception , euthanasia or suicide .
In some respects the Cathar and Catholic Churches were polar opposites .
For example the Cathar Church taught that all non-procreative sex was better than any procreative sex .
The Catholic Church taught - as it still teaches - exactly the opposite .
Both positions produced interesting results .
Following their tenet , Catholics concluded that masturbation was a far greater sin than rape ( as mediaeval penitentials confirm ) .
Following their principles , Cathars could deduce that sexual intercourse between man and wife was more culpable than homosexual sex .
( Catholic propaganda on this supposed Cathar proclivity gave us the word bugger , from Bougre , one of the many names for medieval Gnostic Dualists )
In the Languedoc , known at the time for its high culture , tolerance and liberalism , the Cathar religion took root and gained more and more adherents during the twelfth century .
By the early thirteenth century Catharism was probably the majority religion in the area .
Many Catholic texts refer to the danger of it replacing Catholicism completely .
Catharism was supported or at least tolerated by the nobility as well as the common people .
This was yet another annoyance to the Roman Church which considered the feudal system to be divinely ordained as the Natural Order ( Cathars disliked the feudal system because it depended on oath taking ) .
In open debates with leading Catholic theologians Cathars seem to have come out on top .
This was embarrassing for the Roman Church , not least because they had fielded the best professional preachers in Europe against what they saw as a collection of uneducated weavers and other manual workers .
A number of Catholic priests had become Cathar adherents ( Catharism was a religion that seems to have appealed especially to the theologically literate ) .
Worse , the Catholic Church was being held up to public ridicule ( some of the richest men in Christendom , bejewelled , vested in finery , and preaching poverty , provided an irresistible target even to contemporary Catholics in the Languedoc ) .
Worst yet , Cathars declined to pay tithes to the Catholic Church .
As one senior Churchman observed of the Cathar movement " if it had not been cut back by the swords of the faithful I think it would have corrupted the whole of Europe . "
The Cathar view of the Catholic Church was as bleak as the Catholic Church 's view of the Cathar Church .
On the Cathar side it manifested itself in ridiculing Catholic doctrine and practices , and characterising the Catholic Church as the " Church of Wolves " .
Catholics accused Cathars of heresy or apostasy and said they belonged to the " Synagogue of Satan " .
The Catholic side created some striking propaganda .
When the propaganda proved unsuccessful , there was only one option left - a crusade - the Albigensian Crusade .
The head of the Catholic Church , Pope Innocent III , called a formal Crusade against the Cathars of the Languedoc , appointing a series of military leaders to head his Holy Army .
The first was a Cistercian abbot ( Arnaud Amaury ) , now best remembered for his command at Béziers : " Kill them all .
God will know his own " .
The second was Simon de Montfort now remembered as the father of another Simon de Montfort , a prominent figure in English parliamentary history .
The war against the Cathars of the Languedoc continued for two generations .
In the later phases the Kings of France would take over as leaders of the crusade , which thus became a Royal Crusade .
Among the many victims who lost their lives were two kings : Peter II King of Aragon cut down at the Battle of Muret in 1213 and Louis VIII King of France who succumbed to dysentery on his way home to Paris in 1226 .
From 1208 , a war of terror was waged against the indigenous population of the Languedoc and their rulers : Raymond VI of Toulouse , Raymond - Roger Trencavel , Raymond Roger of Foix in the first generation and Raymond VII of Toulouse , Raymond Trencavel II , and Roger Bernard II of Foix in the second generation .
During this period an estimated half - million Languedoc men , women and children were massacred , Catholics as well as Cathars .
The Crusaders killed the locals indiscriminately - in line with the the famous injunction recorded by a Cistercian chronicler as being spoken by his fellow Cistercian , the Abbot in command of the Crusader army at Béziers .
The Counts of Toulouse and their allies were dispossessed and humiliated , and their lands later annexed to France .
Educated and tolerant Languedoc rulers were replaced by relative barbarians ; Dominic Guzmán ( later Saint Dominic ) founded the Dominican Order .
Within a few years the first papal Inquisition , manned by the Dominicans , was established explicitly to wipe out the last vestiges of resistance .
Persecutions of Languedoc Jews and other minorities were initiated ; the culture of the troubadours was lost as their cultured patrons were reduced to wandering refugees known as faidits .
Their characteristic concept of " paratge " , a whole sophisticated world - view , was almost destroyed , leaving us a pale imitation in our idea of chivalry .
Lay learning was discouraged and the reading of the bible became a capital crime .
Tithes were enforced .
The Languedoc started its long economic decline from the richest region of Europe to become the poorest region in France ; and the language of the area , Occitan , began its descent from the foremost literary language in Europe to a regional dialect , disparaged by the French as a patois .
At the end of the extermination of the Cathars , the Roman Church had proof that a sustained campaign of genocide can work .
It also had the precedent of an internal Crusade within Christendom , and the machinery of the first modern police state that could be reconstructed for the Spanish Inquisition , and again for later Inquisitions and genocides .
Chateaubriand referred to the crusade as " this abominable episode of our history " .
Voltaire observed that " there was never anything as unjust as the war against the Albigensians " .
Catharism is often said to have been completely eradicated soon after the end of the fourteenth century .
Yet there are more than a few vestiges even today , apart from the enduring memory of Cathar " Martyrdom " and the ruins of the famous " Cathar castles " , including the spectacular castle at Carcassonne and the hilltop Château of Montségur ( Montsegùr ) .
Today , there are still many echoes of influences from the Cathar period , from International geopolitics down to popular culture .
There are even Cathars alive today , or at least people claiming to be modern Cathars .
There are historical tours of Cathar sites and also a flourishing , if largely superficial , Cathar tourist industry in the Languedoc , and especially in the Aude département .
As we see the eight - hundredth anniversary of important events , more and more memorials are springing up on the sites of massacres , as at Les Casses , Lavaur , Minerve , and Montségur .
There is also an increasing community of historians and other academics engaged in serious historical and other academic Cathar studies .
Interestingly , to date , the deeper scholars have dug , the more they have vindicated Cathar claims to represent a survival of an important Gnostic strand of the Earliest Christian Church .
Arguably just as interesting , Protestant ideas share much in common with Cathar ideas , and there is some reason to believe that early reformers were aware of the Cathar tradition .
Even today some Protestant Churches claim a Cathar heritage .
Tantalisingly , weavers were commonly accused of spreading Protestant ideas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , just as their antecedents in the same trade had been accused of spreading Cathar ideas in Medieval times .
It can even be argued that in many respects Roman Catholic ideas have shifted over the centuries ever further from the Church 's medieval teaching and ever closer to Cathar teaching .
As the effort to create renewable energy sources picks up , biofuels are attracting a lot of attention , not all of it good .
Initial efforts have focused on extracting energy from sugars and starches in food crops , causing a competition for resources that has raised food prices globally .
Researchers have already started looking for ways to move beyond this competitive state by avoiding the use of food plants , and three documents published this week explore the challenges and potential in these approaches .
Nature Reviews Genetics has published an extensive review of the potential of genetic engineering to improve the efficiency of cellulosic ethanol .
The robust bodies of all plants , including everything from crops to trees , are actually composed of sugars .
Unfortunately , those sugars are linked together and bundled into a complex structure called cellulose , which is insoluble and largely unreactive .
Cellulosic ethanol relies on breaking down the cellulose to its component sugars , which are then converted to ethanol .
It 's flexible enough to work with non-crop species , such as switchgrass , or the non-edible portion of crop species , such as the body of a corn plant .
Right now , generating cellulosic ethanol is fairly energy intensive .
The fuel source has to be extensively processed to be made accessible to enzymes that target cellulose , which need to be obtained separately from growing stocks of bacteria or fungi .
The review focuses on ways that genetic engineering could make various stages of this process a bit easier .
The simplest approach involves engineering the fuel plants to produce their own cellulose digesting enzymes and store them in a safe compartment inside a cell .
Then , the initial processing of the plant could release the enzymes needed to start the fuel production process .
Other ideas discussed would improve the plants themselves .
These include boosting plant growth by increasing a hormone that regulates plant height , or boosting the cellulose content by adding additional copies of the genes that catalyze its synthesis .
Another approach would be to make the cellulose content easier to digest by reducing the dose of the enzymes that produce the crosslinks among cellulose fibers or adding modifications that make cellulose more soluble .
A note of caution about what plants to engineer , however , was sounded by the Global Invasive Species Programme , which published a set of recommendations ( PDF ) regarding a number of species that have been proposed as potential biofuels sources .
Quite sensibly , most plants under consideration grow quickly and in a variety of climates .
Unfortunately , these are precisely the properties that make a plant an invasive species .
The long list of species that GISP examined indicates that nearly every plant being considered is an invasive species somewhere ; the primary exceptions are existing crop plants , like wheat , peanuts , and soy .
Switchgrass , a potential biofuel .
The GISP recommendations are largely focused on keeping countries or industries from driving ahead with biofuels programs that have n't been carefully evaluated for the potential of unintended consequences .
They call for basic evaluations like risk assessments and cost / benefit analyses to be done before any new program is started , and to have working programs include ongoing risk management work driven by a certification process .
Obviously , where possible , native species should be used .
It 's difficult to find fault with any of these recommendations .
Meanwhile , Science ran a short editorial that pondered the other part of the equation , the bacteria that produce the enzymes that digest the cellulose and convert it to useful fuels .
It also goes on to consider how symbiotic bacteria might help foster the growth of useful plants , or other strains might help us sequester carbon .
It 's short , but it wraps up by arguing that scientists need a better understanding of the diversity of bacterial ecosystems and the way they interact with the carbon cycle , and the public needs a better understanding of why that science is important .
Overall , the attention being paid to what might be termed second generation biofuels , ones that are n't based on food crops , appears to represent a significant shift , a shift from a " quick and dirty " approach to one involving some forethought and planning .

Dem Rep. calls for impeachment at McClellan testimony : video David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008

Print This Email This MORE : McClellan testifies to House Judiciary Committee .
After questioning former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan during a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee Friday , a Democratic congressman called for impeachment proceedings to be initiated .
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) said that he believed McClellan 's testimony implicated both Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush as the only two administration sources who could have leaked the identity of former CIA covert operative Valerie Plame - Wilson .
" The president and vice president have denied ordering this illegal leak , but logic and the chain of command dictates that it must have been one of them ,  said Wexler .
" Mr. McClellan , in your book , you state that you cannot believe President Bush authorized the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson 's status as a covert agent .
...
Who does that leave us ?
The vice president . "
" He is someone that keeps things pretty close to the vest , to say the least , " replied McClellan .
" There 's a lot of suspicion there , because there 's questions that have never been answered , despite the fact that we said we would address these issues . "
McClellan added .
Asked Wexler , " So this suspicion leads you to believe that Vice President Cheney could have authorized Mr. Libby 's leak ? "
McClellan replied , " I ca n't rule it out . "
" We know that the vice president wrote a note where he starts to write and then crosses out the fact that the president himself asked Mr. Libby to stick his neck into a meat grinder to protect the administration , " said Wexler .
" It 's clear to me that Mr. Cheney is the only one left -- the only likely suspect -- to have ordered the leak .
If Mr. Cheney really thought Libby was innocent , then Mr. Cheney 's note would have said , ' We need to protect this man , who has done nothing wrong . ' "
Wexler closed by thundering : " The vice president 's own hand betrays him , and Libby , and implicates the President of the United States .
These facts in your testimony , Mr. McClellan , are more than enough , in my view , to open up impeachment hearings . "

Maine ’s governor is asking the federal government not to penalize Maine travelers this spring , based on the state ’s failure to comply with the Real ID act .
In a letter today to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , Gov. John Baldacci noted a state law , passed amid privacy and civil rights concerns , that prohibits Maine from complying with the act .
But he said the state has made progress in meeting many of the requirments of Real ID , and asked that Mainers not be subjected to extra security or travel delays .
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has set a March 31 deadlines for states to request a waiver that would give them more time to comply with the act , which requires new security measures for state - issued driver ’s licenses .
The act was passed after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington .
After May 11 , residents would be unable to use Maine licenses as valid IDs to board airplanes or enter federal buildings .
Baldacci ’s letter also noted legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Rep .
Tom Allen , D - Maine , that seeks to repeal Real ID and negotiate a new rule - making process .
Allen on Tuesday sent a similar letter to Chertoff outlining his concerns and his efforts to repeal Real ID .

You also got to pick your moral alignment , like whether you were “ lawful good ” or “ chaotic evil . ”
And you could buy swords and fight dragons .
It was cool .
Yes , I played a little .
In junior high and even later .
Lawful good paladin .
Had a flaming sword .
It did not make me popular with the ladies , or indeed with anyone .
Neither did my affinity for geometry , nor my ability to recite all of “ Star Wars ” from memory .
Yet on the strength of those skills and others like them , I now find myself on top of the world .
Not wealthy or in charge or even particularly popular , but in instead of out .
The stuff I know , the geeky stuff , is the stuff you and everyone else has to know now , too .
We live in Gary Gygax ’s world .
The most popular books on earth are fantasy novels about wizards and magic swords .
The most popular movies are about characters from superhero comic books .
The most popular TV shows look like elaborate role - playing games : intricate , hidden - clue - laden science fiction stories connected to impossibly mathematical games that live both online and in the real world .
And you , the viewer , can play only if you ’ve sufficiently mastered your home - entertainment command center so that it can download a snippet of audio to your iPhone , process it backward with beluga whale harmonic sequences and then podcast the results to the members of your Yahoo group .
Even in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons , when his company was selling millions of copies and parents feared that the game was somehow related to Satan worship , Mr. Gygax ’s creation seemed like a niche product .
Kids played it in basements instead of socializing .
( To be fair , you needed at least three people to play  two adventurers and one Dungeon Master to guide the game  so Dungeons & Dragons was social .
Demented and sad , but social . )
Nevertheless , the game taught the right lessons to the right people .
One SAILOR calmly tells the camera that America went to war for oil .
Another , while slurring drunk and again when stone sober , is shown making racist comments .
Yet another naval serviceman , who counsels crew members about sexually appropriate behavior , is caught having sex with a shipmate of a lower rank .
Later , a fighter pilot openly questions the rationale for the Iraq war and mulls over the morality of bombing the war - torn country .
And finally , a range of enlisted personnel and officers plainly voice disappointment over not dropping bombs during their mission .
While by themselves these incidents may sound like the stuff of enemy propaganda , they are in fact part of a much larger message entirely approved by the United States Navy -- which is somewhat nervously hoping that by allowing itself to look bad in places , it can look good overall .
The American public can watch what may be one of the riskier and more unconventional public relations strategies in U.S. naval history unfold on PBS ’ “ Carrier , ” a 10 - hour documentary series about life aboard an aircraft carrier during wartime .
The program , which clearly bears the stamp of reality television , premieres Sunday night on KCET - TV and most PBS stations across the nation and runs throughout the week .

“ There ’s a city of 5,000 on an aircraft carrier , ” said Adm .
Ted Branch , who was captain and commander of the Nimitz when the documentary was shot in 2005 .
“ They ’re all people and they all have opinions .
They are n’t robots .
“ I think what may be surprising for our people is to see it on film , ” added Branch , who has since been promoted and now works in the Pentagon .
“ But it ’s not surprising it happened . ”
Unlike with its one - dimensional recruitment ads that invite young Americans to “ Accelerate Your Life , ” the Navy did not pay for a camera crew to chronicle the warship ’s six - month deployment that began and ended in Coronado , and covered 57,000 ocean miles including a combat mission into the Persian Gulf .
The Navy paid instead by surrendering almost total editorial control to the filmmakers , who promised military officials they were out to capture the human stories inside the nuclear - powered ship ’s massive steel hulls .
“ The Navy participated in and supported movies like ‘ Top Gun ’ and ‘ Pearl Harbor , ’ ” said Maro Chermayeff , who directed , co-executive produced and co-created the series , which was bankrolled by Mel Gibson ’s Icon Productions .
“ But they were always about the hotshot pilots ; they were never about the ordinary 19 - year - old sailor on the ship . ”

The unusually candid and personal portrait of life aboard the Nimitz prompted Adm. Gary Roughead , the United States Navy ’s chief of naval operations , to e-mail approximately 1,000 senior active , reserve and retired officers , and civilian executives , earlier this month to explain why the Navy agreed to the series , and to allay fears about the program ’s potential negative impact .
“ We did not get a Navy ‘ commercial ’ in the traditional sense , ” wrote Roughead , a member of the Joints Chiefs of Staff and the senior military officer in the Department of the Navy .
“ ‘ Carrier ’ is very different from the hardware documentaries we have supported in the past .
This program focuses on our people and the reality - TV approach gives it a sense of authenticity and credibility .
Since we did not monitor the individual interviews and ongoing production , the program contains material that does not always and fully represent the discipline , values and mission of the U.S. Navy . ”
‘ An all - inclusive picture ’
The PBS series lands during an especially challenging time for military recruiters .
As the unpopular Iraq war drags on , all branches of the military are finding it increasingly difficult to attract new volunteers .
Although the Navy met its recruiting goals last year of approximately 37,000 and is on track to do so again this year , it ’s spending more money to achieve those figures .
The Navy spent $ 169 million in advertising last year , compared to $ 117 million in the previous year .

But the series provides the Navy with a new and welcome platform to reach what Pentagon officials call the “ influencers ” -- the parents , relatives , teachers , coaches and other adults who help determine whether a young person ultimately signs up for the services .
Several years ago , the Army developed a series of successful ads that specifically targeted adults who had no military experience -- not unlike PBS ’ audience pool .
“ This production , although not an all - inclusive picture of the Navy , will give potential recruits and those who influence them a glimpse of what life is really like in the Navy , ” wrote Roughead , whose e-mail was published on several blogs .
In summing up “ Carrier , ” Roughead said : “ The snapshot is frank and may be somewhat disconcerting to some who came into the Navy some time ago .
However , that said , I believe it will also resonate with a significant segment of our country . ”
PBS clearly has high hopes for the program even as it steers the network into riskier waters than usual .
In addition to staking 10 precious prime - time hours to a single show on consecutive nights , the network can ill afford to have a tent - pole program fail during a time of crushing competition from across the television dial .

Executives are gambling that the series will be able to rally a broad audience and also help drive viewers into other PBS shows , such as “ American Masters , ” “ Nova ” and “ Frontline . ”
And it must do so while not alienating its highly educated viewers , who might easily reject “ Carrier ’s ” reality TV and MTV music - video - like influences .
“ We have n’t really seen anything like this on PBS , ” said John Wilson , the network ’s chief TV programming executive .
“ I have to hand it to the Navy for their willingness to take that leap of faith that allowed us to present an unvarnished look at the Navy .
At the end of the day , they had confidence in their men and women and that the program would net out to be a good thing for them . ”
New freedom of access
Film crews have been allowed on aircraft carriers before , but never with such unfettered access or final control over the content .
Much like combat journalists during the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the 17 - member camera crew was completely embedded on the ship , living side - by - side with sailors for the entire six months .
The film crews were allowed to roam virtually anywhere on the ship and conduct interviews without minders looking over their shoulders .
( The camera crew paid its own expenses . )

The Navy did , however , retain the right to review the finished product and objected to only two scenes -- for reasons of national security .
Both , which amounted to about 30 seconds of screen time , were cut .
One scene apparently disclosed sensitive details about an F - 18 jet fighter , while the other showed a screen with classified information on it , said Chermayeff , whose crew shot more than 1,600 hours on the journey .
It took almost a year of intense negotiating between the filmmakers and Navy officials before the project was finally greenlighted .
A turning point , said Chermayeff , came when she finally convinced then - Capt .
Branch of the Nimitz of the project ’s potential upside to the Navy .
“ For most of the time , the Navy was like , ‘ Thank you for calling , but no , that is never going to work , ” said Chermayeff , who also was behind PBS ’ 2002 foray into reality television with “ Frontier House . ”
“ But Branch saw the value in showing people who these kids [ on the ship ] really are . ”
Added Branch about Chermayeff : “ She does n’t take no for an answer very easily . ”
Advertisement
The filmmaker ’s persistence resulted in a piece that follows the stories of about 15 crew members or , as the PBS series refers to them , “ characters . ”
Through this range of people , the audience experiences the expected -- but no less mesmerizing -- life - and - death moments aboard one of the most powerful Navy vessels ever built : nighttime landings by F - 18s on a violently pitching deck , a desperate search for a man overboard .
But more attention is paid to personal triumphs and failures of its crew members as they navigate their way through their grinding daily routines , while coping with the tough long - term separation from family that constitutes a lengthy naval deployment .
There ’s a sailor who leaves behind a pregnant girlfriend and gradually begins to wonder about her commitment to him .
And there ’s an enlisted Marine , abandoned as a 3 - year - old by his parents at a carnival , who rises in rank through his hard work and dedication and awaits the birth of his first child .
“ It shows exactly the way it is on a Navy carrier , ” said Chermayeff .
“ If you ’re expecting a Kodak commercial , yeah , it ’s a bad light .
But if you stand behind your people and you see your people as more complex than a recruitment ad , then no , I do n’t think it ’s negative . ”

The Navy believes the series carries a new , more enlightened , message to America :
That it is strong enough to be open and even tolerate public dissension in the ranks ; that when bad things occur , they ’ll be dealt with firmly and fairly ( the racist was kicked out of the Navy ; the crew member who had sex with a junior - ranking shipmate has his promising career ruined ) ; that no matter what their personal beliefs , when the time comes Navy personnel will perform their duty .
“ The country as a whole has evolved , ” said Branch .
And , he added , so has the Navy .

Rising oil prices , global food shortages and the economic crisis are proof for many survivalists that society is on the brink of meltdown .
But are their predictions all gloom and doom - or a chance to create new communities ?
Harriet Green reports
For three years , my husband has talked about taking to the hills .
About buying a smallholding on Exmoor where , with our four - year - old daughter , we can safely survive the coming storm - famine , pestilence and a total breakdown of society .
I would wait for his lectures to finish , then return to my own interests .
I had no time for the end of civilisation .
As an editor on a glossy magazine until a few months ago , I was too busy .
There was always a new Anya Hindmarch bag to buy , or a George Clooney premiere to attend .
But recently , I 've wavered .
Much of what he has been predicting has come true : global economic meltdown , looming environmental disaster , a sharp rise in oil and food prices that has already led to the rationing of rice in the US , and riots in dozens of countries worldwide .
This week , the details got scarier .
The UN warned of a global food crisis , like a " silent tsunami " , while Opec predicts that oil , which broke through $ 100 ( £ 50 ) a barrel for the first time a few weeks ago , may soon top $ 200 .
In the course of an idle conversation at work last week , a colleague casually revealed that he keeps a supply of tinned food in his bedroom " just in case " .
He has done this , apparently , ever since the July 7 bombings in 2005 and the fear of global pandemics such as Sars and bird flu .
And he 's not alone .
On the internet , you 'll find numerous would - be survivalists discussing strategies : where to find a hideout in the UK , what goods to stock up on , and the merits of carrying a 48 - hour survival kit .
Some are even wondering how to get round the UK 's relatively strict laws on the possession of weapons .
If not stockpiling food , many others are growing their own , with Jamie Oliver urging us to turn our gardens over to food production : sales of vegetable seeds are up 60 % on last spring .
Others still are moving towards taking their homes " off - grid " , with rainwater harvesting and solar electricity , and withdrawing their money from pensions to invest in precious metals and other time - honoured securities .
I 've started to worry .
Is my family prepared for the worst ?
I 'm reasonably nimble at the computer keyboard , and a whiz with the hairdryer , but otherwise pretty useless .
I 've barely made or mended anything in my life .
Thankfully my husband is three years ahead of me , and - with help from the many self - sufficiency manuals he 's collected - has evolved ( or regressed ) into a creature from the past : he 's got an allotment , has turned our garden into some kind of nursery for innumerable apple trees grown from pips ( farewell , ornamental rose ) and recently started knitting .
He even has plans for a composting loo , in the event that water supplies fail .
This kind of survivalism is not entirely new .
In the 70s , with the threat of nuclear war in the air , government leaflets suggested we stock up on food and drink to last 14 days , and advised how to build our own fallout rooms .
Some of my cousins left the UK for a nuke - free life in Australia .
Then there was the oil crisis , with associated blackouts and abbreviated working weeks .
In 1975 , the BBC reflected the forced move towards self - sufficiency and survivalism in two landmarks series : on a lighter note , Tom and Barbara dug up their back garden in the Good Life while , more apocalyptically , the drama series Survivors imagined that 90 % of the world 's population had been wiped out by a deadly bacterium in just a few days .
The series followed a few disparate survivors as they struggled to form ad - hoc communities , relearning ancient skills in order to survive .
The BBC recently announced that it is remaking Survivors to air this autumn .
I can't help thinking it 's horribly timely .
Survivalists have always seemed quintessentially American ; scary , bear - like loners in commando jackets , loaded with ammunition .
Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma bomber , was a survivalist , as were many of the scary characters in Michael Moore 's anti-gun film , Bowling for Columbine , including one , with bulging eyes , who kept a loaded firearm under his pillow .
But today survivalists include the likes of Barton M Biggs , former chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley , who warns in his new book , Wealth War and Wisdom , that we should accept the possibility of a breakdown of the civilised infrastructure .
" Your safe haven must be self - sufficient , " he advises , " and capable of growing some kind of food , should be well stocked with seed , fertilizer , canned food , wine , medicine , clothes etc .
Think Swiss Family Robinson .
Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down . "
Aside from climate change , what underpins all this gloom is a belief that we have nearly reached , or already passed , peak oil - the point at which global demand for oil permanently outstrips dwindling supplies , causing prices to shoot up .
And not just the price of oil , but the price of virtually everything else too , because our lives depend on ever - increasing amounts of cheap energy and synthetic petroleum byproducts .
Dr Vernon Coleman is a writer and broadcaster who has placed full - page advertisements in national newspapers to promote his new book , Oil Apocalypse .
" This is n't a script for a horror movie , " the terrifying text declares .
" The lorry that collects your rubbish wo n't be running .
Streetlights wo n't burn .
Hospitals will have to close . . .
There wo n't be any more television programmes .
You wo n't be able to charge your mobile telephone .
Within a generation , five out of six people on the planet will be dead .
I 'll repeat , five out of six people on the planet will be dead . "
Blimey .
How long have we got ?
Well , at the annual conference of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil in Cork last year , the former US energy secretary , Dr James Schlesinger , said that oil industry executives privately conceded that the world faces an " imminent " oil production peak .
And last week it emerged that output in Russia - the world 's second - biggest supplier after Saudi Arabia - has peaked already .
The Saudis may have peaked , too , but they do n't allow outsiders to audit them , so we wo n't know until it is too late .
Brazil announced recently a massive new oilfield , but within a week its own government had urged caution , warning that the claims were premature .
" We 've got to start preparing now , " says Coleman .
" The Saudis historically have always increased oil when there is a need , or if the Americans ask them to .
This time they have n't done so .
Suddenly they have stopped increasing .
All the evidence is there : we 've reached peak oil . "
Like many others , Coleman suggests that the recent move towards biofuels would not have happened unless conventional oil supplies had become scarce - and that it has been a disaster .
" How stupid can you be ?
If you use land to grow crops that enable Americans to drive 4x4s , of course you 're going to reduce the amount of food that people can eat . "
After a long period of steadily increasing globalisation , Coleman foresees a future in which everything will shrink back to the local .
" You must prepare yourself for a different world .
A world in which the rich ride horses , the middle classes use bicycles and the poor walk .
If you are planning for the long - term - and in this scenario , five years is long - term - do n't buy a house that relies on you having petrol for your car .
You want a house in a town with a small garden where you can grow vegetables , and you want to be relatively close to railways , hospitals , shops , and libraries .
The government shutting down local post offices is an enormously stupid thing to do . "
Coleman believes that many big companies will collapse , taking their pension plans with them , and governments will not be able to step in .
He 's switched his own investments to gold and silver .
Another prominent survivalist is Paul Thompson , a graphic designer living in Reading who also happens to be a modern - day prophet of doom .
His website , Wolf at the Door , offers a brilliantly argued lecture on peak oil for the beginner and attracts vast numbers of visitors .
In person , however , Thompson is low key .
" I 'm still pretty cautious .
People find the idea that society might fall apart nonsense .
I would n't bring it up in front of just anyone . "
On his website , he takes reasonable account of conflicting arguments about how peak oil and climate change will play out , but overall he remains gloomy .
" I 'm 50 this year .
I 've had a good run , " he says .
" I want to enjoy the next five or 10 years . "
With that in mind , he 's leaving Britain for the Czech Republic , where he will teach English and put into practice the self - sufficiency theory he 's absorbed from books .
" I 'm pretty depressed about Britain .
I think we wo n't cope well .
We are overpopulated , we have poor transport links .
In the Czech Republic they still have trams .
Eastern Europe is better prepared .
They were kept back for so many years , they have n't become so urbanised .
It 'll be easier to slip back to a more rural lifestyle .
We 've got to get back to little villages and towns , growing our own food , putting in place micro-generation .
You wo n't be able to rely on the centralised state any more .
" I 've got no house , no immediate family .
I have tried to make things more flexible in the past few years .
I 've taken money out of stocks and shares , stopped paying into a personal pension , and put all my money into bank accounts where it 's accessible tomorrow if I need it .
I 've got total flexibility . "
Has he put together any kind of emergency kit ?
" It 's probably a good idea , but the problem is you do n't know what you need .
You can have petrol in your garage , food , candles and water .
But you do n't know for sure what you 're going to be facing . "
One of the most gloomy websites that you will ever read is Lifeaftertheoilcrash .
net .
Set up by an American , Matthew Savinar , it presents the bleakest possible outlook .
A lawyer by background , Savinar litters his website with ads for freeze - dried food .
There 's even a picture of Savinar himself , crouching beside boxes of the stuff in his kitchen .
But when asked if the Guardian could reproduce that photo , Savinar declined : " I do n't need the marauding hordes descending on me here as my supplies are quite limited . "
It is presumably this fear that recently led a British member of the international survivalist community to ask for advice on Survivalblog.com ( which attracts 82,000 visitors a week ) .
Noting that the British government has banned samurai swords , he wondered what other weapons might be kept handy .
American correspondents replied that he should get out of England soon , while the US and New Zealand were still letting in foreigners .
Having no samurai swords at our house , we have little chance of fighting off the hungry masses when they tear lettuces from our window boxes and scale the fence of our allotment .
And the truth is that probably few places in Britain are much safer - not even in the most remote parts of the countryside .
Which is why we have put our hopes in a saner band of survivalists , who believe the answer is to work together .
The " transition town " movement was started by an Englishman , Rob Hopkins , after a stint working as a teacher in Kinsale , Ireland .
After learning about peak oil , Hopkins and his traumatised students spent several months trying to imagine what Kinsale would be like without oil , some years in the future - then worked backwards to create an " energy descent " plan that , on completion , was unanimously endorsed by the local authorities .
Returning to the UK , Hopkins started something similar in Totnes , Devon , which became the first official transition town .
There are now more than 35 of these grassroots initiatives up and running , not only in towns but also cities , villages and entire islands - and more than 500 communities , worldwide , are taking steps to join the Transition Network .
Even Ambridge , on The Archers , is weighing it up .
Hopkins recently published a manual , The Transition Handbook , a startlingly cheerful book that gives some idea as to how transition initiatives work - from the very early stages , in which groups raise awareness through film screenings and talks , to the later development of local food networks and even the launch of local currencies .
The movement uses 12 steps , rather like Alcoholics Anonymous , to wean us off our dangerous addiction to oil .
This includes honouring elders , Hopkins says .
" They have the knowledge of how things were done in the past " - when our lives depended so much less on the black stuff .
" We have been doing work with people who remember the 30s and 40s , people who say it would have been insane to eat apples from New Zealand .
Back then , all the food came from near the town , but we do n't have that resilience any more .
In the lorry strike of 2001 , we had only three days ' worth of food in Totnes . "
The key to effecting a smooth transition is rebuilding resilience and self - sufficiency at every scale - from the household to the wider community - all at once .
To Hopkins and others , Cuba offers a great example of effective community - based survivalism at the national level .
Many transition towns have been launched with screenings of The Power of Community , a short documentary showing what happened to Cuba after the breakdown of the Soviet Union led to oil supplies drying up , and the US embargo stopped many other crucial imports .
Faced with potential starvation or capitulation to the US , the Cubans gradually turned from heavy reliance on carbon - intensive agriculture : all kinds of urban spaces were cultivated , from window boxes to wasteland , and oxen were put back into use as there was no fuel to run tractors .
The transition took several years , and for a while Cubans had to forgo the equivalent of a meal a day , but eventually even people in cities were producing half their annual fruit and vegetable needs .
It 's films like this that explain why Hopkins remains fundamentally upbeat , and rejects the gloomiest prognoses .
" If we did n't do anything , " he agrees , " there are all sorts of grim scenarios .
But I like to think of those as like Dickens ' Ghost of Christmas Future - just one possible scenario . "
Thus , when the price of oil rises , Hopkins cheers .
" It 's like a racehorse owner cheering his horse .
The things I want to see happen only happen in times of high oil prices .
In the 70s , there was the most incredible flowering of creativity .
Solar power , permaculture - they all started in the 70s .
Then cheap oil came back , and everything went out of the window .
High oil prices will stimulate creativity all over again : the knock - on of rising food prices will make it more cost - effective to grow food here ; the higher cost of petrol in your car will make you ask if it 's worth making the journey . "
The bonus is that , as we burn fewer fossil fuels , emissions will be reduced and climate change might be slowed .
Peak oil can , Hopkins accepts , confirm the widespread belief that people are inherently selfish .
But the " head for the hills " response , he says , is more typically North American than British .
" I wrote a piece on my website , transitionculture.org , called ' Why the survivalists have got it wrong ' .
That elicited more comments than any previous post .
Some came from survivalist websites , and included such gems as ' Which is better , a gun or a club ?
The answer :
You can use a gun as a club but you can't use a club as a gun . ' "
Hopkins does possess survival skills , and he thinks they 're important .
" Bushcraft training is very useful .
It 's very empowering , learning to eat the things that are around you . "
But there are other things we need to learn too .
Indeed , a key part of the transition - town process is what he calls the " great reskilling " .
" We no longer have many of the basic skills our grandparents took for granted .
One of the most useful things a transition initiative can do is to make training widely available in a range of these skills . "
What skills does he have in mind ?
Bicycle maintenance ?
Home energy efficiency ?
Basic food growing ?
" You need to look at the skills people used to have that might still be appropriate , as well as looking at the skills people have now .
Speaking to older people in the area around Totnes , it turns out that , for example , they all knew how to darn their socks .
I know very few people my age who know how to do that , and it is a skill that , once we get beyond the throwaway society , we may well need again .
Hence the sock - darning workshop we are running . "
Sock darning , eh ?
It 's not as glamorous as those George Clooney screenings , and it lacks the superficial appeal of a hoard of rice , or gold coins .
But I 'm pretty sure my husband has n't tried it yet , and in the spirit of amiably competitive self - sufficiency that I 'm confident will soon become mainstream , I have decided that sock - darning may well be the survival skill for me .
May 20 , 2008  -- Barack Obama 's original answer seemed crystal clear : last July , asked whether he would meet with the " leaders " of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba , and North Korea " without precondition , " during his first year as president , he quickly answered yes .
" I would , " Obama , D - Ill . , said at the CNN / YouTube debate .
" And the reason is this : that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous . "
Obama has not renounced his commitment to meet directly with the leaders of rogue nations , including Iran .
But in recent weeks , his top aides and advisers have sought to add caveats to his promise , as Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , has made Obama 's debate answer a central campaign issue .
Obama Camp Offers Nuanced Approach
The Obama campaign is now offering a more nuanced approach that would not necessarily include a presidential meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- and that stresses diplomatic work that would take place before any such meetings take place .
Asked about Obama 's original statement Tuesday morning on CNN , former Sen. Tom Daschle , D - S.D. , a top Obama adviser and supporter , said top - level meetings would not be immediate -- and would not happen without preliminary extensive diplomatic work .
" I would not say that we would meet unconditionally , " said Daschle .
" Of course , there are conditions that we [ would ] involve in preparation in getting ready for the diplomacy .
... ' Without precondition ' simply means we would n't put obstacles in the way of discussing the differences between us .
That 's really what they 're saying , what Barack is saying . "
Susan Rice , a top Obama foreign policy adviser , said Monday that Obama 's meetings with Iranian leaders might not include Ahmadinejad .
" He said he 'd meet with the appropriate Iranian leaders .
He has n't named who that leader will be , " Rice said on CNN .
" It would be the appropriate Iranian leadership at the appropriate time -- not necessarily Ahmadinejad . "
Candidate Defends Position
Obama told ABC News ' Jake Tapper in an interview Tuesday that he sees no contradiction in the statements , explaining that he has always said that lower - level diplomatic contacts would lay the groundwork for a presidential meeting .
" I have to say I completely disagree that people have been walking back from anything , " Obama said .
" They may be correcting the characterizations or distortions of John McCain or others of what I said .
What I said was I would meet with our adversaries , including Iran , including Venezuela , including Cuba , including North Korea , without preconditions , but that does not mean without preparation . "
On CNN , Tuesday , Obama echoed Rice , saying he may not meet with Ahmadinejad .
" I think this obsession with Ahmadinejad is an example of us losing track of what 's important , " he said .
" I would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders if we had done sufficient preparations for that meeting .
" Whether Ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now , we do n't even know how much power he is going to have a year from now , " he added .
" He is not the most powerful person in Iran .
And my expectation , obviously , would be to meet with those people who can actually make decisions in terms of actually having them stand down on nuclear weapons or stopping funding [ of ]
Hamas or Hezbollah or meddling in the affairs of Iraq . "
Iran 's highest - ranking political leader is n't the president -- it 's the supreme leader , who is selected by the country 's religious leadership .
Obama began making clear that he would engage in " preparations " before a meeting starting shortly after the July debate , after Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton blasted his answer as displaying naiveté about the diplomatic process .
Still , as recently as September , he reiterated his promise to meet with Ahmadinejad himself .
Asked about that commitment in the midst of a firestorm over Columbia University 's decision to invite the Iranian president to speak , Obama indicated that he stood by it .
" Nothing 's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries , " Obama said .
" I find many of President Ahmadinejad 's statements odious and I 've said that repeatedly .
And I think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that do n't have American interests at heart .
But what I also believe is that , as John F. Kennedy said , we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate . "
Last week , in South Dakota , Obama sought to explain what he meant at last July 's debate when he agreed to meetings " without preconditions . "
" Preconditions , as it applies to a country like Iran , for example , was a term of art because this administration has been very clear that it will not have direct negotiations with Iran until Iran has met preconditions that are , essentially , what Iran views and many other observers would view as the subject of the negotiations , " Obama told reporters .
" The point is that I would not refuse to meet until they agree to every position that we want , but that does n't mean that we would not have preparation , " he continued .
" The preparation would involve starting with low level , lower - level diplomatic contacts , having our diplomatic core work through with Iranian counterparts -- an agenda .
But what I have said is that , at some point , I would be willing to meet . "
McCain's Sharp Critique
McCain has focused intensely on Obama 's answer at the debate last summer , while ignoring his subsequent attempts to clarify his position .
" Sen . Obama wants to sit down with [ Ahmadinejad ] unconditionally , face to face , " McCain told reporters in Miami , Tuesday .
" It enhances Ahmadinejad .
What are they going to talk about , the destruction of Israel ? "
While Obama has said he has been consistent throughout the past year , even some Democrats detect an evolving position .
" This is a fellow who , I think , shorthanded an answer that , in fact , was the wrong answer , in my view , saying , ' I would , within the first year ' -- it implied he 'd personally sit down with anybody who wanted to sit down with him , " Sen .
Joe Biden , D - Del. , a former presidential candidate , who is now neutral in the race , said on ABC's " This Week " on Sunday .
" That 's not what he meant , " Biden continued .
" That 's not what he has said , since then , for the last year , or thereabouts .
And so , I think , that he 's fully capable of understanding what 's going on . "
ABC News ' Sunlen Miller and Bret Hovell contributed to this report .
Have you ever had that weird sensation that you ’re not actually playing the same game as everyone else at the table ?
You ’ve described the scene : a noble and his retinue are in a large hall .
The noble is about to engage the party in conversation , almost certainly to hand out a mission .
And then the rogue chimes in with , “ When he starts talking , I ’m going to try to pick the noble ’s pocket . ”
You wait for someone else at the table to point out how ridiculous that would be , but they ’re all looking at you as if it ’s a great idea …
What now ?
Throw the scene , end up with the group in jail , and maybe convince them to do the job as punishment ?
Risk a free - for - all as the guards rush in ?
Let the dice decide ?
Ignore the request ?
Here ’s another option that works for me :
Take a moment and restate the situation in order to ensure that everyone at the table has the same visual image before proceeding .
“ OK , let ’s clarify this .
You ’re standing in front of Lord Wassisname , and about twenty other people , most of whom are paying attention to both you and him , many of whom are armed , some of whom are guards . ”
You ’ve probably played the ‘ telephone game ’ as a kid .
You know the one , where someone in a circle whispers something to the person next to them , who whispers it to the next person , until it comes back around , almost certainly altered from its original meaning .
It ’s the nature of verbal communication that words get misheard , or dropped entirely , and meanings get altered as we translate what we ’ve heard into what we ’re imagining .
( If you do n’t have a mental image of an arrow sticking out of a gazebo by now , you probably have n’t seen this story . )
Let ’s start with two assumptions :
One of the main jobs of a GM is accurately communicating everything in the world to the players .
Ultimately , responsibility for accurate communication lies with the speaker , not the listener .
If the players are about to do something that is obviously stupid , there ’s a pretty good chance that some critical piece of information was lost or misinterpreted .
In the above example , perhaps the rogue did n’t realize that “ retinue ” means “ entourage ” .
GMs such as myself , who try to emulate Gygaxian prose or use archaic words should be especially vigilant , as many of our players ( and sometimes even we ) may not be as knowledgeable as we think about such things .
( For further proof , continue reading my blog posts ; I ’ll eventually do something stupid based on a misinterpretation . )
The players are not entirely off the hook , either .
Communication is a two - way street , and the listener needs to help carry the load by paying attention , providing feedback , seeking clarification when necessary , and making sure that her assumptions and visual image are shared with others at the table .
The roles are reversed when the player is acting .
She needs to make sure that the GM understands her , and he needs to pay attention , etc .
GMs : This is not a license to question your players ’ actions .
We ’re all pretty familiar with the awe - inspiring ability of players to leave a GM ( or an entire table ) shocked and speechless with a single action that is simultaneously so brazen and stupid as to earn him a reputation to rival that of the French at military matters or the Japanese at wholesome and mature graphic novels .
I do n’t think any amount of restating the situation will ( or even should ) stem the tide of “ you do WHAT ? ” moments in the game .
But what can be caught are mistakes based on simple miscommunication or unspoken assumptions .
My own example is from D&D : I was playing a barbarian with a few ranks in Climb , and our party came across a cliff we had to climb down .
It was about forty feet to the bottom , and the GM described it as a typical rock wall .
I looked at my own experience with climbing and at my character ’s stats , figured that “ a typical rock wall ” should be pretty easy for him , and went to climb down .
What I did n’t know is that the D&D rules consider “ a typical rock wall ” to be about as difficult to climb as a brick wall .
I had considered it about as difficult as a modern “ climbing wall ” for beginners , and figured a strong character with some training should be able to handle it , no problem .
I was wrong ; my character fell on his first check , and took some damage ( mainly to the ego ; barbarians may not be able to climb , but they sure as hell can take damage ) .
It was no big deal , and I managed to write a nice story about it , but the whole thing could have been avoided had the GM simply restated the situation .
“ Looking closer at it , you realize that it ’s pretty much a sheer cliff ; it ’s nearly vertical , without a lot of hand and foot holds . ”
Restating the obvious will not prevent the over - thought yet under - considered schemes of your players ( and secretly , we all do love those schemes ) , but it will prevent mistakes based on poor assumptions or miscommunication .
I consider it as that voice in your head that points out the obvious mistake in your plans , or the gut - level reaction your body has at doing something really stupid .
( If you ’ve ever felt that last bit of hesitation on the high - dive , or when you ’re about to pull that bandage off a sensitive spot , you know what I mean . )
Some GMs like to use the generic “ Are you sure you want to do that ? ” question as a last resort .
This is handy , in that it points out that something is wrong , but it ’s not specific enough to differentiate a decision based on faulty assumptions from a decision made out of sheer folly .
Players will make a lot of questionable decisions in the course of a game , and many GMs may be justified in asking if they ’re sure before pulling the trigger , but that ’s another topic for another time .
Right now , I ’d rather just eliminate mistakes based on communication and assumptions .
Years ago as a high school student , I attended a summer running camp in Pennsylvania .
During a routine six - mile run , I stumbled , and a coach stopped me and asked me if I was okay .
“ I ’m fine , ” I assured him , and kept running .
But I was n’t fine .
By the end of the run I had collapsed with heatstroke and had fallen unconscious .
The athletic trainers quickly submerged me in a tub of ice to lower my body temperature , and I spent the next week in a hospital , lucky to be alive .
Later my coach visited me , angry at himself for letting me continue my run .
But I had no memory of our earlier exchange .
“ You were so convincing , ” he told me .
Athletic researchers say one of the most frustrating aspects of heat illness is that the sufferer is often completely unaware of his or her own symptoms .
“ Your cognitive ability and your capacity to make a rational decision is indeed compromised , ” said Michael F. Bergeron , director of the environmental physiology laboratory at the Medical College of Georgia .
“ You hear all the time that the athletes themselves did n’t know enough to stop and did n’t want to stop and have no memory of what happened . ”
While preparing for a study last year , Dr. Bergeron put himself on a treadmill in a heated room .
But knowing the tendency for the heat to distort judgment , he gave his assistant specific instructions before getting started .
“ I told her that when I got to a certain point , no matter what I say , you stop me , ” he said .
“ I told her that however adamant I was about wanting to keep going , do n’t let it happen . ”
The study was stopped without incident when Dr. Bergeron ’s body temperature reached 103.5 degrees .
“ I had n’t lost cognitive control , ” he said .
“ But I remember not being totally aware of exactly what I was doing . ”
The lesson is that if a problem with heat illness is suspected , asking someone if they are O.K. is not enough .
In addition to high body temperature , the obvious signs of heat illness are red , hot and dry skin with little or no sweating , as well as a rapid strong pulse .
A person with heat illness may start stumbling or appear less coordinated than usual .
Ask the person if she or he has a headache , nausea or dizziness .
Talk to them about a variety of topics to see if they exhibit symptoms of confusion .
If you suspect a person is having a problem with the heat , err on the side of caution and insist they get into shade and cool down .
Have them drink water and spray their body with cold water or rub them down with ice or a cold cloth .
If they do n’t cool down quickly , seek medical advice .
Dr. Bergeron notes that after incidents of heatstroke among student athletes , it often becomes clear that other students had noticed the player “ did n’t look quite right . ”
Kids should be instructed that if their friends start acting funny , confused or mumbling , they should alert an adult .
As a result , athletic researchers recommend that kids and adult exercisers alike should adopt a buddy system when playing or exercising in the heat .
“ The athlete is the worst one to make the decision , ” Dr. Bergeron said .
“ We strongly recommend that you have people and kids in like positions sort of assigned to each other so you have a buddy system .
It ’s your buddy or friend who is likely to notice the behavioral change first . ”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention answers frequently asked questions about heat illness here .
While the RIAA has waged a full - on legal assault against individual file - sharers , the MPAA has instead chosen to go after individual web sites .
In 2006 , the motion picture industry trade group filed copyright infringement lawsuits against a number of BitTorrent sites , including TorrentSpy and isoHunt .
TorrentSpy lost , thanks to its admins ' willful destruction of evidence , but is oHunt is fighting back .
A recent filing in the case opposes the MPAA 's motion for summary judgment , arguing that isoHunt is just another search engine .
" There are hundreds of public torrent sites , some limited to a specific subject matter , others general aggregators like is oHunt , who like Google , try to cover as much of the Internet as possible , " reads is oHunt 's filing .
" The essential functions performed at a torrent site are also performed at a comprehensive search site like Google or Yahoo ! . "
isoHunt then makes a series of comparisons to search engines , inviting the judge to visit Google himself to compare .
The torrent site only gives users a " means to obtain content , " again like Google , but not the content itself .
All isoHunt does is collect data , index it , cache content , and add user - uploaded . torrent files to its database .
Any actual copyright infringement occurs only on the part of the user once he or she launches a BitTorrent client .
The torrent site accuses the MPAA of playing fast and loose with the truth about the BitTorrent download process in order to build its case against .
Instead of occupying a " central position or power of control , " isoHunt and other torrent sites have " no meaningful existence other than through collective existence . "
Every function performed throughout the course of a BitTorrent download or upload is dispersed , and no single site has any " power of control . "
Saying that a BitTorrent site is responsible for infringement is ridiculous , according to isoHunt .
Using the odd illustration of a " Gun and Boot Store , " the site 's admins argue that they are no more responsible for copyright infringement than the owner of the hypothetical firearms and footwear outlet would be if someone bought a gun and pair of boots there , and subsequently robbed someone .
In making its case against isoHunt , the MPAA relies heavily on the famous MGM v. Grokster decision , in which the Supreme Court held that anyone who distributes a device with the intention that it will be used for copyright infringement can be liable for subsequent third - party infringements .
That ruling is irrelevant , argues isoHunt , because it only applies to " products " and " devices , " not search engines or " sites that manifest hyperlinks to dot torrent files . "
If that standard were used , search engines like Google or Yahoo would be liable under the MGM v. Grokster ruling if any of their search results led to copyrighted content .
It 's impossible to know how the judge will rule , but , in order to prevail , is oHunt will have to convince the judge that it is the functional equivalent of a search engine .
That might be a tough argument to make , since is oHunt 's primary purpose is to collect an index of and links to one particular type of content .
In contrast , search engines are largely data - agnostic — Google 's stated intent is to index all of the world 's data .
No matter which way the ruling goes , this could prove to be an important milestone for the MPAA 's fight against BitTorrent sites .
The MPAA has a few notches in its bedpost , but those have come from settlements which resulted in shuttered sites , or , in the case of TorrentSpy , resulted from malfeasance on the part of the defendants .
And even if is oHunt convinces the judge to rule in its favor on the MPAA 's motion for summary judgment , the case will still be headed for a jury trial .

An increasingly popular commercial corn , genetically engineered to produce a bacterial toxin to protect against corn pests , has an unwanted side effect :
Its pollen kills monarch butterfly larvae in laboratory tests , according to a report by Cornell University researchers .
Writing in the latest issue ( May 20 ) of the journal Nature , the Cornell researchers note that this hybrid crop , known as Bt- corn , has genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) spliced into the plant genes .
These hybrids are very effective against the ravenous European corn borer , a major corn pest that is destroyed by the plant 's toxic tissue .
The engineered corn is safe for human consumption .
Unlike many pesticides , the Bt - corn has been shown to have no effect on many " nontarget " organisms -- pollinators such as honeybees or beneficial predators of pests like ladybugs .
But the Bt- modified corn produces pollen containing crystalline endotoxin from the bacterium genes .
When this corn pollen is dispersed by the wind , it lands on other plants , including milkweed , the exclusive food of monarch caterpillars and commonly found around cornfields .
Says John E. Losey , Cornell assistant professor of entomology and the primary investigator on the study : " We need to look at the big picture here .
Pollen from
Bt - corn could represent a serious risk to populations of monarchs and other butterflies , but we can't predict how serious the risk is until we have a lot more data .
And we can't forget that Bt- corn and other transgenic crops have a huge potential for reducing pesticide use and increasing yields .
This study is just the first step , we need to do more research and then objectively weigh the risks versus the benefits of this new technology . "
Like all grasses , corn is wind - pollinated , and the pollen can be blown more than 60 yards from the edge of cornfields .
" Pollen is that yellow dusting your car gets on spring and summer days ; pollen is everywhere , " explains Losey .
" That 's why we are concerned about this problem . "
Other researchers on the study were Linda S. Rayor , Cornell instructor in entomology , and Maureen E. Carter , Cornell research aide .
" Monarchs are considered to be a flagship species for conservation .
This is a warning bell , " says Rayor .
" Monarchs themselves are not an endangered species right now , but as their habitat is disrupted or destroyed , their migratory phenomena is becoming endangered . "
In the laboratory tests , monarchs fed milkweed leaves dusted with so - called transformed pollen from a Bt - corn hybrid ate less , grew more slowly and suffered a higher mortality rate , the researchers report .
Nearly half of these larvae died , while all of the monarch caterpillars fed leaves dusted with nontransformed corn pollen or fed leaves without corn pollen survived the study .
The toxin in the transformed pollen , the researchers say , goes into the gut of the caterpillar , where it binds to specific sites .
When the toxin binds , the gut wall changes from a protective layer to an open sieve so that pathogens usually kept within the gut and excreted are released into the insect 's body .
As a result , the caterpillar quickly sickens and dies .
Bt - engineered corn is among the first major commercial successes for agricultural biotechnology .
Last year , more than 7 million acres of the hybrid crop were planted by U.S. farmers primarily to control the European corn borer .
Before the advent of Bt - corn , this pest was extremely difficult to control because it bores into the stalk , where it is protected from pesticides .
It produces several generations a year .
Because it was so difficult to control effectively with pesticides , annual losses averaged $ 1.2 billion .
In contrast , Bt - corn provides essentially total season - long control at a reasonable cost without the use of pesticides .
At least 18 different Bt- engineered crops have been approved for field testing in the United States .
As of last year , transformed corn , potatoes and cotton had been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for commercial use .
Several factors make monarch caterpillars particularly likely to make contact with corn pollen , Losey says .
Monarch larvae feed exclusively on milkweed because it provides protection against predators .
The plant contains cardenolides , which are toxic , bitter chemicals that the monarch caterpillar incorporates into its body tissues , rendering it unpalatable to predators .
Milkweed grows best in " disturbed " habitats , like the edges of cornfields , Losey notes .
The butterflies overwinter in Mexico and by the spring begin migrating north .
The first generation of the year crosses into Texas , other Gulf Coast states and Florida , seeking milkweed on which to lay their eggs and feed .
By late May or early June , the second generation of adults has emerged and heads north to areas including the Midwest Corn Belt .
Monarch caterpillars are feeding on milkweed during the period when corn is shedding pollen , Losey says .
Thus " they may be in the right place at the right time to be exposed to Bt - corn pollen . "
I was telling my husband that I was n't sure how to start a Titanic story , and this was his suggestion :
" Hey , this is a little - known fact ... an obscure , low - budget movie was made about it in the 90s . "
So , on that note , today is the 96th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic .
Yes , we all know about Jack and Rose and their brief - but - intense relationship aboard the ship , but which details did James Cameron get right , which did he exaggerate and what did he leave out altogether ?
Below are 10 things you may not know about the real Titanic .
[ And if that gets you in the mood to buy some Titanic merchandise , order our " Ship Happens " shirt . ]
1. Iceberg Warnings
Seems like this ship was doomed .
Captain Edward Smith actually changed course a little bit in response to iceberg warnings he received over wireless , but , obviously , icebergs were in the Titanic 's future anyway .
Two boats , the Amerika and the Mesaba , both sent messages to the Titanic to warn the captain that despite changing course , huge icebergs were still in the ship 's path .
Neither message made it from the wireless operator to the bridge .
Around 11 p.m. ,
The Californian sent word that they were stopped for the night because of the ice .
Like the others , this message never left the wireless room .
2. Notable Passengers
Being the first to ride on the luxury ocean liner was a big deal " “ thus , some very rich and prominent people called the first - class cabins " home " 96 years ago .
Just a few of the passengers included :
" ¢Millionaire John Jacob Astor and his pregnant wife , Madeleine .
They had been on their honeymoon when she became pregnant , which is why they booked tickets on the Titanic .
Many legends about Astor and the Titanic are floating around , but none of them have ever been substantiated .
It 's rumored that he was the one who let all of the dogs out of their kennels so that they might have a fighting chance ; it 's also said that he put a woman's hat on a younger boy so that he would be mistaken for a woman and would be able to board a lifeboat .
My favorite , though , is the rumor that when the iceberg struck the ship , Astor quipped , " I asked for ice , but this is ridiculous . "
" ¢ Benjamin Guggenheim , the son of mining magnate Meyer Guggenheim and the father of museum founder and art collector Peggy Guggenheim .
He was reportedly the one who said , " We 've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen . "
" ¢ Isidor Straus , co-owner of Macy 's department store .
His wife , Ida , refused to leave his side even though she was offered a spot on a lifeboat .
" ¢ Molly Brown , who was friends with the Astors and decided to return home with them when she learned that her grandson was ill .
Molly survived by boarding a lifeboat and tried to commandeer the boat when the boat 's Commander , Robert Hichens , refused to go back and pick up people in the water even though the lifeboat was only half - full .
" ¢ Dorothy Gibson , who , after Mary Pickford , was probably the best - known and highest - paid silent film actress of the day .
She survived and made a film about her escape from the Titanic , even wearing the same clothes she wore on that fateful night " “ a white silk dress with a cardigan and polo coat .
She may have been the inspiration for Rose in the 1997 movie that you may have heard of if you like little indie films .
3 . The prices
Third - class passage was only about $ 36.25 , although that was still quite a bit of money in those days , especially for a large family .
Second class was about $ 66 and first class started at $ 125 .
The highest priced suite was $ 4,500 , though , which was a huge amount of money " “ at the time , a decent house could be found for $ 1,000 , so to spend more than four times that on temporary lodgings was pretty shocking .
I suppose that 's why they called it " The Millionaire 's Suite " .
4 . A close call
Both J. P. Morgan ( right ) and Milton S. Hershey ( left ) had reservations on the Titanic and surely could have booked the Millionaire 's Suite .
Mrs. Hershey fell ill so the Hersheys booked passage on a different ship " “ The Amerika .
The Hershey museum displays a copy of the check Hershey wrote to the White Star Line as a deposit for his first - class room on the Titanic .
The White Star Line was actually owned by J.P. Morgan , who was scheduled to be staying in his own private suite .
He canceled for unknown reasons .
5. Commander Charles Lightoller
Commander Charles Lightoller was the senior - most crew to survive , but even his was a narrow escape .
When water washed over the bow of the ship , Lightoller decided that he might as well jump in the water voluntarily before it took him unexpectedly .
He surfaced from his dive only to be sucked back under as water flooded one of the ventilators .
He was pinned to the grates until a blast of air from the ship pushed him back up to the surface .
He then helped passengers cling to an overturned lifeboat until they were rescued .
He continued to be a hero even after getting back to dry land - it was his testimony and recommendation that spurred safety improvements such as basing lifeboat numbers on passenger numbers ( instead of the weight of the ship ) , 24 - hour radio communications in all ships and lifeboat drills for the passengers .
6. The Titanic Curse
It does n't really exist , but at the time , people thought the ship was cursed from the start .
The ship was supposedly assigned the number 390904 .
Read that backward in a mirror and it vaguely resembles the phrase " No Pope " .
The Titanic was actually assigned the number 401 , so there 's really no truth to the " curse " at all .
7. Rediscovery
The doomed steamliner was n't found until 1985 , when oceanographer Robert Ballard discovered it near Newfoundland using new sonar technology .
He was actually just looking for debris , not the ship itself " “ over the years , experts decided that debris would have been scattered over a large area as the ship sank to the bottom of the ocean .
Soon after sighting debris , the crew spotted a boiler and then the hull of the ship .
The biggest discovery the team made is that the ship did actually split into two parts " “ both American and British inquiries had determined that the ship sank as one whole piece .
Ballard and his crew did n't take any artifacts from the ship at the time ; he considered it graverobbing .
Eventually , though , more than 6,000 items were recovered and put on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich , England .
Many objects were also part of a traveling Titanic museum exhibit .
8. The Last Survivor
Millvina Dean was the youngest person on the Titanic at a mere two months old .
Her parents were moving from England to Wichita , Kansas , and managed to get third - class tickets for the Titanic .
They never made it to Wichita - her father did n't survive the crash and her mother , being left with two small children , wanted to go home to England to be with her surviving family .
Strangely enough , her brother , Bertram , died on April 14 , 1992 , the 80th anniversary of the Titanic striking the iceberg .
9 . Was the accident foretold ?
Maybe Morgan Robertson was psychic .
About 14 years before the Titanic sank , Robertson wrote Futility , a novel about the largest ship ever built hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean on a cold April night .
The ship " “ The Titan " “ sank , leaving only 13 survivors out of 3,000 .
The Titan was also billed as " unsinkable " and was also a British ship on its way to New York .
A little spooky , no ??
10 .
The last meal
What did all of these wealthy people dine on before going down with the ship ?
Well , it was quite a feast .
Offerings at dinner on the night of April 14 , 1912 , included oysters , filet mignon , lamb with mint sauce , roast duckling , chateau potatoes , roast squab and cress , pate de foie gras , Waldorf pudding , peaches in Chartreube jelly , chocolate and vanilla eclairs and French ice cream .
Second - class passengers did n't fare quite so well " “ their dinner was their choice of haddock , chicken , lamb or turkey , boiled rice , boiled potatoes , plum pudding , American ice cream , fresh fruit , biscuits and coffee .
Third - class passengers received Irish stew , stewed apricots , fresh bread and butter and tea .
Well , these are just a few stories .

— A motel maintenance supervisor found the body of a pregnant Fort Bragg soldier in the bathtub of her room last weekend , according to a search warrant .
Spc. Megan Lynn Touma , 23 , was found Saturday morning in a room at the Fairfield Inn on Morganton Road after guests complained of an odor coming from inside .
She was seven months pregnant , police said .
The decomposed condition of her body has made it difficult to determine the cause of death , police said , so her body was sent to the State Medical Examiner 's Office in Chapel Hill for an autopsy .
A spokeswoman for the medical examiner 's office said Thursday that toxicology results were pending and that the autopsy results have n't been released .
The Fayetteville Police Department has called Touma 's death suspicious but has released no details of the investigation .
The assistant maintenance supervisor at the Fairfield Inn told police that no one had been in Touma 's room for four days because a " Do Not Disturb " sign was posted on the door , according to .
The supervisor said he went into the room shortly before Touma was scheduled to check out , and he found her body in the tub , the document said .
It does not reveal whether she appeared to have been bathing or was clothed in the tub .
The document said the bed was pushed out slightly from the wall and a nightstand and lamp were askew .
There was no mention of any evidence of a possible struggle .
A set of keys for a rented Chevrolet Trailblazer was on a dresser , according to the document .
The SUV was parked in the motel lot , according to the document , but it did n't note whether Touma had rented it .
No information was released on what evidence investigators collected from the room or the SUV .
Fort Bragg officials said Touma was assigned to the base June 12 .
A dental specialist from Cold Spring , Ky. , who had been in the Army for five years , she previously was assigned to Army dental clinics in Germany and at Fort Drum , N.Y. , officials said .
She signed into Fort Bragg 's 19th Replacement Company at 2 a.m. that day and attended two required formations at 6:15 a.m. and 3 p.m. , officials said .
The replacement company 's processing of new soldiers arriving at the post typically lasts between five and eight days , after which they 're assigned to a unit .
Touma was going to be assigned to a Fort Bragg dental clinic , officials said .
When Touma missed a formation June 16 , she was n't reported absent without leave after 24 hours , in accordance with Army regulations , officials said .
Fort Bragg spokeswoman Maj .
Angela Funaro said each unit commander has the discretion to declare a soldier AWOL after 24 hours .
As an Army specialist , Touma was required to report to her unit daily .
If Touma had been deemed AWOL , military and local police would have been notified .
The Army is investigating to determine why Touma was n't declared AWOL and whether anyone tried to check on her , Funaro said .
The investigation is being led by Fort Bragg 's commanding general and was expected to last 14 days , she said .
“ We do n’t know what members of that unit did or did n’t do , ” she said .
“ It appears as though the unit did not have positive accountability of her . ”
Touma 's ex-husband , El Sayed Touma , said the Army had told Megan Touma 's family that she was AWOL but that the family did n't believe she would go AWOL and was worried because they had n't heard from her recently .
“ She was left in the room for two days , and the Army said she was AWOL , " El Sayed Touma told WCSC - TV in Charleston , S.C. , where he lives .
" They did n't even bother to go check on her in the motel where she stayed .
I mean , the Army knows that she stayed in that hotel .
They put her in that hotel . "
Fort Bragg officials were n't aware that she was staying at the Fairfield Inn , Funaro said .
" We did not put her there , " she said .
The Toumas met at Fort Drum , in upstate New York , when they were both stationed there .
They were married for three years and divorced last year .
El Sayed Touma said he and his ex-wife remained close , noting she planned to name her baby after him .
Megan Touma was staying at the Fayetteville motel while she looked for off - base living quarters , Funaro said .
It was unknown whether the room was registered in her name .
Funaro said she Touma requested in February to be assigned to Fort Bragg , but she was n't aware of any relationships the soldier might have had with others in the area .
The Army is cooperating with Fayetteville police , providing access to people to help establish a time line of Touma 's whereabouts , she said .
Touma 's family has declined comment from their home in Kansas , said Deb Skidmore , a spokeswoman at Fort Riley , about 55 miles west of Topeka , Kan .
" They ask that everyone leave them alone and let them grieve , " Skidmore said .

Pentagon officials firmly opposed a proposal by Vice President Dick Cheney last summer for airstrikes against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) bases by insisting that the administration would have to make clear decisions about how far the United States would go in escalating the conflict with Iran , according to a former George W Bush administration official .
J Scott Carpenter , who was then deputy assistant secretary of state in the State Department ’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs , recalled in an interview that senior Defense Department ( DoD ) officials and the Joint Chiefs used the escalation issue as the main argument against the Cheney proposal .
McClatchy newspapers reported last August that Cheney had proposal several weeks earlier “ launching airstrikes at suspected training camps in Iran ” , citing two officials involved in Iran policy .
According to Carpenter , who is now at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy , a strongly pro-Israel think - tank , Pentagon officials argued that no decision should be made about the limited airstrike on Iran without a thorough discussion of the sequence of events that would follow an Iranian retaliation for such an attack .
Carpenter said the DoD officials insisted that the Bush administration had to make “ a policy decision about how far the administration would go – what would happen after the Iranians would go after our folks ” .
The question of escalation posed by DoD officials involved not only the potential of Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Iraq to attack , Carpenter said , but possible responses by Hezbollah and by Iran itself across the Middle East .
Carpenter suggested that DoD officials were shifting the debate on a limited strike from the Iraq - based rationale , which they were not contesting , to the much bigger issue of the threat of escalation to full - scale war with Iran , knowing that it would be politically easier to thwart the proposal on that basis .
The former State Department official said DoD “ knew that it would be difficult to get interagency consensus on that question ” .
The Joint Chiefs were fully supportive of the position taken by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on the Cheney proposal , according to Carpenter .
“ It ’s clear that the military leadership was being very conservative on this issue , ” he said .
At least some DoD and military officials suggested that Iran had more and better options for hitting back at the United States than the United States had for hitting Iran , according to one former Bush administration insider .
Former Bush speechwriter and senior policy adviser Michael Gerson , who had left the administration in 2006 , wrote a column in the Washington Post on July 20 , 2007 , in which he gave no hint of Cheney ’s proposal , but referred to “ options ” for striking Iranian targets based on the Cheney line that Iran “ smuggles in the advanced explosive devices that kill and maim American soldiers ” .
Gerson cited two possibilities : “ Engaging in hot pursuit against weapon supply lines over the Iranian border or striking explosives factories and staging areas within Iran . ”
But the Pentagon and the military leadership were opposing such options , he reported , because of the fear that Iran has “ escalation dominance ” in its conflict with the United States .
That meant , according to Gerson that , “ in a broadened conflict , the Iranians could complicate our lives in Iraq and the region more than we complicate theirs ” .
Carpenter ’s account of the Pentagon ’s position on the Cheney proposal suggests , however , that civilian and military opponents were saying that Iran ’s ability to escalate posed the question of whether the United States was going to go to a full - scale air war against Iran .
Pentagon civilian and military opposition to such a strategic attack on Iran had become well - known during 2007 .
But this is the first evidence from an insider that Cheney ’s proposal was perceived as a ploy to provoke Iranian retaliation that could used to justify a strategic attack on Iran .
The option of attacking nuclear sites had been raised by Bush with the Joint Chiefs at a meeting in “ the tank ” at the Pentagon on December 13 , 2006 , and had been opposed by the Joint Chiefs , according to a report by Time magazine ’s Joe Klein last June .
After he become head of the Central Command ( Centcom ) in March 2007 , Admiral William Fallon also made his opposition to such a massive attack on Iran known to the White House , according Middle East specialist Hillary Mann , who had developed close working relationships with Pentagon officials when she worked on the National Security Council staff .
It appeared in early 2007 , therefore , that a strike at Iran ’s nuclear program and military power had been blocked by opposition from the Pentagon .
Cheney ’s proposal for an attack on IRGC bases in June 2007 , tied to the alleged Iranian role in providing both weapons – especially the highly lethal explosively formed projectiles ( EFPs ) – and training to Shi’ite militias appears to have been a strategy for getting around the firm resistance of military leaders to such an unprovoked attack .
Although the Pentagon bottled up the Cheney proposal in inter-agency discussions , Cheney had a strategic asset which could he could use to try to overcome that obstacle : his alliance with General David Petraeus .
As Inter Press Service reported earlier last week , Cheney had already used Petraeus ’ takeover as the top commander of US forces in Iraq in early February 2007 to do an end run about the Washington national security bureaucracy to establish the propaganda line that Iran was manufacturing EFPs and shipping them to the Mahdi Army militiamen .
Petraeus was also a supporter of Cheney ’s proposal for striking IRGC targets in Iran , going so far as to hint in an interview with Fox News last September that he had passed on to the White House his desire to do something about alleged Iranian assistance to Shi’ites that would require US forces beyond his control .
At that point , Fallon was in a position to deter any effort to go around DoD and military opposition to such a strike because he controlled all military access to the region as a whole .
But Fallon ’s forced resignation in March and the subsequent promotion of Petraeus to become Centcom chief later this year gives Cheney a possible option to ignore the position of his opponents in Washington once more in the final months of the administration .

Final proof that there 's a fetish for everyone : the Daleks , the genocidal cyborgs from Doctor Who , starred in their own porn video a few years ago — and it turns out those egg - whisk guns of theirs have a setting we never knew about .
Abducted By Daleks had barely gone on sale before the BBC sued and banned it out of existence .
Copies are now incredibly rare — but well worth hunting down , if only for the amusement value .
More NSFW evidence of surprising Dalek sexiness , after the jump .
After watching the movie , all the way through , it 's never entirely clear to me exactly why the Daleks want to capture healthy human women in stripper heels in the first place .
They make a huge show of " interrogating " the women , but never actually ask any questions .
It 's also not clear if they want to mate with these women — which would be quite out of character for the Daleks , who are obsessed with racial purity on Doctor Who .
Even when they finally accept human DNA , only one cell in a billion is worthy of cultivation .

Abducted starts with three women picking up a fourth ( who 's really a Dalek agent ) and then as they 're driving down the street , they run over a super - fake looking alien and their car is wrecked .
Even though there 's a woman - skinning serial killer at large , the four women wander off into the forest , split up and then decide to remove their clothes randomly .
And that 's when the Daleks grab them with their teleportation device .
I love the fact that the women do n't notice they 've been teleported to an alien spaceship and are surrounded by Daleks , until one Dalek makes a throat - clearing noise .
The interrogation does n't go very well , so first the Daleks bring in their sexy human agent , who dresses up like a dominatrix and threatens the women with a big bullwhip .
And then the Daleks set their ray guns on vibrate and train them on the women :
Note : I actually made three clips of Abducted , but decided to put up only two because so many people have mentioned a bug where all the videos start playing at once when they click through on a post .
Let me know if I should add an extra clip , or if the simultaneous launch issue would be too annoying .

It was at that point that the astonished surgeons noticed the man was beginning to breathe unaided again , his pupils were active , he was giving signs that he could feel pain - and finally , his heart started beating again .
Several weeks later , the man can walk and talk .
" This situation was a striking illustration of the questions that remain in the field of reanimation ... and what criteria can be used to determine that a reanimation has failed , " says a report on the case , published online by an ethics committee .
The case has stirred debate among medical professionals and daily newspaper Le Monde dedicated a full page to the subject under the headline : " The organ donor was n't dead . "
" What is under consideration here is the status of a person , whether they are a patient who can be reanimated or a potential [ organ ] donor , " said the ethics committee report .
The hospital where the man was treated is one of only nine in France that are allowed to perform organ transplants on patients in cardiac arrest , in very specific conditions , under a pilot program launched in last year .
Elsewhere , organ transplants are possible on other categories of patients under older rules .
The program , which was approved by the French agency in charge of bio-ethics , aims to help reduce the number of people waiting for a transplant by making it possible to take organs from new categories of patients .
Le Monde said more than 13,000 people were waiting for transplants in France and 231 people died last year as a direct result of the lack of a donor .
The newspaper said the pilot program had already yielded an extra 60 organs .
Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris ( AP - HP ) , a body that runs public hospitals in the Paris region , has set up a committee specifically to discuss ethical issues arising from the practice of transplants on people in cardiac arrest .
The committee , made up of medical professionals involved in the revival of heart attack patients as well as organ transplants , held lengthy discussions on the case of the man on February 19 and a summary was later published on the AP - HP website .
" During the meeting , other reanimators ... spoke of situations in which a person whom everyone was sure had died in fact survived after reanimation efforts that went on much longer than usual , " the minutes of the committee meeting say .
" Participants conceded that these were completely exceptional cases , but ones that were nevertheless seen in the course of a career . "

On the economic front , the news is “ ugly . ”
The nation ’s unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent in May — the biggest monthly rise since 1986 — as nervous employers cut 49,000 jobs .
The latest snapshot of business conditions showed a deeply troubled economy , with dwindling job opportunities in a time of continuing hardship in the housing , credit and financial sectors .
“ It was ugly , ” said Richard Yamarone , economist at Argus Research .
Of course , given the environment we ’re in , economic news has an immediate impact on the political landscape , and the McCain campaign was quick to issue a statement .
After noting that the rise in unemployment is a reminder of the “ challenges ” American families are facing , McCain said :
“ … [ W ]e must act now to support workers , families and employers alike .
This means getting our economy back on track by providing immediate tax relief , enacting a HOME plan to help those facing foreclosure , lowering health care costs , investing in innovation , moving toward energy independence and opening foreign markets to our goods .
These policies will help small businesses create the jobs that families need today .
The American people cannot afford more inaction from Washington .
“ The wrong change for our country would be an economic agenda based upon the policies of the past that advocate higher taxes , bigger government , government - run health care and greater isolationism .
To help families at this critical time , we cannot afford to go backward as Senator Obama advocates . ”
As if we needed another reminder of just how far gone McCain is when it comes to the economy , his campaign offers additional evidence .
So , the economy ’s in trouble and unemployment is surging .
McCain says we need to cut taxes again ( which has n’t managed to help so far ) , pass his housing plan ( written by a UBS lobbyist and created to help the industry , not families losing their homes ) , pass his healthcare plan ( which leaves millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions behind ) , invest in “ innovation ” ( though he ’s actually opposed to additional spending in the federal budget ) , promote energy independence ( despite his lacking any kind of energy policy ) , and more trade .
In other words , we need to keep doing exactly what we ’ve been doing .
More of the same .
Stay the course .
Stick to the policies that got us into this mess , and wait for them to stop failing .
It ’s bound to happen eventually .
I was especially amused by McCain ’s insistence that it would be “ wrong ” to pursue the economic policies of the “ past . ”
And when might that be ?
Does McCain mean the 1990s , when taxes were higher , unemployment was lower , growth was stronger , poverty was lower , and the deficit was non-existent ?
Is this the “ past ” McCain is anxious to avoid ?
“ [ W ]e can not afford to go backward as Senator Obama advocates , ” McCain insists .
But we can afford to stick with trickle - down voodoo economics ?
Can anyone actually take this nonsense seriously ?
This unique and revolting form of torture is a relic of the ancient days , and even then it appears to be rarely employed .
The method may be summarized as follows :
Two small boats of exactly the same size and shape are secured .
In one of them the victim was extended flat on his back , with his head , his hands and his feet all projecting over the sides .
The second boat was then turned upside down and fitted over the first .
In this way , the culprit 's body was enclosed within the two boats while his feet , hands and head were left outside .
Food was then offered , and in the event of it being refused , the victim was pricked or otherwise tormented until he complied with the request .
The next step consisted of filling his mouth and smearing his face with a mixture of milk and honey .
He was then exposed to the full glare of the sun .
In a short time , flies and insects began to settle on his face .
As the hours and then the days went by , the biting of the insects drove the prisoner to distraction .
And meanwhile , within the cavity made by the boats , nature pursuing her course , the accumulated excrement stunk to heaven and became a mass of corruption .
When death came , and the upper boat was removed , the flesh was found to be devoured and " swarms of noisome creatures preying upon and - as it were - growing to his inwards . "
kd Lang is Against Gay Marriage ( Photos )
Back on top of the world , 's new album Watershed is on fire .
Wondering what kd's thought 's were on gay marriage , I searched high and low to find her views and lo and behold , I found an interview that the singer recently did with
Liz asked Lang if she would consider getting married and she responded :
I 'm for civil partnerships ; I 'm not for gay marriage .
A friend of mine called that " aping the monkey " .
Watershed is her first collection of new songs since Invincible Summer which was recorded eight years ago .
The sounds are a mixture of jazz , country and Brazilian music and her best selling UK album in a decade .
Back in 1992 when it was n't " ok " to admit your sexuality , Lang came out as being a proud lesbian .
In the interview Lang gushed about the woman she calls her " wife " Jamie .
She 's extraordinarily supportive of me challenging myself .
She 's very wise and honest , an amazing person .

MIT helps inch towards the goal of fusion power
One of the most anticipated achievements in technology is electric energy production using nuclear fusion .
A virtually limitless fuel supply which " burns " without air pollution is the biggest reason , but there ’s also some excitement about the prospect of harnessing the power of the stars through determination and invention .
Current estimates range from about five years to never , and this can be frustrating to those who are looking forward to it .
The way to get the best possible answer is to ask someone who is working directly on the problem , so we contacted MIT 's Plasma Science & Fusion Center and were able to pose some questions to Noah Smick , one of their scientists working with their Alcator C - Mod Tokamak reactor .
Q. Your work at MIT has centered on magnetically confined
Alcator reactor - insert shows interior fusion , most recently using the Alcator C - Mod tokamak reactor .
In this machine you 're heating heavy hydrogen gas to an extremely high temperature plasma using radio waves , and then containing this plasma using very strong magnetic fields .
Are you achieving a steady fusion reaction or just analyzing the plasma behavior ?
Noah :
Our reactor is purely a research reactor .
It is designed to study the plasma physics of fusion and the basic operational issues .
It does not achieve sufficiently high temperatures and does not confine the particles for long enough to produce significant fusion reactions .
In addition , we do n't use the other hydrogen isotope ( tritium ) that would be required for significant fusion yield .
Tritium is very rare , expensive and radioactive and it is not necessary for studying the plasma physics of fusion .
( A power plant would have to breed tritium on site , a substantial technological undertaking ) .
The fusion power from D - D ( Deuterium - Deuterium ) reactions in our device is about 100 Watts ( yes , a light bulb ) .
If we included tritium the D - T fusion reactions would provide about 10kW .
A commercial power reactor by comparison would produce at least several GW ( billion Watts ) of fusion power .
We are also unable to produce steady plasmas for a long period of time due to a number of practical limitations .
Our plasma pulses last about 2 - 3 seconds , which is very long for a plasma but not useful for producing power .
Q . Do you have any means built into this reactor to capture the released energy from the plasma
Noah : No .
As stated previously , this is extremely small anyhow .
Q . What has your own work with this reactor focused on , and why did you choose that area of focus ?
reactor 's interior plasma Noah :
My work is focused on the use of electric probes to study conditions in the cool edge of the plasma .
This area is important because the edge plasma provides the boundary conditions for the core and affects the transfer of particles , energy and momentum in and out of the confined plasma .
Probes provide a simple way of sampling the plasma but are only useful in the unconfined edge region where the temperature and density of the plasma are sufficiently low to allow the probe to survive .
Even so , these probes must be rapidly inserted and retracted , remaining in the plasma only for a few hundredths of a second .
Q . Of what you 've learned so far , what was expected and what took you be surprise ?
Noah : I expected fusion to be a really interesting physics problem .
What took me by surprise was the scope and variety of cutting edge technologies required to operate a tokamak .
I 've gained exposure not just to the sciences of nuclear and plasma physics , but a lot of engineering disciplines with wide application .
Among them are magnets , cryogenics , vacuum , laser , accelerator , radio frequency and microwave technologies .
It 's a great field to be in .
Q. One of your other current projects is being called " Snapshots " because it records advanced types of images immediately after an implosion of a hydrogen fuel capsule by a high - powered laser .
According to your news office " the compressed gas reaches about 100 million degrees , or about seven times hotter than the center of the sun " , but it will not achieve fusion ignition .
Can you explain why you 're stopping short of the ignition process with these tests ?
Noah : Building an inertial confinement machine capable of producing ignition is an extremely expensive and technologically challenging undertaking .
Before attempting this , it was necessary to study inertial confinement methods at a smaller scale .
The MIT research is being conducted at the OMEGA laser facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester .
This machine is about the size of a football field and is still not capable of producing fusion ignition .
The National Ignition Facility , currently under construction at Lawrence Livermore National Lab aims to be the first machine to demonstrate ignition .
It is about four times the size of OMEGA .
Q. Nuclear fission seemed fairly easy to harness for generating electrical power .
By contrast , scientists have been working on nuclear fusion for a long time and many estimates put practical usage at another 50 or so years .
What are the main challenges that make fusion so much harder ?
Noah :
The challenges of fusion are many .
The fundamental reason for the difference from fission is that fusion requires the interaction of two charged particles rather than a charged particle and a neutral particle .
Charged particles repel each other , making fusion the reactions a great deal less likely to occur .
Fission also benefits from a ' chain reaction ' in the sense that the products of a fission instigate additional fissions .
Fusion enjoys no such benefit .
As a result of these drawbacks , fusion must be carried out under much more extreme conditions .
In the end the required system must integrate a large number of cutting edge technologies , including advanced superconducting magnets , powerful radio wave and microwave heating systems , advanced materials and cryogenics , all conducted under high vacuum and in the presence of intense neutron radiation .
The enabling technologies are just now becoming available and a great deal of work remains to be done to integrate them into a functioning reactor .
Noah Smick enjoys natural
fusion when not working Q. Besides our own Sun , the night sky is filled with billions and billions ( as Dr. Sagan would say ) of naturally occurring fusion reactors .
Is it that we 're trying to reproduce it on such a relatively small , confined scale that makes it so difficult for us ?
Noah :
While stars do form natural fusion reactors , they work in a completely different way than anything we can arrange on earth .
The plasma in a star is confined by its own gravity instead of magnetic fields .
The presence of a central force pulling the plasma inwards makes the star a great deal more stable than a terrestrial arrangement where the plasma is being pushed on from the outside .
Unfortunately , gravitational confinement can only work for a star - sized chunk of plasma .
That is , it does not scale down and is useless for a man made reactor .
The stars also enjoy another significant benefit .
They are large and dense enough that they are ' optically thick ' to their own radiation .
This means that most of the thermal radiation is not lost from the system , but is re-absorbed , keeping the star hot .
This allows the fusion burn to proceed ( albeit very slowly ) at much lower temperatures than we require for an earth - based system .
( The center of the sun is roughly 15 million degrees compared to a fusion power reactor which would be greater than 100 million ) .
The tenuous plasmas we can confine at high temperatures cannot hope to achieve optical thickness .
In fact , we are limited to a density about a million times less than that of air .
Q . When a contained and sustainable fusion reaction becomes feasible , which yields a net gain in energy , what do you imagine will be the most probable conversion method to electricity ?
Noah :
The high energy ( 14 MeV ) neutrons emitted by the D - T fusion will be absorbed in a ' blanket ' surrounding the reaction chamber .
During their absorption they will breed additional tritium fuel from lithium contained in the blanket .
The neutrons will also heat the blanket to high temperatures .
The heat will be removed with water , driving a conventional steam turbine to produce electricity .
Q. Will nuclear fusion power plants most likely be limited to large , base - load scale facilities that serve large populations , or do you imagine that the technology could scale down to something that could power an individual business or home ?
Noah :
The fusion energy schemes which seem the most likely to succeed do not scale down at all .
They will only be useful for very large ( > 1 GW - electric ) installations .
The lack of scalability is one of the challenges facing fusion researchers as it appears to be impossible to build a functioning power reactor at anything less than a massive scale .
Q . Do you have your own guess for how much longer practical fusion energy may take ?
Noah : I think the 30 - 50 year forecast is correct , assuming sustained government support .
However one could imagine technological innovations which would greatly accelerate things ( breakthroughs in superconducting magnet technology , for instance ) .
Q. Philo Farnsworth ( who developed television ) designed a machine called a fusor , which demonstrated an actual fusion process in the 1960s .
His machine used electrostatic charges to contain the fusion but was very limited and could never deliver a net gain in energy .
There has been a lot of talk recently about successful testing , and possibly using electrostatic confinement in the future .
Is your group doing any work in this direction and do you feel it has promise ?
Noah :
While a fusor ( along with a great deal of other methods ) can produce fusion reactions , it appears highly unlikely that electrostatic confinement can be used to create a productive fusion reactor .
The most obvious stumbling block is that a purely electrostatic device like a fusor requires its electrodes to be in direct contact with the hot plasma .
In a power reactor , no physical material could long withstand such a configuration .
More complicated hybrid systems which use combinations of magnetic and electrostatic confinement may be able to avoid this issue , but begin to suffer from the same problems as any magnetic confinement system ( e.g. , complicated and expensive ) .
No such configuration has yet demonstrated performance approaching that of a tokamak .
It is therefore not being pursued at MIT as a fusion energy candidate .
Q . What do you think are the most exciting near - term projects going on that people who are interested in fusion energy should be watching ?
Noah :
In my view the most exciting fusion project from the perspective of energy production is the international ' ITER ' project currently under construction in Cadarache , France .
ITER will be the world 's largest Tokamak , the result of a collaboration between the EU , Japan , the US , China , Korea , India and Russia .
It should be the first magnetic confinement device to demonstrate a burning plasma ( one that is sustained in large part by the heat from its own fusion reactions ) and the first fusion device to generate a net power gain .
While it will not have the necessary facilities for harvesting the power it produces , it is expected to produce 400 MW of fusion power , greatly exceeding anything that has been done previously .
It should also be able to operate for extended pulses ( many hours ) and possibly even in steady state .
It will be a great step towards practical fusion and should go a long way towards enabling a full scale demonstration power reactor .
Digging For Nazi Treasure German Treasure Hunters Claim to Have Found Amber Room
Has the Amber Room , the 18th - century chamber decoration the Nazis stole from the Soviet Union in World War II , finally been found ?
German treasure hunters say they may have solved the decades - old mystery .
“ Let the conversation begin , ” Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Jan. 20 , 2007 .
It ’s probably not going to end today .
But her campaign is , at noon in Washington .
For some of her supporters , the conversation is only just beginning , as both of the presumptive nominees pursue their votes .
The Times ’s Jodi Kantor looks at the lingering feelings of the women who passionately supported Mrs. Clinton in the primary , and finds that many of them still see her as their leader and have lasting frustrations with party leaders who tolerated what they perceive as a pervasive sexism in media discourse around the candidate .
The Washington Post ’s Monica Hesse examines the tendency of Democrats to examine , and self - examine , the ulterior motives behind their support of one candidate or the other :
It was a campaign of underlying meanings .
A campaign where people asked who you were voting for but really wanted to know who you were .
The two candidates are politically similar — so a strong preference for one must be because of something else , right ?
Over at The Los Angeles Times , Cathleen Decker looks at the potential of a female president in the future .
While Mrs. Clinton certainly did some things to pave the way , she finds , Mrs. Clinton ’s ambition might have been exceptional , and the “ mixed signals ” on gender roles ( remember “ testicular fortitude ? ” ) leave aspiring female candidates with no clear model .
Gloria Steinem , the feminist icon , recommended that Senator Barack Obama present an ambitious conversation - starter on sex akin to the one he offered on race .
Senator John McCain ’s campaign is taking a more lighthearted approach to chatting up these women , at least in a new blog it debuted last night , The McCain Report .
The latest entry says , “ Attention disaffected Hillary supporters , John McCain is a huge ABBA fan .
Seriously . ” Embedded is a YouTube video with the famous refrain :
If you change your mind , I ’m the first in line
Honey I ’m still free
Take a chance on me
Real subtle , guys .
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama did have a conversation of their own on Thursday night .
The Times ’s Jeff Zeleny has more details , along with a preview of the media deception to come as the candidates try to get below - the - radar face time with prospective running mates .
Much of the campaign conversation is also likely to revolve around the economy amid news about leaps in oil prices and unemployment and drops in the Dow , predict Jonathan Weisman and Robert Barnes in The Washington Post .
Mr. Obama faced criticism in the Middle East when he said on Wednesday , “ Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel , and it must remain undivided . ”
But then he attracted criticism from pro-Israel groups when he sought to clarify the remarks , which some saw as backtracking .
In any case , Republicans have used the issue to bring out the dreaded double - F word : “ flip - flop . ”
The campaigns also had dueling conference conversations with reporters about the Everglades on Friday .
As Mr. McCain toured the Everglades in Florida , the Obama campaign attacked him for a vote against a spending measure to protect the swampland .
Their debate was weedy .
Both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have championed campaign finance issues .
But The Times ’s Leslie Wayne looks at a what some are calling the last loophole in campaign finance : convention donations .
Elected Democratic officials have been calling on corporations — meeting with Wall Street executives and flying to San Diego , Philadelphia and Las Vegas — to raise the $ 40 million the party has budgeted for the convention , in August .
In return , these Democratic officials are promising corporate donors “ sponsor benefits packages ” that include private sessions with federal officeholders and other influential party leaders .
This search for cash comes as national party committees , like the D.N.C. , are barred from soliciting or spending soft money , the unrestricted donations to political parties .
But there is one major exception to these limits : the unlimited contributions from corporations and unions for the party ’s convention .
Even more , donations for the conventions , unlike other campaign contributions , are fully tax - deductible to corporations as a business expense .
( We ’ve excerpted from the part that talks about Democratic efforts , but as Ms. Wayne ’s article makes clear , this is happening with both parties ’ conventions . )
The Post has what we have to admit is a pretty cool , somewhat whimsical interactive timeline of the campaign .
As far as the future goes , Mr. Obama is looking forward to the 2016 Chicago Games .
Since my current job entails a great deal of technical writing , I constantly find myself struggling over the proper construction of certain grammatical statements .
Believe it or not , the basic English words “ Me ” , “ Myself ” , and “ I ” can become quite a challenge to incorporate properly .
Although these grammar errors are easily overlooked , I discover them in my own writing on a regular basis .
How many times have you made a statement constructed in the form of “ Angel and me ” , only to have some smarty pants correct you by explaining that it should be set up as “ Angel and I ” ?
The bottom line is that they may be wrong , but they could be right .
The bitch of it is … it can go either way .
It depends on whether you are the subject or the object of the statement .
So did “ Angel and I go to the concert ” or was it “ Angel and me ” ?
Just remove Angel from the equation .
I would n’t say “ Me went to the concert ” .
I would say “ I went to the concert ” .
So , it was in fact “ Angel and I ” who attended the concert .
But what if Angel handed out the concert tickets ?
Did “ Angel hand Sam and I the concert tickets ” ?
Or did “ Angel hand Sam and me the concert tickets ” ?
Well , Angel would n’t hand “ I ” a ticket , she would hand “ me ” a ticket .
So under this circumstance , it is correct to say “ Angel handed Sam and me the concert tickets ” .
If you want to step it up a notch by using the word “ Myself ” , you could use it to emphasize your point of view .
But , it should be neither the subject nor the object ( unless the object is the subject … example in a sec ) , and it is certainly not a substitute for “ Me ” or “ I ” .
You could say “ Wow !
I loved the concert , myself . ” or “ As the owner , I ( the subject ) am giving myself ( the object ) a large bonus . ”
But you would be incorrect in saying “ I have concert tickets for you and myself ” .
The previous sentence should read “ You and me ” .
Sorry for boring you .
I only wrote this out as a personal reminder to myself .
If it helps someone else , fantastic .
Well , a decade late and many dollars short , we seem to have become the conventional wisdom !
Would only that the _Economist_ had listened to our arguments , ...
Picture of hope :
How a 10 - year - old girl fought back after losing all her limbs to meningitis
Danielle Skilbeck was just four - years - old when she lost both her legs and her hands - but now she is celebrating her 10th birthday with as much energy as every other little girl .
She amazed doctors by returning from the brink of death after suffering from meningitis and has even discovered a love of cartwheels and headstands .
Brave Danielle has been determined not the let her disability get in the way as she splashes about in the pool and dances to pop music just like her friends .
Danielle Skilbeck with mum Lindsey Pollard , is celebrating her 10th birthday against all the odds .
She was just four when she had he legs and hand amputated
In 2002 the 10 - year - old spent five months in hospital when her body was ravaged by the virus .
Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary had to make the heartbreaking decision to amputate her legs below the knee to save her life .
Even then Danielle , of Otley , West Yorkshire , had to go back into hospital where surgeons removed her knees and later , her hands .
Since then , she has amazed the medical profession , friends and her family with her brave battle against the disability .
Her mother Lindsay Pollard , 25 , said : " The hardest thing to deal with was the fact that Danielle was so young , helping her to understand was a real challenge .
" As a little girl , she knew that your hair , your nails , even the grass , all grew back when you cut them .
" But making her understand the same would n't be happening with her legs was very difficult .
" Once she understood what was happening , the next thing we had to focus on was getting her generally moving again , because she was really sore all over . "
Danielle at two - and - a - half ( left ) before she was struck down by meningitis and spent five months in hospital
Just a year later , Danielle was rolling around and doing handstands - making a triangle with her head and arms to keep stable
And by age six she was swimming confidently .
She said : " I like to swim .
I like dancing to pop music and I like to do gym .
I can do cartwheels , handstands , splits and hurdles and high jump . "
Her mother added : " I 'm a great believer that if you think you can 't do something or you re not sure , you try .
" There 's nothing really that she can 't do because she adapts to everything .
" Swimming was a bit difficult to start with , but she 's overcome it and done it and with everything , that 's what Danielle 's done .
" My job is to encourage her to keep on . 
Brave Danielle was presented with a Child of Courage award in 2004 and met then Prime Minister Tony Blair before the ceremony in London .
Danielle does not let her disability get in the way and spends her days doing cartwheels and handstands
Next week surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary will trim her leg bone growth and tidy up her scar tissue in another major operation .
" I 've had quite a few operations , I cant remember how many , its loads ,  " said Danielle .
" I am a bit scared but I 'll be all right . "
Although the schoolgirl wears prosthetic legs , she finds it easier to remove them for her favourite activities .
Lindsay , who has five daughters and two stepsons with partner Trevor , said : " Her legs get thrown down with her schoolbag when she comes in .
" She uses both arms to tackle tasks like writing , and younger sister Tia helps out if shes struggling with fiddly jobs like putting toothpaste on her toothbrush . "
Lindsay said Danielle could decide when she is older whether she wanted surgery on her hands but added : " I hope she realises that she can do so much now . "

The # 2 Digg link at the moment is a lie worthy of Karl Rove : “ Obama to eliminate Iran . ”
Given the gap between what the article itself and the Digg description of it , I would n’t be surprised if it was Karl Rove or some Republican agent trying to sow dissatisfaction with Obama now that he has the nomination in the bag .
But what is worse is that so many people are accepting the premise of the link as true without even following the link .
Is n’t that just as bad as those idiots who read that Obama is a secret Muslim in an email and that :
We checked this out on ‘ snopes.com ‘ .
It is factual .
Check for yourself .
Any intelligent person who follows the link finds that Snopes has declared the story “ False . ”
Now , from the other side of the political spectrum , someone – whether a cynic who saw no difference between Gore and Bush and sees no difference between Obama and McCain – or a Republican operative posts an extremely misleading headline for a link that – if you follow it , leads you to a very different conclusion .
And the link becomes popular and lies are spread .
Some people even had time to post comments but not to follow the link !
As for the facts of what Obama said :
He certainly is more pro-Israel than many would like .
But he is also for talking with Iran .
I have only seen excerpts of Obama ’s speech – and I ’m not sure the full text is posted anywhere yet – but given that Obama ’s critique of McCain is that McCain is vowing to continue the Bush policy of refusing to engage in diplomacy with Iran , I ’d have to imagine Obama ’s remark was part of a message that went something like this – extrapolated from his previous statements :
I wo n’t stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq , but what ’s not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years – especially at a time when our military is overstretched , our nation is isolated , and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored .
One of those threats is the nuclear ambitions of Iran , the country that has gained the most influence and strength from the McCain - Bush foreign policy of waging war first and trying to pick up the pieces later .
Iran is stronger now than it was eight years ago .
On September 11 , 2001 there were vigils in Tehran as thousands of men and women crowded the streets in solidarity with the citizens of New York City and Washington , D.C.
As our nation prepared to invade Afghanistan to go after the terrorists who attacked us , Iran offered us substantial assistance .
As a result of these positive encounters , the Iranian leadership sent President Bush a letter offering to resolve all of the outstanding issues between our countries .
The letter went unanswered .
After seven years of McCain - Bush aggression , Iran has moved away from the United States , but it ’s people still maintain an affection for this country if not for our recent actions towards them .
I have committed myself to engage in diplomatic relations with Iran without preconditions .
I believe it is a sign of strength to sit down with our enemies rather than ignoring them .
I do not pretend that this will be easy .
But it is essential that we try .
We must eliminate the threat from Iran and protect the state of Israel .
We must stop Iran from gaining nuclear weapons .
The McCain - Bush policy of war and aggression is not the answer .
But I must warn anyone who would test my resolve on this issue : I am not opposed to all wars ; just to dumb wars , and I will not hesitate to respond forcefully if Israel ’s or America ’s existence is threatened .
But it ’s easier just to post some sensationalist headline .

BlackBerry Giving Encryption Keys to Indian Government
RIM encrypts e-mail between BlackBerry devices and the server the server with 256 - bit AES encryption .
The Indian government does n’t like this at all ; they want to snoop on the data .
RIM ’s response was basically :
That ’s not possible .
The Indian government ’s counter was :
Then we ’ll ban BlackBerries .
After months of threats , it looks like RIM is giving in to Indian demands and handing over the encryption keys .
EDITED TO ADD ( 5/27 ) : News :
BlackBerry vendor Research - In - Motion ( RIM ) said it cannot hand over the message encrytion key to the government as its security structure does not allow any ‘ third party ’ or even the company to read the information transferred over its network .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/2 ) : Looks like they have resolved the impasse .

We 're obliged to Michael Moran over at the Times for alerting us to a good piece of work by Ain’t It Cool who spotted this provocative movie poster in the background of Will Smith vehicle I am Legend :
The release date for the film is apparently 15 May 2010 , although despite fanboy speculation that the image might be a viral marketing play for a long - awaited Gotham - Metropolis hook - up , Moran reckons it 's " just a sight gag from producer Akiva Goldsman who was at one involved in the Superman / Batman movie project which has been stuck in development hell for some years now " .
Moran notes : " Rumours of a Batman / Superman movie have been at their strongest since the recent rejuvenation of the two movie franchises but neither Christian Bale nor Brandon Routh are currently attached to the project . " ®
Joe Biden Calls President Bush ’s Speech to Israel Bullshit
Today President Bush spoke to Israel at the Knesset , and said the following :
“ some people ” believe the United States “ should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along . ”
“ We have heard this foolish delusion before , ” Bush said .
“ As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ‘ Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ”
Needless to say , this drew the ire of the left who just assumed he was referring to Barack Obama .
They came out in full force against President Bush today .
Joe Biden even called the president ’s remarks bullshit .
“ This is bullshit , this is malarkey .
This is outrageous , for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country , to sit in the Knesset … and make this kind of ridiculous statement . ”
Some others who lambasted the president were Hillary Clinton , John Kerry , Harry Reid , Dick Durbin , and Barack Obama .
Here is what they had to say .
John Kerry :
Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) said that Bush “ is still playing the disgusting and dangerous political game Karl Rove perfected , which is insulting to every American and disrespectful to our ally Israel .
George Bush should be making Israel secure , not slandering Barack Obama from the Knesset . ”
Harry Reid :
“ Not surprisingly , the engineer of the worst foreign policy in our nation ’s history has fired yet another reckless and reprehensible round , ” said Reid .
“ For the President to make this statement before the government of our closest ally as it celebrates a remarkable milestone demeans this historic moment with partisan politics . ”
Dick Durbin :
“ There is no escaping what the president is doing , ” said Durbin , who supports Obama .
“ It is an attack on Sen . Obama ’s position that we should not be avoiding even those we disagree with when it comes to negotiations and diplomacy . ”
Durbin called Bush ’s remarks “ unfair and really unfortunate . ”
Hillary Clinton :
President Bush ’s comparison of any Democrat to Nazi appeasers is both offensive and outrageous on the face of it , especially in light of his failures in foreign policy .
This is the kind of statement that has no place in any presidential address and certainly to use an important moment like the 60th anniversary celebration of Israel to make a political point seems terribly misplaced .
Unfortunately , this is what we ’ve come to expect from President Bush .
The list goes on and on .
Was n’t it Hillary Clinton that has been criticizing Obama for his willingness to talk to terrorists without any pre-conditions ?
I think so .
I do find it ironic however , that Hillary Clinton mentions comparing Democrats to Nazi appeasers , and is appalled .
You know what appalls me ?
When Dick Durbin , who also threw in his two cents , compared our military to Nazis and Pol Pot.
HE COMPARED OUR SOLDIERS TO NAZIS , and that is forgotten .
“ If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control , you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis , Soviets in their gulags , or some mad regime — Pol Pot or others — that had no concern for human beings .
Sadly , that is not the case .
This was the action of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners . ”
You know what else offends me ?
When John Kerry , who also chimed in today , claimed that our soldiers were terrorizing Iraqis .
“ And there is no reason , Bob , that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night , terrorizing kids and children
Oh the hypocrisy of the left , it makes for great fodder .
But the immediate response by Obama and the rest of the high ranking left has to make you wonder .
Do they feel guilty about something ?
Why did they all just assume that the president was talking about Barack Obama ?
Do they think that what the president said was true about Barack Obama ?
It sounds to me as though the Democrats have many private reservations about nominating Barack Obamaas he is perceived as very weak on national security .
This over reaction just shows us how sensitive the Democrats are about their glaring weakness when it comes to national security .
As far as Joe Biden calling the President ’s remarks bullshit , remember he left us with this glittering jewel when describing Barack Obama not all that long ago .
“ I mean , you got the first mainstream African - American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy , ”
Nice huh ?
The first articulate , bright , and clean African - American .
Could you imagine the uproar if President Bush had used those terms to describe Barack Obama ?
With all that said , President Bush was throwing a dart at the Democrats in general , and it must have hit home if it drew the kind of reaction that it did .
Maybe they need to look into the mirror .

Here 's some information on overpopulation for anyone who 's interested :
The current human population is roughly 6.67 billion people worldwide ( according to the U.S. Census Bureau ) .
Resource depletion increases along with the population .
The energy crisis is easily explainable using Harvard professor John Holdren 's formula for finding energy consumption : E = P x e ( where E = total energy use , P = population , e = energy use per capita ) .
As societies become more developed , population growth increases as technology advances - and energy consumption increases as well .
For example , in terms of oil use , adding one person to the US is akin to adding 15 in China .
Energy is only the tip of the iceberg , however .
Productive land is also shrinking , as deserts are spreading due to overstocking grasslands and over plowing land .
In China , 1,400 square miles of ( at least partially ) fertile land were lost to desert annually by 2000 .
Rising sea levels due to burning fossil fuels also shrinks available land - this century seas may rise 4 to 35 inches , however with the explosion in fossil fuel burning the number could be far greater .
The Greenland ice sheet is thawing , and if it were to melt it would raise sea levels by 23 feet ( 7 meters ) .
To put this in perspective , a one meter rise would destroy cropland in many of the deltas and flood - plains of Thailand , Vietnam , India , Indonesia , and China .
7 meters would displace cities worldwide .
The population is growing at an alarming rate - in the US , another person is born every 11 seconds .
This is significant because the average American consumes 20 times as much in natural resources as the average African , and consumes as much oil as 15 Chinese .
The US has only 5 % of the world 's population yet accounts for almost a quarter of global emissions .
Now imagine if China catches up in terms of technology and natural resource use .
If every nation consumed as much resources as the US , the world could only support 1.8 billion people ( roughly the population in 1915 ) .
Dr. Eric Pianka has done several seminars regarding overpopulation and the dangers of it ; quite often conspiracy theorists claimed he advocated mass killings to reduce the population to further a " new world over " .
Even though he never made such a proposition - he was attacked by those who do n't want to face the facts .
Here 's a link to his site with a video on overpopulation ( if you do n't have 25 minutes to spare to see the whole thing , there 's a shorter one that gets the basic idea across ) :
http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~varanus/ movies.html
What can be done to somehow moderate this population explosion ?
Or , more specifically , what peaceful actions can we take ?
What nonviolent policies will be effective in controlling population growth ?
Or is this too taboo of a subject to discuss , and you would rather ignore the issue ?
Some animals regulate their fertility if food becomes scarce - why can't we do the same ?
I have some ideas of my own but I 'd like to hear other people 's thoughts on the subject .

This list of extraordinary human abilities was inspired The Top 10 Tips to Improve Your Memory when I began thinking about how some people are blessed ( or cursed , depending on your point of view ) with the ability to recall a scene as if they were looking at a photograph .
And how other people can recreate music from memory , such as Mozart ’s famed reproduction of Gregorio Allegri ’s Miserere after one hearing .
What other extraordinary abilities might humans have ?
I ’ve listed nine of the most well understood ( i.e. not paranormal or ‘ fringe science ’ ) and interesting abilities rated from most common to most interesting and rare .
Bear in mind that most of these unusual abilities are genetic and cannot be controlled by the person affected but are an inherent quality of their physical self .
Read more here about human senses .
9 Supertasters
People who experience taste with greater intensity than the rest of the population are called supertasters .
Having extra fungiform papillae ( the mushroom shaped bumps on the tongue that are covered in taste buds ) is thought to be the reason why these people have a stronger response to the sensation of taste .
Of the five types of taste , sweet , salty , bitter , sour , and umami , a supertaster generally finds bitterness to be the most perceptible .
Scientists first noticed the differing abilities of people to taste a known compound when a DuPont chemist called Arthur Fox asked people to taste Phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) .
Some people could taste its bitterness ; some could n’t – whether people could depended on their genetic make - up ( a variant of this test is now one of the most common genetic tests on humans ) .
While about 70 % of people can taste PTC , two thirds of them are rated as medium and only one third ( approximately 25 % of the wider population ) are supertasters .
Supertasters will often dislike certain foods , particularly bitter ones , such as brussel sprouts , cabbage , coffee , and grapefruit juice .
Women , Asians , and Africans are most likely to have the increased number of fungiform papillae that make them supertasters .
8 Absolute pitch
People with absolute pitch are capable of identifying and reproducing a tone without needing a known reference .
It is not simply a better ability to hear but the ability to mentally class sounds into remembered categories .
Examples of this include identifying the pitch of everyday noises ( e.g. horns , sirens , and engines ) , being able to sing a named note without hearing a reference , naming the tones of a chord , or naming the key signature of a song .
Doing any of these is a cognitive act – it requires one to remember the frequency of each tone , be able to label it ( e.g. ‘ A ’ , ‘ C # ’ , or ‘ F - flat ’ ) , and sufficient exposure to the range of sound within each label .
Opinions vary as to whether absolute pitch is genetic or a learned ability that is strongly influenced to one ’s exposure to music at crucial developmental stages – much like how a child ’s ability to identify colors by their frequency depends on the type and level of their exposure to it .
Estimates of the portion of the population having absolute pitch range from 3 % of the general population in the US and Europe to 8 % of those ( from the same areas ) who are semi-professional or professional musicians .
In music conservatories in Japan however , about 70 % of musicians have absolute pitch .
Part of the reason for this significantly larger percentage may be because absolute pitch is more common among people who grew up in a tonal ( Mandarin , Cantonese , and Vietnamese ) or pitch accent ( Japanese ) language environment .
Absolute pitch is also more common in those who are blind from birth , have William ’s Syndrome , or have an autism spectrum disorder .
7 Tetrachromacy
Tetrachromacy is the ability to see light from four distinct sources .
An example of this in the animal kingdom is the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) , which can see light from the red , green , blue , and ultraviolet sections of the light spectrum .
True tetrachromacy in humans is much rarer however – according to Wikipedia only two possible tetrachromats have been identified .
Humans are normally trichromats , having three types of cone cells that receive light from either the red , green , or blue part of the light spectrum .
Each cone can pick up about 100 graduations of color and the brain combines colors and graduations so that there are about 1 million distinguishable hues coloring your world .
A true tetrachromat with an extra type of cone between red and green ( in the orange range ) would , theoretically , be able to perceive 100 million colors .
Like supertasting , tetrachromacy is thought to be much more common in women than men – estimates range from 2 – 3 % to 50 % of women .
Interestingly , colour - blindness in men ( much more common than in women ) may be inherited from women with tetrachromacy .
6 Echolocation
Echolocation is how bats fly around in dark forests – they emit a sound , wait for the echo to return , and use that sound of the echo in each ear plus the return time to work out where an object is and how far away .
Surprisingly ( well , maybe not on this list ! ) , humans are also capable of using echolocation .
Use of echolocation is probably restricted to blind people because it takes a long time to master and heightened sensitivity to reflected sound .
To navigate via echolocation a person actively creates a noise ( e.g. tapping a cane or clicking the tongue ) and determines from the echoes where objects are located around them .
People skilled at this can often tell where an object is , what size it is , and its density .
Because humans cannot make or hear the higher pitched frequencies that bats and dolphins use they can only picture objects that are comparatively larger than those ‘ seen ’ by echolocating animals .
People with the ability to echolocate include James Holman , Daniel Kish , and Ben Underwood .
Perhaps the most remarkable and well - documented of cases is the story of Ben Underwood , who lost both his eyes to retinal cancer at the age of three .
He is shown in the video above ( warning : the scene where he puts in his prosthetic eyeballs may be a bit disturbing for some ) .
5 Genetic Chimerism
In the Iliad Homer described a creature having body parts from different animals , a chimera , from this mythological monster comes the name of the genetic equivalent – chimerism .
Genetic chimerism , or tetragametism , in humans and other animals happens when two fertilized eggs or embryos fuse together early in pregnancy .
Each zygote carries a copy of its parents DNA and thus a distinct genetic profile .
When these merge , each population of cells retains its genetic character and the resulting embryo becomes a mixture of both .
Essentially , a human chimera is their own twin .
Chimerism in humans is very rare ; Wikipedia states that there are only about 40 reported cases .
DNA testing is often used to establish whether a person is biologically related to their parents or children and can uncover cases of chimerism when DNA results show that children are not biologically related to their mothers – because the child inherited a different DNA profile to the one shown by a blood test .
This is what happened in the case of Lydia Fairchild : DNA tests of herself and her children led the state to think that she was not actually their mother .
People born with chimerism typically have immune systems that make them tolerant to both genetically distinct populations of cells in their body .
This means that a chimera has a much wider array of people to choose from should they need an organ transplant .
4 Synesthesia
Imagine consistently associating numbers or letters with certain colours , or hearing a specific word which triggers a particular sensation of taste on your tongue .
These are two forms of a neurological condition called synesthesia .
Synesthesia is when stimulation of a particular sensory or cognitive pathway leads to an involuntary ( i.e. synesthesia is not learnt ) response in other sensory or cognitive pathways .
Synesthesia is most often genetic and the grapheme ( letters , numbers , or other symbols ) to colour form of synesthesia is the commonest .
Other synesthetes can experience special - sequence synesthesia ( e.g. where dates have a precise location in space ) , ordinal linguistic personification ( when numbers have personalities ) , or sound to colour synesthesia ( where tones are perceived as colours ) .
Although synesthesia is a neurological condition it should n’t be thought of as a disorder , because generally it does not interfere with a person ’s ability to function .
Most people are not even aware that their experiences of life elicit more sensory responses than other peoples might and the ones that are rarely consider synesthesia to have a negative impact on their lives .
Predictions of the percentage of people with synesthesia vary widely , from 1 in 20 to 1 in 20,000 .
Studies from 2005 and 2006 , using a random population sample , suggested 1 in about 23 people have synesthesia .
Examples of people with synesthesia include the author Vladimir Nabokov , composer Olivier Messiaen , and scientist Richard Feynman .
Daniel Tammet , who is mentioned in the next section of this list , is a synesthete ( in addition to being a mental calculator ) who sees numbers with shapes and texture .
3 Mental calculators
The most extraordinary group of people adept at performing complex mental calculations is those who are also autistic savants .
While there are many trained people who can work out multiplications of large numbers ( among other calculations ) in their head extremely fast – mostly mathematicians , writers , and linguists – the untrained ability of autistic savants is the most interesting .
The majority of these people are born with savant syndrome ( only an estimated 50 % of people with savantism are also autistic ) , which is still poorly understood , few develop it later in life , usually due to a head injury .
There are less than 100 recognised prodigious savants in the world and of the savants with autism who are capable of using mental calculation techniques there are even less .
Recent research has suggested that a blood flow to the part of the brain responsible for mathematical calculations of six to seven times the normal rate is one of the factors that enables mental calculators to work out math much faster than the average person .
Examples of people with extraordinary calculation skills include Daniel McCartney , Salo Finkelstein , and Alexander Aitken .
Daniel Tammet is one of few who are also autistic savants .
2 Eidetic memory
When a person has photographic memory or total recall this is called eidetic memory .
It is the ability to recall sounds , images , or objects from one ’s memory with extreme accuracy .
Examples of eidetic memory include the effort of Akira Haraguchi who recited from memory the first 100,000 decimal places of pi and the drawings of Stephen Wiltshire ( who is also an autistic savant ) – his recreation of Rome is shown in the video above .
Kim Peek , the inspiration for the autistic ( Peek is not actually autistic though ) character of Raymond Babbit in the movie Rainman , also possesses eidetic memory – among other things he can recall some 12,000 books from memory .
Whether true photographic memory exists in adults is still a controversial issue , but it is accepted that eidetic abilities are distributed evenly between men and women .
One also cannot become an eidetiker through practice .
1 Immortal cells
There is only one known case of a person having immortal cells ( cells that can divide indefinitely outside of the human body , defying the Hayflick Limit ) and that is of a woman named Henrietta Lacks .
In 1951 , 31 year old Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer , which she died from within the year .
Unknown to her and her family ( i.e. without informed consent ) a surgeon took a tissue sample from her tumor that was passed on to a Dr. George Gey .
A scientist for the John Hopkins University Tissue Culture Laboratory , Gey propagated Lacks ’ tissue sample into an immortal cell line – the HeLa cell line ( pictured above ) .
The cells from Lacks ’ tumour have an active version of the telomerase enzyme ( telomerase is the mechanism by which cells age or are aged ) and proliferate abnormally fast .
On the day of Henrietta Lacks ’ death , Dr. Gey announced to the world that a new age in medical research had begun – one that might provide a cure for cancer .
HeLa cells were utilised in 1954 by Jonas Salk to develop the cure for polio .
Since then they ’ve been used in researching cancer , AIDS , the effects of radiation and toxic substances , and for mapping genes , among other things .
Today , the HeLa cells are so common in laboratories that they contaminate many other cell cultures and have rendered some biological studies invalid through their presence .
There are also more HeLa cells alive today than when Henrietta Lacks was alive – they outweigh her physical mass by many times .
Tragically , Lacks was never told of the immensely valuable contribution her cells made to science and her family was not informed until many years later that her cells were being used for research purposes ( a 1990 court ruling later verified Lacks ’ hospital as the owner of her discarded tissue and cells ) .
I highly recommend reading this story for a better picture of Henrietta Lacks ’ life and the consequences of her cancer .
DirecTV DVR owners got some bad news from the satellite TV provider recently when the company announced that it will break some of the existing functionality of the DVRs .
Effective April 15 , subscribers will only have 24 hours to watch pay - per- view movies recorded to their DVRs .
Once the movies are purchased , the clock starts ticking , and after 24 hours , the PPV movie saved to your DVR will become nothing more than an unreadable collection of zeros and ones .
In its announcement , the company laid the blame for the new policy at the feet of Big Content .
" Major movie studios have required that satellite and cable providers alike may no longer allow their customers to view these recordings for longer than 24 hours , " reads the announcement .
" During the 24 - hour viewing period , you will continue to enjoy all of your DVR features such as pause and rewind . "
PPV special events like sporting events and PPV movies purchased prior to April 15 are not affected by the new policy .
DRM is n't dying in the world of video
While extremely disappointing , the move is not all that surprising .
DirecTV and the movie studios will argue that the new policy is in line with online rental services such the iTunes Store and Xbox Live .
Both of them offer high - definition movie rentals with a limited viewing window .
In the case of the Apple TV and iTunes content , viewers have 30 days to start watching the movie and 24 hours to finish watching once they hit play for the first time .
But DirecTV is taking away something that its customers are used to having : unlimited time to watch their rentals .
And unsurprisingly , these new restrictions do n't come with lower prices .
Back in 2005 , a handful of TiVo owners were upset to find that some of the programming on their DVRs was being deleted due to what turned out to be a content restriction bug .
That 's all it was , a bug , but it served as an unnerving reminder that the programming stored on our DVRs may not always be under our full control .
With cable and satellite companies generally providing both the programming and the DVRs , they ultimately have tremendous power to control what subscribers do with the shows they record .
DirecTV's move , whether forced by the studios are not , is another indication of what DRM is really all about : the ability to strictly control how we consume content , not fighting piracy .
How does reducing the window of viewing fight piracy ?
It does n't !
In fact , it only encourages it .
Content stored on a DirecTV DVR is locked down tighter than a SuperMax prison after visiting hours , so piracy does n't even enter the equation here .
What the move is intended to do is drive additional rentals and protect DVD and Blu-ray sales .
By limiting the PPV window to 24 hours , DirecTV and the studios can prevent customers from indefinitely storing movies for repeated viewing .
So if you want to watch that Hollywood blockbuster after the 24 - hour PPV windows expires , you 'll have to reorder it , head down to the video rental shop ( brick and mortar or online ) , or buy physical media .
If you want to watch it twice , you 'll have to pay twice .
Or , you 'll do what millions already do , and go straight to BitTorrent .
The move is another indication of Big Content 's shortsightedness when it comes to competing with piracy .
Like it or not , they still have to compete with free .
DVRs are great for that , because they save content in a format that 's easy to use and can be watched on the device of choice ( your TV ) .
Now , DirecTV and Big Content are crippling the DVR , meaning that people who want to recapture the convenience and control over the content will have to turn to BitTorrent and USENET .
Meanwhile , was it much of a threat that people would build giant movie collections on their DVRs ?
We do n't think so .
Even a hacked TiVo is easy to fill up with new shows and new content .
What 's also worrisome is that this DRM is meant to mark the beginning of a whole new world of content restriction .
Imagine if the same restriction was applied to premium programming like that from HBO .
Worse , for parents of small children ( like me ) who squirrel away copies of Disney programming on their DVRs for a rainy day , what if that copy of Fox and the Hound that we recorded a month ago suddenly became unplayable ?
It 's not outside the realm of possibility ... and there 's little stopping satellite and cable programmers from doing it .
But the move will drive piracy , as many readers pointed out when they wrote in complaining about this story .
Hollywood will act surprised , but there 's no way they can be .
Full disclosure : I 'm a DirecTV DVR owner .

The staff in the embassy will be at a bare minimum with only four US citizens remaining as relations between Washington and the former Soviet republic hit a new low over the country 's human rights records and sanctions imposed by the US .
Last month , Belarus ordered 10 US diplomats to leave because Washington had not complied with a demand to reduce the staff at the Minsk embassy from 17 to six .
" All 11 diplomats , 10 of whom were declared persona non grata , together with their families have left Belarussian territory and entered Lithuania , " a representative of the embassy who travelled with the diplomats told the Reuters news agency .
Aleksander Lukashenko , Belarus ' authoritarian president , declared the US State Department employees " persona non grata " on Wednesday .
Sanctions row
A Belarus police officer patrols near the US Embassy in Minsk
Already - bad relations between Minsk and the US began plummeting in November after Washington hit Belarus ' national energy company Belneftekhim with targeted trade sanctions as punishment for Lukashenko's poor human rights record .
In March , Belarus asked the US ambassador to leave after Washington issued a clarification of US sanctions that apply to the national oil products firm Belneftekhim .
Belarus said the move amounted to an expansion of sanctions , although Washington denies that .
Lukashenko , who has been in power since 1984 , is considered by many one of the last dictators in Europe .
He has long faced allegations of crushing dissent , including freedom of speech and assembly .
He has been barred from the United States and the European Union over accusations that he rigged his 2006 re-election .
In the epic " Odyssey , " one of the cornerstones of Western literature , the legendary Greek hero Odysseus returns to his queen Penelope after enduring 10 years of sailing the wine dark sea .
Now scientists have pinned down his return to April 16 , 1178 B.C. , close to noon local time , according to astronomical references in the epic poem that seem to pinpoint the total eclipse of the sun on the day that Odysseus supposedly returned on .
The " Odyssey " is a millennia - old epic said to be composed by the blind poet Homer .
In modern times , the " Odyssey " is typically seen as fiction .
Still , Homer 's earlier epic , the " Iliad , " was centered on the war against Troy , and scientists first uncovered physical evidence of Troy in the 19th century .
This has long raised questions as to what other historical facts the epics might refer to .
In the " Odyssey , " after the decade - long Trojan War , King Odysseus of the island Ithaca contends with monsters and witches after he draws the wrath of the sea god Poseidon .
After he finally returns home , Odysseus slays more than 100 unruly suitors all of whom wish to marry Penelope .
Blood red
The possible solar eclipse comes up in the 20th book of the " Odyssey , " as the suitors begin their final lunch .
At this point , the goddess of war Athena " confounds their minds , " making the suitors laugh uncontrollably and see their food spattered with blood .
The seer Theoclymenus then foresees the death of the suitors , ending by saying , " The sun has been obliterated from the sky , and an unlucky darkness invades the world . "
The Greek historian Plutarch suggested the prophecy of Theoclymenus referred to a solar eclipse .
More recently , astronomers Carl Schoch and Paul Neugebauer computed in the 1920s that a total solar eclipse occurred over the Ionian islands — of which Ithaca is one — about noon on April 16 , 1178 B.C. , and would have coincided roughly a decade before the most often cited estimate for the sack of Troy — about 1190 B.C .
Still , a great deal of skepticism remains over whether Theoclymenus refers to this or any eclipse .
To shed light on the issue , researchers Marcelo Magnasco and Constantino Baikouzis at Rockefeller University in New York decided to analyze other passages in the " Odyssey " for astronomical references without assuming an eclipse .
The scientists first created a rough chronology of events depicted in the " Odyssey . "
First , 29 days before the supposed eclipse and the massacre of the suitors , three constellations are mentioned as Odysseus sets out from the island of Ogygia , where he has spent seven years as a captive of the beautiful nymph Calypso .
Odysseus is told to watch the Pleiades and late - setting Boötes and keep the Great Bear to his left .
Next , five days before the supposed eclipse , Odysseus arrives in Ithaca as the Star of Dawn — that is , Venus — rises ahead of the sun .
Finally , the night before the eclipse , there is a new moon .
Also , the messenger of the gods , Hermes , is sent west to Ogygia by the king of the gods Zeus to release Odysseus and then immediately returns back east roughly 34 days before the eclipse .
The researchers conjecture this trip refers to an apparent turning point of the motion of the planet Mercury .
( Mercury was the Roman name for Hermes . )
Backward planet
Mercury completes its orbit around the sun in just roughly 88 days , compared with the year it takes Earth to do so .
This means that Mercury and Earth are somewhat like two cars moving along separate lanes of a racetrack at different speeds .
The effect of these motions is that Mercury occasionally appears to go backward or retrograde in the sky from our point of view , Magnasco explained .
This happens for roughly three weeks at a time , about three times a year .
The scientists then searched for potential dates that satisfied all these astronomical references close to the fall of Troy , which has over the centuries been estimated to have occurred between roughly 1250 to 1115 B.C.
From these 135 years , they found just one date satisfied all the references — April 16 , 1178 B.C. , the same date as the proposed eclipse .
" That 's just one day out of about 50,000 days , " Magnasco told LiveScience .
" If our findings are correct , it would be pretty spectacularly strange .
How could Homer have known about this eclipse , about planetary positions that happened some 100 years before him ?
If this is all true , it would change the timetable of what we think they knew about astronomy then . "
Homer , if he really existed , is said to have composed the " Odyssey " sometime near the end of the ninth century B.C .
Magnasco and Baikouzis detailed their findings online June 23 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

From a perspective of some six centuries later , it ’s pretty easy to see the revolution inherent in the idea of movable type and the printing press .
Once a hugely expensive endeavor confined to the scriptoriums of only super - wealthy patrons , book production was suddenly a fraction of the cost .
Books , once highly valued original works of art , could now be copied en-masse … once the valued property only of the rich , the printing press brought books , language , and learning within reach of the masses .
The first printing press was to books and literature what the first assembly line was to Ford and automobiles … the means to mass - produce what was once a unique work of art .
Through that mass production , the democracy of ideas took a huge step forward .
It ’s always dangerous to talk about current technology in such sweeping , grandiose ways .
With things like the printing press , we have the luxury of hindsight to guide our analysis , but current technology is a more tenuous matter .
Yet , over the past few years , a technology - based phenomenon has been spreading through the Internet , a phenomenon that perhaps speaks as fundamentally to the marketplace of ideas as the printing press .
If one of the main things we got from movable type was the ability to move scholarship and ideas to more and more people , then the huge rise of weblogs over the past few years is certainly achieving the same goal .
Through software like Movable Type , WordPress , and others , combined with open - source Web servers and ubiquitous internet connections in the western world , the act of publishing is slowly moving out of the concentrated hands of a few , and into the hands of everyone .
This not a debate about the end of books , but rather about a change in the way ideas can be distributed .
With online Web services like WordPress.com , blogspot.com and others offering free blogs to anyone with an Internet connection , knowledge of servers and domain names is n’t even necessary … anyone with something to say can have a platform to say it very easily and conveniently .
Even just a decade ago , presenting ideas to a mass market was concentrated in the hands of a very few , relatively speaking .
Ironically , the same mass - production that served to bring books and ideas to masses , over time mutated into an industry that limited the amount of input from the masses and thereby limited their participation in the marketplace of ideas to observers .
For good or for bad , blogs have changed all that .
Anyone with something to say can find a voice on the Web if they want it .
Finding your audience is a bit trickier perhaps , but people with something to say , and who say it well , typically find people to listen , as well .
No longer is there a huge publishing cost , editors , or marketers involved in publishing your ideas to mass audience .
Through blogs , the marketplace of ideas finally becomes a truly immersing experience for anyone who wants to participate .
Of course , that opens up a series of problems , along with the opportunities .
Some of the services the publishing industry provides are editing , quality control , and filtering .
Blogs are unfiltered and often unedited , which certainly opens us to the possibility of bad information and poor quality .
But one of the tricky parts of quality control , especially in something as tenuous as ideas , is that we all have a different notion of what constitutes good quality .
In the publishing industry , much of that quality selection goes on behind the scenes , outside the control of the public , except through their buying habits … with blogs , readers can seek out their own choices , and set their own standards of quality .
It ’s always difficult to predict what the future will hold … check out some of the posts over at Modern Mechanix for proof of that … but it seems clear that for the moment , blogs are changing the way we exchange ideas .
Back in the 15th century , Johannes Gutenberg moved the printed word and ideas out of the hands of the privileged few , and closer to the hands of the general public .
Now , in the first part of the 21st century , blog systems like WordPress are allowing more and more people not only to share the ideas of a few published writers , but of anyone who feels they have something to say .
The printing press gave the ideas of the select few to the general public , but blogs allow the general public to exchange ideas directly .
If that ’s not a step forward in the democracy of ideas , I do n’t know what might be .

KUWAIT  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed concern on Tuesday that former president Jimmy Carter ’s recent meeting with Hamas leader Khaled Meshal could confuse American efforts to broker a Palestinian - Israeli peace accord .
“ We wanted to make sure there would be no confusion and there would be no sense that Hamas was somehow a party to peace negotiations " between Israel and more moderate Palestinians , said Ms. Rice , speaking on the margins of an international meeting here on aid to Iraq .
Ms. Rice also affirmed that the State Department had explicitly advised Mr. Carter not to meet with Hamas , which the United States considers a terrorist group .
Mr. Carter told National Public Radio on Monday that he had not received a clear signal from the Bush administration before leaving on his Middle East tour last week .
“ We counseled President Carter against going to the region and particularly against having contacts with Hamas , ” Ms. Rice said , responding to questions from reporters .

The media has failed to cover the history of US war preparations directed against Iran .
News coverage of US sponsored war preparations in relation to Iran started to surface in early 2007 in scanty press reports .
Although confirmed by official military documents and reports , public opinion has largely been kept in the dark and misinformed on these war preparations .
A war on Iran has been envisaged since the mid-1990s as part of a strategic " sequencing " of theater operations .
During the Clinton administration , US Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) had formulated " in war theater plans " to invade first Iraq and then Iran :
" The broad national security interests and objectives expressed in the President ’s National Security Strategy ( NSS ) and the Chairman ’s National Military Strategy ( NMS ) form the foundation of the United States Central Command ’s theater strategy .
The NSS directs implementation of a strategy of dual containment of the rogue states of Iraq and Iran as long as those states pose a threat to U.S. interests , to other states in the region , and to their own citizens .
Dual containment is designed to maintain the balance of power in the region without depending on either Iraq or Iran .
USCENTCOM ’s theater strategy is interest - based and threat - focused .
The purpose of U.S. engagement , as espoused in the NSS , is to protect the United States ’ vital interest in the region – uninterrupted , secure U.S. / Allied access to Gulf oil . "
Consistent with CENTCOM ’s 1995 " sequencing " , the plans to target Iran were activated under TIRANNT ( Theater Iran Near Term ) in the immediate wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
TIRANNT consisted in a model scenario type analysis of a theater war directed against Iran .
The analysis , which involved senior military and intelligence experts , consisted in examining different theater scenarios .
" The US army , navy , air force and marines have all prepared battle plans and spent four years building bases and training for " Operation Iranian Freedom " .
Admiral Fallon , the new head of US Central Command [ resigned in March 2008 ] , has inherited computerized plans under the name TIRANNT ( Theatre Iran Near Term ) . "
( New Statesman , 19 Feb 2007 )
The following text ( in annex ) entitled Planned US Israeli Attack on Iran was published three years ago by Global Research in May 2005 .
It outlines the earlier phase of US - Israel war preparations in relation to Iran .
( See http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO505A.html)
While much of this analysis remains valid , military planning in relation to Iran is now in a much more advanced stage .
Moreover , the structure of military alliances underlying the Pentagon ’s war plans has also evolved .
NATO is now part of the military alliance .
Under NATO auspices , in liaison with the Pentagon , British , German , Turkish and French forces are slated to play a significant role in the case of an attack on Iran and Syria .
In this regard , it is worth noting that already in 2005 , NATO and Israel had established the basis of a far - reaching military cooperation agreement .
In turn , Turkey , which from a military standpoint constitutes a significant force within NATO , has a comprehensive bilateral military cooperation agreement with Israel .
According to military documents and statements , US , Israeli and allied forces are " in an advanced state of readiness " .
In fact much of the war planning had already reached that " advanced stage " in 2005 .
Several important variables come into play in assessing the possibility of an all out war on Iran .
" An advanced stage of readiness " to attack Iran does not signify that a war will actually occur .
A number of important countervailing factors must be addressed .
Saber Rattling
Apart from outright war , the US sponsored war preparations serve several other foreign policy objectives .
The threat of war coupled by advanced military preparedness are often used to bully countries into compliance , to oblige them to give up their sovereignty , to open up their economy to Western investors , to privatize and sell off their assets to American companies , etc .
These threats will only be effective if the country does not have the ability to defend itself militarily .
The strength of its national economy is also a major consideration .
The Sabre rattling is ongoing in relation to Iran .
The objective is ultimately to subdue Iran as a regional power and take possession of its oil wealth , which constitutes approximately ten percent of total world reserves .
What are Iran ’s military capabilities , namely its ability to defend itself and inflict damage on US and allied forces ?
The answer to this question involves essentially two aspects .
First , Iran has an advanced air defense system , using both Iranian and Russian technology .
Moreover , it has , according to Western military experts , perfected its ballistic missile capabilities to the extent that it is capable of inflicting significant damage on US and allied military installations in Iraq , the Persian Gulf and Israel .
Over the last few years , Iran has been actively preparing for a US sponsored attack .
Moreover , resulting from the surge in oil revenues , the Tehran government has enhanced capabilities to finance its military preparedness .
In this regard , Iran is in a very different situation to that of Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion , targeted by Anglo - American air attacks under the " No Fly Zone " coupled with more than ten years of deadly economic sanctions .
US military planners are fully aware of the possibility of escalation .
If extensive air attacks were to be launched , Iranian conventional forces would immediately cross the border into Iraq and attack US military installations .
This is a factor which has contributed to " putting the war on hold " .
Instead of extensive bombings which would result in retaliation .
Washington may decide as a first step in a broader military campaign to launch limited air attacks , on the presumption that Iran would not retaliate .
According to Philip Giraldi , the attack would " be as ‘ pinpoint ’ and limited as possible , intended to target only al - Qods and avoid civilian casualties . "
Before launching a " limited attack " , the US would attempt to ensure , through threat and secret negotiations , that retaliation would not occur .
The US Military ’s " Ability to Fight Wars "
Adm. William Fallon , who was recently fired as Commander of US Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) was acutely aware of Iran ’s ability to retaliate militarily and inflict significant losses to US and coalition forces .
This understanding was in fact conveyed at the outset of the 2003 war scenarios under TIRANNT .
Prior to his dimissal , Admiral Fallon played down the possibility of a war with Iran : “ We are not going to do Iran on my watch . ” .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen , while broadly supportive of the Bush - Cheney White House , has officially acknowledged US military weaknesses .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan " may have undermined the military ’s ability to fight wars against major adversaries – including Iran . " ( quoted in Haaretz , October 22 , 2007 ) .
In an interview with the New York Times , Mullen stated :
" … the risks could be very , very high … .
We ’re in a conflict in two countries out there right now …
We have to be incredibly thoughtful about the potential of in fact getting into a conflict with a third country in that part of the world . "
These statements were made at the very outset of his mandate as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2007 .
Mullen ’s hesitations to wage war on Iran are not based on a divergent political stance but on a realistic assessment of US military capabilities .
Admiral Mullen recognizes that the US military is overstretched and that in relation to Iraq , the US military is facing serious problems in military recruitment .
Moreover , tacitly acknowledged by the Pentagon , US and coalition forces are facing fierce resistance in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
The Appointment of General David Petraeus as Head of USCENTCOM
The appointment of General David Petraeus to the Head of U.S. Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) has served to neutralize potential opposition within the US Armed Forces .
It reinforces Vice President Cheney ’s ability to order an attack and ensure that the Military will fully support the Bush administration .
The objective is to " set up Iran for attack " using Iran ’s alleged intervention in Iraq as a pretext and justification , " on [ the ] grounds that Iran … is responsible for the mounting death toll among American troops in Iraq . "
( See Iran should be " Set Up for an Attack " by Muriel Mirak - Weissbach , Global Research , May 2008 ) .
Iran is also accused of intervening in Afghanstan and Lebanon .
In this regard , the 2006 Israeli attacks on Lebanon are part of the roadmap of a broader war directed against Iran and Syria .
( See Mahdi D. Nazemroaya , Global Research , May 2007 )
Armed Clashes in Lebanon
The recent armed clashes in Lebanon opposing Hizbollah to the US - Israeli supported May 14th Movement , have precipitated the country into chaos .
Fighting erupted after the pro-US Siniora government announced a crackdown on Hizbollah .
Hizbollah has taken control of parts of West Beirut setting the stage for a NATO " peacekeeping " intervention inside Lebanon .
A greater involvement of NATO coupled with the militarization of the entire Eastern Mediterranean coastline is an integral part of the Iran - Syria war scenario : " a peacekeeping " role by NATO forces , on behalf of Israel , targetting Syria as well as Hizbollah and Hamas .
These recent events in Lebanon have been triggered quite deliberately with a view to destabilzing the country .
They are part of the US sponsored military roadmap ; they are intended to set the stage for a confrontation with Syria .
The Structure of Military Alliances
The structure of military alliances is crucial .
America ’s allies are Israel and NATO .
Iran ’s allies are China and Russia and the member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
Both China and Russia have far - reaching bilateral military cooperation agreements with Iran .
Since 2005 , Iran has an observer member status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
In turn , the SCO has ties to the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) , an overlapping military cooperation agreement between Russia , Armenia , Belarus , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Republic , Tajikistan .
In October 2007 , the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) signed a Memorandum of Understanding , laying the foundations for military cooperation between the two organizations .
This SCO - CSTO agreement , barely mentioned by the Western media , involves the creation of a full - fledged military alliance between China , Russia and the member states of SCO / CSTO .
It is worth noting that the SCTO and the SCO held joint military exercises in 2006 , which coincided with those conducted by Iran .
( For further details see Michel Chossudovsky , Russia and Central Asian Allies Conduct War Games in Response to US Threats , Global Research , August 2006 )
In the context of US war plans directed against Iran , the US is also intent upon weakening Iran ’s allies , namely Russia and China .
In the case of China , Washington is seaking to disrupt Beijing ’s bilateral ties with Tehran as well as Iran ’s rapprochement with the SCO , which has its headquarters in Beijing .
In this regard , a military operation directed against Iran can only succeed if the structure of military alliances which link Iran to China and Russia is significantly weakened .
There are indicaitons that this Eurasian military alliance underlying the SCO has in fact been strengthened .
While currently Iran has observer status , the Tehran government has indicated its desire to become a full member of the SCO .
Moreover , in the course of the last year , Iran has strengthened its bilateral ties in the field of energy and oil and gas pipelines with India as well as Pakistan .
The positioning of India on the side of Iran in the oil and energy field is another factor which weakens Washington ’s influence in the region .
" What Tehran is seaking is " nothing less than a blueprint for a new correlation of nations in Eurasia , whose collaboration in developing continental infrastucture –nuclear energy , gas and oil pipelines , and transportation –should establish the economic , and therefore political , basis for true independence " ( see Muriel Mirak Weissbach , May 2008 )
History points to the importance of competing military alliances .
In the present context , the US and its NATO partners are seaking to undermine the formation of a cohesive Eurasian SCO - CSTO military alliance , which could effectively challenge and contain US - NATO military expansionism in Eurasia , combining the military capabilities not only of Russia and China , but also those of several former Soviet republics including Belarus , Armenia , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic .
The Decision to go to War : Not a Rational Choice
The decision to go to war is not made by the Military high command .
The decision to go to war is taken by civilians .
The US Military is characterised by a hierarchy and command structure .
Orders come from above , emanating from the " civilian government " , namely the Bush administration .
They are transmitted downwards through the military command structure .
Once the order to go to war is taken , it is not discussed or debated , it is carried out by the military .
Moreover , in all likelihood , in implementing a " preemptive attack " on Iran , the Bush administration would bypass the US Congress , in blatant violation of Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution .
In practice , the President and Commander in Chief , namely George W. Bush , does not decide .
He also obeys orders from above .
He follows the diktats of powerful financial and corporate interests .
This war is profit - driven .
" War is good for business " .
It is a money making operation .
It results in billions of dollar of profits for Wall Street , the oil giants and the military industrial complex , not to mention the institutional speculators in the oil , currency and commodity markets .
The objective of the proposed war is to extend the frontiers of the global capitalist economy , eventually taking control of Iran ’s oil wealth .
The broader implications of a war using tactical nuclear weapons in the conventional war theater are of no concern to those who decide to go to war .
The Central Role of Vice President Dick Cheney
In contrast to previous adminstrations , the Vice President has played a central role in the Bush adminstration , overshadowing the office of the President .
In practice , Vice President Cheney , supported by an army of senior officials and loyal advisers , controls the White House .
At the same time , Cheney is part of a powerful corporate apparatus , through his links to Halliburton and the role Halliburton has played in defining a profit - driven military agenda .
Cheney has personally played a key roie in activating war plans directed against Iran .
" At the outset of Bush ’s second term , Vice President Dick Cheney dropped a bombshell .
He hinted , in no uncertain terms , that Iran was " right at the top of the list " of the rogue enemies of America , and that Israel would , so to speak , " be doing the bombing for us " , without US military involvement and without us putting pressure on them " to do it " . "
( Michel Chossudovsky , May 2005 )
Cheney is the de facto Head of State , he overshadows George W. Bush , who is mere figurehead .
More recently , he has played a key role in pressuring the frontline Arab states into supporting a preemptive attack on Iran .
Vice President Cheney has little concern for the likely consequences and the resulting loss of life which would result from the use of both conventional and nuclear weapons .
He is fully aware that even a limited air attack on Iran could contribute to unleashing a broader Middle East - Central Asian war , extending from the Eastern Mediterranean to China ’s Western frontier .
The various scenarios of this broader war have already been envisaged .
Most serious Crisis in Modern History
We are at the crossroads of the most serious crisis in modern history .
These war plans coincide with a parallel process of economic restructuring and a deepseated Worldwide economic depression .
War and globalization are intimately related processes .
The militarisation of the Middle East and Central Asia supports the extension of the global " free market " system into new frontiers .
In turn , the war has heightened the economic crisis .
The civilian economy is collapsing , overshadowed and undermined by the dynamic growth of the military industrial complex , which in a very real sense produces " weapons of mass destruction .
In turn , the concurrent hikes in the price of crude oil , in the price of basic food staples , through speculative activities on major commodity exchanges have contributed to impoverishing millions of people .
" The antiwar movement must act , consistently , to prevent the next phase of this war from happening .
This is no easy matter .
The holding of large antiwar rallies will not in itself reverse the tide of war .
High ranking officials of the Bush administration , members of the military and the US Congress have been granted the authority to uphold an illegal war agenda .
What is required is a grass roots network , a mass movement at national and international levels , which challenges the legitimacy of the military and political actors , and which is ultimately instrumental in unseating those who rule in our name .
War criminals occupy positions of authority .
The citizenry is galvanized into supporting the rulers , who are " committed to their safety and well - being " .
Through media disinformation , war is given a humanitarian mandate .
To reverse the tide of war , military bases must be closed down , the war machine ( namely the production of advanced weapons systems ) must be stopped and the burgeoning police state must be dismantled .
The corporate backers and sponsors of war and war crimes must also be targeted including the oil companies , the defense contractors , the financial institutions and the corporate media , which has become an integral part of the war propaganda machine .
Antiwar sentiment does not dismantle a war agenda .
The war criminals in the US , Israel and Britain must be removed from high office .
What is needed is to reveal the true face of the American Empire and the underlying criminalization of US foreign policy , which uses the " war on terrorism " and the threat of Al Qaeda to galvanize public opinion in support of a global war agenda . "

" I think a lot of banks are already bankrupt … but they hide their rotten assets … in categories where you do n't really need to value them , " Faber said .
" I think the financial sectors , by - and large , has much larger problems than is perceived by the investment community and the stock market to some extent is telling you that . "
Even another big brokerage of bank failed , nothing would happen to clients ' money since those assets could be transferred somewhere else , " he said .
Buy Gold
Investors should go into gold as its price did not rise as fast as that of other commodities while the central bank keeps printing money , Faber said .
The Fed has been " misleading " investors on wanting a strong dollar , Faber said , as it kept lowering the interest rates .
" When it comes to action , they show no concern about inflation . "
He also blamed the central bank for forcing investors to abandon safe deposits in banks for riskier strategies by keeping rates so low .
" The Federal Reserve is the greatest speculator — they force people to speculate , " he said .
" I think they should have stopped cutting rates at say 4 percent … you could stop cutting rates and pursue a tight monetary policy .
You can take other measures , mop up liquidity , " Faber added .
The world economy is sending signals of a major slowdown and demand for commodities apart from gold is likely to subside in the second half of the year , he said .
The Fed 's loose monetary policy did not help an economic recovery , because the private sector was tightening lending conditions after years of relaxed policies , so the rate cuts had little effect , Faber added .
ALBANY , N.Y. , April 7 ( Reuters ) - New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s plan to free Manhattan from gridlock by charging rush - hour drivers $ 8 fees may be doomed as state lawmakers had not scheduled a vote ahead of a Monday ’s midnight deadline .
It was just about a year ago that the independent mayor unveiled his plan to raise billions of dollars for new buses and subways with so - called congestion pricing , a strategy already used by London and Singapore .
Bloomberg has several times revived his plan , the centerpiece of 127 Earth Day proposals to make the city greener , from near - certain death .
City and state lawmakers at first rejected the new fees and then wrested a series of changes , including pushing the border south to 60th St. from 86th St .
But on Monday , Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver , who killed Bloomberg ’s plan for an Olympic stadium on Manhattan ’s West Side , had made no announcement ahead of the deadline , which if missed will cost the city $ 354 million in federal mass transit aid .
Kevin Sheekey , a mayoral aide , warned lawmakers that they risked angering voters , businesses , environmental advocates and working people if they charging weekday drivers the fees during rush hour for entering Manhattan .
“ I do n’t think they should worry about the mayor , I think they should worry about the other people , ” Sheekey said on an Albany radio show .
But he also explained why Bloomberg ’s leadership might have failed .
“ This was a plan that was advocated by the business community , the environmental community ...
In many ways , the mayor came late to the game , put his office behind it . ”
Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he was willing have his house vote first , before the Democratic - led Assembly .
But Bruno added that he needed support from some Democrats in his house to enact the legislation .
Bruno said lawmakers could fix any problems after the plan was approved , noting that lawmakers wanted to be sure that trucks making deliveries would be exempt if , for example , they entered or left before 7:00 a.m. or 7:00 p.m .
Spokesmen for the speaker and Gov. David Patterson had no comment .
Even if New York ’s legislature -- which has also missed its March 31 deadline for approving a new $ 124 billion budget -- approves Bloomberg ’s plan , New Jersey is likely to try to kill it .
Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine has vowed to sue to protect New Jersey drivers , spurning Bloomberg ’s proposal to have the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contribute an extra $ 1 billion for transportation .
New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez has appealed to the Federal Highway Administration .

The ' super clubs ' of Ibiza are renowned the world over as the global HQ of dance music , and deservedly so .
Not only for their size and splendour , but mainly for the unique atmosphere created by thousands of people , fresh off the beach , letting their hair down with a holiday vengeance .
It has to be borne in mind though that these clubs pre-date the ' dance music ' phenomenon by many years .
Most have been around for three decades , during which time they have put on top ranking the artists of the moment down through the years and therefore every musical genre that has come and gone over this period - from the hippies onwards .
This is still the case today and will be tomorrow and more than likely forever Witness the fact that the Global room at Pacha is devoting six nights a week to perfecting the blend of Hip Hop and R&B with House music in a very effective crossover , whilst on the other side of the island Es Paradis have had ' Twice as Nice ' dispensing R&B , Garage and 2 - Step sounds for years .

ATHEISTS UNITED ANTICIPATES FAVORABLE RULING IN PENDING 9th CIRCUIT COURT DECISION ON " IN GOD WE TRUST " AND " UNDER GOD "
The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to release a ruling in the next several days on the case brought by Sacramento atheist Michael Newdow on the constitutionality of the religious phrases " In God We Trust " and " Under God " in mandated exercises of civic expression .
Atheists United has been watching this case with interest .
The atheist community has always believed that these phrases not only represented intentional shows of contempt and disrespect to our community , but that the use of these phrases by our government were designed to create a religious apartheid in our society that rendered atheists voiceless and invisible in our society and government .
" These phrases represent outdated and government - sanctioned bigotry .
They are no more appropriate or patriotic today than the government - sanctioned signs of 60 years ago that said ' Whites Only ' , " said Stuart Bechman , president of Atheists United .
" As US citizens , we expect a government that represents all of the people and protects all minorities – even those without any religious beliefs - from discrimination and exclusion in our society and government . "
" We look forward to the 9th Circuit Court 's ruling on this matter . "

About
Er.js piggybacks on Neil Mix ’s Thread.js which fakes threading in JavaScript 1.7 using coroutines and nested generator continuations .
The goal is to replicate Erlang ’s concurrent lockless process model and message - passing APIs in JavaScript .
Running Concurrently
Running a JavaScript function in the background is easy with Er.js :
Er.spawn(myBackgroundFunction ) ;
Er.spawn starts a new Er.js process running myBackgroundFunction , and returns its process id .
Because processes are really coroutines , you have to call yield before any function which might block .
Calling yield will create a continuation trampoline that can be rerun by Er.js when it ’s time for the process to continue executing .
For example :
function myBackgroundFunction ( ) { //
Wait for 4 seconds yield Er.sleep ( 4000 ) ; //
Do other things … }
Sending Messages
In Erlang and Er.js , each process has a built - in message queue that other processes use to send it messages .
Posting to the message queue never blocks the caller , and the destination process for the message can read them off the queue whenever it wants .
Messages are just regular associative arrays , similar to hashtables , which are easy to create in JavaScript .
For example :
Er.send( myPid , { Hello : new Date ( ) , From : Er.pid ( ) } ) ;
Here , myPid is assumed to be the process id from some former call to Er.spawn .
This call sends a message with the keys “ Hello ” and “ From ” .
Hello is a Date object with the current date , and From is the process id of the current process , which can always be fetched with Er.pid ( ) .
Passing the current pid means the myPid process can send us messages in return , since we ’ve told it who we are .
Receiving & Pattern Matching
When myBackgroundFunction wants to read off its message queue , it calls the Er.receive function , telling it the kind of message it ’s interested in , and a function to call when such a message is received .
Interest in a message is expressed using a message pattern which , just like the messages themselves , is a simple hash table .
yield Er.receive ({ Hello : Date , From : _ } , // pattern function ( msg ) { // handler log ( ” Hello= ” + msg. Hello ) ; log ( ” From= ” + msg.From ) ; } ) ;
This matches any message in the current process ’s queue which has a Hello key with a Date object as the value , and with a From key with any value .
Explicit value matching for e.g. number and string literals and DOM elements is also possible .
The “ _ ” for the From key means that any value is accepted .
There are a few other matching rules as well that make this a very powerful but simple message dispatching mechanism .
If a message in the process queue matches a pattern passed to Er.receive , it is passed to the handler function found in the argument list following the pattern .
The handler can look up the key values it needs in order to act on the message .
It can also send messages to other processes , spawn new processes , receive queued messages or perform other work .
Because the Er.receive call does n’t finish until a message matching one of patterns is received and handled , we put a yield in front of the call to avoid blocking other processes .
Linked Processes
When a process finishes or exits , it automatically sends a message to any processes which link to it .
Linking is done by passing a pid to Er.link .
The sent message is of the form :
{ Signal : Er.Exit , From : exiting_pid , Reason : reason }
The Reason value comes either from the exiting process calling Er.exit ( reason ) , or just throw 'ing the reason as an exception .
If the linking process does not handle this message , it will exit itself , sending exit messages to its own linked processes .
This allows for simple process chaining and failure handling .
Message Multicast
Er.js processes can also register to receive messages sent to a given name , using Er.register ( name ) .
Registered names can be passed as the first argument to Er.send .
Multiple processes can register for the same name , and they will all receive a message sent to that name , allowing for simple multi-casting .
Concurrent AJAX with Er.Ajax
XmlHttpRequest , AJAX and JSON integrate nicely with the process and message - passing model , allowing processes to avoid asynchronous JavaScript and callbacks .
Instead , using message - passing and concurrency , Er.js makes network access transparent , without blocking other processes or interactivity :
var txt = yield Er.Ajax.get ( " http://beatniksf.com/erjs/index.html " ) ; alert ( " Fetched Content : " + txt ) ;
Under the covers , this is accomplished using Er.Ajax.start , which handles asynchronous XmlHttpRequest internals and uses Er.send to tell the current process about download progress and completion .
Er.Ajax.get and others ( post , json , etc ) are implemented by yielding execution until the final message from Er. Ajax.
start is received .
If the message indicates success , the response text is returned to the caller , otherwise the failure message is thrown :
function myGet( url ) { Er.Ajax.start ( url ) ; yield Er.receive ( {
Url : url , Success : true , Text : String , _:_ } , function ( msg ) { return msg .
Text ; } , { Url : url , Success : false , Text : String , _:_ } , function ( msg ) { throw msg ; } ) ; }
Er.DOM Event Handling
As with remote resources , Er.js can concurrently listen for DOM Events , and once received insert them into the listening process 's message queue .
The following demonstrates a simple wrapper , Er.DOM .
Receive , which subscribes to a named event on a DOM element and calls Er.receive to await its delivery :
var event = yield Er.DOM.receive ( document , " click " ) ;
Note :
The best approach to handling DOM manipulation and eventing with Er.js is still under investigation .
For instance , document above might alternately refer to an an element 's id or multiple elements using a CSS selector .
Future Work
Er.js will wrap certain long - running asynchronous JavaScript calls in synchronous yielding wrappers so that processes can avoid convoluted asynchronous code .
JSON - based Remote Procedure Calls
var rpc = Er.spawn ( " http://www.beatniksoftware.com/echo " ) ; ... Er.send ( rpc , { Echo : " This is the echo payload " } ) ; yield Er.receive ( {
EchoResponse : String } , function ( msg ) { alert ( " Got Echo response : " + msg.EchoResponse ) ; } ) ;
Native Threading
Like Erlang itself , Er.js will enable easy interaction with concurrent processes running on remote nodes .
Using JSON and XML , messages can be sent to and received from remote servers using the same API as locally running concurrent processes :
It would also be interesting to explore the use of native threads for running processes , leveraging e.g. Google Gears ' WorkerPools if available on the client .
Nasa 's Phoenix spacecraft has gone silent and is unlikely to communicate with Earth again .
The probe has succumbed to the diminishing light and increasing cold at its Arctic landing site .
The robotic lab had been investigating the region 's climate and geology , trying to determine whether the planet has ever been capable of supporting life .
Dr Tom Pike , from Imperial College London , has been working on the mission .
He kept a diary for the BBC News website of his experiences .
WEDNESDAY 12 NOVEMBER - FAREWELL PHOENIX
Right up to the end , we were still trying to squeeze more data out of Phoenix .
Our last set of commands for the Phoenix Lander was to break off a beam of our atomic force microscope .
The atomic force microscope station is now sitting silently on Mars Like a used match in a booklet of matches , we wanted to get the tiny silicon beam out of the way , so we could carry on getting images with a new clean tip .
This is a dangerous manoeuvre .
We deliberately drive a miniature knife into our delicate array of silicon tips , cleaving off one while leaving the others untouched .
The knife needs to be aligned to within a hair 's breadth - beam breaking had us sweating even when we practised on Earth .
Knife edge
But we 'd already done this once on Mars , and had even been able to take a picture of our first broken tip in its final resting place , on one of the microscope substrates .
Now , after taking the highest resolution images of Martian dust , the second tip in turn had come to the end of its life .
But before the commands to remove this tip could be completed , Phoenix has come to a sputtering halt , running out of energy under the fading sun of a Martian autumn .
If humans ever venture to these bleak Martian arctic plains again ...
I 'd like to think they will bring Phoenix some spare batteries
Phoenix will likely remain frozen for evermore , its knife poised above the second silicon tip - now given an indefinite stay of execution .
It 's only now sinking in that the first Martian microscope station , a shoe - box sized instrument sitting on the deck of the Phoenix , has completed its life 's work .
It was first conceived in crude sketches in my lab book eleven years ago .
During the following three years , the microscope emerged from labs in California , Switzerland , Arizona and Germany , only to end up literally sitting on the shelf at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena for three years .
The array of tips used to image with the atomic force microscope Reborn for Phoenix , it gained contributions from Denmark and the UK , our tiny micro-machined substrates from Imperial College London designed to hold the Martian dust and soil .
Born again Nearly three years ago , the microscope station was bolted to the deck of Phoenix , before Phoenix in turn was hoisted onto a Delta II rocket - its last hours on Earth before the ten month journey to Mars in the vacuum of deep space .
But that was nothing compared to the four minutes of terror as Phoenix entered the Martian atmosphere just over five months ago , as first its heat shield , then parachutes , and finally retro rockets brought it to a halt .
The microscope station already had its first set of substrates poised to capture its first sample - the debris pushed up in to the thin atmosphere by the retro rockets .
The first tip broken off on Mars During the next five months , we 've loaded up all our substrates with dust and soil , taking over a thousand optical microscope pictures and nearly one hundred atomic force microscope images .
We 've been so busy operating the microscope station to get more images , we 've hardly had a chance to study all we 've gathered so far .
But it looks like we 've captured a billion - year - old history of Mars in our microscopic images .
We see what might be ancient glassy grains that could have disintegrated into the familiar red dust that cloaks the planet .
Empty gaze
Only the atomic force microscope was able to see the finest of the dust .
We 're getting hints in these particles of signatures of past water , spied by instruments circling Mars hundreds of kilometres above Phoenix .
The microscope station is now silent ; optical microscope sightless ; sample wheel rotating no further ; atomic force microscope frozen ; all waiting for commands that will probably now never come .
Delivery of one of the samples to the microscope station
But this instrument has given us by far the closest look we have ever had of another planet .
I 'd like to think that if one day humans ever venture to these bleak Martian arctic plains they will bring Phoenix some spare batteries .
And if the microscope station fires up once more , I hope they can send those last long - delayed commands - to break off the beam and get some final images to add to the collection .
FRIDAY 15 AUGUST - A SPECK OF DUST
When we first conceived of a microscope for Mars nearly twelve years ago , it was to help search for hazards for future human exploration of the planet .
Combined with an analysis from a wet chemistry laboratory , we hoped to alert Nasa to possible environmental threats to astronauts from the Martian dust and soil .
The AFM scan of the Antechamber revealed a single dust particle A mission to Mars requires astronauts to remain months on the surface before a return launch to Earth .
During that time it is inevitable that some dust and soil will get inside their living quarters .
On Earth , exposure to small amounts of very fine dust can be extremely damaging - it is the tiny diameter of asbestos fibres that allows them to get deep into the lungs .
Being able to image such small particles drove us to combine an optical microscope with an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) .
We called our set of instruments MECA , for Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment .
It was built for the cancelled Mars 2001 Lander .
MECA is now operating on Phoenix , and its role has changed .
Now its aim has broadened to study Mars as a planet .
The name has changed as well : still MECA , but now this stands for the Microscope , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyser .
But there are still plenty of reasons to study the dust of Mars apart from the effects on humans .
Orange sunset
The dust is everywhere .
As Mars has almost certainly not seen rain for billions of years , the dust has built up as a fine coating on everything and soil may be hundreds of metres thick .
It stays lofted in the sky giving the distinctive orange - pink backdrop to photographs taken on the planet , and giving sunsets on Mars a ghostly blue glow .
Seasonal dust storms can envelope the whole planet , drastically reducing the Sun 's heating of the surface .
It is impossible to properly understand Mars without studying the dust , but we are the first to try to take an image of individual dust particles .
The silicon substrate is patterned to capture the Martian dust
We know these particles must be small , at best a few micrometres , millionths of a metre , across .
A couple of weeks ago we confirmed that our AFM has sufficient resolution to see the dust .
Now we have to hold a single speck still while the AFM scans it .
The silicon substrate etched with tiny pits over two years ago was designed to do this job .
This 3 mm - diameter disc of silicon was carefully processed with these " nanobuckets " by Sanjay and Hanna in Imperial College 's nanotechnology clean room back in London .
We are going to see if our nanobuckets will work .
The robot arm has sprinkled a perfect sample onto our nanobucket substrate .
After taking an image with the optical microscope we have to select a target area we 'll scan with the AFM .
We 're not looking for the actual particles : they 're too small to be seen in this image .
Instead we 're looking for where there are no larger particles that could get in the way of the AFM while it scans .
Fairy dust
All our targets for study on Mars should have a name .
We 've chosen fairy tales as a rich source of labels for our targets .
Our nanobucket substrate is number 67 , so I decide to rename it " The Twelve Hunters , " the title of the Brothers Grimm 's 67th tale .
This is not one of the Grimm 's better - known stories so I have to read it to find a target name for the AFM scan .
In some ways it 's a typically implausible story of thwarted love between a prince and princess .
But as I read on I feel a chill .
The prince tries to unmask the princess , disguised as one of twelve hunters , by demanding she leave her bedroom across an unlit antechamber whose floor is strewn with dried peas .
The Phoenix team is based at an operations centre in Arizona
If she does n't have the firm step of a hunter , the peas will be scattered across the antechamber and she will be unmasked .
But the princess hears of the prince 's test , treads firmly leaving the peas undisturbed and eventually marries the prince in a classic fairy - tale ending .
So our target area of nanobuckets on the Twelve Hunters is named " Antechamber " .
We send the coordinates up to Phoenix to command the sample wheel to rotate Antechamber in front of the AFM and take a scan .
The next day we 're back in the downlink room , waiting for the AFM scans to return .
It 's taken more two - thirds of the primary mission of Phoenix to get to this point .
First we had to get the sample wheel and optical microscope to bring back images of the soil .
Happy ending
Then the AFM was brought into operation to produce good scans of the test substrates .
This will be our first attempt to image any Martian dust particles in the nanobuckets .
As the data comes down and we decode it , we first see that the AFM has imaged the nanobuckets of Antechamber .
There are several visible as dark circles in the scan .
As I plot the surface in three dimensions , I see that one of the nanobuckets right at the edge of Antechamber looks different .
There , lodged to one side , is what looks like a particle .
The AFM scans both forwards and backwards , producing two images as it scans .
I immediately check the reverse scan and see the same feature in the image .
Our particle has held still in the nanobuckets of Antechamber as sure as any of Grimms ' peas .
Urs , Sanjay , Mike and I look at each other .
Is this the fairy - tale ending ?
As a documentary TV camera crew peer over our shoulders , we measure the size of the particle .
At one micrometre across it 's just about as small as we expected .
We are the first people to see the individual specks of dust on Mars .
We 're not finished .
Next we have to work on building up a portrait gallery of the Martian dust particles .
We also want to look at what collects on our substrates if we leave them outside the MECA enclosure overnight .
But before we continue our work , we invite the entire Phoenix team over to the Microscopy House to celebrate .
We 've lived this Martian tale for seventy sols together ; many more if you include all the training sessions in Tucson .
We want to thank the whole team for helping give this chapter a happy ending .
WEDNESDAY 6 AUGUST - NOTHING TO HIDE ?
It was more than a month ago , on sol 30 , that the wet chemistry laboratory ( WCL ) on Phoenix first detected what looked like perchlorate in the Martian soil .
We 've waited until sol 72 to report this finding , and even this has been a somewhat reluctant announcement .
To many people , the question will be what did we have to hide ?
The wet chemistry lab beaker contains sensors in its walls
The answer highlights a fundamental difficulty of doing good science under the gaze of the public .
When the science relates to the possibility of life on another planet , that gaze can become very intense .
The data from WCL that streamed back to Earth was not immediately ready for such public scrutiny .
First , the results from WCL needed careful analysis - the sensors used to identify the chemistry of the Martian soil do n't directly give us a list of ingredients .
We need to look at how any one chemical might affect more than one sensor - it 's more like a Sudoku puzzle with chemicals rather than numbers , and , similarly , not a great spectator sport .
As soon as the data arrived from Mars , the WCL team were busy in the laboratory here in Tucson , using a twin of the instrument on Mars to understand how all of the readings from the sensors could be explained .
Independent look Some results quickly emerged - the soil was mildly alkali .
This was announced at a press conference the very next day .
Others , like the confirmation of perchlorate , took a little longer .
Secondly , WCL is not the only instrument on Phoenix that can look at the soil chemistry .
TEGA , the thermal evolved gas analyser , bakes the soil and can identify the mass of the molecules that are given off .
However , TEGA can't look for all the possible chemicals , and it was n't even looking for perchlorates when it cooked its first sample .
We really wanted to wait until TEGA had a chance to confirm the perchlorates before going public .
The wet chemistry lab is looking at soil chemistry on Mars
Thirdly , it 's always wise to get an outside opinion before presenting an important result .
This is the basis of the peer - review process , a much used phrase in scientific circles which just means that an independent expert in the field should take a close look before you go public .
Completing all of these steps would take weeks or months .
Skipping a step or two can lead to embarrassment at best .
At worst , if faulty results are presented as correct , research can be knocked back years .
Against this measured pace of careful confirmation is the strong desire to show our results to the world .
A space mission is a rare opportunity to share the excitement of scientific discovery with a worldwide audience .
Rumour mill
We 've had camera crews regularly filming in the SOC , and have given regular press conferences as well as numerous radio and TV interviews .
The Phoenix science team is happy to present the edited highlights .
Transmitting a live commentary , complete with our speculations and initial and often faulty analyses , would be a very different proposition .
Martain soil is delivered to the WCL using the lander 's scoop
The journalists covering Phoenix had been expecting more complete WCL results for many weeks .
They quite reasonably guessed that the delay must mean we were working on something important .
It was reported the White House was briefed that WCL had returned results relating to the potential for life on Mars .
By last weekend , the internet rumour mill , fuelled by online news sources and bloggers , was in overdrive .
Even the microscope station , which shares the enclosure and some electronics with WCL , became part of a cover up : according to one source we had imaged alien droppings !
Peter Smith , who leads the Phoenix Team , was in a tricky position .
Keeping quiet about the perchlorate would just fuel speculation that was getting wilder by the day .
But the detailed work on the perchlorate analysis had not been completed and TEGA had been unable to make a positive identification , though with a different sample .
Peter made the difficult decision to make a preliminary announcement on what we had found to date .
Rather than a confident declaration of our findings , this announcement came with a science health warning - this was a work in progress , and as such , the conclusions could shift .
Usually , any scientist feels flattered when a journalist calls to talk about their work .
But for a brief period in the last week we had to give that most uncomfortable stock response : " No comment . "
At least after this week 's announcement , we can get on with the mission without looking like we 've got something to hide .
FRIDAY 1 AUGUST - UNDER PRESSURE
The heat is on ...
Since I returned to Tucson more than two weeks ago , we have been struggling to bring the atomic force microscope into action .
The AFM should be able to zoom in well beyond the resolution of the optical microscope so that we should be able to see the structure of the individual dust grains on Mars .
The AFM has eight beams , each with a pointed tip used to scan samples
That should give us clues to whether liquid water might have been responsible for weathering the rounded grains we see .
The AFM could be the most complicated instrument sent to operate on the surface of another planet .
At its core is an exquisitely fine tip which scans over the sample , carefully following the contours to produce a three - dimensional image of the surface .
On Earth it is possible to even map out individual atoms on a surface .
The tip is at the end of a tiny beam of silicon shaped like a miniature diving board .
This silicon diving board has a distinctive twang , way above the acoustic frequencies we can hear , but the AFM can use any slight shift in the tone of the twang to keep the tip scanning just above the surface of the sample .
These tips can wear down , so we 've sent eight of them , each at the end of their own silicon beam .
This all works very well in the laboratory here on Earth , but on Mars we have a major complication : the temperature swings between - 20C in the early afternoon to - 80 C at night .
As the temperature drops , the distinctive tone of the twang rises as the silicon stiffens .
We 're looking for tiny differences in tone while we scan , but we 're being swamped by changes in temperature .
The team had all been working towards this image
It looks as though we might have sent a rather complicated thermometer , rather than a microscope , to Mars .
Of course we can't expect the polar regions of Mars to mirror the temperatures of a laboratory , and we 've built a chamber so that we can run the AFM at the temperatures and pressures we might expect on Mars .
But short of putting the entire spacecraft in a massive chamber , it 's never possible to duplicate all of the conditions of a mission .
Very often it is difficult to be sure how well an instrument might perform before it reaches its destination .
We 've worked out a scheme to turn on the electronics of the AFM early .
This should heat up the inside of the black box of our microscopy station to what we hope is a stable temperature before we move our samples up to the AFM and start scanning .
Stable temperature
We send up the revised code to the spacecraft for the next sol 's AFM operations .
As the downlinked AFM images arrive on Earth , it looks like this might be helping : the scans still need considerable improvement , but we 're moving in the right direction .
While we 're crowded round the computer in the downlink room , the figure of the mission manager looms in the doorway - our heating has pushed one of our temperature sensors on the spacecraft into the red , above 65C .
It 's just by a couple of degrees for less than a minute , but he wants an explanation .
More importantly he wants to know how we 're going to avoid doing it again .
We 're in a bind : although it looks as though we might have found a way to run the AFM , we could be risking our instrument at the same time .
As I pore over the temperature profiles , it becomes clear that the problem is not with our heating of the electronics , it 's the final burst of current as we use the motors to approach the AFM .
We need to find a way to cut back on the motor power .
Tom , Sanjay and Urs celebrate their success
Until we do , the AFM is banned from working at the hottest part of the Martian day , the very time the temperature is most stable .
Rushing back to the laboratory , we use the copy of the flight AFM in an environmental chamber to work out a revised way of using the motors .
By running the motors more quickly , followed by regular pauses , we can drastically cut back on our power .
While the code for this new approach is reviewed , I model the temperatures we might get - we 'll keep well below the 65C red line .
The AFM is put back in the schedule .
The next day I feel a rather unpleasant mixture of eagerness and anxiety as we wait for the AFM data to come back .
This time our images are expected to arrive on Earth later than most of the other instruments ' data .
I have time to think through our precarious position .
We can't expect to be given too many more opportunities to get the AFM running properly .
The heat really is on - this might be our last chance .
As the microscope team waits in the MECA downlink room , the TEGA team down the corridor explodes - their instrument has finally produced the confirmation we were looking for - Phoenix has identified water .
Their hard work has been rewarded , but I feel I can only take a sip of the champagne to celebrate their much deserved success .
With the SOC still buzzing , we see the AFM images trickle down .
The first scan looks stable - as we hoped our temperatures must have kept flat while we imaged .
I start plotting the data in three dimensions .
I can make out the details of the calibration grid we 've imaged , an array of tiny square blocks in a chequerboard pattern .
You could fit one million of these blocks on the head of a pin .
The scan is more than stable , it is superb .
In fact it is better than any scan of this grid we 've made on Earth .
We stare at this image , allowing the slow realisation of what we have achieved sink in .
However , this is only a grid from Earth , not a sample from Mars , and we need to start imaging particles .
We started late and we 're running out of time - we 're now more than two - thirds of the way through the original mission .
Perhaps spurred by TEGA 's result , Nasa gives the announcement we were all hoping for : they 're willing to extend the mission beyond the 90 sols to the end of September .
Imaging particles with the AFM was never going to be straightforward , but at least we now have more time to tackle the challenges ahead .
MONDAY 21 JULY - CHANGING TIMES After Phoenix landed on Mars back in May the science team all felt a very sharp stick in our backs prodding us on - each day of surface operations might be our last .
Hanna has been making ice - soil mixtures
The microscope was the first instrument to get a sample delivery from Mars - it came raining down as we landed .
We were able to send microscope images back to Earth within the first ten Martian days , or sols .
Our impatience was rewarded ..
Now we are 54 sols into the mission and , as I return to Tucson , a new mood has descended on the science team .
There is an air of patient concentration as we work out ever more challenging ways to study this corner of the Red Planet 's polar plains .
The science team has been working out the best way to get a sample of ice into the TEGA instrument , where its ovens can boil it and analyse the chemical composition .
Hanna has been making ice - soil mixtures to see how long we have to image the mixture before the ice vapourises .
Urs and I have been working on how to use the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) to image the particles we 've collected so far .
While I was away , Urs and the microscope team took the first steps and used the AFM to successfully image one of our calibration substrates .
The AFM was able to pick out individual grooves one thousandth of a millimetre across , invisible to our optical microscope .
Hours of preparation
The particles , though , are much more difficult to image .
They tend to be pushed about by the sharp tip of the AFM , frustrating our attempts .
On Earth , we'd be able to turn a few knobs to minimise the forces between the tip and the particle .
For Phoenix , each " tweak " of the computer code takes hours to prepare and the results from Mars are n't known until the next sol .
We also have to book ahead to be able to run our microscopes on Phoenix .
What takes just a few minutes to run on the testbed in our laboratory in Tucson takes several sols to complete on Mars .
A good deal of patience is a requirement for any member of the science team .
Scientists are trying to get a sample of ice into one of the instruments
The sense of urgency has not disappeared altogether .
Our mission will end as the Martian summer draws to a close .
Currently , though , we are " power positive " .
Phoenix often needs some time to cool down after a strenuous sol of activities .
We even have enough power to keep Phoenix operating continuously for an entire sol .
This gives us an opportunity to see how the frosting of the soil and ice at the bottom of our trench changes under the weak sunlight of a Martian polar night .
The spacecraft crew in Denver have developed a deeper understanding of how our solar arrays are capturing power while the instruments burn it .
They estimate that we should still be " power positive " until November , giving us at least a 150 - sol mission .
Phoenix may continue to have plenty of power during the day shifts for a while to come , but the science team will soon stop working Martian nights .
This is the time that we 're kept busy analysing the results and preparing the code for the next sol .
For the second time in the mission , the nearly twenty - five - hour Martian day is re-synchronising our sleep cycles to Tucson time .
Back to normality
By the end of the week , we 'll slide over to Earth time and stay there .
It will make running the mission more complex : we 'll have to plan the next sol 's operations without the benefit of the most recent data returned from Mars .
But it will allow at least the local members of the team to have something approaching a normal life .
It has been quite an experience being one of maybe a hundred people on Earth whose body clocks have been locked to the rotation of another planet .
The Phoenix science team is a very international group and it's been easy to think of our collective home being Earth .
But for the last two months we 've felt part of an even larger entity , with our waking hours determined by the gyrations of the Solar System .
But before we desert Mars time , we have time to hold an early morning party before Hanna leaves us briefly .
She 's about to get married back in England , and for this wedding the planets are definitely in alignment : Hanna 's last Martian shift leaves her synched to British Summer Time .
TUESDAY 8 JULY - FUNDING MARS
I 'm back in London for ten days , catching up with the last duties of the term at Imperial College , reminding my family of my existence and attending meetings about the upcoming set of space missions .
ExoMars , unlike Phoenix , will be hunting directly for life
One of these meetings concerns ExoMars , the 2013 European launch to Mars and what we hope will be the first non-US mission to operate on the surface of the Red Planet .
ExoMars , unlike Phoenix , will be hunting directly for life and that is a part of the reason that it will be three times as expensive as Phoenix .
The instruments aboard ExoMars that might identify life are incredibly sensitive - any contamination from Earth could lead to a false positive .
So a programme of sterilisation has to be built into the development of much of the other hardware on the mission .
Back in 1976 , the two Nasa Viking landers had to go through the same process .
The spacecraft were baked at 120C for seven days in giant ovens just before their launch to destroy any terrestrial life .
The microseismometer on ExoMars can pick up marsquakes
In 1974 , for every $ 10 the US was spending on protecting its environment , $ 1 went on safeguarding the environment of Mars from microbial contamination from Earth .
Viking set the standard , and the cost , of the very high levels of biological cleanliness required for any future mission searching for Martian life .
The price tag of ExoMars reflects this cost .
ExoMars is also an ambitious mission .
For Viking , as well as Phoenix , only samples within reach of the scoop could be analysed .
The life detection instruments of ExoMars will be mounted on a rover able to roam many kilometres and drill down 2 m to find samples .
That represents a massive increase in the volume of Mars that can be searched , and a further substantial increase in the price tag .
Of course , there is a distinct possibility that ExoMars will not identify life , at least in the areas it can search .
But the mission will not just be concentrating on this quest .
It is planned to include on the mission a stationary set of instruments to look at the atmosphere and interior of Mars .
One of these is a microseismometer - a very sensitive vibration sensor we 're working on at Imperial to detect marsquakes .
This should help us see for the first time deep into the internal structure of another planet .
Again , all these instruments , with the power and data systems required to run them , cost money .
Both Viking landers were baked to sterilise them of microbes Considering how many more capabilities are included on ExoMars , it is not so surprising that its current budget is three times that of Phoenix .
Neither is it surprising that there is considerable anxiety among the potential British contributors to ExoMars as news of a 25 % cut in UK funding for the programme emerges .
Both Mars Polar Lander and Beagle 2 bear testament to underfunded projects that used up their budgets as well as large chunks of people 's careers only to end up as scrap metal on Mars .
By contrast , Phoenix has already been a success in a number of ways - the landing was executed superbly , it is the first mission to touch the ice on Mars , and its instruments are giving us the closest look at the appearance and chemistry of the Martian soil .
It is also the cheapest mission to make it all the way to the surface of Mars .
I 'm sure we could have axed a quarter off the $ 460 m cost of Phoenix , but I do n't think I 'd now be booking my flight back to Tucson to share in the discoveries of the remainder of its mission .
TUESDAY 1 JULY - CHEMISTRY OR LIFE ?
Phoenix does not have the tools for a thorough investigation of current life on Mars .
We are investigating whether there is at least the potential there .
By contrast , over 30 years ago the two Viking landers each carried a set of four experiments on board designed specifically to detect life on the Red Planet .
The Viking landers carried experiments to detect life
One of these experiments mixed a scoopful of the soil with nutrients and looked to see if any of the carbon in these nutrients was given off as gas .
The results were at first astounding - something in the Martian soil did indeed seem to digest the nutrients and expel gas .
But the other three experiments were negative .
Was Viking seeing life , or chemical reactions between the nutrients and the soil itself ?
On the deck of Phoenix , on one side of the black box that houses the microscope station , are four chemistry experiments waiting to run .
This is the Wet Chemistry Laboratory ( WCL ) , essentially four test tubes that will mix the Martian soil with pure water from Earth and see what we can extract .
We will be recreating in these test tubes what we believe would have regularly taken place billions of years ago when Mars was a much warmer and wetter planet .
WCL might also give clues to why the soil might have appeared to harbour life in that one Viking experiment .
Inserted into each of the WCL test tubes are a number of sensors - one is an electronic litmus paper which will tell us how acidic or alkaline the soil is .
Taken together , the results from all these sensors will give us the best information yet on Mars ' surface chemistry .
Phoenix has delivered its first sample to the wet chemistry laboratory
In particular , if the soil is alkaline this may go a long way to explaining the Viking experiment .
Fifteen years ago , one of my Phoenix colleagues , Richard Quinn , worked out that just such a soil would explain the Viking results .
He is now in the Phoenix science operations center ( SOC ) , anxious to get soil into the first of these test tubes .
It has taken a while - nearly 30 days since Phoenix landed - to make sure we are ready to go with WCL .
It requires a complex sequence of releasing water from a tank , bringing soil into the test tube , stirring the mixture up to make sure we release all the soluble chemicals , and , finally , taking a slew of measurements from the resulting brew .
We have only one shot at it , and we want to make sure the spacecraft follows these instructions to the letter .
The first sample for WCL comes from the top few centimetres of the Martian soil .
The optical microscope has already indicated this very top surface uniformly coats Mars .
Near the Martian equator , Viking probably looked at a very similar scoop of material to what Phoenix has dug up from the " arctic " plains .
The data streams down , filing up our computer screens with scans from all the sensors .
There 's a quiet smile on Richard 's face as he concentrates on just one of these lines - the soil is just about as alkaline as he expected .
It looks like one of the biggest mysteries from previous missions to Mars has been cracked by Phoenix .
It was the chemical reactions of nutrients with the chemistry of the soil , not life , that Viking saw back in 1976 .
FRIDAY 20 JUNE - HUNTING FOR ICE
It was the promise of ice that brought Phoenix to the arctic plains of Mars .
The mission was funded on the expectation that we would find ice .
While the proposal for Phoenix was being written , the Mars Odyssey Orbiter was sweeping its instruments over the surface of Mars 300 km ( 186 miles ) below .
One of these , a gamma ray spectrometer , was looking for one very particular signal , the distinctive signature of hydrogen .
The only plausible source of hydrogen would be water in the form of ice , frozen below the surface of Mars .
The spectrometer did more than just find ice ; as the orbiter circled Mars , it built up a complete map of how much ice there was , and how far below the surface we were likely to find it .
On the northern plains of Mars , the Vastitas Boralis , it would be just a few centimetres down .
The proposal for Phoenix had a landing site and a goal : to dig down and touch this ice .
Phoenix landed in the blue ice - rich area ( top left ) , near Mars ' north pole
I 'm supposedly having a day off today .
I already have my eye on upcoming missions both to Mars and the Moon , and I need to do some work on preparing the next set of instruments to send into space .
Rather than microscopes , next time I hope it will be seismometers .
Instead of zooming in on the individual dust grains , in 2013 I 'll be looking for " Marsquakes " using a very sensitive vibration sensor we 're developing at Imperial .
To probe deep into the Mars , Tom is also working on " Marsquake " sensors
This will tell us about the deep structure of Mars , and should be the first time we learn about the inner workings of a planet other than our own .
It 's difficult to shake the feeling that I 'm somehow being unfaithful to Phoenix .
Even if Phoenix lasts beyond the 90 days it is expected to survive , it wo n't make through the bitter Martian polar winter .
Every day of this mission is precious , and there 's always new data to look at .
I 'm itching to get back to the science operations center ( SOC ) .
Early one morning I drove quickly to the SOC , eager to see what has come down in the latest transmission from Phoenix .
An overnight late pass of an orbiter overhead has given the lander a chance to send back some of the pent - up images it had been storing from a day before .
I get to have a first look at the some images of the trench .
We 've seen white material at the top of the trench ; if this were ice , it is showing little change .
But if this was part of a much larger layer of ice we might not see much change because it would be kept cold by the rest by a much larger hidden mass below .
What I want to find are small white particles .
If ice , these would turn to gas , or sublime , in the thin Martian atmosphere .
In other words , the particles would shrink and disappear .
Small ice particles in the trench are disappearing into the atmosphere I try to coax some detail out of the shadows .
I 'm fighting against image compression because in order to get as much data as possible back to Earth , we shoehorn the images into the smallest possible space .
It 's the dark shadows that lose most of their detail .
But in the deep shadows , I start to make out the outline of some small white shapes .
I compare these outlines to the image from the day before - there 's been no digging in between yet there has been a change : the particles are shrinking .
At the end of every Mars working day , we have a chance to present what we 've found to all the Phoenix mission scientists .
I convince many , but not all .
Confirmation , though , should be simple .
I work out that in another couple of days the particles should have disappeared altogether .
It 's been just over six years since the Mars Odyssey Orbiter first spotted water .
I can be patient for a few more days .
Yesterday , we got a chance to image the trench again .
The white particles are gone .
We 've found what we came for .
SATURDAY 14 JUNE - MARTIAN LABOURS
It 's been more than 30 years since a spacecraft has grabbed hold of the soil of Mars .
In 1976 , the two Viking landers sampled the surface for signs of life .
The scoop delivered soil to the lander 's microscope Since then there have been just three rovers on Mars , two of them still trundling around .
For them , the soil has been a road surface at best , a sand trap at worst .
It has not been a substance to pick up and handle .
Phoenix has a much more sensual relationship with the planet 's surface .
It is digging furrows with its robot arm , stopping to collect a scoopful to bring back to the instruments waiting impatiently on its deck .
But we have little idea what the soil is like , and we 've been fumbling while we try to understand what we 're handling .
There 's very little to help us get a feel of the soil .
The three orbiters circling Mars have sent back pictures at a level of detail never seen before of the surface of the planet .
We 've looked down on ice - filled craters , canyons that dwarf even the largest on Earth , and glimpsed Phoenix itself swinging down on its parachute .
That last image now forms the backdrop to nearly every laptop screen at the science operations center ( SOC ) .
But the orbiters can only give the most tenuous clues as to how the soil might really feel .
Unpredictable soil
We suspect that , unlike the Earth , the make - up of the soil on Mars varies little - the planet is wreathed in the particles of innumerable global duststorms .
That dust , though , has settled in very different environments .
At the poles it lands on ice caps , soon to be buried every Martian winter by ice fall .
At the equator it becomes part of a dry desert .
White material at the bottom of the trench could be ice Where Phoenix has landed , it seems to have a complicated relationship with the ice we think we 've spotted just below the surface .
Our soil is unpredictable .
First we dig up clumps that disintegrate overnight in the scoop .
Then the robot arm tries to dump the first sample into the oven where it will be baked and analysed by a mass spectrometer , an instrument called TEGA .
But the generous serving sits obstinately on the sieve that should just prevent pebbles jamming up the works .
Even shaking the sieve has no effect .
The TEGA team is becoming exasperated by the soil .
We 're next with a delivery to the microscope and decide on a more delicate approach - sprinkling the soil on to our substrates .
The scoop has a vibrator built into it , designed to free up the hard ice and frozen soil we might collect later .
During testing back in March , we worked alongside the robot - arm team using the copy of the spacecraft in Tucson .
We found out how to use the vibrator to dust our substrates with material from a tilted scoop .
We want just enough soil to coat our substrates , but not so much that we can't make out the individual particles .
But in our test in Tucson we could only use our best guess for the soil on Mars .
Perserverance finally paid off for the Phoenix team
It has now taken three days of testing on Mars , sprinkling soil on the top of the black box housing the microscope , before we 've convinced ourselves that we can deliver actual Martian soil .
We command the final sprinkle , followed by moving our sample wheel holding the substrates inside the box and round to the field of view of the microscope .
We hope this final movement , rotating the substrates from horizontal to vertical , will leave just the right amount of soil to peer at with the microscope .
At three the next morning we 're back in the SOC , waiting again for our images to return from the spacecraft .
We 're much more confident that the microscope station will perform as commanded .
My doubt now is whether the Martian soil will cooperate .
All eyes are on us - the mission will only proceed if we can be certain the microscope got the first sample of Martian soil .
Until we give the signal , the robot arm hangs frozen over the microscope enclosure .
The first images show the scoop and our substrates poking out of our box - with what looks like just the dusting we were looking for .
But it is not until Sanjay again decodes the incoming data that we see our first microscope images .
The soil is scattered perfectly across the substrates .
It 's a Go .
Our excitement is mirrored by the TEGA team - on the seventh attempt at shaking their load , the obstinate soil has finally collapsed into their awaiting oven .
We congratulate each other like proud new parents - after a few anxious days of labour we 've both got our deliveries from the surface of Mars .
SUNDAY 8 JUNE - THE DUST ON MARS
The first sample we want to look at with the microscope is an insurance policy .
Even if the robot arm is for some reason unable to reach down and scratch out a sample for us , we know the lander 's retro-rockets ( fired at the Martian surface to slow the craft 's descent on landing ) would have done the trick .
Phoenix has returned its first microscope images
We landed in a cloud of dust as Phoenix lowered itself onto the surface of Mars .
We just had to be able to collect some of it .
So a month before landing , while still millions of kilometres away from Mars , we moved our first set of test substrates out of the microscope station enclosure ready to catch the debris thrown up during landing .
These substrates are the discs we use to hold the dust and soil of Mars in front of our microscopes .
We then wrote the spacecraft computer sequence to rotate the substrates back into the enclosure , focus the microscope and take the red , green and blue images to give us the colour pictures of the dust we have managed to collect .
All is set , and there 's little else to do now but wait for the sequence to run .
We bundle the kids into the car and take advantage of a couple of days off to head up to the Grand Canyon .
The news of Phoenix precedes us as we stay overnight on the way in Flagstaff .
As we eat a late supper we 're congratulated by our fellow diners on a mission that Arizonans have obviously taken to their hearts .
But until we have received our first images of dust , I still feel like a tourist rather than a scientist on Mars .
Grand site
It 's a truism that no camera can capture the vast scale of the Grand Canyon .
But as we amble along the canyon 's North Rim , it is the timescale as much as the immensity of what we are gazing at that is staggering .
The Grand Canyon was created in about 20 million years
It took 20 million years for the Colorado River to carve out the scene in front of us .
But even that is an instant compared to the four billion years that Mars has had to grind its own surface down to a fine dust .
We believe Mars was a wetter and warmer place early in its history .
But it dried out long ago , and since then , the dust has been whipped into innumerable sandstorms - often enveloping the entire planet .
It is these tortured individual particles that we hope to see for the first time .
First images I 'm back in the science operations center ( SOC ) in Tucson just in time for the data to arrive back on Earth .
This time , the transmission stutters and we wait impatiently for the full pictures to come down .
No one has looked at the dust of Mars at this resolution before , and now I gasp as the images appear and we see the sheer variety of what we have collected .
From tiny particles of the palest white to black rounded beads , we 're the first to see what coats Mars and makes the skies pink .
Zooming in , we see finer and finer particles , right to the smallest grains that our optical microscope can make out .
We have run out of resolution and that is why we have our atomic force microscope to look even more closely at the dust .
Team member Urs Staufer is impatient , but it will be a week or more before we can move in his instrument and try to image the very smallest of the particles .
The next morning , I drive down from the microscopy house to present our first microscope images at the daily Phoenix press conference .
I 'm no longer a tourist on Mars , but a scientist .
And as a scientist , this is about as good as it gets .
SATURDAY 31 MAY - FIRST LIGHT
It was more than eleven years that Mike Hecht , from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , and I first started thinking about sending a microscope to Mars .
The microscope is a key instrument on the Phoenix lander Today we have our first chance to get images from the optical microscope of the Phoenix lander as it stands on the northern Martian plains .
Yesterday , we had commanded the sample wheel to bring our test substrates under the gaze of the optical microscope , ordered the LEDs to turn on and illuminate the scene , and asked the microscope to take a series of images .
If it all worked , these would be the highest resolution pictures taken from another planet .
Today , the data is making its way back to Earth , first transmitted up to Nasa 's Odyssey orbiter circling Mars .
Then , as Earth comes into view , Odyssey relays the data packets to the massive parabolic receivers of the Deep Space Network which then give the packets a final push to where the mission scientists are waiting at the science operations center , the SOC , in Tucson .
We gather round Sanjay 's laptop in the downlink room , nervously chatting about all that could go wrong .
Wait and see During testing for the mission , the images had often come out fuzzy - we found it very difficult to keep precise enough control of the sample wheel .
Meca is now working on the surface of the Red Planet
What should have been crisp pictures had become out - of - focus blurs .
Sanjay and Hanna had spent long days on the copy of the microscope station at Imperial , working out the intricacies of how to drive the sample wheel precisely .
Meanwhile , the Phoenix microscope itself had been cruising towards Mars .
We are about to find out if they learnt how to drive it .
Data is now flowing back and we immediately see that the spacecraft has sent back all of the pictures we had asked it to take .
Sanjay has prepared computer code that will eagerly pull apart the data packets , reconstruct the pictures , and immediately throw the microscope images up on his screen .
Eleven years shrinks down to the one second it takes to see our images cascade on to the laptop .
They 're as crisp as any we 've seen .
The first image is a test .
In truth , there 's really not that much to look at - a series of white rectangles covering 1 mm by 2 mm , with two blurred shadows like a couple of fence posts in one corner .
Phoenix made this footprint - shaped impression on Mars with its scoop
These shadows are the first two beams of the atomic force microscope .
With this second microscope we hope to zoom in even further .
The silicon beams are thinner than the thinnest tissue paper , but have survived the trip intact .
Urs Staufer , who put together the atomic force microscope , is very happy .
As we look closely , we see the network of fine scratches left in polishing the test substrate .
The light from the LEDs , bouncing off the substrate and through the optics of the microscope to its camera , is providing the finest detail ever seen on another planet .
The sun is just hitting the Tucson mountains as we emerge from the SOC and head back to the microscope house .
But we 're working Mars shifts and it 's dinner time for us .
We start up the barbecue under the first light of the Arizonan dawn .
It 's certainly worth a toast - we 're now ready to take the closest look ever at the dust and soil or even ice that Phoenix digs up from below the surface of Mars .
MONDAY 25 MAY - POSTCARD FROM MARS
The feeling is almost overwhelming as we listen to the live commentary from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in California as Phoenix descends towards the surface of Mars .
There were big smiles as the team realised the mission was " go " The radar gives us the height : first we 're closing hundreds of metres at a time - surely this is too fast .
But in the last tens of metres the retro-rockets kick in .
We slow to a crawl , and Phoenix is given the graceful landing that JPL promised .
The science operations center ( SOC ) raises a huge cheer that must echo across Tucson .
We embrace our colleagues , some of whom we 've worked with for over ten years while putting this mission together .
Then I hug my wife and kids - they 'll be seeing a lot less of me for the next three months .
Critical information
The first minute after landing Phoenix tells us all it can before concentrating on fanning out its solar arrays .
The first pictures from Mars were studied closely by the scientists
One critical piece of information - we 're tilted by a mere one quarter of a degree .
Even before we see any images , we know we have landed on the flattest of plains .
There 's now a two - hour wait until the first of these images can be sent back to Earth .
Time to share a last meal with our families before we walk over to the secure area of the SOC where we will get started with mission operations .
We 've trained so often it first feels like another mission simulation , although we now all have broad smiles on our faces .
As the images start coming in , we all feel the focus of the world 's gaze slide from Pasadena , where JPL controlled the landing , to where we 're standing in Tucson .
First comes the news we have one of the necessary ingredients for a successful mission - we see the solar arrays are deployed and hear that the batteries are fully charged .
Tom 's family joined him in Tucson for the landing
Then we get a picture of one footpad showing a light covering of material kicked up by the retro-rockets .
Any fine particles lofted during the landing will provide the first sample to look at with the microscopes on Phoenix .
The room gasps and cheers as Phoenix sends back the panoramic images .
The cameras are working superbly - we get more images back than we 'd ever managed during operations training .
As the small tilt indicated told us , we 've landed on a very flat plain .
But the landscape is far from featureless .
We see the surface cracked into polygons , a sign of the forces created by the ice we believe is just below the surface .
It will be difficult to control the urge to ask Phoenix to dig down as quickly as possible .
But Phoenix has exceeded our expectations and does n't deserve to be rushed .
So far , it has been the perfect traveller , sending us back a postcard on the day that it arrives .
SUNDAY 25 MAY - WAITING FOR PHOENIX Phoenix lands today .
The Imperial team is now in the US and we 're settling in to the Phoenix " microscopy house " , our home in Tucson , Arizona , for the three months of the mission .
Foil on the windows helps protect against " Mars lag "
In our case , settling in involves a little more than unpacking our suitcases - we 're also taping aluminium foil on the inside of all the bedroom windows .
The neighbours must be feeling rather worried about us , but there 's a good reason for what looks like the first signs of collective madness .
We 're going to be working on a shift system locked on Mars , not Earth , time .
As Mars has a twenty - four - and - a - half hour day we 'll be drifting in and out of synchronicity with our neighbours and , half the time , sleeping through the day .
We have experts from Harvard University helping us to overcome " Mars lag " - the continuous battle between our body clocks and a mission schedule working to Mars time .
Some of the tools were developed during the missions of the two rovers still trundling round Mars .
The foil will black out our rooms , helping promote melanin production when we need to sleep .
As well as potentially helping us to sleep better , installing the aluminium foil keeps us busy and gives us less time to worry - it 's difficult not to mentally replay what Nasa calls the " six minutes of terror " Phoenix will have to endure to get down to the surface of Mars .
But we can't long keep away from the heart of Phoenix activity on Earth - the science operations center , affectionately known as the SOC .
Hanna and I take the fifteen - minute drive from the microscopy house to where the mission will unfold after Phoenix lands .
But it 's now eerily quiet in the SOC .
Empty tables are arrayed in front of a huge screen round around which we will be gathering tomorrow .
We 'll be anxiously awaiting the first message at 1653 ( local time ) from Phoenix , telling us it has made it down to the surface in one piece .
A huge screen has been set up in the science operations center
To the side , an Earth - bound version of the lander , which we use for testing , stands quietly in a " stage set " of Mars while its brother is fast closing the last million miles to the planet 's surface .
There is a one - minute window directly after landing for Phoenix to send its safe - arrival message .
The lander will then concentrate on getting its power sources operational .
Two fan - like solar panels will unfurl to capture the weak sunshine of the Martian " Arctic " .
In the meantime , the orbiters already circling Mars will send back their accounts of the landing , including the running commentary sent by Phoenix to the spacecraft during its descent .
A copy of Phoenix is standing quietly on the " stage set "
By then , we should know Phoenix 's fate , with a second chance for confirmation about an hour after landing .
The two previous failed missions to Mars - the 1998 Mars Polar Lander and Beagle 2 in 2004 - took weeks before issuing their death certificates .
If the worst happens to Phoenix , we 'll know for sure the same day .
Tonight , the Phoenix microscope team will be sharing a last supper before landing .
It 's perfect weather for a barbecue round the pool at the microscopy house .
Fire and water - just the right ingredients for a final meal before Phoenix reaches Mars .
SUNDAY 18 MAY - A GRACEFUL LANDING ?
For the last nine - and - a half - months , the Phoenix spacecraft has been looping around the Sun , closing the distance between Earth and Mars .
While the spacecraft 's tasks have been few - checking out and preparing the instruments , and producing very slight adjustments to its course - we have been working hard in London preparing for the 90 - day mission .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Using a copy of the microscope station on its way to Mars , the Imperial team - Sanjay Vijendran and Hanna Sykulska and myself - have been testing out the operations in the lab .
Our aim has been to get to know the instrument ( the Microscopy , Electrochemistry , and Conductivity Analyzer - or Meca ) inside out before landing .
On Friday , we packed up our microscope to send to the Science Operations Center in Tucson , Arizona .
Its job there will be to help us understand the behaviour of its twin on the surface of Mars .
Now , we can do little more before Phoenix reaches Mars except worry .
Before launch last August , my kids scrawled " Go Phoenix ! " on the beach at Cape Canaveral , and we enjoyed a perfect pre-dawn launch as the Delta II rocket carrying Phoenix arced over the Atlantic .
It is almost time for them to scribe a new command in the desert sands of Arizona : " Stop Phoenix ! "
Big day
In a few day 's time , early on Monday morning , Phoenix will take just seven minutes to screech to a halt on the icy northern plains of Mars .
It will all be over , one way or another , before the first signal even reaches Earth .
No human intervention can overrule the landing sequence on the spacecraft computer that will set in motion first atmospheric entry , then a parachute descent and finally a thruster - controlled landing .
There are high hopes for Phoenix following its launch last year
While this sequence unfolds , we 'll be waiting in the Science Operations Center for the signals to come back from Phoenix .
Our colleagues and family will be there , including the " Meca babies " born to our instrument team in the years it has taken to prepare for the mission .
Their names , together with those of our colleagues who did not live to see Phoenix launch , form part of an eyetest chart for the microscope that is now hurtling towards Mars at 21,000 km/h ( 13,000 mph ) .
Phoenix will have a welcoming party - three orbiters already at Mars have been re-orientated to communicate with Phoenix before plasma blackout temporarily halts radio transmissions .
One of these , the Mars Express orbiter , will play paparazzo and attempt to snap Phoenix streaking through the atmosphere below on its way in to Mars .
Tense wait As Phoenix slows down , communication will be re-established and a parachute deployed .
As Mars only has 1 % of the Earth 's atmosphere this parachute does n't create enough drag to slow us down enough for a soft landing , and so thrusters give us the final braking to ensure we touch down at a mere 8 km /h ( 5 mph ) .
Meca carries an " eyetest chart " with dedications to friends and family
In contrast to the bouncing airbag approach used in the last three missions , this is what the mission 's principal investigator , Peter Smith , calls " landing gracefully " .
The first sample for our microscope will be collected during the descent - a mixture of atmospheric dust and material kicked up by our landing .
But it will be a few days before we get a chance to image this material .
In the meantime , the first images we should be seeing will be of the Phoenix lander and its immediate surroundings .
These photos might not be of huge scientific interest but we 'll all be feeling like proud parents in Tucson as we share these first pictures with the rest of the world .
Or we could all be standing dumbstruck as the images fail to appear and we realise the mission most of us have spent over a decade preparing for lies as one more piece of space junk on the cruel surface of Mars .

Rogue fathered many children , the Roguelikes , and together they went out into the world to harvest the souls of many a young hacker .
But the arrogance of Rogue 's children grew , and soon they started to form plots against each other .
Lesser clones fell by the wayside as two giants rose to power - the steadfast NetHack and the Angband collective .
There can only be one true heir to Rogue 's throne .
When the time comes , which side will you choose ?
NetHack , as played by an Angband fan
andare two popular roguelike computer games .
As they are both roguelikes , they are both turn - based dungeon crawlers , feature ASCII graphics in preference to 2D or 3D artwork , and are notoriously difficult to complete .
Despite the ' oldschool ' graphics the depth and difficulty of the games attract many fans , two of which are your favourite IconBar editors Jeffrey ' Phlamethrower ' Lee and Phil ' Monkeyson ' Mellor .
Unfortunately Jeffrey likes , and Phil likes .
This has resulted in many arguments and flame wars in the past , but now we 've decided to put aside our differences and try playing the other person 's game , in an attempt to settle once and for all the question of which is better - or

Creating a new character
The interface sucks
Things did n't get off to a good start .
After I creating a new character , and configuring the game so that I could move using the numeric keypad , I started exploring the dungeon .
I kept finding annoyances with the user interface - some tasks seemed needlessly laborious .
I got bored very quickly by opening doors manually , by being unable to run around corners or move through doorways diagonally .
I found some operations were needlessly duplicated for different contexts - there were different commands for opening doors and boxes , even though the end result would be the same - something would be opened .
Similarly , wearing armour and wielding weapons share a single command in Angband , but are different in NetHack .
I ended up fighting monsters using my metal boots because of this .
Other keystrokes are quite odd too - some priority keys are used for quite peripheral functions - O for options being one .
Logical perhaps , but a waste of a good key in my opinion .
I could n't find a quick way to identify monsters - pressing / , then y , then moving the cursor to the monster in question , then pressing .
was quite tedious compared to the * r method in Angband .
It was disappointing that the monster descriptions were only quotes from books , and did n't really contain anything obviously relating to the gameplay , unlike in Angband where the attacks and weaknesses of each monster are listed once you discover them .
This brings me to my main problem with NetHack : the lack of feedback .
Feedback
Like Angband , the game requires a considerable amount of experimentation , but NetHack does n't provide enough information or feedback to encourage this .
There was one point when I was trying to use a wand against a monster .
I had no idea whether the command to zap the wand to the right - z ( inventory letter ) 4 - had worked .
NetHack gave no prompt for a direction , and after ( presumably ) using the wand , it gave no feedback whatsoever .
Angband will provide some sort of message , even if the attempt was ineffective ( such as " nothing happens " , or " the monster is unaffected " ; ) - nothing from NetHack .
I found this very discouraging for a beginner - the command syntax and game rules are fairly complicated in any Roguelike game , and it was quite baffling when NetHack apparently ignored my actions completely .
I can understand the game wanting to demonstrate that the character is clueless about an object , but I would prefer that the game player is treated with more respect .
Harry Potter and the priestess of Mitra
Uninformed strategy
feels like an early text adventure where you have to guess the right verb and noun to solve a puzzle , and anything else gives the response " Mistake " , whereasfeels like a more sophisticated interactive fiction , with better responses for good , but incorrect , tries .
I 'm not one for making choices arbitrarily - I like my decisions to be informed ones .
That 's another reason why NetHack discourages me from playing ; Angband provides so much more feedback to the game player - information about your character 's status , equipment and inventory , along with that of your opponents , can be used to form a strategy .
At one point in NetHack I had picked up both a bow and a crossbow , but had no way of deciding which would be the better to use .
Angband provides basic information about the power of a weapon by default , and can provide more detail on its enchantments with an Identify spell ; I really missed that information in NetHack .
I could n't even work out the better weapon by testing their effectiveness against the monsters , because NetHack fails to provide any feedback on that either .
Angband shows how close to death a monster is , so you can tell whether you are having more effect than a papercut ; with NetHack , no idea at all .
It also makes it harder to decide when to cut your losses and run away - in Angband you might risk staying to deliver the final blow if you know you are likely to outlive the monster ; you can also pick off the weakest monsters first when fighting a group .
A bad player blames his tools ?
Even the shops lack information .
Potions and scrolls are n't identified , so you have no idea what you 're buying .
NetHack does n't disclose the weight of any item either , so working out which to drop when you are burdened becomes another guessing game .
It 's fairly easy to get a new character set up in Angband - you can easily visit the shops to acquire essential , basic ( and often life saving ) equipment and get your possessions identified ; in NetHack you start with a few items , but it 's not so easy to find anything else you need ( even if you find it , you have no clue if it 's any use ) .
After a couple of hours of playing NetHack , I was no wiser about the gameworld than when I started .
Apparently it 's possible to learn attributes of objects using a stethoscope , but I never came across one in my travels .
Exploring the dungeon
Bells and whistles
It seems thatcontinually punishes you for not having the right items , but gives you little opportunity to get them .
Food was my main problem .
My character went from satiated to hungry , then weak and fainting incredibly quickly ; most of my characters died from hunger , not in combat .
The constant search for food was rather tedious , and got in the way of real adventuring .
I can understand the role hunger plays in - it stops you loitering in the dungeon for too long - butoverplays this angle .
forced me to be a hunter gatherer in order to survive , whereas inI could just pop out to the shops .
Maybe I 'm too domesticated for the dungeon lifestyle ?
Even allowing for the difference in character representation ( I was quite surprised when a pile of rubble - : - started moving , and turned out to be a newt ) , I consider the NetHack display inferior to Angband's .
I think the status areas lack colour ( this could be an implementation issue , as I was running a terminal version ) - it 's easier to notice your hitpoints turn from green to yellow to red than to keep reading the numbers .
I was n't keen on how the dungeon maps were displayed either .
Angband shows corridors by indicating walls with # , so each corridor is a minimum of three characters across .
NetHack only displays the areas you can walk along and does n't show the walls at all , which makes navigation more tricky , because you can't tell the difference between a half - explored corridor and a dead end .
It also makes finding junctions harder .
That said , it 's less important in NetHack , because most ( all ? ) of the levels fit on a single screen , and feel cramped compared to Angband 's sprawling dungeons .
I prefer the Angband method because it allows for different styles of gameplay ; you can lead a monster to one corner of a room , then run around the dungeon and attack it at distance from behind , or use the landscape to your advantage by tunnelling diagonal corridors that protect you from summoned monsters , and you and monsters can flee further away .
NetHack felt quite confined in comparison , like 8 - bit single - screen platformers before they worked out how to do scrolling .
Another annoyance was that you could only fire weapons in the 8 compass directions , whereas Angband could target any location .
I realise it can provide a kind of strategy to the gameplay , but it seems one that exists because of the technical implementation rather than a true game design choice .
... Otherwise OK ?
Have I complained enough yet ?
I did like the gameplay when the interface and implementation did n't get in the way , and I was n't being held back by a lack of information .
It felt good fighting my way through the gnome mines , and a revelation when I found the town and shops down there .
There were some interesting monster attacks , such as the dust clouds that surrounded me and hid the map from view .
The Gauntlet style hacking and slashing gameplay was quite fun , but I just felt let down by the unstructured path through the game , and all the baffling rules and special cases .
NetHack is probably quite fun once you 've climbed the steep learning curve , but the pitiful interface , and substantial lack of information and feedback made it too annoying for me to persist with .

Designer babies
One of the first things I realised when creating my character in Angband was that the game reveals a lot more information during the character creation process than NetHack .
You 're also allowed to backtrack through the different steps , so you can easily try out different combinations of race and role and see what stats they generate , or to re-role using the current selection in order to update the random attributes .
While this style of character generation may appeal to some people , I 'm generally of the " You get what you 're given " mentality and are n't interested in getting a character with perfect stats right across the board .
Creating a new character
The town and shops
Non-persistent levels
On the subject of stats , also reveals a lot more information once the game starts .
For example , shops openly display what the items are that are on sale .
While this extra information is certainly useful , I 'm worrying if it results in the item identification aspect of the game being a bit too easy .
I 've grown rather fond of the tricksy shopkeepers in , and the way they take care of shoplifters .
Shoplifters ?
Yes , that 's right , inyou can shoplift , but not in .
In , shops just appear on the map as a room containing items and a shopkeeper , so you can interact with them in the same ways as any other room containing items .
There are many techniques for shoplifting , some more successful than others , but none of them are possible inbecause shops are just a single square on the map which take you to a seperate screen , limited to buying and selling items .
Talking about features that are missing from , there are another two big ones in the form of corpses and spirituality .
Corpses serve several purposes in - apart from adding a bit of extra realism , they can be eaten , offered to the gods , or resurrected .
Some monsters even have a habit of coming back to life .
Spirituality inis important because it affects how other monsters react to you , and can also be used to gain items or help from the gods by praying , offering sacrifices , or making donations to the church .
Getting back to , another thing that struck me was the plethora of gameplay options .
does have a good number of gameplay options , but they 're all set at compile time , and for official releases they 'll all be in the default settings . , on the other hand , allows you to change the options at runtime , to make the game harder or easier , or even to change some mechanics altogether .
Surely one of the boons of roguelikes is the prestige you get from your fellow hackers when you complete the game - but if everyone 's playing using different settings , how are people meant to judge how good they are ?
In particular , there 's one feature of Angband that I 've never been able to fathom - the ability to have non-persistent levels .
This basically means that you can run away from any danger at all just by going up or down one level in the dungeon , because when you return to the level you left it will have been regenerated afresh .
Non-persistent levels has also given rise to stair scumming - the art of going up and down a staircase until an ' interesting ' level is generated ( i.e. one likely to contain a good item ) .
And how does the player know that it 's a good level ?
The game announces the level type as the player enters .
And since stair scumming became so popular , they even added auto - scumming into the game as a toggleable option .
Pure lunacy .
If the boring levels are boring and no - one plays them , why not just remove the code that generates the boring levels ?
Exploring the dungeon
Combat
For people who do n't like non-persistent levels ( and stair scumming ) , you can thankfully turn persistent levels on .
However that option is n't enabled by default , so I was playing my game with non-persistent levels .
But why they chose to have non-persistent levels in the first place still escapes me .
They can't even use the excuse that it 's because a lot of travel between the surface and the dungeon is required in order to complete the game ( and thus new levels are required to stave off boredom or keep the player from running out of supplies ) , because most people will just use Recall scrolls to teleport straight from the dungeon to the surface and vice - versa .
As I went down into the dungeons , I found that the monsters there were fairly weak and easy to kill .
Part of this is because the Angband dungeon is deeper ( 100 levels as opposed to NetHack 's 30 + ) , and the other part is probably because I managed to choose one of the character roles that 's hardest to kill ( Warrior ) .
Combine this with Angband 's large levels and a string of ' uninteresting ' levels , and my first couple of hours of gameplay were fairly boring - spent exploring long corridors and chasing after monsters that were too scared to fight me .
The boringness of the levels , and general lack of items dropped by monsters , even meant that I had difficulty finding useful items such as weapons , armour or food - or even potentially self - harmful items such as scrolls or potions .
Luckily things started to get interesting when I reached levels 10 and 11 .
I began to encounter rooms full of ( weak ) monsters , guarding a ' unique ' monster - a much tougher mini-boss , if you will .
Out of the two or three uniques that I encountered , I was unable to kill them as we were evenly matched , and I was forced to retreat to the level above ( And throw away all hope of seeing the same unique again ) .
If I had actually picked up some useful items during the previous levels ( as opposed to practically nothing at all ) , then it may have tipped the balance in my favour and allowed me to defeat one .
Unique monsters
Death , there
A deeper dungeon , but less depth
Another ' interesting ' encounter was with a swarm of fruit flies .
They are a self - replicating swarm , that unless dealt with quickly can easily overrun the level and deal you a death of a thousand papercuts .
Lacking any area - of - effect attacks , my only available tactic was to attempt to seal them into the room they were in by closing the doors .
And then the next time I changed level , they'd be gone for good anyway .
But the reason I 'm mentioning the fruit flies is that ( to my knowledge ) there 's no creature like this in .
There are monsters that rise from the dead , or ones that summon help , or giant worms that grow in length , but none that self - replicate .
It 's certainly a very different type of monster to have to deal with , and put me in mind of a certain scifi show ( Which , unless you know me , probably is n't the one you 're thinking of ) .
Eventually my adventuring came to an end when I wandered into a magic trap .
The trap blinded me briefly , and when my vision returned I had a dark elven warrior ( and behind him a druid ) on one side and a hairy mold on the other .
Unaware of how many other monsters could be around me , I decided to try and retreat back the way I came - past the hairy mold - and to the safety of the staircase .
But the mold was proving quite difficult to kill , and by the time I had killed it the druid had teleported himself to the other side of me .
He quickly took the place of the mold , blocking my escape , and my death soon followed .
Traps are all over the place in , including monster traps like this one , but they appear to be a lot less common in .
I was also unprepared for the strength of the monsters it unleashed - I get the feeeling that the strength of monsters injumps up in leaps and bounds , compared to the more gradual climb in .
Either that or it was just bad luck from having so many easy levels previously ( And thus nothing to use to level - up my character with ) .
In conclusion - although Angband has a more developed UI than NetHack , it has several odd features that I just do n't agree with ( such as non-persistent levels ) , and it appears to lack many of NetHack 's features ( corpses , real shops , spirituality , dipping items into potions , etc. ) , making the gameplay shallower .
The way it constantly bombards me with statistics sometimes makes it feel more like a pen-and - paper D&D game rather than a computer game , where I need to obsess over stats of items and monsters if I 'm to stand a chance of progressing to the lower levels within a reasonable timeframe .
It may have been bad luck , but I also get the feeling that leveling - up in Angband ( to allow safe access to the next group of dungeon levels ) takes a lot longer than in NetHack .
Not only are NetHack 's levels smaller , but the monsters are therefore more densely packed , and they also have less chance of running away .
This makes leveling - up a much quicker process , compared to the endless corridors and cowardly monsters of Angband 's first few levels .
A conclusion , of sorts
Although at first glance NetHack and Angband may appear to be the same , in reality they are two very different games .
Angband has a clear focus on combat , with the myriad of statistics thrown at the player , and the rather light - hearted approach it takes to the logistics of dungeon life .
NetHack downplays the combat and is more focused on experimentation and even puzzle solving , requiring your character to gain knowledge of almost everything he encounters if he is to succeed .
NetHack , although having an underdeveloped UI , arguably has the deeper gameplay .
Angband deliberately lacks this because it is the foundation for many different variants that offer alternative or more sophisticated environments , skills and gameplay .
Perhaps it 's unfair to compare NetHack to vanilla Angband for this reason , but if the player does n't like the overall feel of Angband , how is a variant going to help ?
Angband is certainly the easier game for beginners to pick up , and possibly a good introduction to the Roguelike genre , whereas NetHack requires a lot of experimentation to uncover certain gameplay mechanics , to the point where you are unlikely to be able to complete the game without reading at least a couple of spoilers .
Much like religion , the version you are taught first is the one you believe to be good and true and proper .
The alternatives just do n't cut it .
You can relate to the core themes , but the differences in rules and implementations repel ; the problem with NetHack is that it is n't Angband , and vice versa .
There 's no solution to that , other than having a very open mind .
Or a wand of polymorph .

To understand the rental market , brokers and recent first - time renters recommend searching the Internet for listings and getting recommendations from friends who already live in the city .
That elusive $ 2,000 one - bedroom apartment , for example , can be found in neighborhoods like Harlem , Morningside Heights and Washington Heights , probably in a nondoorman building .
And the average price for studios is below $ 2,000 in the East Village , the Lower East Side and neighborhoods north of Midtown .
Most real estate agency
Web sites have guides that explain the intricacies of New York ’s rental world .
Citi Habitats sends agents to about 20 universities nationwide to offer seminars on what it takes to get an apartment .
Cullen Hilkene , an agent who ran a Citi Habitats seminar at Princeton University last week , said that prospective renters need to know the limitations the market might impose on them .
“ I give them information so they can figure out how they ’re going to be able to live in New York , ” he said .
“ It ’s better to know sooner rather than later that they need to bring in a roommate because they wo n’t be able to rent a studio on their own . ”
Alex Sooy , who moved into a two - bedroom near Union Square last June with his roommate , David Isaacs , said he knew the first thing they had to decide was whether to use a broker .
For placing you in an apartment , brokers typically charge 15 percent of the annual rent or 1.8 times the monthly rent , which means $ 3,600 on a $ 2,000 apartment .
Mr. Sooy said he tried looking online for no - fee apartments , “ but we would have to go to all these places on our own and work individually with the landlords and that was an overwhelming process . ”
Like many recent graduates , Mr. Sooy and Mr. Isaacs planned to travel after graduation and they had only three days to hunt for an apartment .
“ We hated to pay the fee , but it was the easiest way to look at a number of places in a row without having to do so much legwork ourselves , ” Mr. Sooy said .
Their goal was to find a $ 3,000 two - bedroom downtown .
They visited eight apartments with brokers from two firms before choosing one near Union Square with two real bedrooms , as opposed to ones carved out of a living room , for $ 3,600 .
They did not need guarantors because Mr. Sooy works for a consulting firm and Mr. Isaacs works for an investment bank and their combined income satisfied the landlord .
Mr. Sooy says his rent is much more than the $ 400 a month he paid when he was in school and it eats up more than 50 percent of his after - tax income .
“ I would prefer to have more disposable income , ” he said , “ but it ’s a good apartment and the location is great . ”
From mood swings to nausea , women accept some side - effects in exchange for reliable , hormone - based birth control , such as the Pill .
But that does n't mean they 're happy about it .
A recent study by the non-profit Guttmacher Institute found that half of American women who do n't want to be pregnant still are n't reliably using birth control , and even among those who are , four in 10 are n't satisfied with their current method .
Unfortunately , new options may be a long time coming .
Owing to a lack of funding and a general resistance to doing truly new research , birth control methods have not changed dramatically in 30 years .
What 's available
Making a choice about birth control is all about balancing effectiveness with side effects .
There 's no single solution that works for everyone , and while hormonal birth control tends to have more side effects , the Food and Drug Administration , as well as numerous research institutions , reports that it is safe .
Even the Ortho - Evra patch , recently linked to increased risk of pulmonary embolism ( clots that block blood flow to the lungs ) , is safer than you might think .
That 's something Dr. Jill Schwartz wanted to make clear .
Schwartz is a clinical research manager with CONRAD , a non-profit contraception and HIV prevention institute , based at the Eastern Virginia Medical School .
She said that while there is a greater risk of embolism with the Patch than with the Pill , pregnancy itself is still more of an embolism risk than either form of birth control .
Simply being safe , however , does n't mean that a product is going to be well - liked .
And there are n't a lot of options for women who dislike hormonal birth control but want the same high level of effectiveness .
In fact , out of all the non-hormonal contraceptives currently available , the FDA reports that only two , sterilization and intrauterine devices or IUDs , have failure rates comparable to hormonal methods .
" There does seem to be a lack of research from the public and private sector on new methods , " said Jennifer Rogers , director of programs and policy for the non-profit Reproductive Health Technologies Project in Washington , D.C .
The research gap
Between 1996 and 2004 , the sciences in general made big advancements , but birth control research failed to keep up , according to a 2004 paper published by the Board of Health Sciences Policy at the government - created non-profit Institute of Medicine in Washington , D.C .
Instead , the paper 's authors stated , most of the contraceptives created or introduced during that time were based on technology that already existed .
Worse , new researchers were n't coming on board to replace aging contraception scientists and , unlike many scientific fields , there was no centralized research organization or information clearinghouse dedicated to contraception .
So why is this field falling behind ?
Mostly , it 's money .
The Board of Health Sciences Policy said birth control research does n't get enough funding to support long - term studies or attract young scientists with new ideas .
Other experts say research into completely new types of birth control tends to come from public funding , and that 's been slipping .
For instance , the budget for the Contraceptive and Reproductive Health Branch of National Institute of Child Health and Human Development was cut from $ 50 million in 2004 to $ 35 million in 2007 .
That means fewer completely new options for women .
However , there have been improvements to existing products , such as pills that limit periods to four times a year .
That 's because drug companies tend to focus on improving , refining , and repackaging current contraceptive technologies , research which gets faster results for less cash .
New and improved
So what progress has been made ?
Plenty , if you 're looking at the improvements .
Thirty years ago , our mothers and grandmothers took birth control pills with doses of the hormone estrogren 20 times higher than what we take today .
As a result , they had higher rates of side effects .
That 's no longer the case .
In fact , Dr. Sheldon Segal of the Population Council , a non-profit research institution based in New York , said that much of today 's research is aimed at lowering those doses even further by administering hormones in new ways , such as via sprays .
Another promising option is an improved diaphragm , named SILCS .
Diaphragms are unpopular and women who do own them frequently fail to use them because they 're difficult to insert .
SILCS ' design is based on feedback from real women .
It 's one - size - fits - most , making it easier to purchase , while changes to contour and gripping surfaces make it easier to put in and more comfortable , so it 's more likely women will actually use it .
Dr. Schwartz at CONRAD said SILCS could hit stores by 2010 .
However , truly alternative methods are much further away from completion .
Some of the things to anticipate down the line : Non-hormonal vaginal rings , which would release drugs that immobilize sperm or block hormone function in the ovaries , and male birth control , both hormonal and not .
Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet
Benjamin Franklin took great interest in the promotion of spelling reform .
While living in London in 1768 he wrote A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling in which he proposed a fairly accurate phonetic system for spelling English .
The alphabet was published in 1779 in Franklin 's Political , Miscel­laneous , and Philosophical Pieces .
His new phonetic alphabet consisted all the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet , minus c , j , q , w , x , and y , which he thought redundant , plus six new letters for sounds which he thought lacked unambiguous orthographic representation .
The other letters all adhered to the principle of one symbol ( or unique digraph ) per sound .
Franklin commissioned a type foundry to prepare a suitable type including for the 6 new letters , but soon lost interest in his alphabet .
Notable features
Double vowels represent long vowel sounds , e.g. aa = [ a :] and ii = [ i : ] .
Only one accented letter appears in the alphabet : ê , which represents the a in mane and lane .
Consonant combinations are used to represent such sounds as the ch in chew and the j in jaw .

Much as the imperfections of the alphabet will admit of ; the present bad spelling is only bad because contrary to the present bad rules : under the new rules it would be good -- the difficulty of learning to spell well in the old way is so great , that few attain it ; thousands and thousands writing on to old age , without ever being able to acquire it .
' Tis , besides a difficulty continually increasing ; as the sound gradually varies more and more from the spelling : and to foreigners .

As President Bush calls for repealing a ban on drilling off most of the coast of the United States , a shortage of ships used for deep - water offshore drilling promises to impede any rapid turnaround in oil exploration and supply .
In recent years , this global shortage of drill - ships has created a critical bottleneck , frustrating energy company executives and constraining their ability to exploit known reserves or find new ones .
Slow growth in oil supplies , at a time of soaring demand , has been a major factor in the spike of oil and gasoline prices .
Mr. Bush called on Congress Wednesday to end a longstanding federal ban on offshore drilling and open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration , arguing that the steps were needed to lower gasoline prices and bolster national security .
But even as oil trades at more than $ 135 a barrel  up from $ 68 a year ago  the world ’s existing drill - ships are booked solid for the next five years .
Some oil companies have been forced to postpone exploration while waiting for a drilling rig , executives and analysts said .
Demand is so high that shipbuilders , the biggest of whom are in Asia , have raised prices since last year by as much as $ 100 million a vessel to about half a billion dollars .
As the Republican leader of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , he was in charge when earmarks for the “ Bridge to Nowhere ” and Coconut Road , were almost passed .
He voted twice for the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 , the results of which we are all suffering from now .
That one bill deregulated the energy futures market , which allowed Enron to operate free from federal regulation .
It also deregulated financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations , which are at the core of our subprime mortgage crisis today .
John Mica ’s poor judgment in voting for that bill is also responsible for your gas bill surging .
The Senate investigated the rigging of the oil market by speculators in the summer of 2006 .
They determined that market speculation contributed to rising oil and gasoline prices , perhaps accounting for $ 20 out of a $ 70 barrel of oil .
As much as 60 % of today ’s crude oil price is pure speculation driven by large investment banks and hedge funds .
Lastly , considering that the District is comprised of approximately 17 % veterans , John Mica just voted against the GI Bill .
The same GI Bill that he was a co-sponsor of .
He was for the GI Bill before he was against it .
Apparently he does n’t think that today ’s men and women of the armed forces deserve the same benefits that sent President George H.W. Bush , President Gerald Ford , President Jimmy Carter & Senator Bob Dole to college .

WA researchers investigating how blood vessel growth keeps cancers alive have made a world - first discovery that could boost the chances of successfully treating life - threatening tumours .
Western Australian Institute for Medical Research ( WAIMR ) Associate Professor Ruth Ganss and her team have found that a gene called RGS5 can reverse angiogenesis - the growth of blood vessels inside the tumour .
The discovery is published in the most recent edition of Nature , one of the world 's most prestigious scientific journals .
" It 's the uncontrolled growth of blood vessels and the formation of abnormal blood vessels inside tumours that ' feed ' them , allowing them to grow and stopping the immune system from wiping out the tumour , " said Associate Professor Ganss .
" What we 've shown is that RGS5 is a master gene in angiogenesis and that when it is removed , angiogenesis reverses and the blood vessels in tumours appear more normal .
" Importantly , this normalisation changes the tumour environment in a way that improves immune cell entry , meaning tumours can be destroyed and improving survival rates in laboratory tests . "
Reversing abnormal vessel growth represents a fresh approach to tackling angiogenesis , with most current research focusing on how to block or kill tumour - feeding blood vessels .
" We 've long - suspected this research would deliver advances in knowledge about what impacts tumour growth and this publication recognises the innovation and importance of our work , " said Associate Professor Ganss .
" By understanding what is actually going on in the tumour itself , the ultimate hope is that we 'll be able to work on making current therapeutic approaches even more successful and reducing side effects of them . "
Associate Professor Ganss ' breakthrough comes after joining WAIMR from Heidelberg where she worked at the German Cancer Research Center .
Last month , The Cancer Council Western Australia granted Associate Professor Ganss a Cancer Council Research Fellowship for continued work into tumour angiogenesis .
The majority of the discovery was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and part of the work was achieved using facilities at The University of WA based Centre for Microscopy , Characterisation and Analysis .
Earlier this month , a second paper by Associate Professor Ganss ' and her team was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation which describes how tumours can be attacked by the immune system with fewer side - effects .
" This discovery involves targeting tumours with inflammatory substances that change the environment , so immune cells can attack the tumour through blood vessels more effectively and lessen the amount of toxins going elsewhere in the body , " Associate Professor Ganss said .
WAIMR Director Professor Peter Klinken praised Associate Professor Ganss ' team saying their work was serving to further put WA on the scientific world map .
" This breakthrough is one of the most significant discoveries to come out of WAIMR .
The potential for this new knowledge to positively impact the lives of cancer patients in the future is very exciting , " he said .
" The fact that this breakthrough has come during our 10 - year anniversary celebrations is just fantastic . "

“ There is a total incompatibility between the joy of reading , a vagabond experience , and the experience of reading in order to answer questions , and explain what you understood . ” – Rubem Alves , Brazilian educator .
What is most likely to influence your success at school or at a job ?
The ability to read well .
And that goes for your kids too .
The declining literacy of our society has been a major concern of educators for a while now , and yet things are not getting better .
One reason might be a failure to recognize that reading and literacy are personal skills , best acquired when associated with pleasure .
In most cases , how well we learn to read will depend largely on our exposure to language as children .
If we hear people around us talking about a wide variety of subjects as children , we naturally pick up the words and phrases they use .
If we pick up a lot of words , we will have an advantage when we start reading , and we will learn to read better .
This , in turn , helps us to acquire more words , leaving the poor readers , who know few words , further and further behind .
The literacy divide usually begins early in life , and can only be overcome by lots of reading later in life .
Much of the traditional advice to struggling readers , these days , seems to involve developing “ cognitive strategies ” .
In this approach , readers are asked to focus more , to think , to be curious and ask questions , to analyze , to predict , to infer , and to monitor their understanding , or worse still to answer questions on their comprehension of what they have read .
In other words they are asked to become self - conscious readers .
I do not agree with this approach .
Here are my seven strategies for reading improvement .
1. Read about things that interest you .
If you are interested in what you are reading about , the words will come alive , and you will be motivated to understand .
You will feel satisfaction in accomplishing a task that you enjoy , and which you consider meaningful .
The more you read , the better you will become at reading .
Just get started and it will become a habit , as long as you are interested in what you are reading .
2. Read material that is at your level , or just a little difficult for you .
Read material that you find easy to read , or just a little challenging .
Looking up many unknown words in a conventional dictionary is tedious , and the results of the dictionary search quickly forgotten .
It is better to stay within your comfort zone and keep reading .
Soon you will be able to take on more difficult content .
3. Learn to read in depth , stay on the same subject for a while .
If you are familiar with the subject you are reading about , you will understand better .
Do not just read short articles .
Commit to books .
Stay with one author for at least one book .
If the subject matter is new to you , you should even try to read a few different books or articles about the same subject , before you move on .
This way you will meet the same vocabulary and ideas often , helping you to learn .
You will also be able to get deeper into the subject and your reading confidence will grow .
4 . If you have trouble reading , listen first .
Many great works of literature were written to be read out loud .
Learn to appreciate the art of the narrator .
Listen to audio books or audio files of the material that you are reading .
This will help make difficult content seem more familiar .
If you can hear the new words and phrases that you are reading , you will have an easier time understanding and remembering them .
Hearing the rhythm of someone reading a text will help your own reading .
5 . Let your imagination get involved .
Good readers get engrossed in their reading and let it trigger their imagination .
Learn to enjoy your reading without asking too many questions or analyzing too much .
It will just spoil the sensual enjoyment of the reading experience .
You do not need to predict or analyze .
Just enjoy and look forward to absorbing the information , ideas and thoughts expressed by the writer .
6 . Do n’t worry about what you do n’t understand .
Most of your reading should be for pleasure .
You can enjoy reading without understanding all of what you read .
You may even understand some things in your own personal way .
Neither you nor a teacher needs to “ monitor ” your understanding .
Learn to enjoy reading , even while feeling that you do not fully understand or remember what you have read .
7. Recognize that the key is to read a lot .
You may develop a system for keeping track of new words that you encounter in your reading , using lists , or Flash Cards , or other memory systems available on the Internet or elsewhere .
However , the main growth in your vocabulary and reading skill will come just from reading as much as you can .
So learn to enjoy reading and read a lot .
Keep reading , and you will become a better reader .
Unfortunately not all reading is just for pleasure .
When you are reading a textbook or manual , or report or other material that have to read for school or work , you may need to underline , take notes , and read some parts over again , in order to retain what you are reading .
However , if you have developed the habit of reading for pleasure , you will find that the cognitive techniques you need will come naturally , and that you will understand a lot better than before .

Divorces among laymen are often characterized by a lot of bickering , a midnight move into an efficiency apartment , and drawn - out battles over automatic kitchen appliances .
Celebrity divorces , however , are a little more complicated .
While these couples bicker too , the arguments tend to go beyond who is getting the family cat .
When celebrities split up , fortunes the size of a small college endowment are typically at stake , thereby taking the mudslinging and dirty tactics to a whole new level .
Here ’s a list of 20 of the most expensive celebrity breakups in recent history .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey is back on the Hill today , testifying to the House Judiciary Committee .
Paul Kiel is covering it at TPMmuckraker .
So far , he ’s dropped two big bombshells .
DOJ will not be investigating :
(1 ) whether the waterboarding , now admitted to by the White House , was a crime ; or
( 2 ) whether the Administration ’s warrantless wiretapping was illegal .
His rationale ?
Both programs had been signed off on in advance as legal by the Justice Department .
Cynics may argue that those are n’t bombshells at all , that the Bush Administration would never investigate itself in these matters .
Perhaps so .
But this is a case where cynicism is itself dangerous .
We have now the Attorney General of the United States telling Congress that it ’s not against the law for the President to violate the law if his own Department of Justice says it ’s not .
It is as brazen a defense of the unitary executive as anything put forward by the Administration in the last seven years , and it comes from an attorney general who was supposed to be not just a more professional , but a more moderate , version of Alberto Gonzales ( Thanks to Democrats like Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer for caving on the Mukasey nomination . ) .
President Bush has now laid down his most aggressive challenge to the very constitutional authority of Congress .
It is a naked assertion of executive power .
The founders would have called it tyrannical .
His cards are now all on the table .
This is no bluff .
Late Update : TPM Reader RF :
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
After a week of negotiations , Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines may be set to reveal merger plans as early as Tuesday , according to a media report Sunday .
The merger would expand Delta 's access to the fast - growing Asia market and create one of the world 's largest carriers .
A combination of Delta DAL , - 2.32 % and Northwest NWA , - 0.55 % would have nearly $ 30 billion in annual revenue and about 80,000 employees , knocking American Airlines parent AMR Corp.
AMR , from its position as the No. 1 U.S. airline and posing a challenge to the world 's largest , Air France - KLM AFLYY , - 4.76 % .
Delta was in talks over the weekend with its pilots , whose support of the deal may not be pivotal to the companies ' merger announcement as previously believed , The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter .
See Wall Street Journal story ( subscription required )
Talks with Northwest 's pilots are to take place at a later date .
Delta previously had said it would n't agree to merge without its workers ' approval , and it remains unclear if Delta would move forward if its pilots opposed the deal , according to the report .
A merger between Delta and Northwest has been in limbo since January because pilots could n't come to a compromise on seniority , which ultimately determines a pilot 's pay .
The deal still could be scuttled or prolonged as the airlines seek accord with the other company and their own labor unions , the Journal said .
A Delta-Northwest deal would be a surprising achievement after weeks of investor hand wringing as pilots attempted , failed and attempted again to reach an agreement over how to integrate their seniority lists .
Additionally , it has the potential to kick - off a new round of consolidation in the troubled industry , though antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice will have to weigh in first .
Both airlines ' stocks have had a volatile run since emerging from bankruptcy last spring , with shares trading significantly below their 52 - week highs on concerns the cooling economy could translate into less travel spending .
According to earlier reports , the new company would keep the Delta name and be based in Atlanta , with the current Delta CEO , Richard Anderson , in charge .
The proposed merger would give Delta a broader route network that could challenge rivals with more single - airline services and expands its access to Asia , a market some analysts believe is poised for substantial growth over the next ten years .
It also gives the carrier opportunities to weed out any unprofitable routes it might share with Northwest and increase its pricing power within certain markets .
That 's an important part of the deal that many analysts believe well help the surviving company to offset the sharp rise in fuel prices that have put several smaller carriers out of business in recent weeks .
However , antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice will look closely at exactly those types of opportunities before weighing in on whether the deal is anticompetitive .
United parent UAL Corp .'s UAUA proposed takeover of U.S. Airways LCC , in 2000 was blocked by the department on similar grounds along with concerns that the combination could trigger additional mergers .
It 's already widely expected that a Delta - Northwest merger would initiate further consolidation among major carriers .
Indeed , by agreeing to consolidate , Northwest has effectively given up a so - called golden share it held in Continental Airlines CAL , - 2.48 % , freeing its rival to pursue a deal of its own , possibly with UAL .
Once Delta and Northwest file notice with the agency , the Justice Department has 30 days before requesting additional information if the merger raises concern .
The agency generally determines whether an airline merger is anticompetitive by looking at overlapping city pairs to calculate the post - merger company 's market share .
If the department decides it's not in the country 's best interest for Delta and Northwest to merge , it could delay any industry consolidation for at least another year .
It 's possible for the deal to vaporize even before reaching the DOJ , as when UAL attempted to merge with U.S. Airways LCC , .
UAL dropped the idea in January , 2007 because of vocal opposition among some politicians .
Already state and federal forces are lining up against a Delta - Northwest tie up .
Minnesota politicians , including U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman and Gov. Tim Pawlenty , both Republicans , who have expressed concerns that a merger would take away state jobs and tax revenue .
Last month Pawlenty also reminded Northwest of its commitments to keep its headquarters and a hub in the state .
Also against the merger has been U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar , D - Minn. , head of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
" Further consolidation is not in the overall public interest , " Oberstar said in a January conference call with reporters .
" It reduces competition and it reduces services to the smaller communities .
We did not regulate the airlines in 1978 to create consolidation , but to expand competition . "
So far Delta and Northwest have played their consolidation strategy very carefully , sewing up contract agreements from its pilot union before proceeding .
More difficult has been integrating the company 's seniority lists - important for establishing pilot routes and pay levels .
Many analysts have said labor has the potential to make or break any airline consolidation as post - merger company will be dependent on employee cooperation and motivation to compete in a sector crowded with domestic and overseas rivals .

Airlines can't afford to spend money on much of anything beyond fuel these days , but that 's not stopping them from pouring cash into the technology that will let passengers surf the web at 36,000 feet .
Most of the systems they 're playing with are still being tested , but once running they could generate big money for an industry that desperately needs it .
We 've heard this before – the industry has been promising to bring the internet to commercial flights for at least four years now .
But the effort 's gaining momentum with at least four airlines planning to roll out in - flight internet access before long , and research suggests it could be a cash cow .
Multimedia
Intelligence says sales of in - flight digital broadband likely will exceed $ 1 billion by 2012 .
Two technologies have emerged so far , and with that kind of money to be made , several players are jockeying for position in what promises to be a big game .
Air - to - ground ( ATG ) uses frequencies to transmit signals from ground stations to aircraft in something of a
WiFi in the sky .
It uses existing infrastructure – cell towers – and so is relatively cheap to set up , but at 3 - Mbps ( buffering ... buffering ... ) throughput per plane , the connections are slow .
Satellite systems transmit signals using a data transceiver / router , satellite antenna , and 802.11b access points .
The big advantage over ATG is its availability – it works anywhere , including over water – and it is considered by some to be more robust with a data rate of about 30 Mbps per plane ( think low - end DSL ) .
But it costs more for airlines to set up , which is a big consideration for an industry that 's hemorrhaging cash .
The Illinois firm Aircell will outfit American
Airlines ' transcontinental 767 fleet with its air - to - ground product , and Virgin Atlantic Virgin America has signed on as well .
Southwest is testing a satellite system by the California company Row 44 , and Alaska Airlines is looking at it , too .
JetBlue just announced it 's pumping up its LiveTV
operation by buying Verizon 's Airfone network .
( Yes , Airfone , the guys who brought us those clunky seat - back credit - card phones you 've never actually seen anyone use . )
On the international side , Lufthansa has teamed up with T - Mobile , satellite operator SES Global and signal processing equipment maker ViaSat to offer a satellite based service .
It hopes the experience is more fruitful than its ill - fated 2004 deal with Boeing 's Connexion service , which crashed and burned when Boeing shut it down two years later .
For those worried about endless hours of coach class chatter , fear not .
U.S. carriers do n't plan to allow in - flight voice calls , though several foreign airlines are toying with the idea .
( BTW , we 've tried the service Air France is testing on European flights and can say it needs some work ) .
There has n't been much news about how airlines plan to charge for these services .
But with money tight these days , do n't expect to get something for nothing like you do with JetBlue 's DirecTV service .
And that brings up another good point :
These services cost money to test , install and operate .
If the industry 's cash crunch gets much worse , in - flight broadband might be mothballed before it even gets off the ground .

MUMBAI : With Iran , the world ���s fourth - largest oil producer , shifting its crude trading to the euro and the yen , instead of the US dollar , treasury managers feel that this could well be the first challenge to the US dollar���s dominance as currency of global trade .
On Wednesday , Iran decided to make all transactions with euros in Europe , and the Japanese yen within Asia .
This was largely triggered by the tensions between Iran and Washington for the past few years and lately , due to the weakening of the dollar .
Despite its weakened position against almost every currency last year , the dollar has continued to dominate as currency of trade .
Traders continue to use the greenback as it was a convenient currency .
While exporters stood to gain by billing in dollars , buyers did not always agree .
Also , there were logistics problems in carrying out trade in multiple currencies .
However , unlike other trading countries , the inconvenience of moving away from the dollar is not enough to deter Iran .
The Islamic republic���s decision to reduce exposure to the dollar is more political than economic with the United States ratcheting up sanctions because of a dispute over Tehran���s nuclear programme .
In December , an official said 90 % of its oil export earnings were outside the dollar .
�� �All of Iran���s oil trading is being done with the euro and the yen , ��� Hojjatollah Ghanimifard , international affairs director of the National Iranian Oil Company , told Fars News Agency .
���We agreed with all the buyers of Iran���s crude to trade oil in currencies other than the dollar , ��� he said .
�� �In Europe , Iran���s crude is being sold in the euro , in Asia in the euro and the yen , and trading with the yen has not only been in Japan .�� �
Other treasury managers said the impact on the dollar could be much more intense if other economies such as Saudi Arabia and Russia decide to follow suit .
Another forex manager added that much would depend on the bilateral deals between Iran and the countries buying oil from it and the former���s negotiating capabilities .
In the past , Iranian officials have said oil remained priced in the US dollar , but with actual payments carried out in other currencies .
Iran said it earned $ 70 billion from oil exports in the year to March , windfall revenues on the back of soaring crude prices .
International crude prices recently hit almost $ 120 a barrel while Iran media said Iranian crude had risen above $ 102 a barrel .
The United States , while leading efforts to isolate Tehran which it accuses of seeking nuclear weapons , has slapped sanctions on Iranian banks and other bodies , moves that prompted many foreign banks to cut dollar dealings with Iran or stop all business .
The UN Security Council has also imposed limited sanctions on Iran , which insists its nuclear plans are purely peaceful efforts to master skills to generate electricity .
A senior treasury manager with a multinational bank pointed out that all other commodities continue to be quoted in dollar terms and pricing of oil for Iran would certainly be an issue .
It would mean that Iran would have to continually keep track of the US dollar - euro and dollar - yen exchange rate movements for pricing purposes .
Iran is a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Developing Countries ( Opec ) and ranks amongst the world���s top three holders of proven oil and natural gas reserves .
Iran has also vowed to lower the volume of dollars in its foreign trade , apart from its foreign reserves .
Iran is OPEC ���s second - largest exporter after Saudi Arabia , and is the fourth - largest exporter of crude oil globally after Saudi Arabia , Russia , and Norway .
Natural gas accounts for half of Iran���s total domestic energy consumption while the remaining half is predominately oil consumption .
Protesters reject the Ahmadiyya claim that their founder was a prophet
About 2,000 people have gathered in the Indonesian capital , Jakarta , to protest against a minority Muslim sect , the Ahmadiyya community .
Speakers outside the presidential palace demanded the group be banned .
That was what a government panel recommended last week , saying the Ahmadiyya 's beliefs went against Islam as practised in Indonesia .
But the Ahmadiyya argue that , like other minorities , they are protected under the Indonesian constitution .
The Ahmadis believe their own founder , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , who died in 1908 in India , was a prophet .
That contradicts the belief of most Muslims , who think the Prophet Muhammad was the last prophet .
The Ahmadiyya face persecution in many countries .
Passions high
Sunday 's demonstration brought together hard - line Islamic groups and more established Muslim organisations - all believe that Ahmadis are non-Muslims .
Protesters fear Ahmadiyya beliefs could challenge mainstream Islam
As well as a ban , the speakers called on the protesters to drive the Ahmadiyya out of Indonesia .
The protesters clearly felt very strongly about this issue , reports the BBC's Lucy Williamson at the protest .
They see the Ahmadiyya 's beliefs as a threat to mainstream Islam - and many see a vote for pluralism as a vote for Western - style secularism , she says .
But President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is in a difficult position .
The constitution says Indonesians have a right to religious freedom .
The question is , our correspondent says , where the government will draw the line .
The Bush Administration has long been ridiculed by the international community as converting the United States from a leader in human rights to the very symbol of the violation of core principles of human rights .
However , few were prepared for the utter hypocrisy of watching the Administration condemn China for its use of torture on the very same time that President Bush vetoed a ban on the use of torture in the waterboarding bill .
Now China is using our torture program to defend its own abuses .
Chinese spokesman Qin Gang has accused the United States of “ exercising double standards on human rights issues ” in its condemnation of his country .
There is little question that we are applying a double standard when both the President and Congress has struggled to preserve a well - defined form of torture .
This hypocrisy will become more acute when our soldiers are waterboarded by other countries who will quote the President and various members of Congress in saying that it is perfectly appropriate .

A remarkable group of medical professionals and students were in place to bring medical care to local villagers for the first time ever .
Team Engeye knew when they met Susan that her needs far eclipsed the limited capabilities of the fledgling clinic which had no electricity or running water .
If she were to have a chance for a normal life , she would need to have access to sophisticated surgical techniques and extensive physical therapy in the United States .
It was a daunting task for anyone , but for this group of financially and academically - stressed medical students , it seemed almost insurmountable .
But now , fast - forward to early 2008 .
Susan will board a plane in Kampala , Uganda , on May 12th for an all - expenses - paid journey to the Shriner ’s Hospital in Boston where a team of surgeons and physical therapists will help her turn her life around .
The list of questions and hurdles that at times seemed endless is now a footnote in Susan ’s story .
Just weeks ago , it appeared that all the work and energy that had been invested on Susan ’s behalf might be for naught when John Kalule ’s travel visa was denied .
John is Engeye ’s co-founder and general manager who has donated his land and his life to the clinic , and who has been given legal responsibility for Susan ’s travel and medical decisions .
He is Team Engeye ’s priceless Ugandan connection , and is an essential link in the collaboration that makes this project unique .
Susan ’s visa was in - hand , but without John to chaperone her , the trip could not happen .
It was this last - minute crisis that would make team Engeye aware of just how resourceful , dedicated and passionate its network of friends could be .
Within hours of John ’s devastating phone call , with Susan in tears as her impossible dream seemed to be once again impossible , the wheels of compassion began to turn .
A virtual torrent of communications poured into the US Embassy in Kampala , Uganda , imploring that officials reconsider their decision , led by team members in Boston and Atlanta .
Congressman John Lewis ( D - GA ) , Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Senator Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) , Congressman Michael McNulty ( D - NY ) and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley ( Boston ) jumped into the fray , and either made personal phone calls to the embassy or offered extended assistance during Susan and John ’s stay in the United States .
By the next day , John ’s visa was approved .
In attempt to give Susan back all the years in school she never had , a scholarship fund has been set up to enable Susan to begin schooling upon her return to Uganda and continue through graduate education .
Please visit ChooseANeed.org to donate to Susan ’s scholarship and Engeye.org for Susan ’s entire story and links to updated blogs .
A photojournalist will accompany the next team to the clinic in February 2009 to document Susan ’s return to her new life in her village .
They welcome anyone who is interested in Susan ’s story to join her friends and supporters at the Boston Logan Airport at 2:30 PM on Monday , May 12th , to welcome Susan and John as they begin this incredible journey .

### Albany , NY , April 29 , 2008 --( PR.com ) --
Young Susan Nabukenya never expected to see the world outside the boundaries of her tiny Ugandan village .
Few of her friends or family did either .
Such is life in impoverished rural Africa .
However , Susan ’s prospects were far more dire than most .
A tragic and fateful day early in her childhood changed her life in one horrifying instant .
Her kerosene - stained dress had caught fire while she helped her mother cook a family meal over an open fire , and severe burns covered much of her tiny body .
Her burns had been left to heal with no medical supervision , and her badly scarred leg never had the chance to heal properly .
Walking inevitably re-opened her wounds , and the pain was excruciating .
Susan was denied most of the pleasures that makes childhood and adolescence special .
She could n’t play with her friends , and she was missing much of her schooling .
Susan ’s mother passed away shortly after the accident , leaving Susan with her paralyzed grandfather who could be of little help to her .
The prospects for this shy young woman were grim indeed .
Then one day in 2006 , word came to Susan that a small clinic had just opened its doors in a nearby village .
A remarkable group of medical professionals and students were in place to bring medical care to local villagers for the first time ever .
Team Engeye knew when they met Susan that her needs far eclipsed the limited capabilities of the fledgling clinic which had no electricity or running water .

2008 ’s best green websites
I ’ve just been trawling through the 50 websites that TIME.com are calling the “ Best Websites of 2008 ” and am struck by the lack of green websites on that list .
Considering that climate change is probably the biggest threat we as the human race face , and that we in the West are by now quite aware that it ’s our way of conducting our lives that is causing the problem , it ’s pretty astounding that there just are n’t more great websites out there that are guiding and helping us in an effort to change our ways .
Or are there ?
TIME.com included CarbonRally.com and Apartment Therapy as the only green sites worthy of a mention in their “ 50 Best ” .
Afrigadget.com was another site that could fall into this category , but that , according to TIME.com was the limit to great sustainability sites in 2008 .
Move over TIME.com , here are EcoStreet ’s “ Best Websites of 2008 ” , an eclectic mix of sites old and new , and they ’re a far greener best than yours .
I ’m adding another 7 sites to TIME. com ’s 3 to make it a Top 10 .

– David Tryse ’s Google Earth Files
David
Tryse is the chap who ’s taken the trouble to map out on Google Earth : the earth ’s disappearing forests , the worst oil spills in history , where the most endangered animals live , biodiversity , tribal lands and national parks .
An amazing view of what ’s really happening to our planet .
.
Lending a helping hand is easy .
Simply follow these four steps :
a. choose a film
Every film listed on Films Without Families meets two criteria : it has less than 50 * votes at the Internet Movie Database , and is available online .
b. download that film
Films are available either through Bittorrent or Emule .
BT is quicker and easier ; after you install a client ( such as μTorrent ) , you 're ready to go .
Torrents , however , can die quickly .
Emule , though slower , is more steady and has more available films .
c. watch the film
Once the film finishes downloading , watch it !
This is usually the best part .
d. blog about the film
Finally , once you 've seen the film , do a little write - up on it and , if you 'd like , post a link to that write - up in the comment section attached to the appropriate Films Without Families listing .
A federal judge is hitting the shuttered TorrentSpy service with a $ 111 million penalty for facilitating the infringement of thousands of copyrighted works .
U.S. District Judge Florence - Marie Cooper in Los Angeles , ruling in a case brought by the Motion Picture Association of America , said site operator Justin Bunnell and associates must pay the maximum $ 30,000 for " each of the 3,699 infringements shown . "
The case , producing what is among the largest fines in copyright history , was bolstered after the MPAA allegedly paid a hacker $ 15,000 for internal TorrentSpy e-mails and correspondence .
" This substantial money judgment sends a strong message about the illegality of these sites , " MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman said in a statement .
TorrentSpy , a U.S. - based torrent tacking service , shutteredin March after it lost its case against the MPAA .
TorrentSpy did not lose on the merits , but defaultedafter it failed to produce internal records .
No U.S. case has squarely addressed the legalities of BitTorrent tracking services , although one case is nearing a resolution .
Judge Cooper ordered TorrentSpy permanently shuttered .
TorrentSpy attorney Ira Rothken was not immediately available for comment .
He has appealed the default order to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
UPDATE
Readers are asking how the judge arrived at $ 30,000 for each violation .
Here is direct language lifted from the Copyright Act :
" ... the copyright owner may elect , at any time before final judgment is rendered , to recover , instead of actual damages and profits , an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action , with respect to any one work , for which any one infringer is liable individually , or for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally , in a sum of not less than $ 750 or more than $ 30,000 as the court considers just . "

A Houston couple has demanded that Miles be tested for sexually transmitted diseases after he allegedly forced the wife to kiss him at a holiday party .
He allegedly entered the St. Regis Hotel ballroom without invitation and pulled out a handgun — then forced the woman to kiss him .
He is also accused of brandishing the same gun at a Rockets game that same night .

Few figures in American history are more divisive , contradictory or elusive than Robert E. Lee , the reluctant , tragic leader of the Confederate Army , who died in his beloved Virginia at age 63 in 1870 , five years after the end of the Civil War .
In a new biography , Robert E. Lee , Roy Blount , Jr. , treats Lee as a man of competing impulses , a “ paragon of manliness ” and “ one of the greatest military commanders in history , ” who was nonetheless “ not good at telling men what to do . ”
Blount , a noted humorist , journalist , playwright and raconteur , is the author or coauthor of 15 previous books and the editor of Roy Blount ’s Book of Southern Humor .
A resident of New York City and western Massachusetts , he traces his interest in Lee to his boyhood in Georgia .
Though Blount was never a Civil War buff , he says “ every Southerner has to make his peace with that War .
I plunged back into it for this book , and am relieved to have emerged alive . ”
“ Also , ” he says , “ Lee reminds me in some ways of my father . ”
At the heart of Lee ’s story is one of the monumental choices in American history : revered for his honor , Lee resigned his U.S. Army commission to defend Virginia and fight for the Confederacy , on the side of slavery .
“ The decision was honorable by his standards of honor — which , whatever we may think of them , were neither self - serving nor complicated , ” Blount says .
Lee “ thought it was a bad idea for Virginia to secede , and God knows he was right , but secession had been more or less democratically decided upon . ”
Lee ’s family held slaves , and he himself was at best ambiguous on the subject , leading some of his defenders over the years to discount slavery ’s significance in assessments of his character .
Blount argues that the issue does matter : “ To me it ’s slavery , much more than secession as such , that casts a shadow over Lee ’s honorableness . ”
In the excerpt that follows , the general masses his troops for a battle over three humid July days in a Pennsylvania town .
Its name would thereafter resound with courage , casualties and miscalculation : Gettysburg .
In his dashing ( if sometimes depressive ) antebellum prime , he may have been the most beautiful person in America , a sort of precursorcross between Cary Grant and Randolph Scott .
He was in his element gossiping with belles about their beaux at balls .
In theaters of grinding , hellish human carnage he kept a pet hen for company .
He had tiny feet that he loved his children to tickle None of these things seems to fit , for if ever there was a grave American icon , it is Robert Edward Lee — hero of the Confederacy in the Civil War and a symbol of nobility to some , of slavery to others .
After Lee ’s death in 1870 , Frederick Douglass , the former fugitive slave who had become the nation ’s most prominent African - American , wrote , “ We can scarcely take up a newspaper . . . that is not filled with nauseating flatteries ” of Lee , from which “ it would seem . . . that the soldier who kills the most men in battle , even in a bad cause , is the greatest Christian , and entitled to the highest place in heaven . ”
Two years later one of Lee ’s ex-generals , Jubal A. Early , apotheosized his late commander as follows : “ Our beloved Chief stands , like some lofty column which rears its head among the highest , in grandeur , simple , pure and sublime . ”
In 1907 , on the 100th anniversary of Lee ’s birth , President Theodore Roosevelt expressed mainstream American sentiment , praising Lee ’s “ extraordinary skill as a General , his dauntless courage and high leadership , ” adding , “ He stood that hardest of all strains , the strain of bearing himself well through the gray evening of failure ; and therefore out of what seemed failure he helped to build the wonderful and mighty triumph of our national life , in which all his countrymen , north and south , share . ”
We may think we know Lee because we have a mental image : gray .
Not only the uniform , the mythic horse , the hair and beard , but the resignation with which he accepted dreary burdens that offered “ neither pleasure nor advantage ” : in particular , the Confederacy , a cause of which he took a dim view until he went to war for it .
He did not see right and wrong in tones of gray , and yet his moralizing could generate a fog , as in a letter from the front to his invalid wife : “ You must endeavour to enjoy the pleasure of doing good .
That is all that makes life valuable . ”
All right .
But then he adds : “ When I measure my own by that standard I am filled with confusion and despair . ”
His own hand probably never drew human blood nor fired a shot in anger , and his only Civil War wound was a faint scratch on the cheek from a sharpshooter ’s bullet , but many thousands of men died quite horribly in battles where he was the dominant spirit , and most of the casualties were on the other side .
If we take as a given Lee ’s granitic conviction that everything is God ’s will , however , he was born to lose .
As battlefield generals go , he could be extremely fiery , and could go out of his way to be kind .
But in even the most sympathetic versions of his life story he comes across as a bit of a stick — certainly compared with his scruffy nemesis , Ulysses S. Grant ; his zany , ferocious “ right arm , ” Stonewall Jackson ; and the dashing “ eyes ” of his army , J.E.B. “ Jeb ” Stuart .
For these men , the Civil War was just the ticket .
Lee , however , has come down in history as too fine for the bloodbath of 1861 - 65 .
To efface the squalor and horror of the war , we have the image of Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves , and we have the image of Robert E. Lee ’s gracious surrender .
Still , for many contemporary Americans , Lee is at best the moral equivalent of Hitler ’s brilliant field marshal Erwin Rommel ( who , however , turned against Hitler , as Lee never did against Jefferson Davis , who , to be sure , was no Hitler ) .
On his father ’s side , Lee ’s family was among Virginia ’s and therefore the nation ’s most distinguished .
Henry , the scion who was to become known in the Revolutionary War as Light - Horse Harry , was born in 1756 .
He graduated from Princeton at 19 and joined the Continental Army at 20 as a captain of dragoons , and he rose in rank and independence to command Lee ’s light cavalry and then Lee ’s legion of cavalry and infantry .
Without the medicines , elixirs , and food Harry Lee ’s raiders captured from the enemy , George Washington ’s army would not likely have survived the harrowing winter encampment of 1777 - 78 at Valley Forge .
Washington became his patron and close friend .
With the war nearly over , however , Harry decided he was underappreciated , so he impulsively resigned from the army .
In 1785 , he was elected to the Continental Congress , and in 1791 he was elected governor of Virginia .
In 1794 Washington put him in command of the troops that bloodlessly put down the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania .
In 1799 he was elected to the U.S. Congress , where he famously eulogized Washington as “ first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen . ”
Meanwhile , though , Harry ’s fast and loose speculation in hundreds of thousands of the new nation ’s acres went sour , and in 1808 he was reduced to chicanery .
He and his second wife , Ann Hill Carter Lee , and their children departed the Lee ancestral home , where Robert was born , for a smaller rented house in Alexandria .
Under the conditions of bankruptcy that obtained in those days , Harry was still liable for his debts .
He jumped a personal appearance bail — to the dismay of his brother , Edmund , who had posted a sizable bond — and wangled passage , with pitying help from President James Monroe , to the West Indies .
In 1818 , after five years away , Harry headed home to die , but got only as far as Cumberland Island , Georgia , where he was buried .
Robert was 11 .
Robert appears to have been too fine for his childhood , for his education , for his profession , for his marriage , and for the Confederacy .
Not according to him .
According to him , he was not fine enough .
For all his audacity on the battlefield , he accepted rather passively one raw deal after another , bending over backward for everyone from Jefferson Davis to James McNeill Whistler ’s mother .
( When he was superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy , Lee acquiesced to Mrs. Whistler ’s request on behalf of her cadet son , who was eventually dismissed in 1854 . )
By what can we know of him ?
The works of a general are battles , campaigns and usually memoirs .
The engagements of the Civil War shape up more as bloody muddles than as commanders ’ chess games .
For a long time during the war , “ Old Bobbie Lee , ” as he was referred to worshipfully by his troops and nervously by the foe , had the greatly superior Union forces spooked , but a century and a third of analysis and counteranalysis has resulted in no core consensus as to the genius or the folly of his generalship .
And he wrote no memoir .
He wrote personal letters — a discordant mix of flirtation , joshing , lyrical touches , and stern religious adjuration — and he wrote official dispatches that are so impersonal and ( generally ) unselfserving as to seem above the fray .
During the postbellum century , when Americans North and South decided to embrace R. E.
Lee as a national as well as a Southern hero , he was generally described as antislavery .
This assumption rests not on any public position he took but on a passage in an 1856 letter to his wife .
The passage begins : “ In this enlightened age , there are few I believe , but what will acknowledge , that slavery as an institution , is a moral & political evil in any Country .
It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages . ”
But he goes on : “ I think it however a greater evil to the white than to the black race , & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter , my sympathies are more strong for the former .
The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa , morally , socially & physically .
The painful discipline they are undergoing , is necessary for their instruction as a race , & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things .
How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence . ”
The only way to get inside Lee , perhaps , is by edging fractally around the record of his life to find spots where he comes through ; by holding up next to him some of the fully realized characters —
Grant , Jackson , Stuart , Light - Horse Harry Lee , John Brown — with whom he interacted ; and by subjecting to contemporary skepticism certain concepts — honor , “ gradual emancipation , ” divine will — upon which he unreflectively founded his identity .
He was n’t always gray .
Until war aged him dramatically , his sharp dark brown eyes were complemented by black hair ( “ ebon and abundant , ” as his doting biographer Douglas Southall Freeman puts it , “ with a wave that a woman might have envied ” ) , a robust black mustache , a strong full mouth and chin unobscured by any beard , and dark mercurial brows .
He was not one to hide his looks under a bushel .
His heart , on the other hand . . .
“ The heart , he kept locked away , ” as Stephen Vincent Benét proclaimed in “ John Brown ’s Body , ” “ from all the picklocks of biographers . ”
Accounts by people who knew him give the impression that no one knew his whole heart , even before it was broken by the war .
Perhaps it broke many years before the war .
“ You know she is like her papa , always wanting something , ” he wrote about one of his daughters .
The great Southern diarist of his day , Mary Chesnut , tells us that when a lady teased him about his ambitions , he “ remonstrated — said his tastes were of the simplest .
He only wanted a Virginia farm — no end of cream and fresh butter — and fried chicken .
Not one fried chicken or two — but unlimited fried chicken . ”
Just before Lee ’s surrender at Appomattox , one of his nephews found him in the field , “ very grave and tired , ” carrying around a fried chicken leg wrapped in a piece of bread , which a Virginia countrywoman had pressed upon him but for which he could n’t muster any hunger .
One thing that clearly drove him was devotion to his home state .
“ If Virginia stands by the old Union , ” Lee told a friend , “ so will I .
But if she secedes ( though I do not believe in secession as a constitutional right , nor that there is sufficient cause for revolution ) , then I will follow my native State with my sword , and , if need be , with my life . ”
The North took secession as an act of aggression , to be countered accordingly .
When Lincoln called on the loyal states for troops to invade the South , Southerners could see the issue as defense not of slavery but of homeland .
A Virginia convention that had voted 2 to 1 against secession , now voted 2 to 1 in favor .
When Lee read the news that Virginia had joined the Confederacy , he said to his wife , “ Well , Mary , the question is settled , ” and resigned the U.S. Army commission he had held for 32 years .
The days of July 1 - 3 , 1863 , still stand among the most horrific and formative in American history .
Lincoln had given up on Joe Hooker , put Maj. Gen. George G. Meade in command of the Army of the Potomac , and sent him to stop Lee ’s invasion of Pennsylvania .
Since Jeb Stuart ’s scouting operation had been uncharacteristically out of touch , Lee was n’t sure where Meade ’s army was .
Lee had actually advanced farther north than the town of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , when he learned that Meade was south of him , threatening his supply lines .
So Lee swung back in that direction .
On June 30 a Confederate brigade , pursuing the report that there were shoes to be had in Gettysburg , ran into Federal cavalry west of town , and withdrew .
On July 1 a larger Confederate force returned , engaged Meade ’s advance force , and pushed it back through the town — to the fishhook - shaped heights comprising Cemetery Hill , Cemetery Ridge , Little Round Top , and Round Top .
It was almost a rout , until Maj. Gen. O. O. Howard , to whom Lee as West Point superintendent had been kind when Howard was an unpopular cadet , and Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock rallied the Federals and held the high ground .
Excellent ground to defend from .
That evening Lt. Gen. James Longstreet , who commanded the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia , urged Lee not to attack , but to swing around to the south , get between Meade and Washington , and find a strategically even better defensive position , against which the Federals might feel obliged to mount one of those frontal assaults that virtually always lost in this war .
Still not having heard from Stuart , Lee felt he might have numerical superiority for once .
“ No , ” he said , “ the enemy is there , and I am going to attack him there . ”
The next morning , Lee set in motion a two - part offensive : Lt. Gen.
Richard Ewell ’s corps was to pin down the enemy ’s right flank , on Culp ’s Hill and Cemetery Hill , while Longstreet ’s , with a couple of extra divisions , would hit the left flank — believed to be exposed — on Cemetery Ridge .
To get there Longstreet would have to make a long march under cover .
Longstreet mounted a sulky objection , but Lee was adamant .
And wrong .
Lee did n’t know that in the night Meade had managed by forced marches to concentrate nearly his entire army at Lee ’s front , and had deployed it skillfully — his left flank was now extended to Little Round Top , nearly three - quarters of a mile south of where Lee thought it was .
The disgruntled Longstreet , never one to rush into anything , and confused to find the left flank farther left than expected , did n’t begin his assault until 3:30 that afternoon .
It nearly prevailed anyway , but at last was beaten gorily back .
Although the two - pronged offensive was ill - coordinated , and the Federal artillery had knocked out the Confederate guns to the north before Ewell attacked , Ewell ’s infantry came tantalizingly close to taking Cemetery Hill , but a counterattack forced them to retreat .
On the third morning , July 3 , Lee ’s plan was roughly the same , but Meade seized the initiative by pushing forward on his right and seizing Culp ’s Hill , which the Confederates held .
So Lee was forced to improvise .
He decided to strike straight ahead , at Meade ’s heavily fortified midsection .
Confederate artillery would soften it up , and Longstreet would direct a frontal assault across a mile of open ground against the center of Missionary Ridge .
Again Longstreet objected ; again Lee would n’t listen .
The Confederate artillery exhausted all its shells ineffectively , so was unable to support the assault — which has gone down in history as Pickett ’s charge because Maj.
Gen. George Pickett ’s division absorbed the worst of the horrible bloodbath it turned into .
Lee ’s idolaters strained after the war to shift the blame , but the consensus today is that Lee managed the battle badly .
Each supposed major blunder of his subordinates — Ewell ’s failure to take the high ground of Cemetery Hill on July 1 , Stuart ’s getting out of touch and leaving Lee unapprised of what force he was facing , and the lateness of Longstreet ’s attack on the second day — either was n’t a blunder at all ( if Longstreet had attacked earlier he would have encountered an even stronger Union position ) or was caused by a lack of forcefulness and specificity in Lee ’s orders .
Before Gettysburg , Lee had seemed not only to read the minds of Union generals but almost to expect his subordinates to read his .
He was not in fact good at telling men what to do .
That no doubt suited the Confederate fighting man , who did n’t take kindly to being told what to do — but Lee ’s only weakness as a commander , his otherwise reverent nephew Fitzhugh Lee would write , was his “ reluctance to oppose the wishes of others , or to order them to do anything that would be disagreeable and to which they would not consent . ”
With men as well as with women , his authority derived from his sightliness , politeness , and unimpeachability .
His usually cheerful detachment patently covered solemn depths , depths faintly lit by glints of previous and potential rejection of self and others .
It all seemed Olympian , in a Christian cavalier sort of way .
Officers ’ hearts went out to him across the latitude he granted them to be willingly , creatively honorable .
Longstreet speaks of responding to Lee at another critical moment by “ receiving his anxious expressions really as appeals for reinforcement of his unexpressed wish . ”
When people obey you because they think you enable them to follow their own instincts , you need a keen instinct yourself for when they ’re getting out of touch , as Stuart did , and when they are balking for good reason , as Longstreet did .
As a father Lee was fond but fretful , as a husband devoted but distant .
As an attacking general he was inspiring but not necessarily cogent .
At Gettysburg he was jittery , snappish .
He was 56 and bone weary .
He may have had dysentery , though a scholar ’s widely publicized assertion to that effect rests on tenuous evidence .
He did have rheumatism and heart trouble .
He kept fretfully wondering why Stuart was out of touch , worrying that something bad had happened to him .
He had given Stuart broad discretion as usual , and Stuart had overextended himself .
Stuart was n’t frolicking .
He had done his best to act on Lee ’s written instructions : “ You will . . . be able to judge whether you can pass around their army without hindrance , doing them all the damage you can , and cross the [ Potomac ] east of the mountains .
In either case , after crossing the river , you must move on and feel the right of Ewell ’s troops , collecting information , provisions , etc . ”
But he had not , in fact , been able to judge : he met several hindrances in the form of Union troops , a swollen river that he and his men managed only heroically to cross , and 150 Federal wagons that he captured before he crossed the river .
And he had not sent word of what he was up to .
When on the afternoon of the second day Stuart did show up at Gettysburg , after pushing himself nearly to exhaustion , Lee ’s only greeting to him is said to have been , “ Well , General Stuart , you are here at last . ”
A coolly devastating cut : Lee ’s way of chewing out someone who he felt had let him down .
In the months after Gettysburg , as Lee stewed over his defeat , he repeatedly criticized the laxness of Stuart ’s command , deeply hurting a man who prided himself on the sort of dashing freelance effectiveness by which Lee ’s father , Maj. Gen. Light - Horse Harry , had defined himself .
A bond of implicit trust had been broken .
Loving - son figure had failed loving - father figure and vice versa .
In the past Lee had also granted Ewell and Longstreet wide discretion , and it had paid off .
Maybe his magic in Virginia did n’t travel .
“ The whole affair was disjointed , ” Taylor the aide said of Gettysburg .
“ There was an utter absence of accord in the movements of the several commands . ”
Why did Lee stake everything , finally , on an ill - considered thrust straight up the middle ?
Lee ’s critics have never come up with a logical explanation .
Evidently he just got his blood up , as the expression goes .
When the usually repressed Lee felt an overpowering need for emotional release , and had an army at his disposal and another one in front of him , he could n’t hold back .
And why should Lee expect his imprudence to be any less unsettling to Meade than it had been to the other Union commanders ?
The spot against which he hurled Pickett was right in front of Meade ’s headquarters .
( Once , Dwight Eisenhower , who admired Lee ’s generalship , took Field Marshal Montgomery to visit the Gettysburg battlefield .
They looked at the site of Pickett ’s charge and were baffled .
Eisenhower said , “ The man [ Lee ] must have got so mad that he wanted to hit that guy [ Meade ] with a brick . ” )
Pickett ’s troops advanced with precision , closed up the gaps that withering fire tore into their smartly dressed ranks , and at close quarters fought tooth and nail .
Acouple of hundred Confederates did break the Union line , but only briefly .
Someone counted 15 bodies on a patch of ground less than five feet wide and three feet long .
It has been estimated that 10,500 Johnny Rebs made the charge and 5,675 — roughly 54 percent — fell dead or wounded .
As a Captain Spessard charged , he saw his son shot dead .
He laid him out gently on the ground , kissed him , and got back to advancing .
As the minority who had n’t been cut to ribbons streamed back to the Confederate lines , Lee rode in splendid calm among them , apologizing .
“ It ’s all my fault , ” he assured stunned privates and corporals .
He took the time to admonish , mildly , an officer who was beating his horse : “ Do n’t whip him , captain ; it does no good .
I had a foolish horse , once , and kind treatment is the best . ”
Then he resumed his apologies : “ I am very sorry — the task was too great for you — but we must n’t despond . ”
Shelby Foote has called this Lee ’s finest moment .
But generals do n’t want apologies from those beneath them , and that goes both ways .
After midnight , he told a cavalry officer , “ I never saw troops behave more magnificently than Pickett ’s division of Virginians .
. . . ” Then he fell silent , and it was then that he exclaimed , as the officer later wrote it down , “ Too bad !
Too bad !
OH ! TOO BAD ! ”
Pickett ’s charge was n’t the half of it .
Altogether at Gettysburg as many as 28,000 Confederates were killed , wounded , captured , or missing : more than a third of Lee ’s whole army .
Perhaps it was because Meade and his troops were so stunned by their own losses — about 23,000 — that they failed to pursue Lee on his withdrawal south , trap him against the flooded Potomac , and wipe his army out .
Lincoln and the Northern press were furious that this did n’t happen .
For months
Lee had been traveling with a pet hen .
Meant for the stewpot , she had won his heart by entering his tent first thing every morning and laying his breakfast egg under his Spartan cot .
As the Army of Northern Virginia was breaking camp in all deliberate speed for the withdrawal , Lee ’s staff ran around anxiously crying , “ Where is the hen ? ”
Lee himself found her nestled in her accustomed spot on the wagon that transported his personal matériel .
Life goes on .
After Gettysburg , Lee never mounted another murderous head - on assault .
He went on the defensive .
Grant took over command of the eastern front and 118,700 men .
He set out to grind Lee ’s 64,000 down .
Lee had his men well dug in .
Grant resolved to turn his flank , force him into a weaker position , and crush him .
On April 9 , 1865 , Lee finally had to admit that he was trapped .
At the beginning of Lee ’s long , combative retreat by stages from Grant ’s overpowering numbers , he had 64,000 men .
By the end they had inflicted 63,000 Union casualties but had been reduced themselves to fewer than 10,000 .
To be sure , there were those in Lee ’s army who proposed continuing the struggle as guerrillas or by reorganizing under the governors of the various Confederate states .
Lee cut off any such talk .
He was a professional soldier .
He had seen more than enough of governors who would be commanders , and he had no respect for ragtag guerrilladom .
He told Col. Edward Porter Alexander , his artillery commander , . . . the men would become mere bands of marauders , and the enemy ’s cavalry would pursue them and overrun many wide sections they may never have occasion to visit .
We would bring on a state of affairs it would take the country years to recover from . ”
“ And , as for myself , you young fellows might go to bushwhacking , but the only dignified course for me would be , to go to Gen .
Grant and surrender myself and take the consequences . ”
That is what he did on April 9 , 1865 , at a farmhouse in the village of Appomattox Court House , wearing a fulldress uniform and carrying a borrowed ceremonial sword which he did not surrender .
Thomas Morris Chester , the only black correspondent for a major daily newspaper ( the Philadelphia Press ) during the war , had nothing but scorn for the Confederacy , and referred to Lee as a “ notorious rebel . ”
But when Chester witnessed Lee ’s arrival in shattered , burned - out Richmond after the surrender , his dispatch sounded a more sympathetic note .
After Lee “ alighted from his horse , he immediately uncovered his head , thinly covered with silver hairs , as he had done in acknowledgment of the veneration of the people along the streets , ” Chester wrote .
“ There was a general rush of the small crowd to shake hands with him .
During these manifestations not a word was spoken , and when the ceremony was through , the General bowed and ascended his steps .
The silence was then broken by a few voices calling for a speech , to which he paid no attention .
The General then passed into his house , and the crowd dispersed . ”
They shocked the world and shamed America : photos taken by US soldiers of Iraqi prisoners being abused and humiliated .
But the images were used to cover up torture and murder , report Philip Gourevitch and Errol Morris in an extract from their new book
When Majid Ezzati thinks about declining life expectancy , he says , “ I think of an epidemic like HIV , or I think of the collapse of a social system , like in the former Soviet Union . ”
But such a decline is happening right now in some parts of the United States .
Between 1983 and 1999 , men ’s life expectancy decreased in more than 50 U.S. counties , according to a recent study by Ezzati , associate professor of international health at the Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) , and colleagues .
For women , the news was even worse : life expectancy decreased in more than 900 counties -- more than a quarter of the total .
This means 4 percent of American men and 19 percent of American women can expect their lives to be shorter than or , at best , the same length as those of people in their home counties two decades ago .
The United States no longer boasts anywhere near the world ’s longest life expectancy .
It does n’t even make the top 40 .
In this and many other ways , the richest nation on earth is not the healthiest .
Ezzati ’s finding is unsettling on its face , but scholars find further cause for concern in the pattern of health disparities .
Poor health is not distributed evenly across the population , but concentrated among the disadvantaged .
Disparities in health tend to fall along income lines everywhere : the poor generally get sicker and die sooner than the rich .
But in the United States , the gap between the rich and the poor is far wider than in most other developed democracies , and it is getting wider .
That is true both before and after taxes : the United States also does less than most other rich democracies to redistribute income from the rich to the poor .
Americans , on average , have a higher tolerance for income inequality than their European counterparts .
American attitudes focus on equality of opportunity , while Europeans tend to see fairness in equal outcomes .
Among Americans , differences of opinion about inequality can easily degenerate into partisan disputes over whether poor people deserve help and sympathy or should instead pull themselves up by their bootstraps .
The study of inequality attempts to test inequality ’s effects on society , and it is delivering findings that command both sides ’ attention .
Ezzati ’s results are one example .
There is also evidence that living in a society with wide disparities -- in health , in wealth , in education -- is worse for all the society ’s members , even the well off .
Life - expectancy statistics hint at this .
People at the top of the U.S. income spectrum “ live a very long time , ” says Cabot professor of public policy and epidemiology Lisa Berkman , “ but people at the top in some other countries live a lot longer . ”
Much is still unknown in this dynamic field , where Harvard is home to pioneers who first recognized income inequality as worthy of study and younger scholars at the forefront of its study today .
The variety of disciplines featured in presentations of the University ’s Multidisciplinary Program on Inequality and Social Policy -- economics , sociology , political science , public policy , health , medicine , education , law , and business -- highlights the field ’s broad importance .
Because of the subject ’s complexity and the scarcity of consistent data that would allow comparison between countries and across wide timespans , research findings are often highly specific or framed in the language of interesting coincidences , rather than as definitive conclusions .
Even when discernable patterns exist , there tend to be counter - examples ; for instance , the United States , with high inequality , has low life expectancy compared to Denmark and Finland , with very low inequality -- but in Spain and Italy , with inequality somewhere in between , life expectancy is even longer .
But the coincidences are intriguing indeed .
Research indicates that high inequality reverberates through societies on multiple levels , correlating with , if not causing , more crime , less happiness , poorer mental and physical health , less racial harmony , and less civic and political participation .
Tax policy and social - welfare programs , then , take on importance far beyond determining how much income people hold onto .
The level of inequality we allow represents our answer to “ a very important question , ” says Nancy Krieger , professor of society , human development , and health at HSPH : “ What kind of society do we want to live in ? ”
Keeping up with the Joneses
The united states is becoming even more unequal as income becomes more concentrated among the most affluent Americans .
Income inequality has been rising since the late 1970s , and now rests at a level not seen since the Gilded Age - - roughly 1870 to 1900 , a period in U.S. history defined by the contrast between the excesses of the super - rich and the squalor of the poor .
Early in the twentieth century , the share of total national income drawn by the top 1 percent of U.S. earners hovered around 18 percent .
That share hit an all - time high in 1928 -- when top earners took home 21.1 percent of all income , including capital gains -- then dropped steadily through the next three decades .
Amid the post - World War II boom in higher education , and overall economic growth , the American middle class swelled and prospered , and the top 1 percent of earners took home less than 10 percent of all income through the 1960s and 1970s .
Since then , the topmost 1 percent have seen their share rise again : it shot past 15 percent in 1996 and crested at 20.3 percent in 2006 , the most recent year for which numbers are available .
To describe the distribution of income inequality in the United States , Allison professor of economics Lawrence F. Katz likes to use the analogy of an apartment building .
“ Over the last 25 years , ” he says , “ the penthouse has gotten really , really nice .
All sorts of new gadgets have been put in .
The units just below the penthouse have also improved a lot .
The units in the middle have stayed about the same .
The basement apartment used to be OK , but now it ’s gotten infested with cockroaches and it ’s been flooding . ”
( See graph , page 26 . )
The argument that none of this matters as long as the overall economy is growing — that a rising tide lifts all boats , as President John F. Kennedy famously said — is the subject of vigorous academic review , with mixed results , but it may not be the most important question .
Picture a buoyant luxury cruise ship surrounded by dilapidated dinghies , full of holes and on the verge of sinking .
The fact that the tide has lifted them does not mean they are doing well .
This is a concept social scientists call relative deprivation .
The idea is that , even when we have enough money to cover basic needs , it may harm us psychologically to see that other people have more .
When British economist Peter Townsend developed his relative deprivation index in 1979 , the concept was not new .
Seneca wrote that to be poor in the midst of riches is the worst of poverties ; Karl Marx wrote , “ A house may be large or small ; as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small , it satisfies all social requirement for a residence .
But let there arise next to the little house a palace , and the little house shrinks to a hut . ”
Investigating whether relative deprivation and the negative emotions it engenders help explain why the poor have worse health than the rich in most societies began with epidemiologist Michael Marmot ’s study of British civil servants in the 1960s and 1970s .
Marmot found that the lower - ranking bureaucrats had elevated levels of stress hormones compared to their high - status coworkers , even though the low - ranking workers still had job security , a living wage , decent hours , and benefits .
Others have found similar links .
Examining health outcomes for identical twins raised together — pairs that shared genes and environment —
Nancy Krieger found that when the twins became adults , if one was working class and the other professional , the working - class twin ’s health was , on average , worse .
There is little question that it is bad for one ’s health to be poor .
Americans at the 95th income percentile or higher can expect to live nine years longer than those at the 10th percentile or lower .
The poor are more likely to develop illnesses such as diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , and cancer , and there is evidence that relative deprivation and the stress it engenders are involved .
When high inequality and rising top incomes shift society ’s accepted standards of living upward , it seems that people experience deprivation even when they have adequate food , clothing , and shelter .
The official U.S. poverty rate — 12.3 percent in 2006 — is relatively low , but scholars agree that number is essentially meaningless .
The poverty threshold was developed in 1965 based on the cost of a grocery budget “ for temporary or emergency use when funds are low , ” multiplied by three .
It was “ arbitrary , ” says Wiener professor of social policy Christopher Jencks , “ but once it was adopted , it was politically impossible to change it . ”
That threshold has been adjusted for inflation , but does not take into account the fact that housing prices , energy prices , and certain other costs have grown faster than the consumer price index ( CPI ) .
“ Going to movies , eating out at restaurants , going on occasional vacations , having Internet access and a cell phone — none of these things are in the federal poverty level , ” says Ichiro Kawachi , professor of social epidemiology at HSPH and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School ( HMS ) .
“ What matters for functioning in society is what the average person is able to do . ”
During the same period , the Gallup Poll definition of the poverty line — based on asking people how much income they need not to feel deprived — has risen much more steeply than the CPI .
Kawachi , who grew up in Japan , believes a predominant consumption culture in the United States exacerbates relative deprivation .
“ The Japanese have a very strong culture against conspicuous displays of affluence , ” he says .
“ When I was a child growing up in suburban Tokyo , it was very difficult to distinguish , by dress or anything else , rich kids from poor kids — whereas in America , bring it on ! ”
As further evidence of a correlation between inequality and consumption culture , he points to national spending on advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
The top - ranked countries on this measure , according to United Nations ( UN ) data , are Colombia , Brazil , and Venezuela — countries with inequality levels among the highest in the world — but also Australia , New Zealand , the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) , and the United States , countries with higher inequality than similarly prosperous peers .
Japan comes second only to Denmark in terms of equal - income distribution among its inhabitants , according to United Nations data .
And life expectancy at birth for the Japanese is 82.3 years , compared to Americans ’ 77.9 years , even though per-capita GDP in the United States is about $ 10,000 more than in Japan .
“ It ’s pretty clear that an egalitarian ethos runs along with the idea of having strong safety nets and protecting the health of the most vulnerable , ” says Kawachi , who also directs HSPH ’s Center for Society and Health .
“ And that ’s reflected in national health statistics . ”
The United States ranks twenty - first among the 30 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) in terms of life expectancy , and twenty - fifth in terms of infant mortality .
Kawachi and others have found that the U.S. counties with the most income inequality stack up poorly on health measures , and as mortality rates have fallen nationwide , they have fallen most slowly in states where income inequality increased the most — a cause for concern , whatever the explanation .
American Exception ?
One widely used measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient , named for Italian statistician Corrado Gini , who first articulated the concept in 1912 .
The coefficient measures income distribution on a scale from zero ( where income is perfectly equally distributed among all members of a society ) to one ( where a single person possesses all the income ) .
For the United States , the Gini coefficient has risen from .35 in 1965 to .44 today .
On the per-capita GDP scale , our neighbors are Sweden , Switzerland , and the U.K. ; on the Gini scale , our neighbors include Sri Lanka , Mali , and Russia .
( Even with this basic measure of inequality , it is difficult to get comparable data for all countries , and some other sources find a much wider gap between the United States and Russia .
For instance , the Luxembourg Income Study ranks Russia at .43 and the United States at .37 , and does not even list Sri Lanka and Mali . )

The recent increase in inequality reflects a migration of money upward as salaries have ballooned at the top .
In 1965 , the average salary for a CEO of a major U.S. company was 25 times the salary of the average worker .
Today , the average CEO ’s pay is more than 250 times the average worker ’s .
At the same time , the government is doing less to redistribute income than it has at times in the past .
The current top marginal tax rate — 35 percent — is not the lowest it ’s been — there was no federal income tax at all until 1913 — but it is far lower than the 91 - percent tax levied on top earners from 1951 to 1963 .
Meanwhile , forces such as immigration and trade policy have put pressure on wages at the bottom .

Tax policies and employer - pay practices affect income distribution directly .
But what governs these pay practices , and why have American voters and politicians chosen the tax policies they have ?
One answer lies in Americans ’ unique attitudes toward inequality .
Asked by the International Social Survey Programme whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement that income differences in their home country are “ too large , ” 62 percent of Americans agreed ; the median response for all 43 countries surveyed — some with a much lower degree of inequality — was 85 percent .
Americans and Europeans also tend to disagree about the causes of poverty .
In a different survey — the World Values Survey , including 40 countries — American respondents were much more likely than European respondents ( 71 percent versus 40 percent ) to agree with the statement that the poor could escape poverty if they worked hard enough .
Conversely , 54 percent of European respondents , but only 30 percent of American respondents , agreed with the statement that luck determines income .
It makes intuitive sense that those who view poverty as a personal failing do n’t feel compelled to redistribute money from the rich to the poor .
Indeed , Ropes professor of political economy Alberto Alesina and Glimp professor of economics Edward L. Glaeser find a strong link between beliefs and tax policy : they find that a 10 - percent increase in the share of the population that believes luck determines income is associated with a 3.5 - percent increase in the share of GDP a given nation ’s government spends on redistribution ( see “ Down and Out in Paris and Boston , ” January - February 2005 , page 14 ) .
These attitudes , in turn , are rooted in U.S. history , says Christopher Jencks , whose 1973 book Inequality examined social mobility in the United States .
Jencks has been studying inequality and social class since the 1960s , and has written dozens of journal articles , essays , and book chapters , as well as four more books , on the subject .
He looks back to the Constitution ’s framers , who enshrined property rights as sacred and checked the government ’s ability to control the national economy .
“ The founding fathers did n’t want the government to do that much , ” he says .
The Constitution is structured in such a way that it is harder to change than the constitutions of Europe ’s welfare states , where left - leaning groups have succeeded at writing in change .
By and large , Alesina and Glaeser write , the U.S. Constitution “ is still the same document approved by a minority of wealthy white men in 1776 . ”
And the “ vestiges of feudalism ” in European society make leftist arguments appealing there , whereas American politicians ’ rhetoric has emphasized individual agency since the time of George Washington ( who wrote in 1783 that if citizens “ should not be completely free and happy , the fault will be intirely their own ” ) .
The authors cite a 1980s history curriculum for public schools in California ( “ hardly the most right - wing of states , ” they note ) that instructed , “ A course should assess the role of optimism and opportunity in a land of work : the belief that energy , initiative , and inventiveness will continue to provide a promising future . ”
An alternative , and possibly complementary , explanation points to the United States ’s particular place in geography and history .
Jencks also finds this persuasive .
“ The highest levels of inequality are found in the New World and not the Old , for reasons we do n’t understand , ” he says ( see chart above ) .
Societies with higher inequality also tend to have higher crime rates , although it ’s not clear which way the causal arrow runs , or if it exists .
“ These are societies built on conquest , many of them on slavery , ” Jencks adds .
“ A lot of the inequality may just be the legacy of those things . ”
Former colonies such as Haiti and Namibia inhabit the top end of the Gini scale , with coefficients of .59 and .74 , respectively .
But there are exceptions to the pattern : the low end of the scale includes transitional economies that are far from rich ( Belarus and Moldova , with coefficients of .30 and .33 ) , and former colonies ( Ethiopia and Laos , with coefficients of .30 and .35 ) .
For all the scholarly study , consensus on whether the Gini coefficient can , in and of itself , say something good or something bad about a country is still lacking .
Still , scholars are using what evidence does exist to ask , and test , whether the United States has things in common with Sri Lanka , Mali , and Russia , as it undoubtedly does with Sweden , Switzerland , and the U.K .
The excesses of the Gilded Age led , in the decades that followed , to a backlash in the form of the minimum wage and other labor laws to protect workers , business and financial - market regulation to protect consumers , social safety - net programs — Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid — and infrastructure investment to benefit all .
But as the United States moves from a period of relatively balanced income distribution back into higher inequality , it remains to be seen whether these twentieth - century developments will enable the country to escape the problems that often accompany high inequality .
Left Out At The Bottom
An argument commonly made in inequality ’s defense is that it serves to motivate .
Here , Kawachi cites evidence from the sports world .
A 1990 study of golfers found that they performed best in professional tournaments , where the spread in the size of the prize money is widest .
Similarly , a study of professional auto racers found that performance improved as the spread in the size of the various prizes widened .
So inequality may act on the human psyche to elicit hard work and high achievement — but it also may make us more individualistic .
In a study of baseball players , teams with wider pay dispersion performed more poorly — and so did individual players within those teams .
“ In a world in which each individual is looking out for themselves , players will tend to concentrate on improving their own performance to the exclusion of team goals , since their own performance is what matters for moving up the pay scale , ” Kawachi and Bruce P. Kennedy ( a former HSPH professor who passed away this year ) wrote in The Health of Nations : Why Inequality Is Harmful to Your Health .
“ Concentrating on trying to hit more home runs or improving one ’s own hitting average are not necessarily the tactics that lift team performance — as opposed to , say , practicing great defense . ”
This gets at the ways inequality may affect the fabric of society .
Perhaps motivated by inequality and the prospect of getting ahead , Americans work longer hours than their European counterparts — about 200 more hours per year , on average , than the British , and 400 more hours per year than the Swedes .
Again , there are counter - examples ( the Japanese work almost as much as Americans do , just 50 hours less a year ) , but in any case , time spent at work is time not spent with friends or family , and this has its own implications for health .
As an outreach worker in San Francisco in the 1970s , Lisa Berkman noticed that her clients in the North Beach and Chinatown neighborhoods — poor or working - class , but with the strong social connections typical of immigrant communities — had far better health than her clients in the gritty Tenderloin district , who were much more socially isolated and disconnected from one another .
The link between social integration and mortality risk became the subject of Berkman ’s dissertation at Berkeley , where she earned her Ph.D. in 1977 .
At the time , the idea that social ties could protect health was radical .
Now it is accepted wisdom — and a factor that , Berkman believes , helps to explain the extraordinarily high life expectancy in Spain and Italy .
But the danger of disconnectedness may go beyond being less happy or even less healthy .
Kawachi and Kennedy cited a wealth of evidence that increasing income inequality goes hand in hand with a decrease in “ social capital , ” a concept akin to community involvement that incorporates , among other things , social relationships , trust , reciprocity among friends and neighbors , and civic engagement .
( Malkin professor of public policy Robert Putnam made a similar argument in his seminal 2000 book Bowling Alone . )
Letting social capital atrophy means a less cohesive populace that , at the extreme , leaves entire classes of people disadvantaged and excluded .
“ The big worry , ” says Lawrence Katz , “ is creating something like a caste society . ”
As American neighborhoods have become more integrated along racial lines , they have become more segregated along income lines and , some research indicates , with regard to all manner of other factors , including political and religious beliefs .
( The Big Sort , a new book by journalist Bill Bishop , examines this evidence . )
What ’s more , even along racial lines , American society is still far from integrated .
Sociologist David R. Williams , Norman professor of public health and professor of African and African American studies , has examined racial discrimination and health in the United States and elsewhere , including South Africa , where in 1991 , under apartheid , the “ segregation index ” was 90 , meaning that 90 percent of blacks would have had to move to make the distribution even .
“ In the year 2000 , ” says Williams , “ in most of America ’s larger cities — New York City , Detroit , Chicago , Milwaukee — the segregation index was over 80 . ”
Only slightly lower , that is , than under legally sanctioned apartheid .
When a society is starkly divided along racial or ethnic lines , the affluent are less likely to take care of the poor , Glaeser and Alesina have found .
Internationally , welfare systems are least generous in countries that are the most ethnically heterogeneous .
Those U.S. states with the largest black populations have the least generous welfare systems .
And in a nationwide study of people ’s preferences for redistribution , Erzo F.P. Luttmer , associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School ( HKS ) , found strong evidence for racial loyalty : people who lived near poor people of the same race were likely to support redistribution , and people who lived near poor people of a different race were less likely to do so .
Differences in skin color seem to encourage the wealthy to view the poor as fundamentally different , serving as a visual cue against thinking , “ There but for the grace of God go I . ”
Alesina ’s work investigates this cognitive process as an explanation for the high crime rates in less equal societies .
Rather than following the common - sense explanation that the poor see what the rich have and covet it , leading to burglary and violent crime , Alesina argues that as the incomes of the rich and poor diverge , so do their interests .
Members of a relatively equal society find it relatively easy to reach agreement about what the purpose and priorities of a legal system should be .
But if the rich favor protecting property , while the poor care more about preventing and punishing interpersonal violent crime , the lack of consensus will produce a weak system that fails to meet the desires of either group .
In one essay , his colleague Glaeser offers this apocalyptic prediction : “ Great gaps between rich and poor may …hurt democracy and rule of law if elites prefer dictators who will protect their interests , or if the disadvantaged turn to a dictator who promises to ignore property rights . ”
This does n’t seem possible in a democracy such as the United States , where each citizen ’s vote carries the same weight regardless of income ( the electoral - college system notwithstanding ) .
In fact , given the shape of the income distribution , it seems that Americans would elect leaders whose policies favor the poor and middle class .
Mean household income in 2004 was $ 60,528 , but median household income was only $ 43,389 .
More than half of households make less money than average , so , broadly speaking , more than half of voters should favor policies that redistribute income from the top down .
Instead , though , nations — and individual states — with high inequality levels tend to favor policies that allow the affluent to hang onto their money .
Filipe R. Campante , an assistant professor of public policy at HKS and a former student of Alesina ’s , thinks he ’s discovered why .
After investigating what drives candidates ’ platforms and policy decisions , Campante has concluded that donations are at least as influential a mode of political participation as votes are .
Previous research has shown that voter turnout is low , particularly at the low end of the income spectrum , in societies with high inequality .
Again , this is counterintuitive : in unequal places , poor people unhappy with government policies might be expected to turn out en masse to vote , but instead they stay home .
Campaign contributions may provide the missing link .
Candidates , naturally , target voters with money because they need funds for their campaigns .
And since the poor gravitate toward parties that favor redistribution and the wealthy align themselves with parties that do not , campaign contributions end up benefiting primarily parties and candidates whose platforms do not include redistribution .
By the time the election comes around , the only candidates left in the race are those who ’ve shaped their platforms to maximize fundraising ; poor voters , says Campante , have already been left out .
In a study of campaign contributions in the 2000 U.S. presidential election , he found that higher income inequality at the county level was associated with fewer people contributing to campaigns , but contributing a larger amount on average — so the haves participated , and the have - nots did not .
The solution , he says , is not to scrap the system altogether in favor of full public financing , but to enact contribution limits strict enough to level the playing field .
He views contributions not as bribery or buying policy , but as a legitimate form of civic engagement .
“ The ideal system , ” he says , “ would be a system where you have a really broad base of contributors that are contributing relatively small amounts .
… You want parties to be responsive to voters .
Donations are a way in which parties are made responsive to voters . ”
Buffers Against Inequality
The effects of relative deprivation can come in a form more tangible than stress or low self - esteem .
Krieger uses the example of a job interview .
In a society where the average person has a cell phone , it can hurt one ’s job chances not to have one .
Wearing old clothes to a job interview might be interpreted as a sign of not taking the interview seriously , when in fact the problem is inability to afford a new outfit .
Bad teeth , which require money to fix , can trigger disgust in prospective employers and even hold people back from making friends .
“ Your income , ” Krieger says , “ can decline to a point where you ’re no longer able to participate meaningfully in society . ”
Stress can also make people behave in ways they otherwise would n’t .
David Williams believes that the “ hierarchy of needs ” framework helps explain why , the poorer people are , the less likely they are to take care of their health .
The framework , developed in 1943 by psychologist Abraham Maslow , defines the needs that motivate human behavior and the priority people assign to those needs .
Physiological needs ( eating , sleeping , breathing ) form the foundation ; not until those needs are met can people pursue needs in the higher categories ( in succession : safety , love / belonging , esteem , and self - actualization ) .
“ If people are worried about their basic needs of survival and security and food and shelter , ” says Williams , “ they cannot worry about the fact that a cigarette , which is providing relief from stress now , is going to cause lung cancer 20 years from now .
If you can address the basic needs so people are no longer worried about them , you free them to consider those larger , higher - level needs that have long - term consequences for their well - being . ”
Lisa Berkman ’s latest project aims to let low - wage workers focus on such higher - order needs .
In a study of nursing - home employees , Berkman found that nursing assistants , janitors , and kitchen workers had far less flexibility than higher - status workers in terms of being able to leave work if a family member fell ill , and that this lack of flexibility was related to increased risk of heart disease and chronic sleep problems .
Now she is following nursing homes and retail establishments to see what happens when they implement more flexible policies .
If workers in high - demand , low - wage jobs can spend more time with their families and stop worrying about getting fired if they need to handle an emergency , she says , “ workplace policies may have a profound effect on health . ”
Improving living conditions in poor neighborhoods is another way to alleviate poverty ’s ill effects even in the absence of income redistribution , says Williams .
The poor are more likely to smoke , to eat poorly , and to lead sedentary lives .
These are personal choices — but every choice is made in context , and one ’s surroundings affect the choices one makes .
“ When people live in areas where there are n’t supermarkets that sell fresh fruits and vegetables , their intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is dramatically lower , ” he says .
“ If people live in areas where there are n’t sidewalks , where there are n’t safe bike paths and places to walk and playgrounds , or where the rate of crime is so high that it ’s not safe to go outside , then their level of exercise is much lower and their rates of obesity are higher . ”
Building parks and sidewalks and bringing farmers ’ markets to poor neighborhoods , then , makes it easier for residents to make healthy choices .
Another category of initiatives aims at improving living conditions for poor people by giving them vouchers to move to better neighborhoods , but the details are important , says Dolores Acevedo - Garcia , an HSPH associate professor of society , human development , and health .
She is helping design the public - health component of one such program .
Stemming from a landmark 2005 desegregation court case , it has already enabled about 1,300 former tenants of Baltimore public housing to move to suburban communities .
“ What people are expecting , ” she says , “ is that if people move to a new neighborhood , they ’re automatically going to do better .
Well , in fact , a lot of this is about connecting people to resources ” : for example , helping them find landlords who will rent to them — not the easiest thing in an unfamiliar neighborhood .
The aid does n’t stop there .
Many doctors in affluent communities do n’t accept Medicaid ; Acevedo - Garcia ’s proposal would have case workers help clients find doctors who do , and in some cases persuade doctors to start .
“ People may be used to doing their shopping at a convenience store or a liquor store , ” she says ; case workers will tell them which grocery store has good produce at low prices , and where to catch the bus that will take them there .
Something as simple as taking the new residents to a park can make a difference , she says : “ They may not be used to the idea of exercising outside if they came from a neighborhood that was not safe . ”
Unequal Chances
“ Adults ’ economic status is positively correlated with their parents ’ economic status in every society for which we have data , ” write Christopher Jencks and Laura Tach , a doctoral student in sociology and social policy , “ but no democratic society is entirely comfortable with this fact . ”
The prospect of upward mobility forms the very bedrock of the American dream , but analyses indicate that intergenerational mobility is no higher in the United States than in other developed democracies .
In fact , a recent Brookings Institution report cites findings that intergenerational mobility is actually significantly higher in Norway , Finland , and Denmark — low - inequality countries where birth should be destiny if inequality , as some argue , fuels mobility .
In the United States , the correlation between parents ’ income and children ’s income is higher than chance : 42 percent of children born to parents in the bottom income quintile were still in the bottom quintile as adults , and 39 percent of children born to parents in the top quintile remained in the top quintile as adults , according to the Brookings analysis .
But it is difficult to see whether mobility is increasing or decreasing , because it would require comparing specific individuals ’ incomes to their parents ’ incomes , against the wider backdrop of income distribution across society at that time .
Because data with that level of detail do not exist for earlier periods , scholars ca n’t say with certainty whether the results represent an increase or a decrease in mobility from other periods in American history .
Americans ’ steadfast belief in mobility probably stems from increases in absolute , rather than relative , mobility .
As the overall economy mushroomed throughout the nation ’s history , the majority of people exceeded their parents ’ income .
Recall Katz ’s apartment building analogy ; rather than tenants moving from one floor to another , the entire building was shifting ever higher on a hill .
But “ if anything , ” Alesina and Glaeser write , “ the American poor seem to be much more ‘ trapped ’ than their European counterparts , ” in the sense that fewer people who start life in the bottom quintile ever make it out .
This is puzzling given American society ’s emphasis on fairness and openness .
Lee professor of economics Claudia Goldin and Katz detect an explanation in the increasing cost of college tuition .
In 1950 , the average tuition price at a private college was roughly 14 percent of the U.S. median family income ; public college tuition was even lower ( only 4 percent ) .
Percentages for both types of institutions fell further in the ensuing decades , bottoming out around 1980 , but then rising steeply ever since .
In 2005 , the cost of attending the average public college was 11 percent of median family income ; for private colleges , the average was 45 percent .
There is financial aid , but not enough , and the system “ can be harder to crack than Fort Knox , ” Katz and Goldin write in their new book , The Race between Education and Technology .
For most of the twentieth century , the average American exceeded his parents ’ education level by a significant margin : between 1900 and 1975 , the average American ’s educational attainment grew by 6.2 years , or about 10 months per decade .
Then , between 1975 and 1990 , the authors find that there was “ almost no increase at all ” ; from 1990 to 2000 , there was a gain of just six months .
Although college graduation rates for women are still rising steadily , for men they have barely increased since the days of the Vietnam draft .
At the same time , the “ college wage premium ” has also increased .
In 1975 , the average college graduate ’s hourly wage was 24 percent higher than the average high - school graduate’s .
By 2002 , that number had risen to 43 percent .
Katz and Goldin say this increase indicates higher demand for workers with college degrees , even as computers have eliminated the type of jobs a high - school - diploma recipient or mediocre college graduate would have done 25 years ago : clerical work , basic accounting , middle management .
Technology has exerted downward pressure on those workers ’ pay , explaining stagnating wages at the middle and bottom of the income distribution .
The United States once led the world in the rate at which its citizens finished college ; it now falls in the middle of the OECD pack .
It could lead again if Americans made a decision to fund higher education the way they chose to fund universal public high - school education early in the last century .
“ If you had made people borrow money to go to high school in the early twentieth century , ” says Katz , “ you would n’t have seen the same sort of expansion . ”
But as technology continues to advance , if Americans do not break down barriers to higher education , the authors foresee an even more acute shortage of highly trained workers — and , other things being equal , a further increase in inequality .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A
Navy admiral engaged in sexual relations in the White House in 1990 with a federal employee whom he falsely told he was a widower , according to a report released Friday by the Defense Department .
Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff .
In March , when the report was submitted to Pentagon officials , Rear Adm .
John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff .
Stufflebeem told investigators he could n't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with .
He also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman , identified as " Jane Doe , " the Defense Department 's inspector general 's report said .
Jane Doe , who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency , told the investigators the allegations were true , the report said .
Her supervisor and Stufflebeem 's superiors supported her testimony .
Stufflebeem was convicted April 18 of making false official statements to investigators .
After the hearing , called an admiral 's mast , he requested retirement .
Jane
Doe told investigators that she and Stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989 , that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times , including once in a White House room reserved for " military aides with overnight duties . "
She also told investigators that Stufflebeem came to her home on the day in August 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him " scum , " shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again .
Read the report ( PDF )
" We found Ms. Doe to be an extremely credible , candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband , " the report said .
By contrast , the report said , Stufflebeem 's testimony was " inconsistent with the weight of the evidence , " and " it did not appear Stufflebeem 's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent . "
At issue was Stufflebeem 's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990 .
Stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his White House post because of " close family personal problems . "
But his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair .
Jane Doe 's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from Doe , she confirmed Stufflebeem 's marital status and told Doe what she 'd learned .
" Ms. Doe 's reaction , according to the supervisor , was one of complete surprise and shock , " the report said .
The supervisor also said that she telephoned Stufflebeem 's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up , the supervisor told her that " everybody in town knew Boomer was f'ing some bimbo at the [ federal agency ] . "
Stufflebeem , however , denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with Jane Doe , although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an " inappropriate relationship " with her because he told her about his marital problems .
" I did not have sex with this woman , " he said during one of two interviews with investigators .
Although he told investigators he could not remember the woman 's name , he testified that he " had to live with shame for a long time " after the " inappropriate relationship " ended , that he was " racked with guilt " and " had a terrible time getting myself right with my family . "
" So I have had a great 18 - year career since I left the White House , " he said , according to the report .
" If this is the end of it , then I still leave a rewarded individual , thankful for the blessings that I have had . "
Investigators found Stufflebeem 's remarks inconsistent .
" In our view , comments regarding guilt , shame , and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss , " they wrote in the report .
This year , according to the report , the inspector general 's office provided Stufflebeem with its preliminary findings : that he 'd provided " false and misleading testimony " regarding the nature of his relationship with Jane Doe , his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower .
Stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial .
" [ I ] find it extremely regrettable , in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career , that you have chosen to question my integrity , " he wrote in a February 15 letter .
" The unfortunate truth in this case is that , as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations , you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as I defended myself against these allegations . "
Stufflebeem further castigated the investigators because , at that time , they had chosen not to interview Jane Doe " in deference to Ms. Doe 's privacy , " according to the report .
Doe " readily agreed " to testify when they contacted her after Stufflebeem 's rebuttal .
" Ms. Doe confirmed that she and Stufflebeem had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months , " the investigators wrote .
" The relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions , to include intercourse during overseas travel , in the White House and in her home . "
Doe also said Stufflebeem told her that his wife had died of breast cancer , that a woman who answered the phone when she called his home was the children 's nanny and that he continued to wear his wedding ring " for his daughters who missed their late mother . "
According to the report , the investigation began when investigators received an anonymous letter containing " significant " details about the affair .
Investigators had received another such letter in 1999 , but it contained no detail and was not investigated .
Stufflebeem became well known in the initial months of the war in Afghanistan , when he often conducted on - camera television briefings as a Pentagon spokesman .
He was then deputy director for global operations on the Joint Staff .
He was commander of the 6th Fleet from May 2005 to September 2007 .
During that time , he was deputy commander of Naval Forces Europe , joint force maritime component commander in Europe , commander of strike and support forces for NATO , and allied commander with Joint Command Lisbon .

Comparing People to Hitler
By : Isaac “ Absent ” Amirian
Being a truly advanced white person means being able to speak with authority about pretty much any field of conversation - especially politics .
In order for white people to streamline the process of knowing everything , all human beings can be neatly filed into one of two categories : People I Agree With , and People Who are Just Like Adolf Hitler .
Comparing people to Hitler is an easy way for white people to get a strong point across to the less enlightened , or the insufficiently white .
Everyone knows who Adolf Hitler was .
And everyone knows that Hitler was very , very bad .
Therefore , if a white person really , REALLY , does n’t like something or
someone , he or she may angrily say something to the effect of , “ This is exactly the same kind of thing that Hitler used to do ! ” accompanied by varying levels of profanity based on blood - alcohol content .
No matter what your gut reaction may be at that point , do not disagree with that white person .
Otherwise , well , you love Hitler .
This time - tested white - person maneuver may seem so awesomely useful to you that you are tempted to go out and try it right now .
Not so fast .
White people have spent the last 30 years perfecting this technique .
There are cultural guidelines .
It ’s also critical that you avoid the fatal mistake of getting creative and comparing people you do n’t like to other evil dictators , such as Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro .
With few exceptions , white people are actually fond
of almost any dictator not named Hitler , and your remark that “ this is just like something Mao Zedong would do ” will be met with blank stares and possible social alienation .
This is because , with the exception of Hitler ,
oppressive dictators share a passion for many of the things white people love - such as universal health care , conspiracy theories , caring about poor people while being filthy rich , and cool hats .
Stick to the script and
compare things you do n’t like to Hitler , and Hitler alone .
Now , like most reasonable people , you might find this strategy distasteful , and even a bit disrespectful , since after all , Hitler was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions , and probably does n’t have that much in common with Pat Robertson , in perspective .
If you prefer to avoid hearing or using the Hitler technique , we recommend you speak in soothing , affirming tones around angry white people to prevent the phenomenon from manifesting , and change the subject tactfully .
To something that does n’t involve George

A Santa Clara County sheriff 's deputy was charged Thursday with two misdemeanor manslaughter charges after he ran down three competitive bicyclists in his patrol car in Cupertino , killing two and injuring the third .
Deputy James Council faces up to two years in county jail if convicted of vehicular manslaughter in the March 9 deaths of Matt Peterson , 29 , of San Francisco , and Kristy Gough , 30 , of San Leandro .
The deputy has been on administrative leave from the sheriff 's office since the crash .
Council crossed the center line on Stevens Canyon Road in Cupertino and struck the three cyclists at 10:25 a.m. on a Sunday , authorities said .
Witnesses at the scene said there were no skid marks and that the officer said he had fallen asleep at the wheel .
He was 4 1/2 hours into his shift after working a 12 1/2 - hour shift the day before , Council 's attorney has said .
Misdemeanor charges , rather than felonies , were warranted because Council was not engaged in serious reckless driving , such as running a stop light , and he did not have drugs or alcohol in his system , Assistant District Attorney David Tomkins said .
A GPS device in Council 's patrol car and witnesses indicated that he was not speeding at the time of the crash , Tomkins said .
The California Highway Patrol , which investigated the crash , recommended misdemeanor charges when it forwarded the case to prosecutors in April .
Prosecutors took more than two months to make a charging decision in order to reanalyze a sample of Council 's blood at a Pennsylvania lab to look for traces of over - the - counter or prescription medication , Tomkins said .
" We wanted to make sure , " Tomkins said .
" That 's why we ordered a more sophisticated drug screening . "
The sample was taken about four hours after the crash , he said .
Council was booked into the Santa Clara County jail Thursday and released on $ 5,000 bail , prosecutors said .
His attorney , Mary Sansen , did not return a call seeking comment .
" It 's kind of tough .
He 's a friend of mine and I saw him today , " sheriff 's Sgt. Don Morrissey said .
" We wish him well .
We have faith in our system of jurisprudence and that it will treat him fairly . "
Anthony Borba , a captain of Gough 's Third Pillar Racing Team and a friend of Peterson's , said he was concerned about officers being put behind the wheel after working lengthy shifts .
" My concern is not that they throw this guy in jail , " Borba said .
" My concern is taking a hard look at who was responsible and whether they were negligent .
If drugs and alcohol were n't involved , I think we need to look at the department , his commanding officer and why he was put in a car in that state .
It was an entirely avoidable accident if someone is alert and awake . "
[ UPDATE , 7/14 : A remarkable animation depicting the pulsing flow of Arctic sea ice over a stretch of years moved to the “ jump ” page because it was slowing the loading of Dot Earth for some users . ]
The Drudgeosphere was all pumped up today about the “ shock claim ” in the ( UK ) Independent that the sea ice that normally persists year - round at the North Pole ( I stood on it in March , 2003 ) will be replaced by open water later this summer .
Given the unpredictable short - term dynamics up there , which make the ice subject to vagaries of Siberian winds and a mix of currents , a lot of polar ice experts tell me it ’s pretty much impossible to make such a prediction with high confidence .
In fact , the Independent ’s story — the opening sentences and headline at least — go way beyond what Mark Serreze of the National Snow and Ice Data Center tells the reporter .
As early as May , ice experts were putting good odds on having open water at the North Pole .
[ UPDATE 11 p.m. : Gavin Schmidt of Realclimate.org muses on why the media hyperventilate over polar non-news developments . ]
One way or the other , it ’s clear that , by the end of the 1990s , the veneer of ice on the Arctic Ocean had shifted to a far more tenuous state , with ever less thick , years - old ice like the floes I camped on when I went with the team setting up the annual North Pole Environmental Observatory .
The animation above shows that the ice was flushed out , not melted .
Most of the seasoned Arctic ice experts I ’ve canvassed for recent stories see the region exhibiting a mix of natural variability in the ice ( like the flushing process ) and a long - term trend toward less of it in summer , and more of it being fresh - made each season , and thus thin and easy to melt .
Most also are convinced the change is now at least partly driven by human - caused global warming .
Their various projections are laid out in monthly Sea Ice Outlook reports .
Right now the odds are essentially even on a 2008 match for the dramatic ice loss last year .
Here ’s what trends looked like leading to last year ’s remarkable ice vanishing act :
Many foes of greenhouse - gas restrictions and skeptics on the strength of climate science have pointed out that the world ’s total sea-ice area has n’t changed appreciably when you add up the ice in the Arctic and the sheath of sea ice that annually forms in winter around Antarctica ( but disappears in austral summers ) .
The Antarctic sea ice ( distinct from the massive ice shelves fringing the continent and ice sheets inland ) has , in fact , been expanding in recent years .
You can compare the differences by clicking here for Arctic and Antarctic trends .
But scientists studying trends at both poles say there is nothing inconsistent with the intensifying greenhouse effect .
William Chapman , who maintains the helpful Cryosphere Today Web site at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , sent me an email this morning reminding me of a 2005 study that projects more Antarctic sea ice ( by volume ) in a warming world .
“ Yes , sea ice seems to behaving as the consensus of the climate models have been projecting – more rapid and larger response in the northern high latitudes than anywhere else , flat to possible increase in [ southern hemisphere ] sea ice as warming takes hold , ” he wrote .
Here ’s where the extent of sea ice in the Arctic stands now in relation to the average tracked between 1979 and 2000 , and the remarkable ice loss in 2007 :
PERHAPS you will recall a recent political dust - up over a certain proposed gas tax holiday ?
The issue was highly problematic for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , but she did n't warm to the idea until well after Republican presidential nominee John McCain had made it a key plank in his economic plan for the nation .
This would be , you 'll recall , the same proposal of which it could be said that no economist was a supporter ( well , almost no economist ) .
The Wall Street Journal , however , has conducted a survey of economists , asking who they felt was the most fiscally responsible candidate in the race .
The results ?
Almost half of the economists in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey decided against answering a question on which presidential candidate offers the most responsible fiscal policies .
However , Sen. John McCain was the clear favorite of those who answered the question .
An odd choice , one would think .
But maybe those economists are focusing on issues other than the gas tax .
Of course , just a few weeks ago , the Economist had this to say :
He is asking voters to trust him .
He has been a fiscally conservative senator , so he will be a fiscally conservative president .
Never mind that , as a candidate , he offers few examples of programmes he would axe .
He says he would lower the corporate tax from 35 % to 25 % and keep the Bush tax cuts , which he once opposed .
He says he can do this while still closing the budget deficit within eight years .
But because he has so far been afraid to list the deductions he will axe and the loopholes he will close , his plans amount , at best , to half a fiscal policy , and the easy half at that .
The
Tax Policy Center
He proposes to make President Bush ’s tax cuts permanent , repeal the AMT , double the dependent exemption , raise the estate tax exemption and lower its rate , make permanent the research credit , and suspend federal gas taxes this summer .
He ’d also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent and allow companies to deduct machinery and equipment immediately , rather than amortizing them .
He also plans to close corporate tax loopholes worth $ 30 billion per year .
Even with the loophole closers , these proposals would reduce federal revenues by about $ 5.7 trillion over ten years if they could be enacted immediately .
Under a more realistic assumption that they do n’t take effect until October 2009 , the cost would be about $ 5.4 trillion ...
Cuts this size would pare government back to levels not seen since the Eisenhower administration .
In FY 2012 , tax revenues would be reduced by about $ 550 billion compared with current law ( with the tax cuts expired ) .
That is roughly equal to CBO ’s baseline projection for all nondefense discretionary spending .
has more :
The comparison with the defence budget is a telling one , given Mr McCain 's ambitious foreign policy goals .
And , " cuts this size would pare government back to levels not seen since the Eisenhower administration , " if and only if Mr McCain is willing to actually pursue such cuts , which are likely to prove politically difficult .
If he cannot do this , then his plan spells no end of red ink .
Mr McCain may well have the potential to be a fiscally responsible candidate , but his plans , so far , suggest otherwise .
Economists should demand more from the candidate before declaring him the man best suited to craft sound budgets .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
In my previous essay , Open Ended Rolls , I promised I would describe the open - ended rolling system I ’ll be using for the forseeable future in Pathfinder games .
This is where that description happens .
It ’s more than just a system for open ended conflict resolution rolls , however .
It ’s also a critical hit system designed specifically to improve upon the vitality and wounds damage system I mentioned I was adopting in Damage Systems in D&D and Pathfinder .
Before I explain the new system in particular , though , I ’ll set the stage with references to a couple of other systems I ’ve developed .
The Nd6 System
Back in the early ’90s , as I explained in Open Ended Rolls , I developed a system that used multiple d6 dice .
That system was designed with the specific workings of the AD&D 2E system in mind .
I created house rule after house rule for that system until the game I ended up running in my Serpent ’s Spine gameworld was n’t AD&D at all — it was a separate game of my own creation that came into being incrementally over time .
If one knew the history of how this new game came into existence , the evolutionary line of descent from AD&D 2E to whatever the new system was called was obvious , even if seeing it as a whole system without having experienced the process of mutation might not give you many helpful clues .
Part of the process of creating this system involved reworking the Proficiency system ( what you 3E kids would call a Skill system ) .
Back in the day , there were two types of skills — Weapon Proficiencies and Nonweapon Proficiencies .
It was the Weapon Proficiencies that really led to the major changes in the game system that , in turn , left me with an Nd6 system .
The way the Weapon Proficiencies in 2E originally worked was kind of arbitrary and inelegant : you rolled d20 to attack , of course , but had bonuses or penalties depending on your proficiency with the weapon you used .
If you were not proficient in the weapon , you had a penalty to hit , and how much of a penalty was imposed depended on your character class ( Fighters had lower nonproficiency penalties than Wizards , naturally ) .
With proficiency , you had no bonuses or penalties — but you might be limited to specific weapons in which you could become proficient by your character class ( Wizards could n’t be proficient in two - handed swords ) .
Spending two Weapon Proficiency “ slots ” on a single weapon made you Specialized , a level of skill only warrior classes could achieve , and that gave you a + 1 to hit and a + 2 to damage with that weapon .
The Nonweapon Proficiency was in some ways similar , but in some ways different .
Most Nonweapon
Proficiencies cost one proficiency slot to become proficient , but some cost two ( or even three , in the case of Weaponsmithing ) , and cross-class proficiencies cost one more slot in addition to the standard cost .
Additional slots could be spent on a Nonweapon Proficiency a character already had to increase the level of that proficiency by one point .
Proficiency ranks were added to the associated attribute ( not the attribute bonus — the whole attribute ) to determine the proficiency level and , to resolve an action , the player would roll 1d20 and attempt to get a number under the total proficiency level .
What I ultimately ended up doing was unifying the die roll system for the entire game .
Nonproficient characters — whether attempting a task with a Nonweapon Proficiency or an attack with a Weapon Proficiency — would roll 2d6 .
The standard target number was 10 , 15 , or 20 , depending on the difficulty of the task , but could be further modified by situational bonuses or penalties .
For attack rolls , the target was AC , which was the target ’s Dexterity attribute ( the whole attribute , not a modifier ) plus bonuses for armor and magic .
If a character had a relevant proficiency ( Equestrian for difficult horse riding maneuvers , or Bastard Sword for attacking with a bastard sword , naturally ) , the player would roll 3d6 instead .
If the target number for the task difficulty was higher than the number available from a raw Nd6 die roll allowed by proficiency level , of course , the player needed to hope for some 1 results on dice so that additional dice could be rolled and added into the total , incrementally improving the chances of success .
If all dice came up with a 1 result on the initial roll , however , that was a critical failure .
As I explained in Open Ended Rolls , a critical success ( resulting in double damage , in the case of an attack roll ) came about if the total roll was at least twice the target number .
Three times as much meant another “ level ” of critical success ( three times the target number meant triple damage , for instance , and so on ) .
Additional levels of expertise in a given proficiency were possible as well .
A fourth d6 could be added to the roll by adding another proficiency slot to the pile , and a fifth , and so on .
The levels of proficiency from two dice on up were dubbed Nonproficient , Proficient , Specialized , Master , Mastery 1 , Mastery 2 , and so on .
Notice the elegance of the probability curve ’s shape , there : the more dice you roll , the lower the likelihood all your dice will come up with 1 results , but the more likely you are to get one or more 1 results from those dice .
Ever - greater levels of proficiency would also significantly improve your chances of killing an opponent in a single strike in combat , as multiples of basic damage are achieved by reaching multiples of the target ’s AC , which fits well with the notion that the character is better at this combat stuff .
Of course , with the completely reworked combat and skills system of 3E , this was no longer an appropriate way to roll dice for conflict resolution .
The 2d9 System
Now that the combat and skills system had changed so drastically from the 2E days , I needed to start over on how best to fix the shortcomings of the system .
It occurred to me that the best way to do that involved the traditional 0 - 9 numbering of the d10 .
I ’d simply start calling it a “ d9 ” for conflict resolution rolls instead , and use two of them for standard skill and attack rolls .
When a roll came up all zeros , it would be a critical failure .
When it came up all nines , the roll would open up at the high end ; for every 9 result on a die , the player would get to roll another d9 and add it to the total .
The fact that the traditional d10 was numbered from 0 - 9 , instead of 1 - 10 , made it easy to treat it as a 0 - 9 roll .
Because the low end of the roll is a 0 which , added to another roll , does n’t change its value at all , that means that the roll can be open - ended when one rolls the maximum on a die rather than the minimum without giving up the smooth progression of your probability curve — especially when the initial roll is more than one die .
Thus , a 2d9 roll +1d9 for every 9 that is rolled provides a nice , fairly natural - looking curve for an open - ended roll , with a “ long tail ” of probability at the high end of the curve that approaches infinity .
Handling critical successes and failures is another matter entirely .
The first instinct , after having developed the Nd6 system described above , was to say that all dice coming up with a 0 would be a critical failure .
Unfortunately , that does n’t reduce the chances of getting a critical failure as a character got better and better at that task — which is one of my major pet peeves with the flat probability curve and “ 1 is always a fumble ” approach of the standard d20 system .
The first instinct for determining critical successes , meanwhile , was to go with the “ double the target number , double the effect ” system — which works great with hit points when resolving attacks .
For critical successes , then , I just decided that with all modifiers ( bonuses for magic items , increasing base attack bonus , et cetera ) and all additional d9s rolled when a 9 is achieved on a die you just needed to get double the target number .
Triple would do triple damage or triple effect ( in the case of non-damaging tasks ) , et cetera .
For critical failures , however , I came up with an arithmetic solution .
If your roll ultimately ended up being ten or more lower than the target number , you achieved a critical failure .
For twenty or more lower , you doubled the significance of that failure , and for thirty or more lower , you tripled it .
How that would work out in terms of actual effects depended on the specific action taken ( and would be largely up to the GM — who could , if desired , work up some critical failure charts ) .
It seemed like a pretty good system , and may still be a good system for a game like Elements Eight .
This is the approach I suggested to Shackleton he might want to consider when I said :
Do n’t decide on a system yet â ??
you may find that you like the additional system I ’m going to describe
Then , I chose to incorporate another variant rule into my games , which threw a monkey wrench into the works — and , ultimately , led me to a system for conflict resolution with open ended rolls that better preserved the flavor of the D&D / Pathfinder system while still giving me the improvements I wanted .
The Vitality / Wounds System
When I added the vitality / wounds damage system , as I mentioned I was going to use in Damage Systems in D&D and Pathfinder , I realized I had to figure out how to deal with critical hits in combat differently .
Rather than using a steadily climbing scale of additional damage multipliers , I needed a way to determine when damage should be assigned to wounds rather than vitality .
The way the vitality / wounds system works is actually pretty simple :
Calculate hit points for a character as usual , except now you call them Vitality .
Under normal circumstances , you take damage to your vitality , which then heals at a rate of one point per character level per hour .
This represents not actual serious injury , but the cumulative effects of exertion and minor cuts and bruises , which can be shaken off relatively quickly .
I do n’t recall off the top of my head how the book does it , but the way I handle things , your vitality heals at that rate regardless of whether your wounds have recovered — though I ’m considering limiting your vitality to a percentage of the total equal to your current wounds capacity ’s percentage of your maximum wounds capacity , or the actual vitality to the actual current wounds capacity unless all wounds are healed , or something like that .
A character ’s wounds capacity is equal to his or her Constitution score .
If you take damage to wounds , you immediately suffer the effects of being “ fatigued ” .
That means you cannot run or charge , and you take a - 2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity until you have rested for eight hours or your wounds are healed ( whichever comes first ) .
I ignore the “ rested 8 hours ” part of that , and just go with taking all those penalties until your wounds are healed .
Under normal circumstances , you only take damage to wounds when you ’ve run out of vitality .
In other words , once you run out of vitality , you start taking damage to wounds .
When you take a critical hit , however , the damage goes directly to wounds .
Obviously , the whole “ double damage ” thing gets ignored entirely .
The way Unearthed Arcana suggests you deal with critical hits , then , is that you translate the damage multiplier for a weapon into a modifier to the critical threat target for that weapon .
For instance , with a light mace you get a critical threat target of 20 ( normal ) ; with a short sword you get a threat target of 19 ( same as in the book ) ; for something with a critical damage multiplier of x3 ( higher than normal by one ) and a threat target of 20 , you change the threat target to a 19 ( normal , reduced by the difference between that weapon ’s damage multiplier and the multiplier for a “ normal ” weapon ) .
I do n’t like the way that works out , so I came up with my own ideas for a variant .
The 20 + Nd9 System
Instead of using 2d9 for attacks , I went back to 1d20 .
The flat curve seems bothersome at first , but with an open ended roll that starts creating an actual , non - flat curve again once you get beyond the 1 - 20 range , all that really matters is the statistical probabilities — not really how they look when graphed .
Whenever a 20 is rolled , add a d9 to the roll , though , thus creating an open ended roll .
Thus , when a target number is doubled , you get a critical hit and damage is shifted from vitality to wounds .
For critical failures , you can use the “ confirm the effect ” roll that D&D suggests for critical results ; roll another d20 ( with all the added d9 the roll calls for , naturally ) , and consider it a confirmed critical failure if you come in under the target number on the confirmation roll .
In both cases , all relevant modifiers are applied .
This allows for increasing chances of critical successes and decreasing chances of critical failures as skill improves .
It even fits the flavor of a 3E / Pathfinder game better than any of the other options I ’ve come up with ( or seen elsewhere ) , and is quite easy to manage in terms of bookkeeping as well as in terms of rolling and adding up dice .
If you roll a single d9 to add to a d20 roll , you ’re actually doing less bookkeeping and arithmetic than if you use the standard “ rolled a 20 , now roll to confirm ” system , because you only have to add all relevant modifiers to a roll one time — and if you need an extra d9 or two added to the roll because you keep rolling 9 , the tension of the situation certainly makes the very minor extra effort involved worthwhile .
It ’s not like you ’re going to roll 17d9 on every attack , after all .
All that remains is figuring out how to handle those critical numbers for the various weapons .
Let ’s take a military pistol from the Iron Kingdoms gameworld book as an example : its critical hit statistics are 19 - 20/x3 .
Since we ’re not using damage multipliers for critical hits , and we ’re not using raw d20 roll results for critical hit determination , we have to do something else with those numbers — or just ignore them .
There are a number of reasonable options open to us :
Use the critical threat range as provided for by the Unearthed Arcana rules to determine when the first d9 is rolled and added to the total on a d20 attack .
For instance , the military pistol would allow you to roll a d9 and add it to the total if your raw roll is in the range of 18 - 20 ( 19 - 20 +1 for the x3 damage multiplier ) .
Use the standard critical threat range ( 19 - 20 in the case of the military pistol from Iron Kingdoms ) and use the multiplier ( x3 for the military pistol ) to determine how many dice are rolled .
Count the d20 that was already rolled as the first die , and roll Nd9 where the N added to the 1 from your 1d20 roll yields a sum equal to the multiplier — meaning that a x3 multiplier adds 2d9 to the 1d20 roll .
Use the standard critical threat range , as in the preceding case , but apply a damage modifier determined by the multiplier even though damage is assigned to wounds instead of vitality .
In this case , I ’d say add the multiplier number , minus two , to the damage roll .
Since a military pistol does 2d6 damage and offers 19 - 20 / x3 as its critical hit stats , you would roll an additional d9 die when you roll 19 or 20 on d20 and add it to the total , roll additional d9s if you roll 9 on your d9 dice to give you an open ended roll , and if your total comes out to two times the target ’s AC ( or more ) you do 2d6+1 damage ( that ’s 2d6 damage , +3 , - 2 ) .
Use the multiplier to indicate how many times a + 1 is added to damage if your character is proficient in the weapon in question .
This adds to the lethality of proficient characters as contrasted with nonproficient characters ( such as a warrior vs. a wizard using a martial weapon ) .
Treat the threat and critical system otherwise exactly the same as in the preceding example .
The way this would hash out is that a proficient character always gets a +1 to damage ( 2d6+1 in the case of a military pistol ) , an additional +1 when a critical hit is achieved by rolling double the target ’s AC ( 2d6+2 to wounds for the military pistol ) , and in the case of a multiplier of x3 , another + 1 if you roll triple the target ’s AC .
Use the threat range as in the preceding couple examples , but use the multiplier as the penalty to Strength and Dexterity for wounded characters , instead of the standard - 2 .
Thus , with a x3 modifier , wounding a target with a critical hit would impose a - 3 to Strength and Dexterity until the wounds are healed , instead of the standard - 2 for being fatigued .
There are other possibilities as well , but of those that have occurred to me , these strike me as the best options .
I think a certain amount of playtesting is required to really arrive at a definite favorite — and the choice may actually vary depending on the intended flavor of your particular campaign , in addition to depending on things like not making your PCs feel robbed of the extra coolness of an additional damage multiplier or killing off your PCs too easily if they get hit by an orc with a greataxe ( 1d12 , 20/x3 ) .
I still need to decide what I ’m going to use in my ongoing game , a session of which — by the way — I ’m running this evening .
Maybe I ’ll ask the players what they think .

A good many years ago , I read George Soros ' " The Alchemy of Finance " , which introduced me to the concept of reflexivity , which in a nutshell is when observers of a phenomenon can't help but impact the phenomenon itself via their ' observing ' , thus changing the original underlying fundamentals and setting in motion a boom - bust dynamic ( i.e. more exaggerated trends in both directions ) .
Since Mr. Soros recently spoke to Congress regarding the oil futures market ' bubble ' , I thought I 'd take a closer look at the concept of reflexivity , both as it relates to oil and commodities in general , as well as its broader implications for efforts in raising awareness of global resource constraints .
" The situations that men define as true , become true for them . "
Sociologist William Thomas , 1928
Though Soros applied the idea of reflexivity to financial markets ( and had huge success ) , its origins are in social theory .
Social ( science ) phenomena are influenced by a two - way interaction between perception and facts , thereby making it impossible to ascertain a true stand - alone ' fact ' .
Thus , reflexivity is basically the ecological / systems concept of ' positive feedback ' merged into the social sphere where thinking , acting human agents create circular relationships between cause and effect in real - time .
Flanagan ( 1981 ) and others have argued that reflexivity complicates all three of the traditional roles that are typically played by a classical science : explanation , prediction and control .
For example an anthropologist working in an isolated tribal village may impact the native peoples culture and behaviours in unknown ways - e.g. her observations will not be independent of her participation as an observer .
This contrasts to the natural sciences , where one set of facts follows another irrespective of what anybody thinks .
This is a central example of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning that is prevalent in modern Walrasian welfare economics .
In financial markets ( which include oil futures ) , reflexivity occurs when prices themselves influence the fundamentals and that this newly - influenced set of fundamentals then changes expectations , thus influencing prices .
This process then continues in a self - reinforcing pattern until it has overshot equilibrium .
Because the pattern is self - perpetuating , markets tend towards disequilibrium - where every outcome is uniquely different from the past .
( This of course flies in the face of most everything I was taught at the University of Chicago Business School )
Here is what Mr. Soros had to say about reflexivity in a 1994 speech at MIT :
" I am in fundamental disagreement with the prevailing wisdom .
The generally accepted theory is that financial markets tend towards equilibrium , and on the whole , discount the future correctly .
I operate using a different theory , according to which financial markets cannot possibly discount the future correctly because they do not merely discount the future ; they help to shape it .
In certain circumstances , financial markets can affect the so - called fundamentals which they are supposed to reflect .
When that happens , markets enter into a state of dynamic disequilibrium and behave quite differently from what would be considered normal by the theory of efficient markets .
Such boom / bust sequences do not arise very often , but when they do , they can be very disruptive , exactly because they affect the fundamentals of the economy . "
" The theory holds , in the most general terms , that the way philosophy and natural science have taught us to look at the world is basically inappropriate when we are considering events which have thinking participants .
Both philosophy and natural science have gone to great lengths to separate events from the observations which relate to them .
Events are facts and observations are true or false , depending on whether or not they correspond to the facts ....
The separation between fact and statement was probably a greater advance in the field of thinking than the invention of the wheel in the field of transportation .
But exactly because the approach has been so successful , it has been carried too far .
Applied to events which have thinking participants , it provides a distorted picture of reality .
The key feature of these events is that the participants ’ thinking affects the situation to which it refers .
Facts and thoughts cannot be separated in the same way as they are in natural science or , more exactly , by separating them we introduce a distortion which is not present in natural science , because in natural science thoughts and statements are outside the subject matter , whereas in the social sciences they constitute part of the subject matter .
If the study of events is confined to the study of facts , an important element , namely , the participants ’ thinking , is left out of account .
Strange as it may seem , that is exactly what has happened , particularly in economics , which is the most scientific of the social sciences . "
Well , economics has been the best path dependent allocation mechanism for a competitive species finding a huge energy subsidy , and as such has developed complicated econometrics and other empirical formulae that appear to be laws .
Since energy has always grown , the ' rules ' for economics seem like science , but the observations that economists consider to be facts , are based in large part on the specific inputs and history from this cultural system .
More from Soros :
" Classical economics was modeled on Newtonian physics .
It sought to establish the equilibrium position and it used differential equations to do so .
To make this intellectual feat possible , economic theory assumed perfect knowledge on the part of the participants .
Perfect knowledge meant that the participants ’ thinking corresponded to the facts and therefore it could be ignored .
Unfortunately , reality never quite conformed to the theory .
Up to a point , the discrepancies could be dismissed by saying that the equilibrium situation represented the final outcome and the divergence from equilibrium represented temporary noise .
But , eventually , the assumption of perfect knowledge became untenable and it was replaced by a methodological device which was invented by my professor at the London School of Economics , Lionel Robbins , who asserted that the task of economics is to study the relationship between supply and demand ; therefore it must take supply and demand as given .
This methodological device has managed to protect equilibrium theory from the onslaught of reality down to the present day " .
from George Soros speech to MIT in 1994
The upshot of this is that ' facts ' , as seen from the financial market participants persective , actually change the behaviour of not only the investors , but also the corporations , policymakers , institutions , etc .
In studying supply and demand we impact supply and demand .
With this background on the concept of reflexivity , let 's take a look at commodity futures markets .
In 2004 , the total value of futures contracts outstanding for all 25 index commodities amounted to around $ 180 billion .
At that time , that was 240 times smaller than worldwide equity market cap of $ 44 trillion .
Recent estimates of the global derivative markets notional size are northwards of $ 600 trillion .
This compares to US GDP of about $ 13 trillion , and around $ 8 trillion of new inflow into investments each year ( savings ) .
The total global equity market and debt ( bond ) markets are around $ 50 trillion each .
Commodities have not had a boom since the late 1970s , and until recently have played a minor role in general portfolio asset allocation .
Combined with media coverage ( e.g. Jim Rogers ) and rapid growth in demand and tightening of supply , commodity markets have had explosive moves the last 5 years .
Pension funds , sovereign wealth funds , university endowments and other index speculators have been allocating money away from stocks and bonds into commodities .
A common way for these entities to invest is to allocate a % of their capital to commodities in general , without taking a particular sector or timeframe , e.g. they buy exposure to commodities via the front months of each major contract and just before they would have to take delivery of the physical , roll into the next closest futures month .
There are several major commodity tracking ' indexes ' that differ slightly in their respective commodity weightings .
The red , green and blue bars in the above graph track the dollars invested in different indexes compared to the black line which is the SP spot commodity index .
This explosion of funds into commodities , combined with fundamentals , has created some hefty price increases in the major commodity groups :
The combination of price increases and more funds allocated to commodities has obviously increased the total size of the ' commodity market ' .
Notice in the below graphic that the amount of index speculators ( red area ) as a % of the total has risen over time , again a function of their own performance , and general commodity price increases :
The transfer of ' money ' into ' real goods ' ( or at least paper represntations of them ) has been widespread .
Commodity - index funds controlled a record 4.51 billion bushels of corn , wheat and soybeans through CBOT futures , equal to half the amount held in U.S. silos as of March 1 .
According to Mike Masters , in his Congressional Testimony last week , speculators have now stockpiled , via the futures market , the equivalent of 1.1 billion barrels of petroleum , effectively adding eight times as much oil to their own stockpile as the United States added to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during the last five years .
Since there is a positive feedback mechanism with futures index funds , the demand for futures actually increases as prices go up - the opposite of what one would expect from price - sensitive consumer demand .
There are currently position limits for futures contracts for speculators :
Position Accountability Levels and Limits NYMEX Crude Oil Futures - 1,000 U.S. barrels ( 42,000 gallons ) :
Any one month / all months : 20,000 net futures , but not to exceed 3,000 contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month .
NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures - 10,000 million British thermal units ( mmBtu ) :
Any one month / all months : 12,000 net futures , but not to exceed 1,000 in the last three days of trading in the spot month .
NYNEX Heating Oil Futures - 42,000 U.S. gallons ( 1,000 barrels ) : 7,000 contracts for all months combined , but not to exceed 1,000 in the last three days of trading in the spot month .
Exemptions
The Commission and exchanges grant exemptions to their position limits for bona fide hedging , as defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3( z ) , 17 CFR 1.3( z ) .
A hedge is a derivative transaction or position that represents a substitute for transactions or positions to be taken at a later time in a physical marketing channel .
( Source JPMorgan Chase )
Hedgers have no position limits but do have reporting requirements .
Currently , an index speculator can call up a bank and request exposure to say , $ 100 million of oil and enter into a swap - the bank then hedges this via the futures markets - in this way the speculator has bypassed the official position limits , skirting the current intent of the rules .
There are rumors that due to pressure from hedge funds , politicians , etc. ( either in an effort to reduce energy and food prices or reduce the pain on their short positions ..;-) , that the definition of ' hedger ' is going to soon become more restrictive .
In theory this would relieve pressure on commodity prices , as the large positions by index speculators would have to be reduced ( e.g. sold ) .
However , it is not clear to me that this rule alone would drop oil prices : 1 ) there exists a large short interest in oil that counterbalances the index longs - e.g. some large ' shorts ' would have to reduce their positions by covering too , 2 ) at the end of each calendar month , someone is taking delivery and paying these high prices , 3 ) if speculators were largely responsible for the oil price spike , where would all the stored oil be that they were taking delivery on ?
With this brief overview of the commodity markets , let 's now revisit the concept of reflexivity .
REFLEXIVITY - TAIL , DOG , WAG ?
Back to Mr. Soros :
" So we can observe three very different conditions in history : the “ normal , ” in which the participants ’ views and the actual state of affairs tend to converge ; and two far - from - equilibrium conditions , one of apparent changelessness , in which thinking and reality are very far apart and show no tendency to converge , and one of revolutionary change in which the actual situation is so novel and unexpected and changing so rapidly that the participants ’ views cannot keep up with it . "
Wheat might be a good example of the 2nd of these three conditions .
After breaching an all time high of $ 6 last summer , wheat continued until it peaked over $ 12 per bushel ( hard red wheat hit $ 25 ) .
Droughts in Australia and Eastern Europe exacerbated a low inventory situation and people were caught off guard - thinking and reality now differed .
In 2007 Americans consumed 2.22 bushels of wheat per capita .
At 1.3 billion bushels , the wheat futures ' stockpile ' by index speculators was enough to supply every American with all the bread , pasta and baked goods they could eat for two years ( Masters ) .
Yet despite the large bullish position , indeed perhaps because of the large bullish position , wheat futures reversed their asymptotic rise in similar dramatic fashion , with the speculators riding it up and the physical hedgers sending it down .
( Sidebar - there is still a massive index speculative position in wheat , despite a nearly 50 % selloff , a relevant datapoint to those who believe index speculators are primarily to blame for crude oils rise . )
Dec/08
Wheat futures - daily prices
Here was an example of equilibrium overshoot in two directions , eg. large ' runs ' both up and down .
Speculators were behind , reached , and got out too far ahead of fundamentals in this case .
But what about oil ?
I would contend that a 1200 % increase in price since 1999 and flat production since 2005 with a growing world economy is consistent with either the 2nd or 3rd of Soros ' 3 conditions .
Whether we have overshot equilibrium or are in a situation of revolutionary change is still an open question .
But let 's step back first with a thought experiment .
Imagine that there were no Ken Deffeyes , Matt Simmons or Colin Campbell .
Imagine that M. King Hubbert spent his retirement playing Parchesi with his wife and not modeling future oil depletion .
Imagine that when the UK hit is second ( and final ) peak in 1999 that no one noticed , and that market participants did n't pay attention to the subsequent 12 fold increase in oil prices .
Imagine we did n't know that the energy return on crude oil had declined from over 100:1 , to 30:1 to around 10:1 .
Imagine that Nigerian rebels and Iraqi freedom fighters could n't cause daily spikes in crude prices by their actions due to the fragility of supply and demand .
Imagine that bandits were n't stealing scarce diesel fuel at night in California .
And , imagine if places like theoildrum , or ASPO or energybulletin did n't continually posit data and questions that pushed the envelope of conventional energy wisdom .
Consider then only geology .
That we use horizontal drilling and nitrogen and water injection , that we are drilling more and more wells all around the world using the latest seismic technology , etc .
That the EIA continues to model supply forecasts with demand forecasts , because supply has never really been a constraint in the past .... Would oil prices be approaching $ 130 ?
Would T Boone Pickens be interviewed with a mixture of awe and fear on CNBC ?
Would there be major military presence in what was formerly the fertile crescent ?
Would Saudi Shura ( Parliamant ) be voting to keep more oil in the ground for higher future prices ?
Probably not .
Yesterdays ' facts ' are influencing today 's perceptions which are influencing tomorrows realities .
$ 100 + oil DOES change consumption habits , but it also changes humans built in beliefs towards their futures , both individually and as nations .
Earlier this week the CEO of TOTAL , one of the worlds largest oil companies , stated that new forms of energy would not be able to compensate for the coming oil and gas depletion .
He also stated that new oil reserves cost $ 80 to procure so $ 80 would become the new price floor for oil going forward .
We do n't know that this is a fact - but is the opinion of an expert in a position to know more than the average participant .
Monsieur de Margerie , via his perceived authority and public pronouncements is therby affecting the fundamentals of the oil industry .
Each incremental admission , whether from the IEA , from TOTAL , or from theoildrum.com , shifts the mindsets of participants at the margin , which subsequently changes behaviours .
In 1999 with oil below $ 10 per barrel , the stock market at all time highs , and resource limit concerns restricted to a handful of cranky environmentalists and Hubbert acolytes , were we at ' equilibrium ' ?
In 2001 with oil at $ 20 ?
In 2005 with oil at $ 50 ?
The point is that for a very long time we were not in equilibrium - the pendulum was pulled way to the left and finally let fly in 2000 - the question is , has it now past equilibrium in the other direction ?
Or have we moved into the third stage , where human collective awareness is accelerating knowledge about and action in the oil sector ?
More knowledge about finite flow limits changes professionals opinions about the future , which changes investment into refineries , changes long term contracts with exporting nations , changes military strategies , changes hoarding strategies , all of which are reflected in the price moonshot .
Soros theory , which I happen to subscribe to , implies we will overshoot in both directions , because gravity and momementum will combine to send the pendulum backwards once market participants have not only caught up , but exceeded the reality of the situation .
But Soros ( to my knowledge ) generally applied this principle to finance , and admitted to Congress he is not an expert in things energy .
Reflexivity could of course have larger societal implications beyond investment booms and busts .
Nearly two years ago , in this post about the Amaranth blow up , I suggested that price floors and position limits would eventually become a reality because of the sheer size of dollars vs notional energy values .
In A Closer Look at Futures , I commented :
I believe there are 3 different definitions of Peak Oil and they will come in succession .
The point when we have used half of the oil that will ever be extracted .
The point when we reach maximum sustained production ( given that we use high technology like horizontal drilling and water and nitrogen injection , we are likely borrowing from the second half of what was normally a bell shaped curve so this point will come later ) .
The point when the meme of finite energy resources takes hold in society .
For sake of this discussion , lets use the first definition , and assume we are roughly at Peak Oil now .
We have used 1 trillion + barrels and have 1 trillion + left .
But as discussed previously ( exhaustively ? ) , those 1 trillion barrels require a decent amount of energy to locate , harvest , refine , and distribute and this amount of `energy cost ' subtracted from the gross is increasing .
Lets assume that the 1 trillion barrels nets out to 650 billion barrels to non-energy society .
( Yes I chose this number specifically ) .
Given our current world population , that equates to 100 barrels of net oil remaining for every person on the planet , ( and leaves none for our children , grandchildren or subsequent generations ) .
Any Tom , Dick or Rainwater for $ 4,000 can financially control 1000 barrels of oil in the futures markets , or 10 times his or her all time planetary allotment .
Once Peak Oil version # 3 is realized , there will be many investors clamoring to financially ( or physically ) control their 100 barrels , let alone 10,000 or 1,000,000 barrels .
Can the futures markets absorb this ?
Will this make the Hunt Brothers cornering of the silver market seem like childsplay ?
The world uses 85 million barrels per day - and for a mere $ 340 million in margin , this entire amount can be controlled via the futures markets .
Consider this in contrast to the $ 7 +
Trillion invested or saved annually , and the nearly $ 100 trillion in stock and bond market assets .
Will the market send the right signals ?
What smart angles will hedge funds take on this ?
Is n't this what we would expect in a finite world as people wake up to real resource constraints ?
What is a dollar , or yen , or euro worth , really ?
Though Soros ' ideas about reflexivity were applied to the financial arena - perhaps we the observers , are impacting the real time experiment of resource constraints in the same vein .
Though geologic limits to flow rates are an ostensible signal , the real dilemmas of Peak Oil are all socioeconomic .
We are beginning to realize that societies need to be ' intact ' with reasonably equal distribution and allocation if the entire system is to continue it 's current trajectory .
But oil depletion will likely first be a tax on the middle class and poor , accelerating political pressure on things likely to exacerbate the long term situation ( e.g. cutting gas taxes , scaling ethanol , giving tax rebates to help economy , etc . )
On top of that are myriad human elements that are very difficult to predict .
Hoarding behavior is an autocatalytic process which begets other behavioral changes once set in motion .
' Not drilling ' or ' not producing ' oil and gas at a certain price could also be considered hoarding behaviour .
" Virtual hoarding " via futures contracts can also occur to a certain extent .
On the one hand accelerated knowledge about geologic limits acts as a needed tax on finite high quality fossil fuels , which spurs investment into alternatives and quickens conservation and consumption behavioral change .
On the other hand , once the cat is out of the bag , there is a greater chance of unintended consequences , as the owners of paper money might start to look at it differently .
Reflexivity indeed ....
SOME PREDICTIONS
Here is my ' participant ' part of the equation of Peak Oil .
These are not facts , but my opinions :
1 ) There will be extreme volatility in next 5 years in oil and gas prices .
Not only day to day , but year to year .
Awareness of possible flow constraints is now upon us , rightly or wrongly .
This combined with the tiny size of energy commodity markets compared to investable dollars will engender large position sizes that inevitably will fall victim to the fear / greed / leverage trifecta .
Attention to the oil sector guarantees increased volatility .
Accelerating oil depletion of older wells and skyrocketing reserve replacement costs guarantees higher highs and higher lows ...
2) The Peak Oil community ( e.g. those who generally understand that oil production is either peaking now or will peak soon ) will begin to bifurcate into two relatively disparate camps - a ) the supply - side camp that understands the urgency but will try and address energy and resource shortage via technology , more drilling and alternatives and b) the demand - side camp who will see that no matter what the energy source , a new paradigm of how we live our lives / structure our institutions will be the only full answer to the twin problems of peak fossil fuels and a growing population .
Conversations between these two camps will become increasingly disparate and tense .
Supply and demand solutions will not be mutually exclusive , but some people recognize that our ends are constrained as well as our means .
3 ) There will be an eventual slowing and ultimately a cessation of speculation in energy markets by non-producers .
This is tantamount to a change in capitalism so I do n't say it lightly , but already only 6 % of world oil reserves are owned by public companies - the amount of dollars NOW dwarfs the amount of notional physical resources - if printing presses are turned on while resources deplete this disparity will continue to grow .
At some point people like you and I wo n't be allowed to buy oil futures , which is only a short step away from nationalization of the energy industry ( which is the case in most countries already ) .
Conversations and thoughts like these are meant to raise the bar of discourse on energy topics so when real policy discussions take place , either locally or regionally , people will speak a common language .
There is a fine line in peak oil outreach - more awareness is needed to accelerate renewable infrastructure and kick - start efficiency and conservation measures - yet too much awareness might cause supply disruptions ( hoarding ) and make it difficult for oil companies to extend the time horizon that we have access to a large baseline of production , etc .
As an editor on this site , I hope we are efforting positive change , but realize many of our readers are likely tuning in to know the latest details in order to improve their own situation , financial or otherwise .
One of my concerns is when the pendulum swings back the other direction , and we head towards one of those ' higher lows ' , that the urgency of both supply and demand response will be lost .
Both oil prices and energy stocks will overshoot on the downside and we will lose sight of the long term situation .
These are high stakes .

NOW EXPERTS SAY CANNABIS SHOULD BE LEGAL
CANNABIS should be legalised and taxed , an influential Scottish think tank recommended yesterday , just weeks after the Government hardened its attitude towards the drug , reclassifying it as a class B substance .
The Scottish Futures Forum yesterday published a report on drugs and alcohol in Scotland , saying one way to tackle the problem of addiction to harder drugs was to tax and regulate cannabis .
Forum chairman Frank Pignatelli said studies of San Francisco , where cannabis is illegal , and the Netherlands , where it is decriminalised , showed that the idea is worth considering because it breaks the link with class A drugs .
In the Netherlands , only 17 per cent of cannabis sellers were also selling drugs such as crack , cocaine and heroin , while in San Francisco it was more than 50 per cent .
The idea was one of several aimed at halving drug addiction in Scotland by 2025 .
This included introducing shooting galleries , where heroin addicts can go and take drugs in supervised surroundings , as revealed in yesterday 's Scotsman .
The forum 's vice - chairman , Tom Wood , former deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders , said that there are " no easy options " and insisted that a different and sometimes uncomfortable approach was needed to tackle Scotland 's drug problems .
He said : " Where we are now is living in a country where there is one of the highest prevalences for drugs .
" We 're living in a country where we have the highest drug death rate , we 're living in a country which has one of the highest hep C rates in Europe .
So we 're hardly in a good place now .
A lot of the things we 've done in the past clearly have not worked and so we have to move , and I think we are moving in the right direction , but we have to move quite radically . "
Just last month the Home Office announced it was reclassifying cannabis to class B , reversing a decision in 2004 to lower it to class C .
The decision was made because stronger forms of cannabis such as skunk are becoming more readily available and there is new evidence linking the drug to psychiatric problems .
Both the Home Office and the Scottish Government have made it clear that they do not support the idea of legalisation .
The community safety minister Fergus Ewing , who last week unveiled a new drugs strategy , welcomed upgrading cannabis to class B .
There were two failed efforts to open cannabis cafes in Edinburgh .
Scottish Socialist Party member Kevin Williamson almost bankrupted himself trying to open one in Haymarket and Paul Stewart was forced to quit for Amsterdam after being fined for selling cannabis at his cafe Purple Haze in Leith .
The forum 's suggestion has been welcomed by the Legalise Cannabis Alliance UK , which claimed Scotland is leading the way on the issue .
Don Barnard , a spokesman , said : " The Scots seem to have been taking a more mature view and I hope the recommendation is taken seriously . "
The idea has also been backed by the Greens .
Patrick Harvie , MSP , said : " The current approach to criminalising drug users has been one of the most obvious failures of social policy over the last 50 years , and the Futures Forum should be thanked for their efforts to move the debate on .
We broadly welcome their report . "
But the Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie , who persuaded the SNP to produce a drugs strategy as part of a deal on supporting its budget , described the forum 's report as " flawed " .
She added : " The taxing and regulation of cannabis is akin to legalisation .
This will not decrease use of this extremely harmful substance .
Fortunately the long - term consequences of cannabis usage are now universally acknowledged and there is a consensus at Westminster that the damaging downgrading of cannabis to a class C substance should be reversed . "

I ’ve pointedly ignored Joe Lieberman for a while now .
The man just grates on me for obvious reasons .
If there ’s one thing that grinds my gears , it ’s anyone who throws both party and supporters under the bus in power grabs and Holy Joe has provided me with so much gear - grinding all I ’ve got left is cylinders .
Awful analogy aside , I was downright gleeful to read that Barack Obama may have delivered a little ultimatum to Joementum , telling him to shape up or ship out .
At least that ’s an assumption , for all I know he could have told Joe to stop bringing Pepsi to the party get - togethers and actually contribute something that requires effort .
I do n’t know .
The point is that the last two years have been torturous in all things Lieberman .
With the Democrats barely holding onto a majority in the Senate , Joe has been the potential tipping point , and as an independent he could at any time choose to nominally or de facto throw the majority to the Republicans if so inclined .
Thanks to this , he ’s been able to basically pull down his pants and waggle his shriveled old genitals at the Democrats and the moment they start to get mad and tell him to pull up his damn pants , pretends like he ’s going to “ accidentally ” fall onto the red side of the fence .
So the Democrats have been forced to tolerate him because , as it stands , he ’s needed .
So you know what ?
Let me make this simple : fuck Joe Lieberman .
Y’hear that ?
Fuck ‘im .
Lieberman ’s gambit was incredibly shortsighted this time around .
He created a little situation that worked to his advantage in the near term but offered nothing in the long haul .
Let me explain .
Dick Morris is a flaming douchebag .
That has nothing to do with what I ’m about to say , but I felt like saying it .
Anyway , the man was on FOX recently saying that the Democrats are “ the party that cannot lose ” this November .
It was in the interest of making a stupid point about why Obama needs Hillary Clinton as his running mate , but let ’s just stick with the first sentence : the Democrats are the party that cannot lose .
On that point , I agree .
Come November we ’re going to see something amazing .
The Democrats are going to find an even larger majority in both houses .
You heard it , potentially a filibuster - proof one in the Senate .
In every single poll , Democrats are doing better than Republicans in the abstract by wide margins , so while person - to - person Obama may not run away with the win by a country mile , in the Congressional races where fewer people know what the hell ’s going on we can expect an even bluer Legislative branch .
This is where Lieberman ’s little master plan begins to unravel .
The right , let ’s face it , loves Lieberman the traitorous Democrat .
He ’s fantastic from their perspective .
A “ principled ” Democrat who is n’t afraid to go against his party , coincidentally in a way that the right really agrees with .
He ’s on their side in a way that lets them claim him as an ally and accuse everyone else of being ideological and party - lockstep .
As a brief tangent , Lieberman going against the Democrats on the war does n’t take balls .
What does is to be a Kucinich or Russ Feingold .
To stand up and take the “ crazy ” position that everyone wants privately but is too scared of being called a “ radical ” to say out loud .
Russ Feingold was the only senator , the only Senator to vote against the PATRIOT Act .
That ’s being courageous .
Siding with the opposition knowing they ’ll be your best friend is n’t being strong and principled , it ’s cowardice .
Here ’s the dirty little secret though .
The right loves Joe Lieberman the Democrat , they do not want Joe Lieberman the Republican .
When he stands up and stumps for McCain and trashes Obama , he ’s their ace in the hole : a Democrat defying his party to show just how gosh darn much he supports John McCain or wants us to win in Iraq or whatever .
He ’s being used by the GOP simply because of his willingness to do the aforementioned genital - waggling at his own party .
Look at Joe Lieberman ’s track record : the man is a liberal and a damn good one .
Pro-choice , pro-gay - rights , big on energy independence , 0 % from the Christian Coalition , the works .
If you just went by that , he should the left ’s darling .
The Iraq War has seen him , and frankly everyone else , ignore 95 % of his political positions and define him as the Democrat that hates Democrats and stumps for Republicans .
Nevermind that he agrees with the Dems on almost everything , he ’s out there pumping Bush and knocking Obama .
Endearing himself to the right while caucusing with the Democrats has enabled him to be needed by both sides .
All that goes away as soon as the Democratic majority breaks over 50 .
Suddenly Lieberman is n’t needed to keep majority .
The Democrats have no reason to give a shit who he caucuses with and wo n’t need to try and keep in his good graces .
That leaves him in an awkward position because no one ’s going to want him .
The Democrats have proven he ’s unwanted as he lost his primary bid in Connecticut , and the Republicans have no reason to want a flaming liberal who just happens to agree with them on Iraq in their party .
Holy Joe is going to be burning his bridge at both ends ( and yes , I ’m aware that I combined two idioms ) .
So , once again , fuck Joe Lieberman .
If he wants to deliver the key note speech at the Republican Convention , let him .
In fact , let him break from the Democrats entirely .
He ’s been kissing asses on the right side of the aisle like mad these past three years , why not let him hop over entirely ?
Let him see how well that goes .

In another blatant violation of the promise made in Annapolis in September 2007 by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to halt settlement construction , the Israeli Housing Minister Ze'ev Boim announced Friday that he will be issuing permits for 1,460 new housing units in three Israeli settlements built on Palestinian land in East Jerusalem .
The announcement came just days before the Israeli Prime Minister plans to visit Washington to report on the progress of the peace process .
After the so - called ' Annapolis Summit ' , which was a one - day meeting between Israeli and Palestinian factions in Annapolis , MD in the US , Ehud Olmert announced that all new construction in Israeli settlements must be approved by both himself and the Defense Minister .
But despite that promise , construction has continued unabated in a number of West Bank settlements .
Housing Minister Ze'ev Boim said in an interview with the Kol Hai radio station on Friday that the permits for the 1,460 new units were meant as a " gift to the city [ of Jerusalem ] on the 41st anniversary of its emancipation . "
This is a reference to the creation of the state of Israel on Palestinian land in 1947 , and the subsequent disenfranchisement of the hundreds of thousands of indigenous Palestinians living on the land .
The settlements in question are : Har Homa , built on land stolen from the Palestinian residents of Beit Sahour municipality , Pisgat Ze'ev , built on land stolen from the Palestinian village of Hizma , and Beitar Ilit , built on land stolen from Palestinians south of Jerusalem .
The new units to be constructed will be 120 units in Har Homa , 600 units in the settlement of Beitar Ilit and 700 units in Pisgat Ze'ev .
In April , when the permits for the new units gained initial approval , Israeli journalist Uzi Benjamin wrote in the Israeli paper Ha'aretz , " There is no doubt about it :
The ultra-Orthodox factions have become the spearhead of the settlement enterprise over the Green Line , and they are busy competing with one another over which of them will lead it ...
Olmert tries to pretend that his response to their demands is mere small change , but in fact they are dictating the agenda with regard to settlement over the Green Line and , in this way , they have an influence over the entire Israeli - Palestinian arena . "
In 2006 , when these three settlements were widely expanded with the approval of the Israeli government , Palestinians pleaded with Israel to cease the ever - increasing encroachment onto Palestinian land in the West Bank .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said at the time , " This act of expanding settlements , is a choice for more obstacles and more problems and more violence .
I really hope that the new government will stop this . "
Instead , the government of Ehud Olmert announced a plan to lay down final borders for the Israeli state by 2008 .
Over 30,000 Orthodox Jews live in Beitar Ilit alone .
All Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem are in direct violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention , to which Israel is a signatory .
For years , congressional Democrats dreamed of getting a crack at a man they saw as a key player behind the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods against detainees in the war on terrorism -- methods the critics say amount to torture .
On Thursday , they finally got their wish :
Thickly bearded and glaring out through half - rimmed glasses , David S. Addington , a top aide to Vice President Cheney and alleged master - mind of the legal rationale for the harsh techniques , appeared before a House subcommittee .
But rather than eliciting new information or forcing damaging admissions from the long - sought witness , the hearing turned into an emotion - charged demonstration of the hostility and mutual disdain between the most liberal critics of the Bush administration ’s war policies and one of the architects of those policies .
For his part , Addington provided little specific information on his role in pressing for controversial interrogation tactics at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and with CIA prisoners .
At the same time , he made it clear that he had played a central role in the matter .

And he lectured the committee on the continuing nature of the terrorist threat .
“ No American should think we ’re free , the war is over , Al Qaeda is not coming and they ’re not interested in getting us , ” Addington told the Constitution , civil rights and civil liberties subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee .
“ Because that ’s wrong . ”
Yet when Democrats tried to pin him down on the moral and legal issues they considered crucial , Addington brushed them aside with barely concealed disdain .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) , who later characterized Addington ’s attitude as “ smug , ” asked whether , if the interrogation program was found to be illegal , he would bear any responsibility .
“ Is that a moral question or a legal question ? ” Addington asked , then said he bore no responsibility , legal or moral .

Was President Bush constrained by laws against torture ?
Addington refused to offer an opinion .
Putting the question in extreme terms , Nadler asked Addington if torturing a detainee ’s child to get information would be legal .
“ I ’m not here to render legal advice to your committee , ” Addington shot back .
“ You do have attorneys of your own to give you legal advice . ”
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) tried to press Addington on whether he had pushed interrogators at Guantanamo to utilize tougher techniques .
When Addington said he did not recall , Wasserman Schultz said she found that “ hard to fathom . ”
“ Is there a question pending , ma’am ? ” Addington responded .

A Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week showed that William J. Haynes II , former top Pentagon lawyer , helped push harsh techniques down to interrogators working at the Guantanamo prison .
Pentagon lawyers helped transform techniques used to train pilots to resist enemy interrogation into tools for American interrogators , the panel found .
The methods may have violated prohibitions on torture or cruel treatment .
Addington acknowledged attending many meetings with Haynes and other top officials .
He said he was briefed by John Yoo , the former Justice Department lawyer who drafted many of the legal memos defending harsh techniques .
He acknowledged multiple trips to Guantanamo and discussions with interrogators .
He said he was familiar with the development of the CIA program .
But he gave no details on what he said or did at such meetings .
Critics had hoped the hearing would show that , behind the scenes , Addington played a leading role in pushing for tough interrogation techniques .
Addington said he was trying to maximize the president ’s options in dealing with terrorism and give protections to intelligence agents asked to do “ tough things in wartime . ”
Perhaps the strangest exchange came at the end of the hearing .
Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) asked Addington whether waterboarding was discussed in meetings .

“ I ca n’t talk to you , ” Addington said .
“ Al Qaeda may watch these meetings . ”
Delahunt replied that he was sure they did .
“ I ’m glad they finally have a chance to see you , Mr. Addington , ” Delahunt said .
Without missing a beat , Addington answered , “ I ’m sure you ’re pleased . ”

" The first thing I knew was on Friday morning when a parent complained , and come Friday afternoon I was told not come back to the school " she told smh.com.au .
During an afternoon meeting with principal Julie Organ and local schools director Maurice Brennan , Ms Tziolas was issued with a letter signed by Mr Brennan .
" I refer to an article in the magazine Cleo in which your photograph appears acompanied by an article about your personal life , " the letter reads .
" Concerns have been raised by community members in relation to this article .
I have concerns that this will seriously impact on your continued employment at Narraweena Public School , " it read , before telling her she would be sacked .
" I was told ... that my actions had breached the code of conduct , " said Ms Tziolas , whose husband Antonios also appeared in the article .
" I was extremely surprised .
I was just given a letter and told not to come back .
" I had no course for appeal prior to the decision - it was almost like I was guilty until proven innocent . "
The article which has caused the furore is this month 's Cleo .
Titled " Buck naked couples talk about their sex lives " the article interviews ten couples about " what they get up to between the sheets " .
It also includes a full - page picture of each couple , naked and holding each other .
Lynne and Antonios 's article asks them about how many times they have sex a week , their favourite body part and the most risque sexual thing they 've done .
" Leaving the blinds up and the lights on , which is all the time , " Antonios said in response to the last question .
Ms Tziolas said she was stunned by the response of her school to the article , and said it may end her career in public schools .
The NSW Department of Education and Training says Ms Tziolas 's suspension follows complaints from " several " parents at the school .
" Several Narraweena parents complained to the school about photographs and inappropriate sexual comments in a Cleo magazine article , " a department spokesman said in a statement .
Mr Tziolas said his wife wanted to return to the same school .
" She would be happy to be reinstated back at Narraweena , " he said .
We were honest .
Yes , we 're both teachers .
Yes , we have sex , and yes , we are loving and committed to each other .
" What we did we both stand by .
We would do it again . "
Mr Tziolas - also a teacher - is concerned the furore may have also affected his chances at getting a job with the NSW public system .
He said he had applied for work at Narraweena , a primary school , as well , but doubted he would now get a position .
" I 'd imagine that my name is one that wo n't be called , even though I 'm on the list , " Mr Tziolas , 45 , said .
The Department of Education released a statement earlier today , saying Ms Tziolas was a temporary teacher and the school had taken the decision to sack her .
" Several parents complained about the photographs and innapropriate sexual comments , " it stated .
The sacking would be investigated by the department 's Employee Performance and Conduct Brach .

" Pulling " Building 7
A PBS documentary about the 9/11/01 attack , America Rebuilds , features an interview with the leaseholder of the destroyed WTC complex , Larry Silverstein .
In it , the elderly developer makes the following statement :
I remember getting a call from the , er , fire department commander , telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire , and I said , " We've had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it . "
And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse .
This statement seems to suggest that the FDNY decided to demolish the building in accordance with Silverstein 's suggestion , since the phrase " pull it " in this context seems to mean to demolish the building .
At least that interpretation appears to be supported by a statement by a Ground Zero worker in the same documentary :
... we 're getting ready to pull the building six .
Building 6 was one of the badly damaged low - rise buildings in the WTC complex that had to be demolished as part of the cleanup operation .
An alternative interpretation of Silverstein 's statement is that " pull it " refers to withdrawing firefighters from the building .
However , according to FEMA 's report there were no manual firefighting operations in Building 7 , so there would not have been any firefighters to " pull " -- at least not from inside the building .
WTC 7 collapsed approximately 7 hours after the collapse of WTC 1 .
Preliminary indications were that , due to lack of water , no manual firefighting actions were taken by FDNY .
That Silverstein would admit that officials intentionally demolished Building 7 is bizarre for a number of reasons .
Silverstein Properties Inc. had already won an $ 861 million claim for the loss of the building in a terrorist incident .
FEMA 's report states that the cause of the building 's collapse was fires .
Presumably FEMA and the insurance company would be interested in knowing if the building was instead demolished by the FDNY .
Moreover , the logistics of rigging a skyscraper for demolition in the space of a few hours would be daunting to say the least , particularly given that demolition teams would have to work around fires and smoke .
An Overlooked Explanation
A third explanation is less obvious but makes sense of the non-sequiturs in the above explanations : perhaps Silverstein 's statement was calculated to confuse the issue of what actually happened to Building 7 .
By suggesting that it was demolished by the FDNY as a safety measure , it provides an alternative to the only logical explanation -- that it was rigged for demolition before the attack .
The absurdity of the FDNY implementing a plan to " pull " Building 7 on the afternoon of 9/11/01 will escape most people , who neither grasp the technical complexity of engineering the controlled demolition of a skyscraper , nor its contradiction with FEMA 's account of the collapse , nor the thorough illegality of such an operation .
Thus the idea that officials decided to " pull " Building 7 after the attack serves as a distraction from the inescapable logic that the building 's demolition was planned in advance of the attack , and was therefore part of an inside job to destroy the entire WTC complex .
Web research supports the theory that Silverstein 's remark was part of a calculated distraction .
The pull - it remark is copied by hundreds of websites , many citing the remark from the Ground Zero worker about Building 6 as proof that to ' pull ' means to demolish .
However , searching sites specific to the demolition trade does not support this meaning of ' pull ' .
The following Google searches of the two best known controlled demolition sites in October of 2003 did not return any results indicating that pulling and demolition are synonymous .
City staff have contacted the property owner by phone to request that he obtain a demolition permit and pull down and demolish the building
Searching Google with the query demolition pull and filtering out sites referring to the Silverstein pull - it remark returns only one result in about 10 pages of results that uses ' pull ' to mean demolish :
A review of the numerous websites that assert that Silverstein 's remark constituted an admission of demolishing WTC 7 is revealing .
Few such sites note that the physical characteristics of the collapse exactly match conventional demolitions , or that fires have never before or since felled steel - framed high - rise buildings -- two facts that constitute an overwhelming case for the controlled demolition of WTC 7 .
Instead , the pull - it controversy seems to have created a distraction , eclipsing the case for controlled demolition .
10 Attractive Women Who Could Kick Your Ass At Something Manly May. 12 by TKK
Women have historically been seen as the " fairer sex " and their physical accomplishments are often overshadowed by their male counterparts .
But let 's get something straight : there are plenty of women out there who are not only attractive but who are pretty damn good at a sport or profession that 's normally seen as " manly . "
So the next time you think of women as the weaker sex , take a look at the following examples and wallow in the disgusting pool of your own wrongness .
10 - Natsuko " Gal " Sone - Competitive Eating
Eating mass quantities of food extremely fast seems to be custom tailored for fat dudes .
Surprisingly , the real landscape of Major League Eating defies that .
There 's eaters like Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut , who look and act like regular dudes but can somehow also consume almost 70 hotdogs in 12 minutes .
Natsuko " Gal " Sone ( pictured in the middle ) is not like these men .
No , Natsuko is a Japanese TV personality and pop singer who weighs in at a teensy 96 lbs .
So while her tiny frame and high pitched voice may have you thinking this girl could n't finish a garden salad , she 'd eat more sushi in one sitting than you will in one year .
And she 'll look much hotter than you while doing it .
Check out Natsuko " Gal " Sone in action on YouTube .
9- Danica McKellar - Math
Remember the Wonder Years ?
Remember Winnie Cooper and how you totally had a crush on her , and how you wished she 'd stop messing around with that loser Kevin Arnold and transfer to your school so you could be her boyfriend and carry her books to class for her ?
Yeah , us too .
Well , guess what ?
Winnie Cooper , or rather Danica McKellar , the actress who played her , is all grown up and she is freaking hot .
But what 's most surprising is that she 's also a total brainiac , having graduated summa cum laude from UCLA with a degree in mathematics .
That 's right : Ms. McKellar excels in a field that , for a long time , was considered too complex for the relatively " simple " brains of women .
It makes your math skills seem almost " elementary " by comparison , does n't it , Einstein ?
Check out Danica McKellar in action on YouTube .
8- Jennie Finch - Softball
99 % of the male population will never play in the major leagues .
Most of us mortals just do n't have the hand - eye coordination and the strength necessary to see , much less hit , a major league fastball nor do we have the speed or the dexterity to field a position .
However , there is hope in the form of softball .
This toned down version of the big league sport is simple enough that most of us can play it at least on a recreational level .
And we bet most of you think that if you ever found yourself face to face with a female pitcher , you could point out into the stands and call your shot because this baby is going , going , GONE , right ?
Well , if you ever went up against Jennie Finch , chances are you 'd probably strike out on three straight pitches .
We really can't decide what this former All - American and Olympic Gold Medalist 's greatest weapon is :
Is it her smoking hotness or her smoking fastball , which tops out at 71 mph - in baseball terms , that 's the equivalent of a 100 mph heater .
No wonder she 's struck out a total of 1,028 batters in her career .
You want to step in to the batter 's box and see if you can avoid being number 1,029 ?
Did n't think so .
Check out Jennie Finch in action on YouTube .
7- Jeanette Lee - Pool
Pool is the Steve McQueen of sports : it 's classic , timeless and utterly cool .
And it 's also pretty freaking manly .
Pool invokes images of smoky bars and rough and tumble types with tattoos burning time until they have to call their parole officers .
But there are a ton of accomplished female pool players out there who could run the table in the time it'd take most guys to line up a single shot .
If we were going to be humiliated at a game of pool , we'd want it to be at the hands of Jeanette " The Black Widow " Lee .
Supremely skilled and ridiculously attractive , this top pro is as deadly as her nickname implies .
Your best bet for beating her ?
Break and hope you sink the 8 - ball right off the bat , because if you let her near the table , chances are , you wo n't get another shot .
Check out Jeanette Lee in action on YouTube .
6- Paula Creamer - Golf
Is there any sport that 's more " male " than golf ?
Not manly - football , baseball , hockey , hell any sport with physical contact is manlier than golf .
But the sport of golf is so steeped in the " male " culture that it 's hard not to see it as sport for men .
And talk about a boy 's club : there are still golf clubs in America that wo n't allow women to join !
But if those idiots who are in charge of those misogynistic institutions got a look at Paula Creamer , we 're sure they 'd relax those outdated membership laws .
But not just because she 's as pretty as a Tiger Woods tee shot right down the center of the fairway - she's also an accomplished golfer who has 8 major wins under her belt as well as the 2005 LPGA 's Rookie of the Year award on her mantle .
A female golfer who 's hot and can help you with your ( putting ) stroke ?
What 's not to love ?
Check out Paula Creamer in action on YouTube .
5- Jinx - Video Games
For a long time , video games have been a male dominated industry .
While women are rapidly catching up , men still spend more money and time on video games than women do .
But that does n't necessarily mean men better at them .
There are some professional female video gamers who can dominate any online match they find themselves in , no matter who they 're playing against , which only further dispels the notion that video games are just for guys .
If we could pick , we 'd personally love to play a few online matches of Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4 with Jinx of the Frag Dolls ( pictured on the right ) ; not only is she hot , but she would totally pull her weight when things got heavy .
Hell , if anything , we 'd probably hold her back with our bumbling fingers .
Check out Jinx in action on YouTube .
4- Allison Stokke - Pole Vaulting
Allison may have just started her collegiate track career , but she 's vaulted ( sorry ) into the national spotlight due to her amazing ability in the gutsiest of track sports -- pole vaulting .
Here 's a woman who will toss her body 12 feet up into the air on multiple occasions every day without an ounce of fear .
We predict Olympic success for this high - flying hottie .
At least we hope so , so we can ogle her in HD .
Check out Allison Stokke in action on YouTube .
3- Maria Sharapova - Tennis
Before you slap the obvious tag on this one , consider this : Maria Sharapova is freaking hot and you should n't complain about getting an opportunity to think about how hot she is .
Ever .
Besides , unlike a certain other hot female tennis player , Sharapova is actually capable of winning a few matches every now and again .
And she sure as hell could beat you in a match .
Have you ever seen her forehand smash ?
It 's vicious .
On a relate note , what is it with hot female tennis players whose last names end in - va anyway ?
Sharapova , Hantuchova , Kournikova , Dementieva , Cibulkova , Vaidisova - the list goes on .
Check out Maria Sharapova in action on YouTube .
2- Kyra Gracie - MMA
Mixed martial arts is the new hotness right now and it's easy to see why : it 's fast , brutal and bloody .
And it takes a special breed of person to step into an octagon and proceed to try and beat the holy hell out of another human being .
Sure , men , with their violent reptilian brains , are suited to this but women , who are supposed to soft , gentle and nurturing , are n't , right ?
Do you ever get sick of being wrong ?
There are a lot of female MMA fighters out there and they could take you apart like a fat man dismantling a whole roasted chicken .
If we ever had to walk down a dark alley , we 'd take Kyra Gracie with us .
Not only is she hot , but she 's a deadly fighter who holds a black belt in Brazilian jiu - jitsu and has won several world championships .
Oh , she also belongs to the Gracie clan - yes , that Gracie clan - so not only could she beat you up , but her entire family could as well .
Check out Kyra Gracie in action on YouTube .
1- Ashley Force - Racing
Is there any sport that 's more " male " than racing ?
Oh wait , we already used that line .
But auto racing is also a quintessential " male " sport .
Think about it : guys in the garage , tinkering with their tools then taking their cars out on the track and tearing around , all the while wasting gas and polluting the environment .
God , it makes the hair on our chest stand up straight just thinking about it .
But have you ever seen professional NASCAR and NHRA drivers ?
Yikes .
Aside from Dale Jr. , who we guess is sort of not terribly un - good looking , professional male racecar drivers have us wondering what else is on TV .
But not so with female racecar drivers - while their male counterparts leave much to be desired , female racecar drivers are , for some odd reason , ridiculously hot .
And while everyone 's fixated on NASCAR driver Danica Patrick , we 'd rather ride shotgun with the much hotter NHRA driver Ashley Force .
She 's got the balls to compete professionally in drag races and once beat her own dad -- also a pro racer -- in a competition .
Kinda makes your automobile exploits seem a little lame , does n't it ?
Yeah , that triple - lane change that you pulled off during rush hour traffic yesterday is way impressive , dude .
Oh yeah , and getting your Honda up to 80 on the highway that one time ?
Totally rad .

She 's a loved - and loathed - lawyer married to a political charmer : Is Michelle Obama the U.S. Cherie Blair ?
They have become almost as big a story as the candidates themselves - the First Wives - in - Waiting - but what do we really know about Michelle Obama and Cindy McCain ?
Femail spent weeks in the U.S. talking to their families , old school friends and current colleagues .
Here we present the first in a two part series on the women whose influence will be felt by us all . . .
Formidable : Michelle Obama has a highly competitive streak
Who knows what Michelle Robinson expected as she waited for her new roommate within the Ivy League walls of Princeton University in the autumn of 1981 .
As a young black girl from the wrong side of the tracks in Chicago she certainly knew she had done well to get here , one of just 94 black freshers in a class of more than 1,100 .
Even she , though , might not have anticipated her skin colour would cause such a furore .
While her roommate Catherine Donnelly appeared unfazed on walking in to greet her , Catherine 's mother Alice Brown felt differently , and , on learning the race of her daughter 's fellow student , immediately called the university 's student housing office .
' I said I needed to get my daughter 's room changed right away , ' Alice Thomas , a 71 - year - old retired schoolteacher recalls today .
' I called my own mother , and she said : " Take Catherine out of school immediately .
Bring her home . "
I was very upset about the whole thing . '
In the end , the room was n't changed , and today Alice bitterly regrets her bigotry , although , of course , attitudes to race were very different a quarter of a century ago .
And at least she consoles herself with the knowledge that 17 - year - old Michelle did not know , although she later confessed to wondering why she and Catherine did not become better friends .
Michelle 's years at Princeton , a time when students were not officially but often socially segregated , were to prove formative for the woman who would go on to marry the man now tipped to become America 's first black president .
What Michelle Obama did not envisage back then , however , was how she would prove to be a lightning rod for America 's views on race in 2008 .
Certainly , in a presidential campaign that has bubbled with controversy over race and gender , Mrs Obama has a singular vantage point - a black woman who has traversed vast landscapes of colour and class in her 44 years .
In a campaign where the wives have been set in as direct an opposition as their husbands , the ' Michelle Factor ' , as it has been dubbed , is playing a crucial part in the Obama team strategy - for better and for worse .
A statuesque and vivid figure - she stands six feet tall in her heels - many have warmed to her direct , straightforward manner and apparent ' relatability ' ( she often talks of the difficulties faced by working mothers , and has complained her husband does n't take out the ' trash ' often enough ) .
Others ( and they have included on occasion members of Obama 's campaign team ) have winced at what they privately call her ' lack of filter ' and the corresponding headaches this can cause .
One of those apparently more unfiltered moments , has indeed , continued to cause problems for Team Obama .
Earlier this year , Michelle announced , in relation to her husband 's political success , that she was proud of America ' for the first time ' .
Speaking at a Wisconsin rally in February , she said : ' For the first time in my lifetime I am really proud of my country and not just because Barack has done well , but because I think people are hungry for change . '
The quote was replayed on TV news channels in an endless loop of outrage , and eagerly seized upon by the McCain camp , who suggested it showed a lack of patriotism : within hours , the rival First Lady - in - Waiting , Cindy McCain was emphasising that she had ' always ' been proud of her country .
Three months on , the issue was raised again , when Cindy referred to it once more during an appearance on the breakfast TV show Good Morning America .
' I do n't know why she said what she said .
All I know is that I have always been proud of my country , ' she said .
Michelle , in turn , felt compelled to issue a renewed statement of pride during a TV appearance of her own this week in which she co-hosted a network chat show .
' Of course I 'm proud of my country , ' she avowed .
' In nowhere but America would my story be possible . '
She may be right - but there have been times when one could understand why Michelle might not have felt so proud of her country .
Only 20 blocks separate the £ 900,000 three - storey red - brick home , complete with thousand - bottle wine cellar , where the Obamas now live in the affluent Chicago suburb of Hyde Park from the South Shore district where Michelle Robinson grew up .
But socially , culturally and economically it is a different country .
Today the area has improved , but the buildings speak of neglect , and listless groups of black children still kick around on street corners .
Family values : Michelle with Barack and their two children , Malia and Sacha
Michelle , known as ' Miche ' , and her elder brother , Craig , grew up in a one - bedroom top - floor flat .
Space was tight - Michelle 's bedroom was in the apartment 's sitting room - and money was tight too : Michelle 's father , Fraser provided for the family of four on a manual labourer 's salary , all the while battling multiple sclerosis .
Her mother , Marian , stayed home and proved a fond , but disciplinarian parent , allowing her children only one hour of TV a night .
Instead , Michelle and her brother filled their time with books , chess , sports and dinnertime conversations with their parents .
Michelle 's parents and sibling recall the young girl as a determined , competitive soul .
Craig , now head basketball coach at Brown University , even recalls having to let his sister win at Monopoly because she ' did n't like to lose ' .
' She was a poor sport , ' he says today .
' Miche ' was also athletic , playing football baseball and basketball , honing athletic instincts that have stayed with her today - friends say she still works out ' like a gladiator ' , often rising at 4.30 am for a session on the treadmill .
She was also girlie too , her mother recalls , an ' easy - bake ' children 's oven , and an Afro- Caribbean version of Barbie among her favourite toys .
Intelligent and inquisitive , the young Michelle was an obvious candidate for one of the city 's ' magnet ' schools , a state school offering more specialised courses for brighter students .
It was , however , several miles from her home and every day she'd have to make an hour long journey to attend classes .
But Michelle wanted to do it .
' The first full graduating class was in 1978 , so it was pretty experimental to come here , ' one former teacher , Bernadette McHale - Rogers , says .
' She made a decision to choose an integrated environment that had more diversity in both curriculum and population .
She was a good student , a class officer in her senior years and a good participant in class .
She physically looks very much the same as she did in High School and she still is an articulate speaker . '
Yearbook pictures show a serious looking girl in a yellow shirt who does , indeed , look much the same as she does today , albeit a little less polished back then .
An ambitious student , Michelle made it clear she wanted to follow her brother Craig to Princeton , a desire in which she was , friends recall , initially discouraged by teachers who thought her grades would not be good enough .
But they were , and she enrolled in 1981 to study sociology , one of four roommates ( including Catherine Donnelly ) who were all on financial aid and shared a sparsely decorated common room a world apart from some of the more privileged white students with their expensive home furnishings .
Support : Michelle played a key part in her husband 's presidential nomination victory
Today , one of her roommates , a fellow black student called Angela Acree , now a Washington - based lawyer and a good friend of Michelle 's , recalls the university of the time as a ' sexist , segregated place ' where some of the white students would sometimes deliberately walk past the black students and pretend not to see them .
' It was like " here comes a black kid " , she recalls .
As a result , Michelle spent much of her time on campus with Angela and another black student , Suzanne Alele .
She was never an activist , however , but she felt the tension acutely enough to make it the subject of her senior sociology thesis , titled ' Princeton - educated Blacks and the Black Community ' .
At her request , the thesis is embargoed until November 5 , 2008 , the day after the Presidential election , but leaked segments demonstrate her acute awareness of her skin colour .
In one part , she writes of how she had never been more acutely aware of her blackness since arriving at Princeton .
' I have found that at Princeton no matter how liberal and open - minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me , I still feel like a visitor on campus as if I do n't really belong . '
These sentiments , it must be said , were kept away from her mother , who says today that her daughter rarely brought up the issue on visits home .
Nonetheless , it has proved enough for Michelle to be caricatured in some parts of America as the ' Angry Black Woman ' , an image her friends say is hugely wide of the mark .
' The last thing Michelle wants is to be defined just as a black woman , ' one friend told me this week .
' She is proud of her heritage but she wants to take race out of the equation , not make it the focus .
That 's what she 's about . '
Another friend , Cindy Moelis , a white woman who worked alongside her in Chicago in the 1990s , points out that Michelle retains an earthy sense of humour about the colour of her skin .
She recalls attending a spa with Michelle to celebrate her birthday .
' We were getting healthy food for breakfast , ' Moelis recalls .
' Everyone was saying " Hey Michelle ! " I wondered why no one was greeting me the same way .
" See any other six - foot tall African American women , " Michelle replied with a laugh .
" I do n't think so .
So stop taking it personally . " '
Any resentments she may have felt back then , however , certainly did not stand in the way of further academic success .
Michelle graduated from Princeton with honours and moved on to Harvard to study law , from where she was recruited as an associate into the smart Chicago headquarters of blue chip law firm Sidley and Austin , one of only 14 black lawyers out of several hundred working in the city at the time .
Michelle has told how she recalls gazing out of the window of her plush 47th - floor office in downtown Chicago and realising that she could barely see , literally or metaphorically , her beloved South Side .
Misconstrued : Right - wingers said this gesture of celebration between Michelle and Barack was ' terrorist fist jabbing '
She immediately impressed partners at the firm with her quick intellect and focus , among them Newton Minow , a attorney who still works with the firm .
' If she had stayed , she would have been a superstar , ' he says .
She did not stay however , leaving after five years to pursue a life in public office .
The death of her beloved father in 1991 , as well as the death of close Princeton friend Suzanne from lymphoma , had forced her to re-evaluate her life .
She was bored , she realised .
She had unthinkingly stepped onto a corporate path , and wanted to do something different , something with more of a calling .
No doubt her handsome beau also gave her the courage to make the break : while still at Sidley and Austin in 1989 Michelle was asked to mentor a summer intern named Barack Obama .
She initially refused his constant requests for a date before finally caving in .
Three years later , in 1992 , the couple walked down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ .
By then , Michelle had started a new job working in the office of the Chicago mayor .
It necessitated a big pay cut , but she was adamant it was the right move .
Valerie Jarrett , who recruited her and has since become a close friend , recalls being instantly impressed .
' I think I offered her a job at the end of the first meeting , ' she says .
' She was impressive . '
Avis Lavelle , the mayor 's former press officer and a contemporary also recalls her as a formidable force in the department .
' She was smart , she was successful , well liked and popular .
Long before there was a Barack Obama , there was a Michelle Robinson who was a star in her own right . '
She has remained in public sector jobs ever since , albeit increasingly well - renumerated ones , latterly as a £ 135,000 - a- year vice president of external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospital , an appointment she was offered two months after her husband became senator and is seen by some as a cynical attempt by the hospital to cash in .
Cashing in , it must be said , is something that the Obamas themselves have also been accused of .
Certainly , the couple 's financial fortunes have bloomed in recent years , aided by Michelle 's salary and sales of her husband 's best selling autobiographies .
It has enabled them to put £ 200,000 into trust for their daughters , Malia , nine , and six - year - old Sasha and £ 500,000 into other investments .
Michelle likes to make a point of saying she shops at the discount store Target , especially for the little essentials such as loo roll , but detractors , among them Chicago political consultant Joe Novak , believe she is motivated more by personal gain than her public image might suggest ( detractors have on occasion compared Michelle Obama to the acquisitive Cherie Blair ) .
Joe Novak points out that she wasted no time following her husband 's election as Senator in joining a corporate board , signing up in 2005 to the board of Tree House foods , a post that earned her $ 45,000 in 2005 , plus stock options .
' She got on the corporate board of someplace where she could make money , and make money quickly , ' Joe Novak says today .
' She 's cashing in . '
Her friends , of course , dispute this , pointing out that if Michelle had continued to pursue her legal career she would be earning many hundreds of thousands more by now .
Her motivation , they say , is providing security for the couple 's two daughters , nothing more .
She is , by all accounts , a devoted mother and , according to her husband , co-ordinates play dates , ballet , gymnastics , tennis and piano lessons ' with a general 's efficiency ' whatever the demands of the campaign .
While she has now given up her job , she has spoken often about the conflicts of the working mother .
' Every other month since I 've had children I 've struggled with the notion of " Am I a good parent ? "
Should I stay home ?
I have gone back and forth every year about whether I should work . '
She also insists that Barack fly home to attend crucial dates such as parent teacher conferences whatever his schedule .
It would be fair , indeed , to say that - like her wifely rival Cindy McCain - Michelle 's ambition for her husband is matched in equal measure by her misgivings about his candidacy , and its impact on family life .
Notably , like Cindy , she refused to move to Washington when her husband became a senator , fearing it would cause too much disruption to family life .
Having pledged to give her children the kind of dinner - together - every - night childhood that she had growing up in Chicago , discovering her husband 's presidential ambitions gave rise to conflicting emotions .
While sharing her husband 's vision , Michelle took time to adjust to his candidacy .
According to one friend , she hated confronting the fact that her husband could be away from home for several nights a week ( her solution to this , incidentally , as well as insisting to his campaign team that her husband has at least two nights a week at home , has been to equip both her husband and daughters with camera computers so they can kiss each other goodnight online . )
On the few occasions she has to be away overnight , her mother , Marian , puts the children to bed - Michelle does not want to get a nanny , joking that she has ' granny nanny ' instead .
She has always preferred to rely on family and friends where the care of her children is concerned .
Tellingly , too , campaign members recall that in the run-up to the final decision for Barack to run for the Democrat nomination , it was Michelle who led the questioning in the final intense meetings .
' She was n't talking about policy , she was asking questions about what demands would the campaign place on their lives ?
Where would the money come from ?
Could they really take on the Clintons and win ?
In other words , would it really be worth it ? ' one campaign insider reveals .
The sentiment is echoed by longstanding law school friend Verna Williams , who confirms that Michelle will have had the final say over the timing or indeed over whether to do it at all .
' Of anything , you can count on Michelle to have thought through whether it 's better to do it now as opposed to four years from now or as opposed to eight years from now , ' she says .
But now it is , and friends say she has reconciled herself to the fact .
And as well as the sacrifices she has had to make to her family life , Michelle has made great personal sacrifices too , most notably her job .
She resigned in January , aware that it was simply untenable to continue .
It was , according to friends , an obvious but difficult decision , and one about which she still expresses some ambivalence .
One close friend told the Mail that the subject had come up as recently as a couple of weeks ago , over a casual quiet dinner with girlfriends shortly before Barack was to win the democratic candidate presidential nomination .
' Of course , Michelle is right behind him , but she has misgivings about giving up her independent life .
It was hard - fought for , after all .
She said it 's a sacrifice for her , ' the friend says .
Her attachment to her professional life was revealed in January when , by way of a leaving gift , staff at the University created a volume documenting her accomplishments intended to mirror a similar book celebrating Obama 's Senate victory .
Mrs Obama , according to those present , burst into tears when she saw it .
Her skills have since been put to use on her husband 's campaign , of which she has become an integral member , flying all over the U.S. to deliver rousing speeches , often 40 minutes long and without notes .
But the knives came out for her again when some commentators tried to turn a gesture of celebration between the couple - touching fists at a rally in Minnesota just before he claimed the nomination - into something sinister .
One or two Right wingers accused the couple of ' terrorist fist jabbing ' , dismissed as nonsense by their supporters .
She often drops in references to popular culture , alongside words like ' freaky ' , and asides about American Idol , which cynics say are an attempt to ' normalise ' her in the eyes of voters .
Others pooh pooh this vehemently .
' There is no difference whatsoever between the public Michelle and the private Michelle , ' one campaign insider says .
' Truly there is n't .
The point about her is that she does n't need to adopt an image . '
Maybe not , but it has n't stopped efforts at a little re-branding , particularly in the wake of the ' national pride ' debacle Michelle so unwittingly sparked in February .
On Wednesday , sporting a chic , but simple black and white sundress , she was drafted in to co-host a popular afternoon network discussion programme , deftly navigating her way through hour - long chatter largely devoted to what to serve for breakfast , the merits of wearing tights and the cuteness of children .
It was largely well - received by the viewing public and afterwards , according to production staff , Mrs Obama delayed her schedule for half - an - hour to pose for photographs and sign autographs for the crew - requests that had not befallen her wifely rival Cindy McCain when she appeared on the same show some months ago .
' Everyone was very charmed by her , ' one source confirms .
' There was this sense she was ' one of us ' .
The revelation that sales of her $ 148 sundress ' spiked ' throughout America can , surely , only have further served to delight the Obama campaign team .
A dress , of course , does not win an election .
America may apparently like her sartorial style , but whether it is ready for a black First Lady as its figurehead will only be revealed by the polls in November .
In the meantime , however , Michelle can be heartened by one thing : Alice Brown , a woman who was so horrified by the colour of her skin that she did n't want her daughter sharing the same dorm room , is now considering casting her vote for Barack Obama .

Feds suggest a delay in 3 projects so they can study dying bats
[ social_buttons ]
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service has sent a letter to to the developers of three wind farms in upstate New York strongly urging they consider other locations for their proposed projects .
Biologists for the agency are concerned that the wind farms will further threaten imperiled bat populations suffering from an unprecedented die - off .
One of the wind energy developers , Iberdrola Renewables has decided to hold off on moving forward with the Horse Creek project until the impacts of white nose syndrome on bat populations are better understood .
But developers of the other two projects have yet to make similar moves .
There is little known about the so - called “ white nose syndrome , ” so - named because of the white substance found on the face of the sick bats .
The unexplained illness has killed of tens of thousands of small brown bats throughout the northeast over the past two winters .
As temperatures warm and bats emerge from a winter of hibernation , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has sent letters to three Jefferson County ( NY ) wind developers “ strongly urging them to look at other places ” for their proposed wind energy projects .
In the letters , USFWS requested the wind farm developers postpone their applications for ‘ incidental take permits . ’
Incidental take permits are required when any non-Federal activities will result in “ take ” of threatened or endangered species .
A habitat conservation plan ( HCP ) must accompany an application for an incidental take permit .
The HCP process is used to ensure there is adequate minimizing and mitigating of the effects of the authorized incidental take .
One of the species seeing some of the heaviest losses , the Indiana bat ( Myotis sodalis ) , is listed on federal and state endangered species lists .
The Indiana bat is the species of question in the New York case .
Scientists say that many bats are waking early out of hibernation because they are dehydrated , malnourished , and lacking sufficient energy to hibernate any longer .
According to Biologist Susi von Oettingen , “ [ W ]e have no clue what it is , and right now , it does n’t look like we will find out any time soon … ”
Although it is not clear what effect turbines have on bats , developers must be prepared for at least a few bat collision deaths .
And with bat populations falling at such unprecedented rates , biologists fear that those few bat collission deaths could have a much more substantial impact than previously calculated .
In other words , what once seemed “ incidental , ” may now be rather significant .

The New South Wales town does not have a large Muslim population Authorities in an Australian town have rejected proposals to allow an Islamic school to be built there .
Councillors for Camden , a small town on the outskirts of Sydney , unanimously voted against the proposed school for 1200 pupils .
The councillors said they based their decision solely on planning grounds , citing an internal report about its environmental impact .
The proposed development had met with fierce local opposition .
Camden 's authorities received some 3,200 submissions from the public about the school and only 100 in favour .
Tensions reached their height last November when two pigs ' heads were left on the site of the proposed school .
Pork products are forbidden for consumption according to Islamic dietary laws .
Camden 's mayor , Chris Patterson , stressed that the decision to reject the proposals was not made on religious or nationalistic grounds .
" It is a site issue , clearly a site issue , " Mr Patterson said after the vote .
Residents ' views
Town moves against school Council meetings , which addressed the proposed development , regularly drew large and outspoken crowds .
A variety of local residents ' views were aired at one such public meeting late last year and attended by over 1,000 people .
Some speakers focused solely on the environmental impact of locating an urban - scale school in such a bucolic setting .
One speaker implored the crowd to stick to planning issues , and not let the campaign be contaminated by racism or xenophobia .
The loudest cheers of the night greeted a speech from a local man in his late 70s , according to the BBC's Nick Bryant .
" Can I just say this without being racist or political ? " the man said .
" In 1983 , in the streets of London , a parade by Muslims chanted incessantly ' If we can take London , we can take the world ' .
Do n't let them take Camden . "
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney says Camden does not have a large Muslim population - about 150 families - so most of the pupils for the proposed school would have had to be brought in by bus from Sydney , an hour 's drive away .
Andrew Wynnet of the Camden / Macarthur Residents ' Group told the BBC about local concerns for the long - term demographic impact of such a development .
" The character of the town will change , " he said .
Low profile
The Quranic Society , the organisation behind the proposal , has kept a low public profile throughout the process .
Its position has been that Australian parents have the right to educate Australian children wherever they wish , regardless of race or religion .
The organisation was not represented at the meeting , but it can appeal against this decision in the courts .
Camden Mayor Chris Patterson said that the society would be welcome to re-submit the application on a different site in Camden .
An internal council report had earlier recommended against construction , mainly citing traffic concerns .

Police Have No Duty To Protect Individuals
by Peter Kasler
Self - Reliance For Self - Defense -- Police Protection Is n't Enough !
All our lives , especially during our younger years , we hear that the police are there to protect us .
From the very first kindergarten - class visit of " Officer Friendly " to the very last time we saw a police car - most of which have " To Protect and Serve " emblazoned on their doors - we 're encouraged to give ourselves over to police protection .
But it has n't always been that way .
Before the mid-1800s , American and British citizens - even in large cities - were expected to protect themselves and each other .
Indeed , they were legally required to pursue and attempt to apprehend criminals .
The notion of a police force in those days was abhorrent in England and America , where liberals viewed it as a form of the dreaded " standing army . "
England 's first police force , in London , was not instituted until 1827 .
The first such forces in America followed in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia during the period between 1835 and 1845 .
They were established only to augment citizen self - protection .
It was never intended that they act affirmatively , prior to or during criminal activity or violence against individual citizens .
Their duty was to protect society as a whole by deterrence ; i.e. , by systematically patrolling , detecting and apprehending criminals after the occurrence of crimes .
There was no thought of police displacing the citizens ' right of self - protection .
Nor could they , even if it were intended .
Professor Don B. Kates , Jr. , eminent civil rights lawyer and criminologist , states :
Even if all 500,000 American police officers were assigned to patrol , they could not protect 240 million citizens from upwards of 10 million criminals who enjoy the luxury of deciding when and where to strike .
But we have nothing like 500,000 patrol officers ; to determine how many police are actually available for any one shift , we must divide the 500,000 by four ( three shifts per day , plus officers who have days off , are on sick leave , etc. ) .
The resulting number must be cut in half to account for officers assigned to investigations , juvenile , records , laboratory , traffic , etc. , rather than patrol . [ 1 ]
Such facts are underscored by the practical reality of today 's society .
Police and Sheriff 's departments are feeling the financial exigencies of our times , and that translates directly to a reduction of services , e.g. , even less protection .
For example , one moderate day recently ( September 23 , 1991 ) the San Francisco Police Department " dropped " [ 2 ] 157 calls to its 911 facility , and about 1,000 calls to its general telephone number ( 415-553-0123 ) .
An SFPD dispatcher said that 150 dropped 911 calls , and 1,000 dropped general number calls , are about average on any given day . [ 3 ]
It is , therefore , a fact of law and of practical necessity that individuals are responsible for their own personal safety , and that of their loved ones .
Police protection must be recognized for what it is : only an auxiliary general deterrent .
Because the police have no general duty to protect individuals , judicial remedies are not available for their failure to protect .
In other words , if someone is injured because they expected but did not receive police protection , they cannot recover damages by suing ( except in very special cases , explained below ) .
Despite a long history of such failed attempts , however , many , people persist in believing the police are obligated to protect them , attempt to recover when no protection was forthcoming , and are emotionally demoralized when the recovery fails .
Legal annals abound with such cases .
Warren v. District of Columbia is one of the leading cases of this type .
Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate , a third woman , being attacked downstairs by intruders .
They phoned the police several times and were assured that officers were on the way .
After about 30 minutes , when their roommate 's screams had stopped , they assumed the police had finally arrived .
When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact the police never came , but the intruders were still there .
As the Warren court graphically states in the opinion : " For the next fourteen hours the women were held captive , raped , robbed , beaten , forced to commit sexual acts upon each other , and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers . "
The three women sued the District of Columbia for failing to protect them , but D.C. 's highest court exonerated the District and its police , saying that it is a " fundamental principle of American law that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services , such as police protection , to any individual citizen . " [ 4 ]
There are many similar cases with results to the same effect . [ 5 ]
In the Warren case the injured parties sued the District of Columbia under its own laws for failing to protect them .
Most often such cases are brought in state ( or , in the case of Warren , D.C. ) courts for violation of state statutes , because federal law pertaining to these matters is even more onerous .
But when someone does sue under federal law , it is nearly always for violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 ( often inaccurately referred to as " the civil rights act " ) .
Section 1983 claims are brought against government officials for allegedly violating the injured parties ' federal statutory or Constitutional rights .
The seminal case establishing the general rule that police have no duty under federal law to protect citizens is DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services . [ 6 ]
Frequently these cases are based on an alleged " special relationship " between the injured party and the police .
In DeShaney the injured party was a boy who was beaten and permanently injured by his father .
He claimed a special relationship existed because local officials knew he was being abused , indeed they had " specifically proclaimed by word and deed [ their ] intention to protect him against that danger , " [ 7 ] but failed to remove him from his father 's custody .
The Court in DeShaney held that no duty arose because of a " special relationship , " concluding that Constitutional duties of care and protection only exist as to certain individuals , such as incarcerated prisoners , involuntarily committed mental patients and others restrained against their will and therefore unable to protect themselves .
" The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State 's knowledge of the individual 's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him , but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf . " [ 8 ]
About a year later , the United States Court of Appeals interpreted DeShaney in the California case of Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Department . [ 9 ]
Ms. Balistreri , beaten and harassed by her estranged husband , alleged a " special relationship " existed between her and the Pacifica Police Department , to wit , they were duty - bound to protect her because there was a restraining order against her husband .
The Court of Appeals , however , concluded that DeShaney limited the circumstances that would give rise to a " special relationship " to instances of custody .
Because no such custody existed in Balistreri , the Pacifica Police had no duty to protect her , so when they failed to do so and she was injured they were not liable .
A citizen injured because the police failed to protect her can only sue the State or local government in federal court if one of their officials violated a federal statutory or Constitutional right , and can only win such a suit if a " special relationship " can be shown to have existed , which DeShaney and its progeny make it very difficult to do .
Moreover , Zinermon v. Burch [ 10 ] very likely precludes Section 1983 liability for police agencies in these types of cases if there is a potential remedy via a State tort action .
Many states , however , have specifically precluded such claims , barring lawsuits against State or local officials for failure to protect , by enacting statutes such as California 's Government Code , Sections 821 , 845 , and 846 which state , in part : " Neither a public entity or a public employee [ may be sued ] for failure to provide adequate police protection or service , failure to prevent the commission of crimes and failure to apprehend criminals . "
It is painfully clear that the police cannot be relied upon to protect us .
Thus far we 've seen that they have no duty to do so .
And we 've also seen that even if they did have a duty to protect us , practically - speaking they could not fulfill it with sufficient certainty that we would want to bet our lives on it .
Now it 's time to take off the gloves , so to speak , and get down to reality .
So the police are n't duty - bound to protect us , and they can't be expected to protect us even if they want to .
Does that mean that they wo n't protect us if they have the opportunity ?
One of the leading cases on this point dates way back into the 1950s . [ 11 ]
A certain Ms. Riss was being harassed by a former boyfriend , in a familiar pattern of increasingly violent threats .
She went to the police for help many times , but was always rebuffed .
Desperate because she could not get police protection , she applied for a gun permit , but was refused that as well .
On the eve of her engagement party she and her mother went to the police one last time pleading for protection against what they were certain was a serious and dangerous threat .
And one last time the police refused .
As she was leaving the party , her former boyfriend threw acid in her face , blinding and permanently disfiguring her .
Her case against the City of New York for failing to protect her was , not surprisingly , unsuccessful .
The lone dissenting justice of New York 's high court wrote in his opinion : " What makes the City 's position [ denying any obligation to protect the woman ] particularly difficult to understand is that , in conformity to the dictates of the law [ she ] did not carry any weapon for self - defense .
Thus , by a rather bitter irony she was required to rely for protection on the City of New York which now denies all responsibility to her . " [ 12 ]
Instances of police refusing to protect someone in grave danger , who is urgently requesting help , are becoming disturbingly more common .
In 1988 , Lisa Bianco 's violently abusive husband was finally in jail for beating and kidnapping her , after having victimized her for years .
Ms. Bianco was somewhat comforted by the facts that he was supposedly serving a seven - year sentence , and she had been promised by the authorities that she'd be notified well in advance of his release .
Nevertheless , after being in only a short time , he was temporarily released on an eight - hour pass , and she was n't notified .
He went directly to her house and , in front of their 6 - and 10 - year old daughters , beat Lisa Bianco to death .
In 1989 , in a suburb of Los Angeles , Maria Navarro called the L. A. County Sheriff 's 911 emergency line asking for help .
It was her birthday and there was a party at her house , but her estranged husband , against whom she had had a restraining order , said he was coming over to kill her .
She believed him , but got no sympathy from the 911 dispatcher , who said : " What do you want us to do lady , send a car to sit outside your house ? "
Less than half an hour after Maria hung up in frustration , one of her guests called the same 911 line and informed the dispatcher that the husband was there and had already killed Maria and one other guest .
Before the cops arrived , he had killed another .
But certainly no cop would stand by and do nothing while someone was being violently victimized .
Or would they ?
In Freeman v. Ferguson [ 13 ] a police chief directed his officers not to enforce a restraining order against a woman 's estranged husband because the man was a friend of the chief's .
The man subsequently killed the woman and her daughter .
Perhaps such a specific case is an anomaly , but more instances of general abuses are n't at all rare .
In one such typical case [ 14 ] , a woman and her son were harassed , threatened and assaulted by her estranged husband , all in violation of his probation and a restraining order .
Despite numerous requests for police protection , the police did nothing because " the police department used an administrative classification that resulted in police protection being fully provided to persons abused by someone with whom the victim has no domestic relationship , but less protection when the victim is either : 1 ) a woman abused or assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend , or 2 ) a child abused by a father or stepfather . " [ 15 ]
In a much more recent case , [ 16 ] a woman claimed she was injured because the police refused to make an arrest following a domestic violence call .
She claimed their refusal to arrest was due to a city policy of gender - based discrimination .
In that case the U. S. District Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that " no constitutional violation [ occurred ] when the most that can be said of the police is that they stood by and did nothing ... " [ 17 ]
Do the police really harbor such indifference to the plight of certain victims ?
To answer that , let 's leave the somewhat aloof and dispassionate world of legal precedent and move into the more easily understood " real world . "
I can state from considerable personal experience , unequivocally , that these things do happen .
As to why they occur , I can offer only my opinion based on that experience and on additional research into the dark and murky areas of criminal sociopathy and police abuse .
One client of my partner 's and mine had a restraining order against her violently abusive estranged husband .
He had recently beaten her so savagely a metal plate had to be implanted in her jaw .
Over and over he violated the court order , sometimes thirty times daily .
He repeatedly threatened to kill her and those of use helping her .
But the cops refused to arrest him for violating the order , even though they 'd witnessed him doing so more than once .
They danced around all over the place trying to explain why they would n't enforce the order , including inventing numerous absurd excuses about having lost her file ( a common tactic in these cases ) .
It finally came to light that there was a departmental order to not arrest anyone in that county for violating a protective order because the county had recently been sued by an irate ( and wealthy ) domestic violence arrestee .
In another of our cases , when Peggi and I served the man with restraining orders ( something we 're often required to do because various law enforcement agencies can't or wo n't do it ) , he threatened there and then to kill our client .
Due to the vigorous nature of the threat , we went immediately to the police department to get it on file in case he attempted to carry it out during the few days before the upcoming court appearance .
We spent hours filing the report , but two days later when our client went to the police department for a copy to take to court , she was told there was no record of her , her restraining order , her case , or our report .
She called in a panic .
Without that report it would be more difficult securing a permanent restraining order against him .
I paid an immediate visit to the chief of that department .
We discussed the situation and I suggested various options , including dragging the officer to whom Peggi and I had given the detailed death threat report into court to explain under oath how it had gotten lost .
In mere moments , an internal affairs officer was assigned to investigate and , while I waited , they miraculously produced the file and our report .
I was even telephoned later and offered an effusive apology by various members of the department .
It is true that in the real world , law enforcement authorities very often do perpetuate the victimization .
It is also true that each of us is the only person upon whom we can absolutely rely to avoid victimization .
If our client in the last anecdote had n't taken responsibility for her own fate , she might never have survived the ordeal .
But she had sufficient resolve to fend for herself .
Realizing the police could n't or would n't help her , she contacted us .
Then , when the police tried their bureaucratic shuffle on her , she called me .
But for her determination to be a victim no more , and to take responsibility for her own destiny , she might have joined the countless others victimized first by criminals , then by the very system they expect will protect them .
Remember , even if the police were obligated to protect us ( which they are n't ) , or even if they tried to protect us ( which they often do n't , a fact brought home to millions nationwide as they watched in horror the recent events in Los Angeles ) , most often there would n't be time enough for them to do it .
It 's about time that we came to grips with that , and resolved never to abdicate responsibility for our personal safety , and that of our loved ones , to anyone else .

Newswise —
A virus that typically infects insects could help with the development of gene therapy treatment for Hemophilia A , a condition in which even a bump on the knee can cause serious internal bleeding in people .
Researchers at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine improved a vector -- a vehicle that delivers gene therapy to cells -- in two ways to create a sustained , partial correction to bleeding problems in mice engineered to have Hemophilia A , which is also known as factor VIII deficiency .
The findings appear in the Sept. 1 issue of the journal Blood ( published Aug. 19 online ) .
The team adapted the outer layer , or " coat , " from a baculovirus , a virus that infects butterflies and moths , onto another modified virus .
This hybrid vehicle could more easily attach to certain liver cells and allow the genes within the vehicle to enter the cells .
The genes then caused the liver cells to make the protein that prevents bleeding .
The researchers also modified the vehicle so that it would express these therapeutic genes only in liver cells , thus reducing the likelihood of negative side effects .
The laboratory findings have significant potential for developing improved treatment for hemophilia but are not yet applicable to people , cautioned Paul McCray , UI professor of pediatrics and the study 's corresponding author .
" It 's an exciting finding , but we are still many steps away from a possible gene therapy for people with hemophilia , " he said .
Hemophilia
A is the leading sex - linked bleeding disorder , affecting one in 5,000 to 10,000 males .
People with the condition have a genetic mutation that leaves them with little to no factor VIII protein to prevent uncontrolled bleeding .
Individuals with the severe form of the disease have less than 1 percent of the normal amount of protein .
However , only a relatively small amount of the normal protein level is needed to make the problem milder and , thus , less life threatening .
" Hemophilia is considered an ideal candidate for correction with gene therapy because if you could just raise the factor VIII activity from less than 1 percent of normal to within 5 to 10 percent of normal , the tendency for spontaneous bleeding and need for hospitalization would diminish dramatically , " McCray said .
" In the mouse model in our study , we were able to achieve levels of gene expression that converted the hemophilia A in the mouse from a severe to a mild form .
The correction lasted 30 weeks -- the duration of the study , " he added .
One of the current treatments for hemophilia involves intravenously delivering recombinant ( genetically engineered ) human factor VIII protein to prevent bleeding episodes .
However , the weekly to bi-weekly preventive treatments are extremely expensive , costing up to $ 500,000 per year .
In addition , over time some patients may develop antibodies to the protein , making the treatments less effective .
In earlier studies , McCray 's team , which includes Yubin Kang , M.D. , at the time a UI assistant research scientist in pediatrics ( now a UI resident in internal medicine ) , targeted the liver because its main functional cells , called hepatocytes , can make the factor VIII protein and secrete it into the bloodstream .
However , the investigators recognized the need to target the liver more effectively .
" It has been difficult to conclusively identify the cells that normally make factor VIII , " McCray said .
" Hepatocytes may not be the main source of this protein , but they are relatively easy to target .
So we aimed to find a way to get these cells to make more of it .
In effect , we 're using the hepatocytes as a factory to make this protein and secrete it into the bloodstream . "
To better target the hepatocytes in the mice , the team took the disabled protein coat from the baculovirus Autographa californica and put it on to a modified type of lentivirus called feline immunodeficiency virus ( FIV ) .
FIV causes leukemia in cats but no disease in humans .
The hybrid vehicle efficiently bound to receptors on the liver cells because the modified baculovirus coat serves as a " key " that fits into the " lock , " or receptor .
The percentage of liver cells that took up the virus increased from approximately 5 percent to 20 percent .
The team also modified the part of the FIV that expresses the therapeutic gene so that its promoter that causes gene expression worked only when it was in a liver cell .
" Even if this FIV modified virus goes to other organs of the body , it wo n't express well because its promoter is liver - specific , " McCray said .
" This modification helps prevent negative side effects .
For example , if the gene were expressed in immune cells instead of liver cells , it could lead to a damaging immune response . "
McCray said the team now is studying additional ways to make the hybrid vector express the protein even better .
The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health , the National Hemophilia Foundation and the Hemophilia Association of New York , and by a pilot and feasibility grant from the Center for Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis .
The UI Gene Transfer Vector Core and UI Cell Morphology Core also provided assistance .
