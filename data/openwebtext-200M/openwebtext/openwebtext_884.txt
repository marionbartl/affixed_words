All but around 500 of the bottles contained wine , Ms Merron said
The government 's wine cellar includes stocks of alcohol worth nearly £ 800,000 , a minister has disclosed .
In a parliamentary answer , Foreign Office minister Gillian Merron said it holds 39,500 bottles of wine , spirits and liqueurs valued at around £ 792,000 .
Ms Merron added in her reply to Liberal Democrat Don Foster that " small quantities " of beer were also bought in for official events .
Mr Foster accused the government of " living way beyond their means " .
Ms Merron said that fewer than 500 of the bottles were spirits or liqueurs .
But the stocks did not include beer , which was acquired on an " ad hoc basis " , she added .
Mr Foster said : " The government are living way beyond their means .
They expect the rest of us to cut back but they still have n't given up their taste for the high life .
" Rather than wasting public money on expensive bottles of wine , it could be used to help get Britain out of its economic problems . "
Mark Wallace of the Taxpayers '
Alliance said ministers should not spend any money on restocking the cellar in 2009 .
He added : " It 's staggering that the Government has run up such a huge wine cellar at the taxpayers ' expense .
" Given the tough economic conditions , they should commit to spend nothing on it this year and start using up some of the stock instead . "
You know you are rich when you have this in your driveway ..!
Back in 2007 Bradford & Bingley issued a dossier challenging the " myths " and " misperceptions " held by critics of buy - to - let lending .
It wanted to " celebrate the resounding success " of the hundreds of thousands of people " investing for their futures " through the buy - to - let market .
Myth 1 in the dossier was how " the buy - to - let market is a bubble waiting to burst " .
What nonsense , it said .
Demand would remain strong , investors would ride out any cyclical movements in house prices , and it would be " extremely difficult for a widespread , national over - supply to develop . "
Little more than 24 months later , B&B has reported an extraordinary 20 - fold increase in bad debts , rising from £ 22.5 m in 2007 to £ 508 m in 2008 .
The number of its mortgages three months or more in arrears trebled to 4.6 % of its book in the last quarter of last year compared to 1.6 % a year earlier .
We do n't know precisely how many of these loans in arrears are buy - to - let , self - cert or more conventional residential lending , but it 's a safe bet that buy - to - let make up a hefty proportion .
After all , B&B was , through Mortgage Express , the pioneer of buy - to - let and the single biggest lender in 2006 when the market was at its most enthusiastic .
Many were also acquired from that toxic beast in the market , GMAC , which sourced loans and packaged them up for sale to B&B .
A humbled B&B , whose mortgage book is now the painful responsibility of the taxpayer , reckons we may be some way from the peak level of arrears , forecasting they will increase through 2009 and into 2010 .
Let 's put these figures in perspective .
During the worst year ever for arrears and repossessions , which was 1992 , 3.55 % of all mortgages were six months or more in arrears .
It was n't until 1994 that the Council of Mortgage Lenders started collecting figures for three - month - plus arrears .
These peaked at 3.7 % and then fell gradually to 0.87 % in 2003 .
In other words , B&B 's figures are grim by any standards , and are going to get worse .
Arrears are a lagging indicator ; they reflect job losses , which only now are beginning to be felt across the economy .
If B &B 's figures are this bad when unemployment was below 2 million , just how bad will they be when joblessness hits 3 million ?
Optimists may hope that B&B 's arrears are statistical outliers .
The industry average for arrears of three months or more remains at 1.88 % .
But maybe all this tells us is that other lenders simply have n't yet come clean .
When Guardian Money first began criticising the volume of buy - to - let and self - cert lending back in 2005 we were greeted with derision from the mortgage industry .
One report after the next was issued by the industry 's various cheerleaders to vouchsafe buy - to - let as a copper - bottomed investment .
We had two concerns .
One was the social impact of buy - to - let , with easy lending to tax - advantaged landlords crowding out loans to first - time buyers .
That first step on the property ladder became ever more difficult as properties suitable for let – the one - and two - bed flats – were snapped up by landlords bloated with cheap buy - to - let finance .
A side effect was the impact on existing flat owners when blocks were overrun by the buy - to - let merchants .
Our second concern was financial .
The extraordinary volume of buy - to - let funding was pushing up house prices ( and depressing yields ) to unsustainable levels .
It was a bubble waiting to burst , and it has .
I feel little sympathy for those who thought they could make easy money from buy - to - let .
They were not " investing for their futures " as B &B liked to put it .
They often did not put down a deposit and borrowed recklessly on fanciful ( and sometimes entirely fake ) prospective rents , which assumed perfect economic conditions for ever .
They expected workers priced out of homeownership to toil away paying off their landlords ' many mortgages in the most debased form of rentier capitalism .
What is absolutely infuriating is that we , the taxpayers , are now paying to bail out this bunch .
No wonder so many people will be gathering outside the Bank of England 's doors this week .
Web users in New Zealand are today blacking out their profiles on social networking sites to highlight objections to a new copyright law that orders Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) to disconnect any user or websites merely suspected of copyright infringements .
The photo blackout , which has extended to sites including Twitter , Facebook and MySpace , is just the first step in a week of protests .
It will climax next Monday when websites are asked to take down their content for a day to demonstrate what life without Internet access would be like .
The protests are organized by the Creative Freedom Foundation , a group representing artists ( which copyright laws supposedly protect ) .
They are objecting to section 92 of the country 's Copyright Amendment
Act which is due to come into effect on February 28 .
ISPs Forced to Take Immediate Action
The group says it does n't support copyright infringement and has no problems with genuine offenders facing legal action .
But it argues that the new law effectively forces Internet providers to cut access as soon as they hear a claim of infringement , rather than go to the expense of investigating the claim properly .
That 's because once an Internet provider becomes aware of such a claim , they are immediately held legally responsible for any copyright infringement themselves unless they take immediate action .

The CFF says this will lead to cases where people lose Internet access thanks to malicious claims .
It points to a US study showing 25 % of users unknowingly have malicious software on their computers which could leave their machines playing a part in illegal distribution networks .
( Source : com.au )
' Third - rate legislation '
Supporters of the law say these claims are overstated and that there 's nothing in the law to say Internet providers would have to act so aggressively in practice .
The problem is that the relevant sections of the law appear far too vaguely worded .
Indeed , at the time the law went through New Zealand 's legislature , then opposition MP Christopher Finlayson said " I think this bill is very much a patch - up job and very much what I would call third - rate law reform legislation . "
Ironically .
Finlayson is now the country 's Attorney General and insists there will be no delay to the law going into effect .

Asians should simplify their names , GOP lawmaker says John Byrne
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009
Print This Email This
In a puzzling move which she insisted is n't about race , a Republican state lawmaker in Texas said in House testimony Wednesday that Asian Americans should change their names to ones that are easier for Americans to deal with . 
Democrats jumped on the comments by state Rep. Betty Brown .
Her remarks came during a Texas House Elections Committee hearing , who 'd invited a Chinese American representative to testify about ballot accessibility .
 Rather than everyone here having to learn Chinese  I understand its a rather difficult language  do you think that it would behoove you and your citizens to adopt a name that we could deal with more readily here ?
Brown remarked .
 Cant you see that this is something that would make it a lot easier for you and the people who are poll workers if you could adopt a name just for identification purposes that s easier for Americans to deal with ? she added .
A spokesman for the Texas Republican legislator told the Houston Chronicle her comments were n't about race -- she was only attempting to " overcome problems " with identifying Asian names " for voting purposes . "
Brown made the comment after the Chinese American representative , Ramey Ko , said people of Chinese , Japanese and Korean descent had trouble voting because their legal name may differ from the English name they use on their driver 's licenses .
Democrats demanded an apology .
Local Democratic Chairman Boyd Richie said that the Republicans were trying to suppress votes with a voter ID bill and that Brown is adding insult to injury with her disrespectful comments . 
" State Representative Betty Brown 's racially insensitive remarks have no place in America , and she should immediately and unconditionally apologize for her remarks , " wrote Asian - American Democrats of Texas President AJ Durrani , according to a post on the Burnt Orange Report .
" Please contact State Representative Betty Brown about her unacceptable remarks and ask her to apologize immediately in a public forum . "

Nicolas Sarkozy angered China when he met the Dalai Lama in December
China and France have agreed to restore high - level contacts , ending a rift that began after French President Nicolas Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama last year .
The announcement by the Chinese foreign ministry came shortly before Mr Sarkozy was to meet President Hu Jintao in London ahead of the G20 summit .
France had agreed not to back Tibetan independence in " any form " , it said .
Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , of trying to seek independence from Chinese rule .
Correspondents say that Mr Sarkozy 's decision to meet him while France held the EU presidency particularly incensed Chinese leaders , who took the unprecedented step of postponing a joint summit .
' Mutual respect '
A joint statement published on the Chinese foreign ministry 's website said an agreement had been reached with France to restore high - level contacts and co-operate on tackling the global economic crisis .
" Both sides reaffirm the high importance of Sino - French relations and are willing to strengthen the all - round strategic partnership on the basis of mutual respect and paying attention to each side 's basic interests , " it said .
The statement said France " fully understands " the importance and sensitivity of Tibet 's status , and recognises that it is " an inseparable part of China " .
" On the basis of this spirit and the principle of not interfering in internal affairs , France refuses to support any form of ' Tibet independence ' , " it added .
" Both sides are willing to strengthen communication and coordination , to jointly deal with the global challenge of the international financial crisis . "
There would also be high - level talks at an appropriate time , the statement said .
No further details were given .
Mr Sarkozy and Mr
Hu are due to hold bilateral talks in London later on Wednesday , a day before attending the G20 summit .
Here comes the wave of job losses !
With the exception of one state ( Colorado ) , Moody ’s Economy.com is projecting negative job growth across the country .
Of course , some states will be harder hit than others .
Some you may be able to guess ( i.e. Big Five Auto states like Michigan ) ; others may be a surprise .
If you have been wondering about how the recession is going to affect your state , check out this list of the worst 10 states for job losses in 2009 .
It may be time to either relocate to Colorado or strengthen your resume .
Things are about to get roughâ€ ¦
10 . Mississippi
( - 2.61 percent ; 29,693 jobs lost )
With U.S. manufacturing , especially auto manufacturing , declining faster than ever , this blue collar state is hating life .
9. West Virginia
( - 2.7 percent ; 20,409 jobs lost )
You should be seeing a trend forming here .
States , like West Virginia , that have depended on manufacturing are getting hammered especially hard by the economic crisis .
8. Massachusetts
( - 2.8 percent ; 90,025 jobs lost )
This may be evidence that , while the economic crisis is starting with blue collar auto workers , it will not leave white collar and education - sector jobs untouched .
7. Kentucky
( - 2.85 percent ; 51,341 jobs lost )
Again , manufacturing jobs are getting hit the hardest .
This is going to get really repetitive before I ’m done .
6. Ohio
( - 2.9 percent ; 154,938 jobs lost )
Repeat after me : the blue collar manufacturing job market is becoming a swirling vortex of doom .
Get out while you can !
5. Missouri
( - 2.93 percent ; 80,550 jobs lost )
Repeat .
Manufacturing workers , abandon ship .
Go back to school .
Do whatever you have to do to get out before the roof collapses on you .
4. Florida
( - 3 percent ; 231,265 jobs lost )
The other bad places to be in this economy are real estate and tourism .
And Florida , unfortunately , has both .
Quickly sliding down the backside of a huge housing boom , this state has more houses than it can sell .
Add to that a huge drop in people willing to fork out the cash to visit Disneyworld and Miami , and you have a big problem for the Sunshine State .
3. Hawaii
( - 3.4 percent ; 21,228 jobs lost )
The Aloha State ’s biggest problem ?
It relies almost solely on travel and tourism .
When budgets on the mainland and overseas tighten up , the first thing to go is that yearly trip to Kona and the timeshare in Turtle Bay .
Worst of all for this island state , there are no other industries in the state large enough to buffer the economy .
Expect to see a lot of people relocating elsewhere from this beautiful but mismanaged state .
2. Connecticut
( - 3.45 percent ; 56,882 jobs lost )
This state will likely be hit on two fronts .
First , its blue collar manufacturing sector will suffer just like in other states .
To make matters worse , however , the cash that used to come into the state from the Wall Street fat cats that call Connecticut home will falter .
This drop in cash inflow will hurt every kind of consumer business in the state .
1. Michigan
( - 4.3 percent ; 175,368 jobs lost )
This is no surprise .
The fates of the U.S. automakers are directly tied to the future of this state .
With the Big Five taking beatings daily in the news and in their performance , job prospects in this overwhelmingly blue collar manufacturing state are dismal .
With no salvation in sight for automakers , employees are being paid to leave .
My advice : take the money and get into another career .
Auto manufacturing is not a good place right now for anyone .
That ’s the worst of it !
New York , Iowa , Rhode Island , and Utah are n’t far behind .
Check out the silver lining later this week when we talk about the 10 best states .
Okay , so it ’s more like a bronze lining .
How are job losses in your state ?
Or are you from a state with actual job growth ( gasp ! ) ?

Back before I gave up on the beat , I used to write quite a bit about abuses of the H - 1B program , particularly by technology companies who exploited the program and foreign - born workers for cheap labor .
Why did I give up ?
Covering the issue became a waste of time , because the government would n't actively investigate the program , and a mere shouting match between nativist anti-H -1B activists and the program 's supporters is only interesting for so long when there are no new developments .
But this past Thursday , there was , at long last , a real development : a federal grand jury indicted 11 people in six states for using the H - 1B program to commit immigration fraud , and specifically for violating prevailing wage laws .
" What we found here is that some folks have found some ways to make misrepresentations to the government that disadvantage American workers who did not have the opportunity to apply for the real jobs that existed , " US Citizenship and Immigration Services official Michael Aytes told CNN - IBN .
All 11 of those indicted were Indian nationals who worked for Vision Systems Group , and there are at least five other companies under investigation .
An Iowa US Attorney involved in the case told BusinessWeek that the government is only " at the tip of the iceberg " with these initial investigations and expects to uncover much more fraud .
If even half of what I heard from programmers during my H - 1B coverage days was true , then not only is there plenty of fraud to investigate , but some of the biggest names in technology have been guilty of abusing the program to varying degrees at different times .
The most common abuse scenario goes something like this : a company looking to hire a low - or mid-level programmer posts a job advertisement containing some patently ridiculous set of qualifications , like 20 years of Java programming experience ( Java has n't even been around that long ) and a Ph.D. in computer science .
Upon getting no responses , the company applies to the federal government to fill the position with an H - 1B worker on the grounds that it can't find any qualified Americans .
Having hired the H - 1B worker , the company may pay him less than the advertised wage , or it may offer him no benefits , or his working conditions may be poor , or some combination of these and other factors , yet the immigrant worker sticks it out for a set number of years in hopes of getting a green card .
But the bigger problem with this kind of H - 1B abuse is n't necessarily that the immigrant workers are exploited — many of them are quite happy in their US jobs , even if their wages are lower and they have no benefits .
Rather , the program ( anecdotally ) has a second - order , negative effect on American programmers ' wages , and therefore on the overall attractiveness of the profession for high school and college graduates .
I described how this may work in a 2006 article using a slightly contrived and un-nuanced example :
Let 's say that an H - 1B - free labor market has set a price on a year 's worth of work from a programmer with a bachelors degree and two years experience at US $ 35,000 +
$ 12,000 ( benefits like health insurance for a family of four ) = $ 47,000 .
Now let 's say that companies acquire the ability , via the introduction of the H - 1B program , to import foreign labor of comparable quality .
The average imported worker is willing provide the same work for $ 35,000 , but instead of benefits she wants health insurance for herself only ( $ 3,000 / year ) plus a green card .
Thus the promise of a green card to the H - 1B worker is valued by the market at $ 9,000 / year , and you can and must factor this in to account for the H - 1B employee 's total compensation .
The cost of the green card to the employer is much less than the cost of the American worker 's insurance coverage , plus the foreign worker is obligated to work for the employer for a set period if she wants to get the promised green card .
This is a win-win for the employer and the H - 1B worker , but not for the American employee , to whom the green card is worth exactly US$ 0 .
The American has been priced out of the market because the H - 1B will sell her labor at what amounts to a steep discount in exchange for a green card .
When the H - 1B program is used properly , it 's a great way to increase America 's global technology competitiveness .
By enabling American companies to tap the best and brightest workers from foreign labor markets , we can bring even more of the world 's money back to America and create more American jobs in other corners of the labor market , for a net gain in employed citizens .
But when the program is abused , it can have precisely the opposite effect by making the affected fields look less attractive to bright and ambitious Americans , some of whom may opt for non-tech career paths with better compensation prospects .
Let 's hope that in this present period of a shrinking job market and falling wages , the federal government takes a very close look at the H - 1B program to ensure that it 's working as designed .
The current crackdown is an encouraging start , but if it adds momentum to a protectionist backlash against the very existence of the H - 1B program , then that would counter - productive — a " reverse stimulus , " if you will , and at a time when we need every edge we can get .

HYDERABAD , India , March 17 ( UPI ) -- Scientists in India say they 've found three species of bacteria in the stratosphere , all of which are alien to Earth and resistant to ultraviolet radiation .
One of the species has been named Janibacter hoylei , after the late astrophysicist Fred Hoyle .
The others are named Bacillus isronensis , recognizing the contribution of the Indian Space Research Organization in the balloon experiments that led to its discovery , and Bacillus aryabhata after India 's ancient astronomer Aryabhata and also the first ISRO satellite .

The experiment was conducted using a 26.7 - million - cubic - foot balloon flown from the National Balloon Facility in Hyderabad , India .
The payload consisted of a cryosampler containing 16 evacuated and sterilized stainless steel probes that were immersed in liquid neon to create a cryopump effect .
The cylinders , after collecting air samples from different heights , were parachuted to Earth and retrieved .
In all , 12 bacterial and six fungal colonies were detected , nine of which showed greater than 98 percent similarity with known species on Earth , the researchers said .
Three bacterial colonies were deemed new species .
Although the study does n't conclusively establish an extraterrestrial origin of the microorganisms , it does provide encouragement to continue the work in the quest to explore the origin of life , the scientists said .

Allegations of British collusion in torture have widened to Egypt , where a young British man says he suffered appalling mistreatment during a week of illegal detention while being interrogated on the basis of information that he says can only have come from the UK .
The development comes after the Conservative leader , David Cameron , said there needed to be a full inquiry , not just to discover whether crimes had been committed by British officials but to establish whether the government 's " moral authority " has been maintained .
Azhar Khan , a 26 - year - old who has seen a number of friends jailed for terrorist offences , says Egyptian intelligence officers who detained him when he flew into the country last July forced him to stand on the same spot for five days , with little rest , while beating him and subjecting him to electric shocks .
Throughout this time , he says , he was asked detailed questions about his friends and associates in the UK .
The Foreign Office has confirmed that Khan was detained in Egypt for a week last July and , after being pressed repeatedly , admitted that it knew that Khan had subsequently complained that he had been tortured .
The Guardian understands that Khan 's allegations of mistreatment are supported by medical evidence .
Khan says he was handcuffed and his feet shackled throughout the five days he was tortured , and that he was naked but for a hood kept over his head .
He also says he could hear other detainees being tortured in the same large room , including one man with a British accent .
The Guardian has learned from a reliable source that MI5 had an interest in another person who was in detention in Egypt at the same time as Khan , and that the security service knew that there was every possibility that this individual would be tortured .
The allegations will fuel calls for an independent inquiry into the conduct of Britain 's security and intelligence officers in the so - called war on terror .
Gordon Brown is resisting an inquiry , saying that the attorney general will decide whether the police should be asked to investigate .
In addition to Cameron 's calls for an inquiry , however , Lord Carlile of Berriew , the government 's independent assessor of counter - terrorism legislation , said this month that a judicial inquiry was needed to examine Britain 's role in the US policy of rendering suspects to foreign prisons where they can be tortured .
Andrew Dismore , the MP who chairs parliament 's Joint Committee on Human Rights , says an independent inquiry may need to be held to examine MI5's role in the torture of British terrorism suspects after the foreign secretary , David Miliband , and the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , refused to appear before his committee to answer questions .
Professor Manfred Nowak , the United Nation 's special rapporteur on torture says he has " been in regular contact with the British government " to raise his concerns about the role of British intelligence officers in the interrogation of terrorism suspects who have previously been tortured .
Last week a highly critical UN report condemned Britain for breaching basic human rights and " trying to conceal illegal acts " during counter - terrorism operations .
A policy governing the interrogation of terrorism suspects in Pakistan that led to British citizens and residents being tortured was devised by MI5 lawyers and figures in government , according to evidence heard in court during a hearing brought on behalf of Binyam Mohamed , the British resident freed from Guantánamo last month .
Since Mohamed 's detention in Pakistan in 2002 a number of British terrorism suspects have been tortured there , both before and after interrogation by MI5 officers ; and they and their lawyers say there is clear evidence that British officials have been aiding and abetting their mistreatment .
However , Khan , from Slough , Berkshire , is the first British national to allege British collusion in torture in Egypt .
Khan is the former brother - in - law of a convicted terrorist , Omar Khyam , and was an associate of other members of a group led by Khyam who are serving life sentences in the UK after being convicted of plotting to blow up targets including the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent .
He was arrested at the same time as Khyam in March 2004 , but released a few days later without charge .
He and a friend flew to Cairo on 9 July last year having told friends that they planned to have a short holiday in Egypt .
Khan was detained immediately on his arrival , but no attempt was made to detain his travelling companion , who says he left the airport and alerted the British embassy .
Khan says he was held in a room at the airport for about 24 hours before agreeing to sign a document in Arabic , having been told by uniformed police that it would lead to the return of his passport .
He says he was then hooded and handcuffed and bundled into the back of a vehicle between two men , one of whom apologised to him in English and said : " This is our job , this is what we have to do . "
In an account of his subsequent mistreatment given to his solicitor as well as to relatives and close friends , Khan says he was driven for a short distance and taken into a building where the hood was removed .
He could see that he was in some sort of prison with barred windows .
He was stripped naked , handcuffed and his feet shackled and the hood placed over his head once more .
Khan says he was led along a corridor into a room where a number of people were being tortured from time to time .
He says he was beaten around the body with sticks and subjected to occasional , unexpected electric shocks .
His captors shouted at him and beat him if he tried to sit or lie down , he says , although he was occasionally allowed to rest .
He says he received little food or drink .
Around him , he says , were a number of other people who were also being beaten and tortured , including one man who spoke English with a British accent and prayed during beatings .
From other cells within the prison he could hear screaming from both men and women throughout the day and night .
During interrogations , which took place twice a day , he says he was asked in English about his friends and associates in Slough , Berkshire , in Crawley , West Sussex , and in east London .
He was asked about the bomb plot and about the bomb itself .
However , the questions concerned not only the men convicted of conspiring to cause explosions but others whose names had never entered the public domain .
His torturers , Khan says , even knew the name of the sister who married Khyam .
Khan says he was also asked about discrepancies between a statement that he had given to British police at the time of his 2004 arrest and later comments that he made while visiting friends in jail .
During other sessions he was asked about his childhood , faith and mosques he had attended , in a series of questions similar to those put to his friends four years earlier .
He says that after five days of torture he was taken out of the room , his shackles removed and his clothes returned .
He says he was then put into the back of a vehicle , driven across the city and thrown out of the car with a hood still over his head .
When it was removed he found himself in a public place with a uniformed police officer standing next to him .
He was taken to a police station and a statement was taken from him .
He says he met a number of British consular officials and told them that he had been tortured .
The following day he flew to Heathrow , where he was detained for questioning under counter - terrorism legislation .
He told the officers what had happened to him and was released without charge .
Khan remains deeply traumatised by his experience and has been receiving a range of medical and professional care , including treatment for internal bleeding that persists eight months after his release .
The torture of detainees in Egypt has been well - documented over many years by human rights groups and the US state department .
According to Amnesty International , about 18,000 people detained without trial are languishing in Egyptian prisons in " degrading and inhumane " conditions .
The organisation says that methods of torture routinely employed by the country 's principal intelligence agencies , the Mukhabarat al - Aama and Mubahath el - Dawla , include blindfolding , beating , suspension in painful positions , electric shocks , drugging , rape and death threats .
The UK Foreign Office reported in January last year : " One of the key human rights concerns in Egypt is the widespread mistreatment of detainees and use of torture in police stations , especially in cases involving political detainees .
The government has taken some steps to address the problem , such as allowing semi-independent prison inspections , improving prison conditions , and paying compensation to victims of torture .
" There have also been a few court cases against police and prison officers accused of mistreating detainees .
" But the basic problem still remains , and we actively encourage the Egyptians to tackle it . "
WASHINGTON  Seventeen - year - olds will soon be allowed to buy morning - after contraceptive pills without a doctor ’s prescription after federal drug regulators complied with a judge ’s order and lowered the age limit by a year .
The decision on Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration , which overturns one of the most controversial health rulings of the Bush administration , was scorned by abortion opponents and hailed by their abortion rights counterparts .
The long - running controversy involving Plan B has had more of a political impact than a public health one .
The drug consists of two pills that can prevent conception if taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse , and is not related to RU - 486 , the abortion pill .
Since 2006 , when Plan B became widely available to women 18 and over without a prescription , it has had no measurable effect on the nation ’s abortion or teenage pregnancy rates .
Like their older counterparts , 17 - year - old women will now be able to go to almost any pharmacy , clinic or hospital and , after showing proof of age , buy Plan B without a prescription .
Men 17 and older may also buy Plan B for a partner .
WASHINGTON  A Pentagon office responsible for coordinating Defense Department information campaigns overseas has been abolished in an effort by the Obama administration to distance itself from past practices that some military officers called propaganda , senior officials said Wednesday .
Military and civilian critics said the office , the Defense Department office for support to public diplomacy , overstepped its mandate during the final years of the Bush administration by trying to organize information operations that violated Pentagon guidelines for accuracy and transparency .
Pentagon officials said the position of deputy assistant secretary of defense for support to public diplomacy had been eliminated , with the staff members reassigned and the office closed .
Senior Pentagon officials said the decision to close the office was made by Michele A. Flournoy , the new under secretary of defense for policy , and was meant to ensure that global communications efforts by the Defense Department and military would be aligned with the rest of the government .
Reports have started filling all over the internet that a suspected Botnet detected back in January 2009 has been activated and reported to be on atleast 20 k machines .
This is the first time a Botnet has been activated on Mac OS X .
For those who dont know what a Botnet is , here ’s a layman explanation : A botnet is a netwrok of infected computers ( infected by Trojans that come with software packages and get installed on your machine when you install that software ) which are used to initiate attack on other machines through the network or internet .
These infected machines are also called zombies .
The first ever Trojan has been confirmed to come with pirated and unlicensed iServices package that came with iWork ‘09 and PhotoShop CS4 .
How to know if your Mac OS X has been infected ?
If your CPU is showing excessive usage ( 90 to 100 % at times ) then that ’s a strong sign that your Mac has been infected .
On close inspection you will discover a PHP script instigating DDoS ( denial - of - service ) attacks on websites .
How to protect your Mac OS X ?
Even though many Antivirus programs have been updated to block iServices ( which is infected with the trojan ) package but if your Mac has been infected already then try this :
Delete these folders :
1 ) System / Library / StartupItems / DivX
2 ) System / Library / StartupItems /iWorkServices

You know , I have always wondered like every other entrepreneur what makes some people just so successful and others not successful .
I wrote a blog post a while back on one of my other blogs , I thought I would move over to this one because well it was just so damn popular .
In working with my startup or just one of my start up ideas at DrinkingFor I have to live by the rules stated in that post in which I also found them at GoDaddy in which Bob Parsons is the original author .
I am not trying to take his stage , but rather spread the ideas .
Make them known to more people in more places in more types of crowds .
He wrote some 16 rules to live by and I just wanted to express them to the technical crowd that reads this blog .
A vast many of these can be used in an entrepreneur type environment and I feel thats where I am moving more and more every day .
So to be as powerful and rich as Parsons , I will start by living by what he says are rules to live by .
1 . Get and stay out of your comfort zone .
I believe that not much happens of any significance when we 're in our comfort zone .
I hear people say , " But I 'm concerned about security . "
My response to that is simple : " Security is for cadavers . "
2 . Never give up .
Almost nothing works the first time it 's attempted .
Just because what you 're doing does not seem to be working , does n't mean it wo n't work .
It just means that it might not work the way you 're doing it .
If it was easy , everyone would be doing it , and you would n't have an opportunity .
3 . When you ’re ready to quit , you ’re closer than you think .
There 's an old Chinese saying that I just love , and I believe it is so true .
It goes like this : " The temptation to quit will be greatest just before you are about to succeed . "
4 . With regard to whatever worries you , not only accept the worst thing that could happen , but make it a point to quantify what the worst thing could be .
Very seldom will the worst consequence be anywhere near as bad as a cloud of " undefined consequences . "
My father would tell me early on , when I was struggling and losing my shirt trying to get Parsons Technology going , " Well , Robert , if it does n't work , they can't eat you . "
5 . Focus on what you want to have happen .
Remember that old saying , " As you think , so shall you be . "
6 . Take things a day at a time .
No matter how difficult your situation is , you can get through it if you do n't look too far into the future , and focus on the present moment .
You can get through anything one day at a time .
7 . Always be moving forward .
Never stop investing .
Never stop improving .
Never stop doing something new .
The moment you stop improving your organization , it starts to die .
Make it your goal to be better each and every day , in some small way .
Remember the Japanese concept of Kaizen .
Small daily improvements eventually result in huge advantages .
Photo by _nickd Photo by
8 . Be quick to decide .
Remember what General George S. Patton said : " A good plan violently executed today is far and away better than a perfect plan tomorrow . "
9 . Measure everything of significance .
I swear this is true .
Anything that is measured and watched , improves .
10 .
Anything that is not managed will deteriorate .
If you want to uncover problems you do n't know about , take a few moments and look closely at the areas you have n't examined for a while .
I guarantee you problems will be there .
11 . Pay attention to your competitors , but pay more attention to what you ’re doing .
When you look at your competitors , remember that everything looks perfect at a distance .
Even the planet Earth , if you get far enough into space , looks like a peaceful place .
12 . Never let anybody push you around .
In our society , with our laws and even playing field , you have just as much right to what you 're doing as anyone else , provided that what you 're doing is legal .
If the law is unfair to you and others , you should do everything in your power to see that does n't happen anymore going along with not allowing anyone to push you around .
Imagine if Rosa Parks would have obeyed the laws !
[ Thanks Katrina ]
13 . Never expect life to be fair .
Life is n't fair .
You make your own breaks .
You 'll be doing good if the only meaning fair has to you , is something that you pay when you get on a bus ( i.e. , fare ) .
14 . Solve your own problems .
You 'll find that by coming up with your own solutions , you 'll develop a competitive edge .
Masura Ibuka , the co-founder of SONY , said it best : " You never succeed in technology , business , or anything by following the others . "
There 's also an old Asian saying that I remind myself of frequently .
It goes like this : " A wise man keeps his own counsel . "
15 . Do n’t take yourself too seriously .
Lighten up .
Often , at least half of what we accomplish is due to luck .
None of us are in control as much as we like to think we are .
16 .
There ’s always a reason to smile .
Find it .
After all , you 're really lucky just to be alive .
Life is short .
More and more , I agree with my little brother .
He always reminds me : “ We ’re not here for a long time , we ’re here for a good time ! ”

The Dow Jones is at its lowest since 28 October 1997
US shares have fallen sharply on concerns about the government 's latest attempts to shore up the banks .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 250.9 points , or 3.41 % , at 7,114.8 , its lowest since October 1997 .
But shares in the banks themselves rose sharply , with Citigroup up nearly 10 % and Bank of America rising over 3 % .
The US government reiterated its determination to keep banks operating , but added it wanted the banks themselves to stay in private hands .
There had earlier been reports that the government was planning to take a bigger stake in Citigroup and could even nationalise it .
" People left and right are throwing in the towel , " said Keith Springer from Capital Financial Advisory Services .
" The biggest thing I see here is the incredible pessimism - the government is doing a lousy job of alleviating fears . "
Technology shares also fell on reports that a reorganisation is planned at Yahoo .
The technology - based Nasdaq index fell 53.5 points , or 3.71 % , to close at 1,387.7 .
The falls pick up from a tough week last week , when all the major indices fell by more than 6 % .
Earlier in the day , the FTSE 100 in London closed down 1 % , the Cac 40 in Paris fell 0.8 % and the Dax in Frankfurt fell 2 % to close below 4,000 points for the first time since 2004 .

Archaeologists claim that they have found the skeletal remains of Princess Arsinöe , who was put to death by her sister , Cleopatra , in 41 BC .
The remains have also shed new light on Cleopatra 's ethnic background .

Cleopatra directly ordered Arsinöe 's death in order to protect her claim to the Egyptian throne .
Scientists are now using her remains to piece together an image of what she may have looked like — and what the famous Queen of the Nile may have looked like , as well .
" Evidence obtained by studying the dimensions of Arsinöe 's skull shows she had some of the characteristics of white Europeans , ancient Egyptians and black Africans , indicating that Cleopatra was probably of mixed race , too , " writes Daniel Foggo of the Times of London .

To AMQP or to XMPP , that is the question 19 April 2009
Some time ago I started a series of blog posts [ 1,2 ] on Ruby and messaging .
Most of the series is still in draft format and has to be completed .
It ’s a topic I ’ve been very interested for some time , and have monitored the space quite closely looking for new implementations and collecting presentations and links as I go along .
I ’ve been a fan of Jabber ( XMPP ) for some time now , but it has some smells , to me at least …
First , some background .
I ’m the chief utopian at a South African ISP , inX , and most of my current work focusses on finishing off the fourth generation of our flagship project ISP in a Box .
ISP in a Box is essentially a Rails frontend to a variety of services we procure and reprovision to resellers , which in turn sell to their clients .
Apart from coping with a lot of models and extremely complex business processes , we also have to cope with procuring and provisioning services .
In this post I ’ll aim to give some insight into our provisioning processes , and more specifically how I plan to implement our hosting provisioning over the coming days .
We exclusively use the excellent ruote Worflow Engine by John Mettraux to drive our procurement / provisioning processes , instead of overly complex state machines .
As part of this I ’ve implemented a Jabber Participant / Listener pair of classes for ruote , allowing any part of the workflow to be shelled out to a Jabber bot for processing , and continuing the workflow when done .
This has worked great so far , but the requirements of our hosting services are somewhat more .
This made me sit down and think , and I announced today that I ’ll be doing a “ pen and paper ” SWOT on XMPP , AMQP and REST .
What I came up with , is not a textbook SWOT , but at least a look at AMQP from an XMPP point of view .
And it was interesting indeed , so much so that I ’ve made up my mind to move to AMQP from XMPP .
Here ’s what happened …
The smells of XMPP
For the record , I really love XMPP as a protocol and the possibilities made possible by it .
I ’ve written a good couple of clients , for fun and for serious production use at our company .
In my mind , here is a “ SWOT ” on XMPP from someone who works with it frequently .
Strengths Weaknesses Presence – Know if your bots are running
Quick – Easy to get going ( emerge ejabberd ; gem install xmpp4- simple )
Queue like – ejabberd will store “ offline chats ”
Feedback and control via pidgin
Explicit identities ( JID ) Roster – Managing relationships is a nightmare
Roster –
High number of presence updates can be large overhead
PubSub – Feels like an afterthought to me
REST bridge ( hence ratpack )
File transfers are an “ extension ” to protocol and daemons
NOTE : I personally feel that most of the times we implement XMPP where we should be implementing a real queueing protocol .
This holds especially true , if you like me , counts on ejabberd ’s persisting of messages while the client is down .
For me personally the biggest smell in XMPP is the roster , at least for automated clients .
This shows in other implementations too , Vertebra implemented a gatekeeper called Herault .
I assume that with Herault in place you do n’t care about roster management , and all bots will freely accept invitations from each other , and ask Herault whether the commands should be accepted or not .
This is a perfectly sound plan , permitted your XMPP server is well secured and does n’t allow inter - domain communications , ie you ’re running inside a wall of trust .
The promised land of AMQP
I ’m typing this without ever having written a single piece of AMQP code ( be it producer or consumer ) .
The “ SWOT ” below is what I ’ve extracted from various online sources over the last couple of weeks , and especially today .
I ’ve got a number of requirements that needs to be fulfilled first :
Peer to peer implementation of “ bots ” or “ agents ”
Identity driven commands -> “ Server 1 : Create new site ” , “ Server 2 : Suspend site ”
Unrestricted “ bot ” to “ bot ” communication
File transfers ( big files )
No more roster management
Now the scary part is that all the above requirements can be fulfilled with XMPP .
The implementation would smell however .
Requirement XMPP AMQP
Peer to peer communication Roster management ( -1 ) Unique named queues ( +1 ) Identity driven commands Roster management ( - 1 ) Unique named queues ( +1 ) File transfers
File transfer proxy configuration ( - 1 ) Supported on the wire ( +1 )
No roster management Implement copy of Vertebra ’s Herault ( - 1 ) Unique named queues ( +1 )
I hope the table above shows how blurred the lines are , and how difficult it can be to make a decision between the two protocols .
Below is my non-textbook “ SWOT ” of AMQP .
Strengths Weaknesses
No rosters to manage – Use queues
Security managed inside the broker ( at least with RabbitMQ )
One to one ( private ) communication
One to many ( fan out ) communication
File transfer on the wire
REST interfaces in the making ( RestMS ) Presence – Know if your producers / consumers are running
Explicit Identity – ( JID )
Not so quick yet ( RabbitMQ ebuild only came into portage today )
In Summary
Both protocols are great , and the differences are not obvious at first .
XMPP is easily mistaken as a message queue , especially because of the “ offline chat ” features in Jabber daemons and the inherently “ targetted messages ” .
AMQP supports all of this , and so much more , without the need for roster management or Heraults .
The only thing that I ’ll miss from XMPP is the presence features .
All my bots currently “ talk to me and members of our support team ” .
I ’ll implement this in my AMQP producers / consumers irrespective .
XMPP is built for one - on - one communication , with “ broadcasting ” supported by a protocol extension called PubSub .
AMQP inherently supports one - on - one and one - to - many communication through it ’s clever message / exchange system .
Going forward , I ’m starting with the excellent nanite project from Ezra .
I ’ll probably work on bringing AMQP comsumers / producers into ruote this week , as well as implementing a nanite actor / master combo for ruote as well .
A great and timely post on RubyInside higlights RabbitMQ and some presentations to watch .
Please chime in on the comments , admittedly I might have buttered up AMQP due to my recent excitement , but I have a “ gut feeling ” it will payoff better in the future than XMPP .
XMPP still rocks , I ’ve just been using it as the wrong tool for the job , and I fear others have done the same .
In recent news , hackers have infiltrated sensitive Government data .
There seems to be no way of stopping this , as the Government has no organized group to address cybersecurity .
The challenge of protecting the government ’s computer networks is too big for any one agency to handle alone , a top adviser to President Barack Obama said Wednesday .
That suggests the administration does n’t intend to consolidate control of U.S. cybersecurity under a single department like the National Security Agency , as some have feared .
Hackers , identity thieves and spies are stepping up their attacks on the nation ’s power grids , military networks and other government networks loaded with sensitive data , as evidenced by the number of break - ins that have come to light in recent months .
Meanwhile , the administration has struggled with how to organize the nation ’s cyberspace programs .
In a sign of the turmoil , the head of the nation ’s cybersecurity center — Rod Beckstrom — resigned in March , blaming a shortage of money and a clash over whether the NSA should control cyber efforts .
Suggestions from intelligence officials that the NSA should coordinate the country ’s overall cybersecurity effort have triggered protests over whether it ’s appropriate to give such control to spy agencies .
What ’s next ?
It seems that funding is an issue and forming a solid team to study and implement new technologies to combat security breaches .
The US Government needs to find the funds and hire best in class hackers to be part of the cybersecurity team .
The old saying is – If you ca n’t beat them , join them . ”
In this case , hire these hackers to improve and secure the existing infrastructure .

How about restoring the franchise to prisoners and convicted felons .
The High Courts in Canada , Australia , South Africa , and the European Union have all declared the disenfranchisement of prisoners to be unconstitutional .
The USA is way out of line with other western democracies on this issue .
A huge percentage of the black population in the USA is deliberately disenfranchised through high rates of imprisonment , and in some states , because of some minor felony in the past .
Permanent disenfranchisement is truly monstrous .

Good point , Grace .
And I 'm sorry I had n't remembered that one when compiling my list originally .
But is that one best left to states to determine ?
Or the federal level ?
( I have my own unformed thoughts on that question , but am interested in yours and others first . )

Precinct - Based Counting : Ballots cast at the precinct are to be counted in a fully public , transparent , and verifiable manner at the local precinct level , with full citizen observation allowed by law , and results posted publicly at the precinct before either ballots or results are forwarded to any other location (s ) .
What methods of counting ballots would fully satisfy this recommendation , other than hand - counting ?
Perhaps scanning all ballots and putting on the web as in the Humboldt Transparency Project , but then you might have issues with non-secret voting , if a carefully placed subtle mark could be recognized from the web photos and identify a ballot as belonging to a particular individual .
Is there any other fully public , transparent and verifiable counting method ?
Move Election Day to Wednesday : Election Day is to be moved to Wednesday .
( Would likely require a Constitutional amendment - see this for a quick explanation of why moving it to Wednesday is a good idea . )
It 's a good recommendation , but hardly one for which you could get a consensus and move on quickly .
Your other recommendations are more important and could be achieved sooner .

Seems major disenfranchisement issues are missing or low on list ( e.g. define provisional to be valid at any polling place in county / township ) .
Hand counting before releasing results will not fly due to lack of poll - worker capacity and delay for media , introduces all kinds of avenues for cheating including by biased neighborhoods , and does not address vote by mail , which is 100 % in Oregon and upwards of 40 % in some some major states .
Also , baked in is some kind of assumed knowledge of the alternatives in perpetuity ; starting with principles instead of prescribing detailed " solutions " would make much more sense .

I understand you 're doing a to - do list rather than detailed legislation , but the elephant in the living room is HAVA .
HAVA with both its assumptions of the nonexistent coupled with its demands for the impossible and its backdoor transfer of both federal and state election control to the executive branch ... ... and I say again , because I was right and still am right in this regard : that you cannot get the election reforms you want from legislators while HAVA and what it represents is dangling in front of them like a shiny bauble in front of a two year old .
We 'd best make HAVA reform and EAC restructuring part of the list ... or the current status quo with HAVA and the EAC will be used against us every step of the way .
I 've said it often enough before :
We 'll have to say " No . You can't have that . " and take it away from them ... because they sure as hell wo n't give it up on their own .
And they 're not going to pay attention to anything else we want with that distraction dangling in front of them .
As for released convicts ... given America 's soon to be booming incarceration rates ( You think it 's bad now ?
Wait until the economic crash is in full swing ... ) given the high percentage of the population disenfranchised thusly I think a civil rights case could be made for a federal mandate that someone who 's served their sentence and is not on probation can vote in federal elections .
But it 'll be a fight , and the Rethugs on the Supreme Court will spike it if they can .
Of course the Rethugs on the Supreme Court and off will promptly try to implement " eternal probation " and " conditional not - parole " as soon as they can as well .
It depends on how much of an additional fight you want to add to an already uphill battle ...

I used to share that same concern .
Once I spoke to Harri Hursti about it , he straightened me out .
In CA , for example , we already have some 40 % of ballots cast by mail ( unfortunately ) .
If you 're gonna use those marks to buy / sell ballots , it'd be a helluva lot easier to do it via the absentee balloting going on already !
Overall , I think the transparency gained by the Humboldt Transparency Project far outweighs the downside you mention , at least for now , with such schemes .

First , please feel free to use your name .
You are welcome to do so AND express opinions , even if they might disagree with mine .
Second , I should have noted that the items on the list are n't necessarily ranked in any particular order of importance , or what I believe is most necessary .
Third , I agree , provisionals should be counted no matter where they are cast , as I strongly argued to Obama 's EAC transition team when they consulted with me .
It may lead to other problems , which I do n't think have been well thought out yet ( at least by me ) , by agree something needs to be done about that .
Will keep pondering it .
Hand counting before releasing results will not fly due to lack of poll - worker capacity and delay for media , introduces all kinds of avenues for cheating including by biased neighborhoods , First , I said nothing about hand - counting in my list .
But perhaps you were replying to Lora .
But in either case , the arguments above are all stuff and nonsense , unless you do n't know anything about real hand - counting ( for example , of the type done very successfully in NH ) .
Fully transparent hand - counting is * exceedingly * difficult to game .
Far more difficult than doing so via op - scan and tabulators , far easier to catch , and the time and capacity issue I find similarly unconvincing .
Pay people to come in ( instead of wasting money on shitty machines ) to count and keep your precincts small enough that no precinct has more than a few hundred votes to count .
No problem .
In any case , my list above purposely does not speak to hand - counting at this time .
Also , baked in is some kind of assumed knowledge of the alternatives in perpetuity ; starting with principles instead of prescribing detailed " solutions " would make much more sense .
No idea what you 're referring to .
My list speaks to doable election reform items .
For discussions of principles , see a few hundred ( or thousand ) other items here at The BRAD BLOG .

ZapKitty - I wo n't respond in detail for the moment , but wanted to let you know , I read your thoughts , and appreciate them .
For the record , the Holt Bill is meant as an amendment to HAVA .
It is meant to correct some of the HAVA problems .
On some levels , as its currently written , it succeeds , on other levels , it leaves huge problems , as I detailed in my analysis of the bill .
While I likely share many of your concerns about both HAVA and the EAC , I also believe that correcting many of the probs , in all 50 states at once , rather than one by one , may be a better way to go .
I 've met many of the state officials , and I see no reason to believe they 'll * ever * do the right thing in many cases .
If we can have a single federal success , rather than 50 that may take forever , I think we 'll be better off over all .
I 'll leave it at that for the moment .
And thank you for your --- as always --- VERY keen analysis of this stuff !

Naturally , it 's the best list around , Brad .
I know the precinct - based counting would eliminate most of my concern on this issue , but i'll mention it anyway .
I would like to see strong cybersecurity guidelines , including more frequent network security audits for state departments of elections .
I was shocked last year to find that Pennsylvania only performs internal security audits every two years .
The transmittal of results to the state office on election night should also be properly secured in some fashion .
Of course , if counting is transparent and properly conducted on the precinct level , then any inconsistency down the line would become immediately apparent .
But I would still like to see higher network security standards .

Brad , IMHO it must be a federal law , not for each State to determine , because we know what they variously do already - disenfranchise prisoners and felons for electoral advantage .
Primarily this is a federal constitutional issue ( other federations like Canada and Australia recognise this ) , not just a local electoral issue , because it is about the fundamental right to vote that should be available to all citizens .

Hey , Brad , that 's pretty much BS from the same politicos as I warned would not turn loose of HAVA in the first place .
HAVA can be reformed and reconstructed using the carrot of " you must have these minimums in place in your state for federal elections " ... and the worst of HAVA 's offenses can be easily corrected by having it under congressional mandate rather than executive .
HAVA / EAC's " backdoor " mode must be deactivated for reform to proceed .
I say again : you 'll get nothing like you want in reform with HAVA hanging over anything we may do ... no matter what sweet nothings Obama 's team may be whispering in your ear .
And there is no place for a local state - by - state reform effort ?
You will exclaim " Of course there is ! " and I say " No , there is not ... for there is no state by state reform plan in the eyes of congress .
They will insist that it 's HAVA in backdoor mode or nothing . "
And it was Democratic support that enabled HAVA and it was n't the federal government that got us as far as we 've gotten ... it was local and state ... it was Bradblog .
So why do you espouse the views of those who perverted the election system in the first place ... those who still have n't gotten crap all right with elections in the second place ?
And of course the reason
Holt 's bill is currently such a useless mess is because he will not turn loose of HAVA / EAC as it is currently configured come hell or high water .
And Brad ... it is a useless mess .
You above all other people have seen how Holt twists and turns the bill every which way the wind blows but one ... turning loose of HAVA / EAC as they are configured .
The bills current purpose is to legitimize that backdoor mode .
Nowadays pretty much everything else in the bill is window dressing designed to placate and distract " teh bloggers " ...
And that HAVA - caused distortion in the bill has cost us how much time and trouble ?
The bill is a constantly inconsistent mess designed to prop up HAVA and the EAC ... in backdoor mode .
And if you bought into a line they 're handing out that " We ca n't get you your reform without HAVA / EAC in backdoor mode " then you 'll wind up totally screwed sans vaseline , wondering just how the cripppled and watered down reforms got that way ... and with HAVA / EAC permanently entrenched .
Entrenched and just waiting for the next Karl Rove to realize " ...
Hey ... you know , we 've got centralized control of elections here ... "

Again , zap 's right , Brad .
They do not want to do the right things .
They want to seem as though they want to do the right things , and perhaps the most trenchant usage here was " sweet nothings " .
Bingo .
Sweet nothings .
Obama has been a one man symphony of them , and all kinds of awful stuff is actually taking place behind all those sweet nothings .
Somehow we must figure out a way to drive them to do the right things .

i can't immagine after a 14 to 16 hour day , as an election judge that counting & posting the results at each precinct would be that far a stretch in the name of democracy .
i'd do it .
the incarcerated felon thing is a little more complicated .
who 's to say that the guards / warden does n't tell the inmates how to vote & then rewards or punishments follow ?
there is no privacy in prison .
once a person has paid their debt to society , though , they should have the right to vote .

Ain't gonna happen in the first go round ... in fact the uphill fight I mentioned is that it 's going to be a royal slugfest just to get them to stop disenfranchising people who've paid their debt to society ... because most of those people happen to be black .
Convicted and incarcerated ... no .
But do n't worry !
We 'll be accused of wanting to allow pedophiles on death row to vote within , say , an hour of any real election reform bill being presented ...

1 . What about Voter Registration reform ?
Similar to what the Brennan Center has presented as " Universal Voter Registration " - i.e. all citizens are voters .
This should extend , for the purposes of federal elections to US citizens overseas .
2 . Please consider pro-actively noting whether your list of reforms covers voters who vote under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act .

i know u said it wasnt meant to be a complete list but the middleman , soe , is the most dangerous new tactic i see the neo cons using ... it as close to having " centralized counting " as they have gotten so far counting and posting at the precinct level is good but here in bloomington , they post the machine tape results a day or 2 , take them down before they post the soe " results " and no one realizes the totals have changed ( well nobody but me and i seem to be powerless )

" Disclosure of Federal Testing Processes / Results :
All federal voting system testing / certification processes must be fully documented and results made immediately available for public inspection . "
This is already happening .
All test plans , preliminary test reports and final test reports are posted by the EAC .
They are very thorough and show that there is not much difference in the process from when NASED and ITAs were doing it .

You mentioned that " backdoor mode " several times .
Forgive me , but I 'm not sure what you 're referring to with that phrase ??
I say again : you 'll get nothing like you want in reform with HAVA hanging over anything we may do ... no matter what sweet nothings Obama 's team may be whispering in your ear .
For the record ( and hopefully Agent 99 reads this comment as well ) , there are no " sweet nothings " that anybody is whispering in my ear .
None .
Obama 's EAC transition team talked to me to get my input on the mess that is the EAC .
They said virtually nothing about their plans .
It was me talking ( whispering less - than - sweet nothings ) into their ears , in hopes that they might listen .
And there is no place for a local state - by - state reform effort ?
You will exclaim " Of course there is ! " and I say " No , there is not ... for there is no state by state reform plan in the eyes of congress .
They will insist that it 's HAVA in backdoor mode or nothing . "
You 're right , I do say " of course there is ! " and lots of it !
But you 'll have to explain what " backdoor mode " is for me to respond in more detail to your point there .
So why do you espouse the views of those who perverted the election system in the first place ... those who still have n't gotten crap all right with elections in the second place ?
I do n't believe I have espoused any such views .

Well , and I do n't know what Zap meant by " back door " , but the way I read it is that HAVA and the EAC will become permanent federal control of voting .
Sort of like this quiet vitiation of Posse Comitatus is turning into permanent federal troops , the US Military , policing our streets .
Sort of like the supposed loss of Habeas Corpus for noncitizens only is actually the loss for us all because the president can declare ANYBODY a noncitizen at will .

HAVA Look : A Simple , Verifiable , Open Source , Paper Ballot Vote - Recording & Counting System http://www.geocities.com...ctionmodel/HAVAOnePC.htm
On the other hand , paper ballots can easily be input to a standard personal computer spreadsheet .
Voters can request a copy before leaving the precinct .
The precinct ( spreadsheet ) file is uploaded to the Internet .
The voter can quickly and easily verify his vote as the spreadsheet ballot records are sorted by a unique Precinct / Ballot ID code .
At the same time , he can view and / or download the total precinct ballots to verify the vote counts .
Consolidation of district / county / state vote counts is tabulated by Open Source software .
Three ( 3 ) volunteers input and verify the paper ballots .
As Volunteer A reads the ballot , B enters the data and C verifies the result .
Data entry would be completed shortly after the polls closed .
The voter fills out a ballot marking each selected candidate 's code ( i.e. a = Dem , b=Rep , c=Ind ) .
The volunteers use their god - given optical scanners ( EYES ) to read the ballots and enter the codes in a spreadsheet .
As each code is entered , the spreadsheet automatically calculates the total vote and percentage for each candidate .
here are many advantages over the current , vulnerable system .
HAVA look : * Data redundancy : 1 . Original paper ballots : retained in a secure location
2. Precinct spreadsheet files : ballots sorted by ballot ID
3. Internet : copies of uploaded precinct files for online viewing / download
4. Internet : County / state composite files ( vote totals sorted by precinct / county ) for online viewing * Data / software integrity : 1 . Original paper ballots : documented chain of custody
2. Data integrity ( 100 % automatic audit to catch discrepancies between the local precinct spreadsheet and corresponding internet file
3. Open Source code : eliminate proprietary code on DRE / Optiscan / central tabulator * Eliminate corrupting influence of vendors and election officials : 1 . Hardware : Eliminate bribery of election officials for purchase of DREs and optical scanners
2. Diebold / Premier & ES&S out of the DRE / Opscan voting machine business

Let me add one more item to your list .
When there are multiple precincts at the same location all candidates in all election contests must be in the same order .
This is to avoid what allegedly happened in Ohio in 2004 .
COMMENT # 35 [ Permalink ]

One thing that I did not see on your list was a mandatory canvass / audit of election results .
In Minnesota , each county is required to conduct a random hand count of a certain number of precincts to ascertain whether the scanners had tabulated the ballots correctly .
The canvass / audits should be transparent and open to citizen oversight .
Posting results at the precinct location after closing ( and having the facility open to the public ) might be problematic solely because the poll workers have already worked 14 + hours already and have an incredible amount of work to complete before they can call it a night .
It may be possible , but it would be difficult ( for example , we 'd need to pull at least one poll worker to serve as a liaison for the citizens and to make sure ballots and all materials ( e.g. , tabulation tapes ) are kept secure .
Minnesota does give a chance for citizens to witness vote tabulation at the city location .
That , of course , occurs after the ballots and tabulation tapes are transferred from the precinct to the city .
I do not know how many people actually go in to watch .
Great list !

From Brad above : Lora @ # 66 said re : transparent counting : Perhaps scanning all ballots and putting on the web as in the Humboldt Transparency Project , but then you might have issues with non-secret voting , if a carefully placed subtle mark could be recognized from the web photos and identify a ballot as belonging to a particular individual .
I used to share that same concern .
Once I spoke to Harri Hursti about it , he straightened me out .
In CA , for example , we already have some 40 % of ballots cast by mail ( unfortunately ) .
If you 're gonna use those marks to buy / sell ballots , it'd be a helluva lot easier to do it via the absentee balloting going on already !
Overall , I think the transparency gained by the Humboldt Transparency Project far outweighs the downside you mention , at least for now , with such schemes .
Brad , to clarify : I understand and agree in terms of the value gained from the Humboldt Transparency Project vs. the danger of non-secret ballots when compared with the absentee ballot mess and when considered in light of the GEMS snafu .
That was n't what I meant in my post above .
I was commenting on your Precinct - Based Counting item from your list above ( emphasis mine ) : Ballots cast at the precinct are to be counted in a fully public , transparent , and verifiable manner at the local precinct level , with full citizen observation allowed by law , and results posted publicly at the precinct before either ballots or results are forwarded to any other location (s ) .
I mentioned the drawbacks of posting ballots on the web --- i.e. non-secret , possibility of being able to identify a particular ballot as having been cast by a particular person --- and I add --- not restricted by those with access to ballots at the precinct , but available to anyone in the world with internet access --- not from the standpoint of " it 's lots better than what we have now , " but from the standpoint of " what 's the best way to count ballots , period . "
I mean no criticism of the Humboldt project and I applaud their method and efforts .
However , the votes were already counted , the election was over , and no one who might be into vote - buying or vote - coercion knew in advance that these ballots would be placed on the web .
Taking the point of view of the best way to count ballots , period , which is what I assumed you meant in your Precinct - based item above , putting photos of every ballot on the web for anyone to view has the drawbacks I outlined above .
I ask again , what methods other than hand - counting would fit your requirements here ?

COMMENT # 40 [ Permalink ]
... the zapkitty said on 3/12/2009 @ 12:49 am PT ...
Brad , first off : an apology .
I was celebrating my birthday and really had had too much margarita mix to be posting ...
And , equally seriously , I 've been wading hip - deep in Holt 's latest " discussion draft " since you posted about it .
I 've been working on integrating it into an actual ( and coherent ) election reform bill ... and the unending BS underlying nearly every part of that bill and the HAVA bill it is based on has really gotten to me .
And somewhere in the haze I confabulated things you had said into things you had not said .
And for that I apologize to you .
So now let 's review what I did ... and if there 's anything that may be worth keeping .
... Brad Friedman wondered bemusedly ...
" You mentioned that " backdoor mode " several times .
Forgive me , but I 'm not sure what you 're referring to with that phrase ? ? "
That 's just a shorthand phrase I coined on the spot for how the mess came to be .
But does it apply ?
Let 's see .
HAVA / EAC was a post -2000 shock doctrine - style effort to " temporarily " override state election prerogatives ... and of course now the EAC just wo n't go away .
And " backdoor " also applies to the underhanded way the mess operates ( see Bradblog , Tobi , BBV et al etc etc etc etc ) .
And add to that the less - than - honest efforts of certain parties to make that " temporary " mode of operation a permanently funded government agency with regulatory powers .
( which was one thing that HAVA / EAC was promised to not become ... )
So , yeah , it 's a lot of problems rolled into one and complicated by the insistence of the parties involved in being less than honest about the subject ... and " backdoor mode " popped into my buzzing head and I used it repeatedly ... without explaining it .
I blame the margarita mix .
... Brad continued ...
" For the record ( and hopefully Agent 99 reads this comment as well ) , there are no " sweet nothings " that anybody is whispering in my ear .
None . "
My apologies again .
I confused your support of HAVA / EAC - style top down enforcement by fiat as supporting HAVA / EAC in that " backdoor mode . "
I blame the extra lemon juice .
...
Brad then corrected us firmly ...
" Obama 's EAC transition team talked to me to get my input on the mess that is the EAC .
They said virtually nothing about their plans .
It was me talking ( whispering less - than - sweet nothings ) into their ears , in hopes that they might listen . "
My paranoia got loose again .
I blame the extra lime juice .
... the zapkitty liquidly ranted ...
" And there is no place for a local state - by - state reform effort ?
You will exclaim " Of course there is ! " and I say " No , there is not ... for there is no state by state reform plan in the eyes of congress .
They will insist that it 's HAVA in backdoor mode or nothing .
" ... and Brad replied ...
" You 're right , I do say " of course there is ! " and lots of it !
But you 'll have to explain what " backdoor mode " is for me to respond in more detail to your point there . "
Given the explanation above this part almost makes sense .
Top down is what DC does , Various parties in both parties have lusted for ages for a way to centralize control of elections ... and HAVA / EAC , a Rethug power grab in the wake of the 2000 election debacle , is the closest they 're ever going to get to it .
If we 're lucky .
( " It 's okay !
They 're our planes now ! " )
Thus its very existence distorts even well - meaning bills that have no need for the EAC yet find references to it somehow crammed in just to justify the EAC 's continued funding .
So actual election reform will need to see the HAVA / EAC mess acknowledged for what it is and then straighten it out .
And when that is brought up the dancing will begin .
Just like
Holt twists and turns every which way , baiting the EI movement then handing everything to the corporations ... but never ,
ever questioning HAVA 's origins or the continued existence " as is " of the EAC .
The dancing will start and you will be told that the states must have election reform rammed down their throats by executive fiat and that only the EAC can do the job .
You 'll find that any attempt to actually bring the EAC into line with the balance of powers will be stonewalled .
And any reforms will be at the mercy of the continuation of the EAC or will be distorted to support the EAC .
This has happened before to the EI movement .
This will happen again to the EI movement .
And Starbuck is still dead ... the zapkitty quietly raved ...
So why do you espouse the views of those who perverted the election system in the first place ... those who still have n't gotten crap all right with elections in the second place ?
And Brad responded :
" I do n't believe I have espoused any such views .
Please feel free to correct me , as usual , of course .
But I do n't know what you 're referring to , Zapper . "
Again , my sincere apologies .
I blame the salt

Glad to see you answering requests ( mine for one ) from last year .

I believe that those who commit voting crimes ( caging , suppression , etc. ) should lose their right to vote for set periods of time .
I agree that most of those in prisons should still have the right to vote despite being incarcerated .
The exceptions to that should be publicly debated and agreed to by the majority ..... a voting jury .
As you pointed out the sooner a vote is transparently counted after casting the less chance of outside manipulation occurring .
Someone made a comment about how good the NH vote counting was .... hmmmm .... that is not what I remember from reading the coverage here on BradBlog .

One issue that was not addressed was voting by the military and others overseas .
I believe overseas voters should not be disenfranchised due to the mail not arriving on time .
I would set an international voting date one week prior to the US date for posting an overseas ballot .
Or there should be voting precincts in each country 's US embassy or US central military base that counts the ballots , reports them and securely ships them stateside for a mandatory verification recount .

ArchiCoot ( # 42 ) ~ " Someone made a comment about how good the NH vote counting was .... hmmmm .... that is not what I remember from reading the coverage here on BradBlog . "
Thank you for addressing my 2008 NH Primary obsession !
Actually , it was the pristine , completely open and transparent hand count procedure in NH that allowed us to run the numbers and discover : " ... New Hampshire ’s ( Diebold ) machines experienced an error rate approximately 163 times greater than the error rate allowed under federal Election Law .
In addition , the number of machine counts that were in error by more than 2 votes was 9.81 times greater than the number of hand counts that were off by more than 2 votes ... " ( Robert Schulz , We The People Foundation )
http://www.wethepeoplefo...-RecountRpt-Feb-2008.htm
In fact , it was a fascination to watch the meticulous , dedicated , experienced NH state employees struggle to explain the number of anomalies they encountered on any given day .
Considering the evidence compiled by BlackBoxVoting.org 's now infamous ballot - tracking investigation / car chase ( playlist ELECTION TV link : http://www.youtube.com/v..._list?p=9ECEABC09579F656) it would follow that the outrageous violations on record of the NH ballot chain of custody would be reflected directly in the number of recount anomalies .
And boy , were they ever ...
You can see for yourself in this video , where a sharp - eyed counting team observes UNSORTED ballots coming out of the ballot box in sequential order .

WobegonGal @ 35 : The canvass / audits should be transparent and open to citizen oversight .
Canvass / audits would be transparent , under the list item above requiring " Full Transparency " for " All ballot counting / tabulation / auditing processes " .
Posting results at the precinct location after closing ( and having the facility open to the public ) might be problematic solely because the poll workers have already worked 14 + hours already
If they 've op - scanned results , those tapes could be posted in a window , no problem .
If they are hand - counting results , a new crew can be brought in to do that , and the all - day crew can go home .
In any case , no need to keep the facility open , as far as I can tell , as long as the results are posted before its closed for the night , and before ballots move .
ZapKitty @ 36 : Actually , 99 , upon review it seems I confabulated both of Brad 's replies to me into some things he did n't actually say .
Happens to me all the time .
I accept your apology , though none is necessary .
Your admitted shame is more more than adequate .
And happy birthday !
I think I 'll reply to your later clarification on the EAC / HAVA issues in a separate reply .
Lora @ 39 : I ask again , what methods other than hand - counting would fit your requirements here ?
Well , since I do n't know what sort of schemes will be invented ( see , for example , the Humboldt project , and others like it ) , all I 'm doing is calling for full transparency , citizen oversight at the moment .
Obviously , hand - counting fits the bill .
But there may be other methods , that might be deemed acceptable , and potentially , even more transparent .
So I 'll leave that as my answer for now , with an acknowledgment that hand - counting , if done properly at the precinct , is certainly the most transparent method that I know of at this time .
Archicoot @ 42 : How about except for assistance voting , No Electronic Voting ?
I believe the first item in the list already does exactly that , no ?
As to your suggestion of a majority vote to determine whether felons should be allowed to vote ( in prison and / or after ) , voting on rights is always a terrible idea ( see Prop 8 in November , for just one example ) .
We need to determine what rights citizens do and do n't have , and then enforce those rights .
That 's one reason why the list above contains a constitutional amendment , clearly declaring the right to vote .
Someone made a comment about how good the NH vote counting was .... hmmmm .... that is not what I remember from reading the coverage here on BradBlog .
You 're referring to NH 's recount procedure ( and horrible post - election chain - of - custody mess . )
Not the precinct - based hand - counting procedures used at some 20 % of it 's polling places , as I was referring to .
( And I now see that Jeannie - Dean responded similarly , with whom I 'll happily associate myself . )

The newly sobered ZapKitty @ 40 clarified his ( her ? ) EAC / HAVA " backdoor " ...
This discussion may be more meta than we likely want to get into in this thread .
But where the classic federalist ( and yes , conservative , but real conservative ) argument is made concerning the EAC's ( and HAVA 's ) existence , there is something overlooked .
That is :
Before the EAC , there was the FEC who created the federal voting system standards , and then the horrible and unoverseen NASED who carried out testing and certification for them ( they like to call that certification " qualification " now , but it was federal certification , as required by many states ) .
Nobody oversaw NASED 's testing , which was carried out largely by the companyies themselves , and nobody at the FEC bothered to do anything with the voting system standards , created back in 1990 , as I recall , and un-updated until 2002 .
I believe there does need to be a federal body overseeing much of this stuff , even as I realize that I may be in disagreement with some of my EI colleagues who feel differently .
As mentioned up - thread , I do n't want to have to go through much of this shit in all 50 states , one state at a time .
And there needs to be a federal oversight , testing , certification system in my opinion .
At least as long as anything electric is allowed to have anything to do with elections .
The references made above ( by you and others ) to EAC " controlling elections " , I believe to be somewhat of an overstatement .
From their current perch , I do n't believe they have the capacity to " control elections " , though they can , as it is now , control the machinery of elections , and control it poorly .
The EAC certainly needs to be reformed .
Big time .
And it 's so bad , I do n't care if they abolish it and start over with a different agency , or move it 's functions to other existing federal agencies , but there will still be a need for what it is they do ( or , more appropriately , what it is they are supposed to do ) .

( Waving now - empty bottle of Jero ) Come back here and fight , you !
More seriously ... these are all things that should be discussed in advance of and then in conjunction with any reform effort .
And as you suggest there are alternative solutions that have been discussed before as well .
How about I write up a guest article discussing the parameters of , and various views on the subject and invite discussion thereof ?
It 'd be a nice break for a day from Holt 's draft and I promise to stay off the Jero

Brad wrote in a response above , " Pay people to come in ( instead of wasting money on shitty machines ) to count and keep your precincts small enough that no precinct has more than a few hundred votes to count . "
I actually think a limit on precinct size should be on your list , given how some states have been pushing a move to " superprecincts . "
This is both because of the election night counting issue you spoke of , and also because it 's important that polling places be close to the places people live .
That 's an access issue and a disenfranchisement issue .

Just brainstorming here ...
There might be a way to mark ballots so they could be posted on the Web and still protect the secret ballot ...
How about if the ballot were under a clear surface , and the voter marked the ballot with a single uniform brand and color of marker , and the clear surface had openings only where the ballot should be marked , and a device could " read " the ballot so as to determine if the marks were complete ?
It would be very much harder to make an identifiable stray mark that might be recognized from a photo on the web , right ?
Or --- how about an automatic marking device that would deliver the appropriate amount of ink only to the correct location ?

should be At least as long as anything electronic is allowed to have anything to do with elections .
electronics = chips , boards , caps , coils , resistors , memory , logic , etc. 5 v , 12v DC voltages .
electrics = wires , power distribution , voltage regulation , high current load balancing , transmission lines , 120VAC 60 Hz voltage phase also in your networking thingy , add no synchronous or asynchronous telnet .
If they got to report results , they should drive node to node face to face , even a voice phone call could be intercepted these days !!
Got an alligator clip ?
Also Boxes that fail should be destructively reverse engineered for possible tampering .
We want to know what happened at the doping level , was any extra logic added and attempt to be destroyed by burning it out type coverup .
Just cause a part manufacture stamps a part number on a chip do n't mean it 's the chip they say it is , it has to be checked for backdoors logic bombs / radio control / killswitches / etc .

There are irrefutable arguments why elections should not involve computers .
Here are three references .
One is based solidly in information theory .
To believe , after reading it , that computers can be useful is like believing in a flat earth ; simply impossible .
Then there are two papers by leading scientists dealing with subversion at the working level .
[ Look them up in Wikipedia for more . ]
I ’ve tacked on two minor points at the end .
But the only valid conclusion is : hand count paper ballots at the polls ...
In “ An Undetectable Computer Virus ” David Chess and Steven White of IBM show that you can always create a vote changing program ( a virus in their context ) that no ‘ verification software ’ can ever detect .
They do this by a very clever argument which you can pursue in that paper , but the important thing to realize is that their results are not in doubt .
You also should know that these arguments apply to every computer system that can ever be created .
Therefore , if you use a computer anywhere in the vote counting process , you can not be certain of the result . ”
http://www.research.ibm....s/SciPapers/VB2000DC.htm
Dr. Peter Neumann , one of our most distinguished computer scientists : “ Even if you can look at the source code , you ca n’t guarantee that there ’s not a Trojan horse embedded somewhere in the code .
Any self - respecting system programmer can hack the innards of the system to defeat encryption techniques or any password protection , or anything like that .
All this stuff is trivial to break , for the most part .
In most computer systems out there , it is child ’s play .
Given the fact that the underlying systems are so penetrable , it is relatively easy to fudge data - for example , to start out with three thousand votes for one guy and zero for the other before the counting even starts , even though the counter shows zero .
Essentially a Trojan horse in the coding .
I can do it in the operating system .
I can do it in the application program .
Or I can do it in the compiler .
I can rig it so that all test decks work perfectly well …. ”
http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/dugger.html
Dr. Kenneth Thompson , another of our most highly - regarded scientists , won the Turing Prize [ maybe one level below a Nobel award ] ; he wrote a paper which has become one of the classics ; in it he showed how a trojan horse can be designed and released to do its work undetectably ...
“ The moral is obvious .
You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself .
( Especially code from companies that employ people like me . ) [ ]
No amount of source - level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code . ”
[ His attack inserted malware in the source - level code whence the compiler translated it to machine - level code .
Then he erased the malware items in the source level code .
But the compiler itself had been subverted and remained ready to pass on the malware indefinitely in later occasions .
http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html. ===
In addition to legislating against the communications devices mentioned by Brad and others , note that some machines communicate by transmission over the 110 V AC power lines .
This came to light in the Snohomish County [ WA} case a while back .
The Automark design is flawed .
Many voters have no way to check whether the ballot , as printed by the machine , correctly records their choices .
Also , the idea is really odd .
Other countries ’ election systems [ e.g. , Canada ] have provisions for voters to have assistance from humans in casting ballots .
All involved find this satisfactory .
[ BTW : Whence came the idea that using a machine is preferable to dealing with a sympathetic human ?
From a manufacturer ? ]

The most needed election reforms ?
Sure , here they are : 1 ) How 's about a break from the unichoice afforded to us in the polling place ?
I mean , unless you 're content to squabble over wedge issues for the rest of your life , easing ballot access for a second party to oppose the republicrat 's uber - grip on our federal government would be the most welcome change .
2 ) Finance reform .
I am so sick of being out gunned by multi-nationals and other groups who 's desires and ends are clearly at odds with the best interest of the electorate .
Admittedly , I do n't know what the best way is to end this bribery .
Whatever the answer , however ..
I support it 100 % .
Publically financed campaigns have been mentioned in the past .
Perhaps that 's the place to start .
Repealing the 17th Amendment might not hurt either .
ANYTHING , really ..
Just to bring some degree of accountability to congress .
3 ) A " None of the above " vote , resulting in a re-do if " None " wins , would help engage those who currently feel disenfranchised .
It would also help keep the party 's focused on the quality of their nominees .
4 ) Representative representation might be long overdue .
As it is , half the country is disenfranchised by our " winner take all " system .
With a proportional system , the representation is broken down in percentages ..
There are no " losers " who get ignored till next time round .

Actually , in political parties , as in many other large group human affairs , it is usually the most charming and disingenuous or the scariest and most disingenuous who rise to the top .
That right there is the reason we get no decent choice in every election .
How about NO political parties ?
And certainly repealing the 17th Amendment would n't help because the State Legislatures have no more morals than any of the other officials elected from political parties to " serve " .
And if you 're going to have huge immigrant populations becoming citizens , you can't take away their votes and call the citizens .
If people are sheep , flesh - eating and herbivore alike , making wedge issues is as easy as boiling water and wo n't ever fail till people stop being sheep .
One of the single most productive things we might be able to do , in terms of who it is getting placed on the ballots , is to abolish corporate personhood ... unless we can get everyone to rise up and force public campaign finance , one of those restorations that should n't be called revolution .

Here are my thoughts :
Not good to have " new team " come in to count votes .
I think only partisans will come .
If someone can't work the 14 ( or 8 see next comment ) hours , come vote and go back to work , you 're a sissy .
I think mandatory holiday is license for people to take the day off and not vote at all .
I think it could be mandatory 1 / 2 day holiday , which would split up the pollworkers day into two shifts to make it more manageable , especially if counting ballots at poll .
I have now looked at several hundred poll worker precinct reports in a big audit being done in L.A. County .
This is not definitive yet , but of those several hundred , only about 10 % were accurate .
There were fewer votes than signed the poll book , there were more votes than signed the poll book ; there were counts of more ballots ( including voted & not voted ) than the precinct had been given ; there were many that had less .
Counting the votes at the poll ?
People need to learn how to do basic math first maybe ?
I do not think this is fraud as if someone was committing fraud , they were make all the numbers work .
Training .
Need more and different .

Thinking from the perspective of someone who might try to ' alter ' an election by changing results , the 3rd and 4th ones together seem to be the most powerful method to thwart such an attempt .
results posted publicly at the precinct before either ballots or results are forwarded to any other location (s ) .

Wavelets in Multiresolution Analysis
Presented 2/15/99 for CS563
by Tom Germano
Table of Contents
Introduction
So how can a signal be converted and manipulated while keeping resolution across the entire signal and still be based in time ?
This is where wavelets come into play .
Wavelets are finite windows through which the signal can be viewed .
In order to move the window about the length of the signal , the wavelets can be translated about time in addition to being compressed and widened .
Linear Algebra Review
Basically a vector space is a set of vectors such as V= [ ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 1/2,1/2 ) , ( - 1/2,0 ) ] .
In addition to defining a vector space by explicitly stating all the vectors that make up the space , you can also define a vector space using a function .
When reading material on wavelets , the vector space L2 is often mentioned meaning the 2 dimensional plane of real numbers .
This vector space can be thought of as the plane made up by the x and y axis .
There are three important terms to learn for understand vector spaces and these terms of often used in discussions of wavelets with respect to their use in multiresolution analysis .
Linear combination  this is the easiest term to understand .
It is simply the sum of a set of vectors or equations where each vector , value , or function is multiplied by some real constant .
It is represented mathematically by the following :
Span  a span is a set of vectors whose linear combination can create all of the other vectors in the vector space .
For example , using i= ( 1,0 ) and j=( 0,1 ) we can recreate any of the vectors mentioned above through a linear combination .
i *1 + j*0 = ( 0,1 )
i*0 + j*1 = ( 1,0 )
i *( 1/2 ) + j *( 1/2 ) = ( 1/2,1/2 )
i *( - 1/2 ) + j*0 = ( - 1/2,0 )
So we can say that the vectors [ ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) ] span the vector space V mentioned above .
If we try to see if just the vectors i= ( 1,0 ) and k=( - 1/2,0 ) span V , well see that it does not work .
i *1 + k*0 = ( 1,0 )
i*( - 1/2 ) + k*0 = ( - 1/2,0 )
That works fine , but no matter how hard you try you will never make ( 0,1 ) using just I and k , so we can say that the vectors i and k do not span vector space V .
Basis 
This is the smallest set of vectors that can span a vector space .
If we create a sub set of our vector space V called S consisting of the set [ i , j , k ] , we can say that it spans V , but is not a basis for V .
Why , because we can eliminate k from S since k can be created using i and j .
So , S is not a basis , but a set of the vectors [ i , j ] is a basis for vector space V .
This is not the only basis for V , another basis could be the vector ( 1/2,1/2 ) and ( - 1/2,0 ) , since those two can also create all the other vectors .
Concepts of Multiresolution Analysis
For practical purposes one can think of an image as a vector space such as Vj would be the perfectly normal image , and Vj - 1 would be that image at a lower resolution until you get to V0 where you just have one pixel in the entire image .
For each vector space
Vj , there is an orthogonal complement called Wj and the basis function for this vector space is the wavelet .
The Haar Wavelet
These are the root functions for the haar wavelet .
f is what is called the scale of the haar wavelet , y is the actual wavelet .
With these two functions alone , you really cannot do much , so you must create a function where you can translate and scale both of these functions which are the following :
i is responsible for the scaling of the function , it basically shrinks and expands the graph the function makes and represents the resolution of the function .
j is the translation of the graph across the time axis .
Note how as the resolution increases , the number of possible translations increases exponentially .
Also , f ( i , j ) and y ( i , j ) for the haar wavelet do not call themselves unlike some other wavelets , they call the piecewise functions mentioned above .
To show how these functions actually work , see the Animations section in this Maple worksheet .
Haar Example
Pixel Values
[ 9 7 3 5 ] ( 9+7 ) /2 = 8
( 9 - 7)/2 = 1
( 3+5 ) /2 = 4
( 3 - 5)/2 = -
1
[ 8 4 1  1 ] ( 8+4 ) /2 = 6
( 8 - 4)/2 = 2
[ 6 2 1 1 ]
There are two types of data here , the sparse data and the detailed data .
The sparse data is what we want to get rid of and in this examples are the numbers [ 9,7,3,5,8,4,6 ] .
The other data type here are the details which make up the differences when doing our compression and here they are [ 2,1, - 1 ] .
This may look wonderful and all , but what good is compression that takes four values and compresses it to four values ?
Simple , in images especially , the pixel values are similar to their neighbors .
If they werent we would be looking at random static and there would not be an object .
When doing the averaging and differencing with wavelets , the detail values are usually low numbers and sometimes zero .
These detail values ( which compose all but one of the resulting values ) can be compressed much better than the original pixel values .
In this example , the number [ 6 2 1  1 ] are more easily compressible than [ 9 7 3 5 ] .
Filter Banks
Here we see what happens to an array of 8 values .
First the values are filtered with the high and low pass filters .
The data from the high pass filter is stored and the data from the low pass filter is filtered again .
This process repeats until there is only one value left and since the averaging and differencing works in pairs , that value is saved .
For my examples , the differences are stored in an array called d and the coefficients of the actual values and sparse values are stored in an array called c .
To see how these filter banks are applied using matrices , please review the Maple worksheet .
Image Thresholding
[ 1,0 , -3,2,1,0,1,2 ]
We can do our normal compression and get the following :
[.5 , -.5 , .5 , -.5 , .5 , - 2.5 , .5 , -.5 ]
Or we can implement the scaling of 2 ( j / 2 ) and get this :
From here we can do a better job of applying a threshold on our detail values .
In this example we can scale any value at or below 1 / sqrt ( 2 ) to 0 and get the following as our new coefficients :
How well does this thresholding mangle our orginial data ?
Here are the plots of the original data and reconstructed data with the thresheld coefficients followed by the comparison of the two :

Healthy young adults carrying a gene variant that is a major risk factor for the disease seem to have extra activity in brain regions related to memory , even when their brains are at rest .
The gene APOE codes for a protein thought to help create , maintain and repair neuronal connections .
One variant , epsilon 4 , is considered the biggest risk factor for getting Alzheimer ’s , increasing your risk by up to 4 times if you have one copy and up to 12 if you have two .
It is not known exactly how epsilon 4 ups the risk , but in people who carry it and have developed Alzheimer ’s , the hippocampus , which is involved in memory functions , is usually smaller .
To figure out if epsilon 4 influences brain function earlier on in life , Clare Mackay of the University of Oxford and colleagues at Imperial College London scanned the brains of 18 healthy adults with epsilon 4 and 18 controls who did not have the variant .
In the scanner , the volunteers spent time performing memory tests and also doing nothing .
Brain differences
During the memory task , the epsilon 4 carriers had more activity in the hippocampus compared with controls , even though there was no difference in their performance on the tests , suggesting that their hippocampuses expend more energy to achieve the same result .
Advertisement
For the scans when the volunteers did nothing , the researchers focused on the default mode network , a series of connected sites throughout the brain that are active even when the volunteer is resting .
Parts of the DMN found in the hippocampus were more active in the at - risk adults than in controls .
“ The fact that we got differences in the hippocampus is very exciting , ” says Mackay .
One way to interpret this is that epsilon 4 causes brain regions responsible for memory to get overworked early in life , prompting them to “ burn out ” with age and leading to Alzheimer ’s .
However , it ’s impossible to tell whether the extra activity contributes to Alzheimer ’s symptoms later on or is just a sign of inefficient brain circuitry in the hippocampus .
‘ Tour de force ’
Neurologist Michael Griecius of Stanford University , who studies the DMN in people with Alzheimer ’s , agrees but says the work is a “ real tour de force ” because it shows differences so early on .
“ These subjects are several decades away from the point at which we would expect to pick up on the subtlest signs of cognitive difficulty , ” he says .
Mackay says the next step is to look for early differences in brain function between those who have the gene variant and go on to suffer from Alzheimer ’s , and those who have it and do n’t .
Such differences might be used to target interventions at certain people before the disease develops .

As Stephen noted last night , Ron Paul has introduced a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to open it ’s books to Congress .
According to Thomas , that bill now has 79 co-sponsors .
I agree with Stephen that this is an issue that all libertarians , all Americans indeed , need to pay more attention to and , in that spirit , here ’s a very interesting clip of House Banking Chairman Barney Frank answering a question about Paul ’s bill :
At the very least , Frank ’s comments would seem to indicate that the bill will get a fair hearing by the committee , which is more than can be said about previous legislative efforts to crack open the doors of the Fed .
There are no hearing dates set right now , but that does n’t mean that it is n’t time to contact your Representative and tell them they need to get on board , especially if they ’re on the Banking Committee .
First they won control of Pakistan 's Swat Valley .
Then they easily took over Buner District next door .
Now the Taliban appear to have set their sights on two more neighboring areas as they continue to drive deeper into Pakistan .
Some analysts say that , for the time being , the Taliban are likely restricted to rural areas in the northwest – it's unlikely , for example , that they could take over the nearest major city , Peshawar , where the provincial government of the North West Frontier Province is based .
Still , the militants appear intent on expanding their influence .
And in the NWFP over the past several weeks they have faced little resistance from either the populace or government security forces .
" If they stay in Buner longer they will continue their drive , " says analyst Rifaat Hussain , of the Quaid - i- Azam University in Islamabad .
" The fact they were able to take over so easily will encourage Taliban from other districts to do the same . "
The Taliban progress
In Buner , where the Taliban consolidated their control this week , militants have begun patrolling bazaars , villages , and towns , according to a leading English - language daily newspaper , Dawn .
For the past six days , they are reported to have been looting government and NGO offices for supplies and four - wheel - drive vehicles .
Leading politicians , bureaucrats , prominent businessmen , and judges have fled the area , says local reporter Abdur Rehman Abid .
" The people of Buner feel they have been abandoned to God 's will . "
Taliban members have also set up checkpoints along Buner 's borders with the districts of Mardan and Swabi and are making forays into those areas , Mr. Abid continues .
Mardan lies southwest of Buner , toward Peshawar , and is home to NWFP Chief Minister Amir Haider Khan Hoti .
Swabi borders Punjab Province , Pakistan 's populous heartland .
The fall of Buner comes at a sensitive time for the government , which is trying to maintain a controversial peace deal with the Swat Taliban that was negotiated by hard - line cleric Sufi Mohammad .
The government agreed to impose Nizam - e - Adl regulations , a form of Islamic law , or sharia , in the area if the Taliban stopped fighting their troops .
But since President Asif Ali Zardari and the National Assembly officially approved the deal last week , militants in Swat have declared that no other Pakistani courts have jurisdiction over the area and have refused to put down their guns .
On Sunday , Mohammad sparked further controversy nationwide when he declared at a rally in Mingora , the capital of Swat , that there is " no room for democracy " in Islam – raising concern that the Taliban aim to impose their interpretation of sharia well beyond the northwest .
" They are now threatening to get out of Swat and take other areas into their custody .
So , we 've got to avoid that situation , " former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who has in the past gained popularity for his anti-American stances , told USA Today Tuesday .
Critics of the Swat agreement have called it " appeasement . "
" If [ the Taliban ] manage to consolidate their influence here [ in Buner ] they will play the politics of falling dominoes , " says Mr. Hussain , the analyst .
" Sufi Mohammad made it clear in his speech – they are targeting the whole of Pakistan . "
And if the government continues to make deals with the Taliban , Hussain continues , they may be tempted " to go for the jugular " and lay siege to the city of Peshawar .
' We will not lose hope '
But provincial legislators of the Awami National Party , which governs the NWFP , appear more keen on keeping the peace going .
" We will not lose hope .
The peace in Ireland took 30 years ; we 're asking for 30 weeks , " says Haji Adeel , senior vice president of the ANP .
He says that the government has sent for eight platoons of Frontier Constabulary , a paramilitary force , to patrol Buner , but adds that the basic problem is the Taliban expect too much , too soon .
" They [ the Taliban ] do n't understand we need time and money to meet their demands to create and staff sharia courts .
Sufi Mohammad does n't understand the way bureaucracy works . "
He adds : " So far , the Taliban have n't kept to their side of the bargain .
We were expecting everyone to lay down arms and live like decent and ordinary citizens , to act according to the rules . "

If you have a lot of yard space , you can build yourself a full - sized compost bin .
Vermicomposting , compost bins where worms do the work breaking down the organic matter , are great for folks with a less space , but you homeowners can benefit from a worm bin , too !
Worm castings are super - nutritious , and worm bins yeild good compost relatively quickly .
The bins are easy to make yourself , and you can even divert some waste from the landfill while you ’re at it !
Bonus points if you rescue discarded plastic tubs , rather than buying new ones .
Check out this awesome step - by - step video on getting your worm bin together :

You might check Craigslist or Freecycle for some bins that you can use .
If even the worm bins would take up too much space in your pad , you might look into a bokashi compost bin instead .
Bokashi uses microorganisms to break down food waste .
The mixture can be a bit pricey , but it ’s another situation where you can use your DIY skills to save some cash .
Check out this video on making your own bulk bokashi !
Composting is a great way to help fight global warming .
When food scraps go to the landfill they break down and let off methane , a powerful greenhouse gas .
Are you planning to get your spring garden going ?
What sorts of things are you planting ?
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) -
The chief executives of Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Yahoo Inc YHOO.
O met last week to discuss potential partnerships between the companies '
Internet search and advertising operations , the technology blog All Things Digital reported on Friday .
Wide - ranging talks have taken place between executives at the companies , the blog reported , including discussion of the potential for Microsoft to handle Yahoo ’s search advertising business , and for Yahoo to combine and run the two companies ’ display advertising business .
Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment on the report .
Expectation that the two technology giants would enter negotiations over Yahoo ’s search business has been rising since Yahoo ’s new CEO , Carol Bartz , took the reins in January .
She succeeded Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang , who beat back Microsoft ’s effort to buy all of Yahoo last year for $ 47.5 billion , which soured relationships between the two companies .
Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo chiefly to combat Google Inc's GOOG.
O dominance in the Internet search arena , and CEO Steve Ballmer has made it clear he would still like to do some sort of deal in that area .
“ Unless I ’m fooling myself , over time I would expect there ’s a good opportunity for a deal , ” Ballmer told a media conference in New York last month .
It was an incident that began innocently enough , but nearly ruined the life and three - decade career of a veteran high school teacher and administrator .
Rumors had been flying at Freedom High School in South Riding , Virginia that students were distributing nude pictures of each other on their cell phones .
It 's a phenomenon , known as " sexting , " that 's become increasingly worrisome to educators across the country , and Ting - Yi Oei , a 60 - year - old assistant principal at the school , was tasked with checking it out .

The investigation was inconclusive , but led to a stunning aftermath : Oei himself was charged with possession of child pornography and related crimes – charges that threatened to brand him a sex offender and land him in prison for up to seven years .
Transferred from his school and isolated from colleagues , Oei spent $ 150,000 and a year of his life defending himself in a Kafkaesque legal nightmare triggered by a determined county prosecutor and nurtured by a growing hysteria over technology - enabled child porn at America 's schools .
" The heaviest burden is the [ label ] of ' child pornographer ' , " Oei says .
" It just hangs so heavy around me .
How you ever recover from that I do n't know . "
On Tuesday , Oei's legal nightmare ended when a Virginia judge threw out the case before it got to trial .
But as the educator begins piecing his life back together , similar tragedies are unfolding across the country .
Reacting to the phenomenon of underage " sexting , " prosecutors in at least a dozen states have resorted to arresting or charging kids for possession of child pornography .
In a recent case in Pennsylvania , six teens aged 14 to 17 were charged with creating , distributing and possessing child porn .
And this week a judge in a separate case in Pennsylvania temporarily barred a prosecutor from charging three teens for taking photos of themselves in their bras and a towel .
Even in this environment of prosecutorial excess , Oei's case stands out as likely the first to entangle an adult who came in possession of an image that even police admit was n't pornographic , and who did so simply in the course of doing his job .
" These charges are so toxic and incendiary , " says Diane Curling , a former teacher and Oei 's wife of 35 years .
" Children need to be made aware of the dangers of sexting , but to intimidate public education officials and try to make it a felony to even touch something like this is terrifying .
. . .
If we are not careful , we will find ourselves with a new McCarthy era . "
Oei 's problems began in March of last year , when his investigation of sexting rumors at Freedom High led him to a 16 - year - old boy .
Oei and the school 's safety and security specialist met with the student to ask if he knew anything about the photos .
" He says , ' Oh yeah , I 've got one on my cell phone , ' " Oei recalls .
The image depicted only the torso of a girl – later determined to be a 17 - year old student – wearing only underpants , her arms mostly covering her breasts .
The boy claimed he did n't know who sent him the photo or who the girl was .
Oei says he showed the image to his boss , Principal Christine Forester , who told him to preserve a copy on his office computer for the investigation .
A computer neophyte , Oei did n't know how to transfer the image from the boy 's cell phone , so the teen sent the picture to Oei 's phone , and told him how to forward it to his work e-mail address .
When the process was complete , Oei instructed the student to delete the image from his phone .
Oei and the school security specialist interviewed more students , but were unable to find additional pictures or identify the girl in the photo .
Oei concluded she probably was n't a student at the school .
Relieved , he says he reported his findings to the principal , thinking the matter was done .
He could n't have been more wrong .
Two weeks later , the boy caught with the photo was in trouble again – he'd pulled down the pants of a girl in class .
The school suspended the student for 10 days .
But when the boy 's mother learned from Oei about the earlier photo incident , she was outraged that Oei had n't reported the picture to her .
She called his house at 7:00 a.m. , screaming at him that the suspension had to be revoked .
When Oei refused , the woman went to the police about the photo .
Sheriff 's investigators came to the school , ostensibly to investigate the sexting issue .
They helped the technologically - challenged Oei recover the photo from his cell phone and later determined the girl in the photo was a student at the school .
A month later , the first charges were filed against Oei : failure to report suspicion of child abuse , a misdemeanor .
The charge alleged that Oei had a legal duty to report the girl 's photo to her parents , and to state agencies or law enforcement .
" First of all , nobody thought this was reportable , " Oei says .
" Who would have thought this was suspected child abuse ? "
Oei also had n't known the girl 's identity and therefore was n't able to notify her parents .
The prosecution looked like an error right out of the gate .
The photo did n't show sexual activity or genitalia , and even the sheriff 's office conceded it was " inappropriate " but not " criminal " – making it unclear what the " child abuse " was supposed to be .
In any event , as a matter of law , Oei was only required to report suspected abuse to his principal , which he 'd done .
It was then Forester 's job to report it to authorities if needed .
Oei said Forester did n't step in to defend him to authorities .
( Forester did n't return phone calls for this story )
But rather than drop the misapplied charge , Loudoun County prosecutor James Plowman upped the ante .
Plowman had been swept into office as Loudoun 's Commonwealth 's Attorney in 2004 , following a lively campaign in which he accused the incumbent prosecutor of turning Loudoun into " one of the softest counties in Virginia on crime . "
In 2007 , his tough - as - nails image won him re-election with 80 percent of the vote .

The prosecutor gave Oei an ultimatum : resign , or see his misdemeanor charge bumped up to a felony .
" We just feel very strongly that this is not someone who should be in the Loudoun County school system , " Plowman 's assistant explained to reporters .
Oei refused , and on August 11 , a grand jury indicted him for possession of child porn , a crime that carries a possible sentence of five years .
The misdemeanor charge was dropped .
And so it was that Oei , a Quaker of Chinese and Dutch descent , a former Fullbright exchange teacher , Peace Corps volunteer and 30 - year veteran educator , was arrested nine days later at school .
Oei 's world changed overnight .
He was released on his own recognizance , and the district reassigned him to a job at the county testing center , away from students .
A parent that Oei encountered one day at a restaurant avoided eye contact with him , and his colleagues at the school were advised not to contact him .
The day after his arrest , Oei was on a treadmill at the gym when his face suddenly appeared on two large TV screens broadcasting the news .
" There I am , big as life , " he recalls ruefully .
An exerciser on the treadmill next to him glanced his way .
He lost 15 pounds , and could n't sleep .
Oei resigned from his position as president of the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans of Virginia so the organization would n't be tainted by his legal troubles , and took out a second mortgage on his house to cover legal costs .
His wife , already struggling with a serious physical health issue , became paranoid .
" We had to tell all our friends when they sent us e-mail that police could seize computers at any time so anything they wrote us could be accessed , " Curling says .
" Any phone call they made to us could be recorded . "
Warned that their house could be searched , Curling went through the family photos to see if there were any baby pictures of their now - grown children in a state of undress .
" Heaven forbid that a parent might think it was cute for a baby to play in a bubble bath and there might be an inappropriate part showing , " she says .
" Luckily all of our rubber - ducky baby photos had the children covered in bath bubbles or something . "
After planting her garden with flowers , she saw people looking up at the house and pointing .
" I was wondering if they were neighbors saying , ' Oh , that 's where the pervert lives , ' or complimenting me on my choice of Chrysanthemum colors , " she says .
Four months later , Plowman charged Oei with two more misdemeanor counts for contributing to the delinquency of a minor , claiming Oei broke the law when he had the 16 - year - old boy send the photo to his cell phone and advise him on how to then forward it to his desktop computer .
Each count added another year to his possible prison term .
" The December charges really felt like piling on , " Oei says .
When things looked darkest , the family found an unexpected wellspring of support .
The Loudoun Education Association and Virginia Education Association came to Oei's aid with loans and grants that covered about 30 percent of his legal costs .
Then dozens of current and long - lost friends from the family 's Quaker community and elsewhere – including former students and friends they 'd been out of touch with for decades – started appearing to offer support .
Oei went to court for a pre-trial hearing , and found 38 supporters crammed into the gallery pews .
Then last month , Oei 's defense attorney , Steven Stone , filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the photo did n't constitute child pornography .
In a ruling on Tuesday , Loudoun Circuit Court Judge Thomas Horne agreed .
Citing a long history of state appeals court decisions , Horne noted that nudity alone is not enough to qualify an image as child pornography .
The image must be " sexually explicit " and " lewd . "
" As a matter of law , the photograph does not meet the requirements established by our appellate courts and the felony charge will be dismissed , " the judge wrote .
" [ T ] he two misdemeanor counts will be dismissed as well . "
Despite the ruling , Plowman , the prosecutor , stands by his initial assessment of the photo .
" The issue of whether it meets the definition under the statute ... goes to whether it is lewd , " he says .
" This one I felt was [ lewd ] because of the focus of the picture , which was the private areas ... and the provocative pose she was in .
The judge felt it did n't meet the precedent case law for child pornography , but it was apparently provocative enough of a photograph that he saw fit that it should be sealed . "
Plowman insists he never intended to seek prison time for Oei .
He would have been satisfied with a fine , probation and Oei's resignation .
The case would never have gone this far , he says , if Oei had resigned when asked .
" I thought that was a just and appropriate sanction for his behavior , " he says .
" But he was unwilling to be responsible for any kind of accountability for what he did . "
Now Oei is left with the aftermath , including deep debt and a tarnished reputation .
Asked about the possibility of suing the prosecutor 's office to recover the cost of his defense , Oei 's lawyer says it would be difficult .
" Prosecutors in Virginia have a pretty solid grant of immunity , so he 's going to be up against a lot if we get to that point , " Stone says .
Oei says he 's grateful that the school district never took away his pay throughout the ordeal , but he is n't sure he wants to go back to the school after being abandoned by its principal .
Yet he knows that finding another job would n't be easy .
" If someone were to Google me , why would you want to touch someone who had [ this trouble ] , even if I had the charge dismissed ? " he says .
" I do n't think you 'd necessarily want that baggage . "
[ A previous version of this story had authorities asserting that Oei should have notified the 16 - year - old boy 's parents about the photo the boy had on his phone .
The piece has been corrected to indicate that authorities asserted that he should have notified the parents of the girl in the photo , whom Oei was unable to identify . ]

' The notion that inflation will pick up in the near - term is completely out of the picture , ' said one analyst
The US economy has begun to deflate for the first time in more than half a century as a slump in demand pushes energy and food costs lower .
The consumer price index fell at an annual rate of 0.4 % in March , the first decline since August 1955 , figures from the US labour department showed today .
It was bigger than the 0.1 % drop expected by economists .
Compared with the previous month , consumer prices dipped by 0.1 % .
The decline was mainly caused by lower energy costs , which offset a surge in tobacco prices , the biggest since 1998 .
If energy and food costs are excluded , the annual inflation rate stands at 1.8 % .
Energy costs fell by 3 % on the month and gasoline prices were down 4 % .
Food and housing costs both edged down by 0.1 % .
" It reinforces the deflationary fears that the Fed has been voicing , " said George Davis , currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
A 2.4 % fall in hotel room rates and a 0.2 % decline in clothing prices reflected the weakness of consumer demand .
But David Buik at BGC Partners pointed out that with " oil prices now stable at close to $ 50 a barrel , there is no near - term prospect of a further substantial decline in energy prices " .
He does not think that the latest figures signal the beginnings of widespread deflation this year .
Certainly , inflation is no longer an issue .
" The notion that inflation will pick up in the near - term is completely out of the picture , " said Peter Kenny at Knight Equity Markets in New Jersey .
" Now we 're looking at numbers that speak to recession without the prospect of inflation . "
The figures came as the head of Wal - Mart said that he still saw a " lot of stress " in the economy and did not anticipate a quick end to the recession .
" It 's not a ' V ' recession , where we 're just going to bounce out and come back , " Mike Duke said on NBC's Today Show .
His comments contrasted with those of Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke , the head of the US central bank , who made a concerted effort yesterday to talk up the prospects for the American economy despite fresh evidence of the squeeze on consumer spending .
US retail sales unexpectedly fell last month .
" With the unemployment rate and the output gap both headed for 10 % and the financial system still crippled , the risk of a pernicious debt - deflation emerging [ where the collateral on loans decreases damagingly in value ] is still much bigger than the risk that the Fed 's quantitative easing actions will lead to runaway inflation , " said Paul Ashworth , senior US economist at Capital Economics .
Britain is also on the brink of deflation .
Inflation as measured by the retail price index , which is used as a basis for wage negotiations , was zero last month but failed to turn negative as the City had predicted .
The entertainment industry is furious about its treatment at the hands of pirates .
Last year , even the creator of iPhone cracking - app Crackulous got pretty annoyed when his work leaked .
But it 's not just content creators that get angry at pirates - and this is where it starts to get a little confusing .
The following story revolves around a small private BitTorrent tracker , one that specializes in various sub -genres of urban music .
There is no work of mainstream artists at all , so there are n’t really any copyright worries , particularly since many artists and people from labels are active members of the site .
The site even has its own album in the making .
The tracker makes its own ‘ scene ’ - type releases too , often in advance of true scene groups and often at a better quality .
Some members who have these to share choose to put them up as ‘ Site - Only ’ , and issue an order not to leak outside of the tracker .
But to the dismay of some members of the site these exclusive releases leak too .
Absolutely everything .
Damn pirates .
Within minutes of upload , these releases spread to many blog - type sites , in particular Russian ones .
Not only was someone inconsiderately leaking an already - leaked release , but they also had the nerve to remove the tracker ’s release ‘ tags ’ from its description , passing the work off as their own .
There was a leaker in town – maybe more than one – who knows , but the “ Site - Onlys ” were tunneling out and the recriminations had begun .
A handful of upset releasers threatened to stop sharing their exclusive stuff , while becoming quite vocal about how much time , effort and in some case money they put into their position .
Then , they say – despite all the pleas – people go ahead and leak the releases – and they do n’t even pause to say “ thanks ” .
Bastards .
It would n’t be difficult to imagine a similar situation in the ‘ real Scene ’ , where angry release groups simultaneously cursed the evil individual who constantly leaked their releases to the tracker .
“ If only they could find him and ban him , ” they would muse , it would cut off the music supply and rid the tracker of most of its releases .
One could imagine a similar scene at a recording label as they ponder the route of their latest leak to Internet .
Back at the tracker the community began to panic .
They were thinking of all the stuff they were going to miss out on when the releasers kept their candy to themselves .
They were absolutely clear , the admin had to do something .
One member said :
Someone is leaking our torrents , we lose our exclusives ?
Find him in the logs !
BURN HIM !
An admin on the site involved told Torrent Freak that this happens often .
“ We could track the leaker but then what , ban him ?
He ’s just sharing it with his own site but they [ the site ’s releasers ] want action . ”
Lots of ‘ solutions ’ were put forward .
One group wanted a ‘ private - sharing area ’ from where ( apparently ) nothing could leak , since access to it would be limited and the section would be “ invite only ” .
The whole site is a very limited membership already and is also “ invite - only ” and thrives on the work of “ leakers ” .
Hmmm , interesting .
Some members puzzled over why people would want to “ ruin the site ” by leaking stuff outside and derided the Russian sites as pure evil , their uploaders thieves and demanded them traced and kicked from the site .
Others suggested a complicated tiered - membership system as a kind of proving ground for ultimate access to the “ Site - Only ” material .
Others wanted a tracker - wide Russian IP ban , others wanted a paid - subscription area .
Some opted that access to the “ Site - Only ” stuff should be based an algorithm calculated from ratio , forum posts , time on the site and other sundry stats .
Ultimately a handful of releasers wanted a guarantee from the admin that nothing would leak , something impossible to give .
While the very nature of things like BitTorrent means that people have to share files , it is interesting to see how some file - sharers can be as protective of the content they handle , as the people who created it .
Their reasons are very different , but with all the talk of anger at leaks , of locking out an entire country ’s citizens , proposals of denying access to all but those who could afford it and mounting a worldwide witch - hunt for leakers , there are some intriguing parallels .
“ We caught the leaker , ” the admin told us .
“ He ’s one of our best releasers … ”
Better put the burning on hold .
President Barack Obama did not utter any of the statements reproduced above ; the quoted example is a bit of fictional dialogue excerpted from a satirical piece by conservative humorist John Semmens which was published on his site on 21 March 2009 .
The basis of Mr. Semmens ’ satire was that , in conjunction with meeting with several veterans groups in March 2009 , the Obama administration floated a proposal to save the federal government an estimated $ 540 million per year by billing veterans ’ private insurance companies for the treatment of their combat injuries and other service - related health problems .
( Currently only non-service - related medical treatments are so billed . )
The proposal would not have , as was often misreported , forced veterans to pay for the treatment of their injuries out of their own pockets or required them to buy private insurance ; but it did raise the prospect that injured or ill veterans might find it harder or more expensive to purchase health coverage , or to obtain employment in the private sector if employer - funded private insurance plans had to cover the additional costs of treating injuries and other service - related health problems .
The plan was heavily criticized by veterans almost from the moment it was presented to them , as the Washington Post reported in an account of a meeting between President Obama and veterans ’ groups :
[ T ]he leaders of veterans service organizations warned the president that their goodwill would vanish if he pursued a budget proposal to bill veterans ’ private insurance companies for treatment of amputations , post - traumatic stress disorder and other combat - related injuries .
One Vietnam veteran summoned his deep voice to address Obama , calling the change “ a dumb move . ”
An Iraq veteran said the move would be “ a deal - breaker ” because it would represent an abrogation of the government ’s responsibility to care for the wounded and could jeopardize veterans ’ insurance benefits .
Within 48 hours , the White House announced that the proposal had been dropped , but the President still came in for his fair share of criticism from those who maintained that he failed to anticipate how his proposal would be received and should have known better than to even raise the subject :
However , many said that they were surprised by the ham - handedness of the private insurance effort because it seemed that no one in the White House or the [ Veterans Administration ] took into consideration how veterans would react — or Congress , where several members called the plan “ dead on arrival . ”
“ The president needs to drop this , ” [ Paul ] Rieckhoff [ executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America ] said of Obama .
“ The longer we wait , the more it hurts his relations with the [ veterans service organizations ] and with vets .
This is a no-brainer .
We were all shocked .
We do n’t understand why he ’s picking this fight . ”
A Newsday editorial summed up many Americans ’ feelings about the matter in opining that :

Living in Germany , a foreigner quickly learns to appreciate the precise punctuality of trains and trams , but also to have a healthy fear of that same punctuality in dinner guests who appear when they were invited , instead of 20 minutes later .
A group of Germans lined up on an empty street corner , even in the middle of the night , waiting for a light to change before crossing , is one of the favorite first impressions taken away by visiting Americans , who are usually jaywalking past as they observe it .
For self - reliant Americans , the German devotion to all manner of precise rules and regulations is impressive and stifling in equal measures .
For American policy makers , it appears to have bred no small amount of exasperation recently .
During the often heated trans -Atlantic debate over the financial crisis , and how to respond to the worsening recession that has grown out of it , I often have felt as though the American side sometimes fails to take into account that it is talking to Germans .
Indeed , if there was going to be a disagreement between the United States and Germany over stimulus and regulation , one could guess just by looking at the words , stripped of their economic context , who has been on which side of the divide .
President Obama ’s approach to the financial crisis has been typically American  bold , improvisatory and on the fly .
The Germans have been studied and measured , evincing a far greater trust than the Americans in their social - security system to patch the cracks in the foundation of their economy .
Of course that is due in part to the famed German aversion to excessive deficit spending , stemming from gut - level fear of a repeat of the hyperinflation of the 1920s .
But there is also the German adherence to rules , love of a good plan and cautious , thoughtful approach when it slowly becomes apparent that a return trip to the drawing board may be necessary .
Can we really blame them ?
They tried improvising once , tearing up the rule book in the first half of the last century , letting a little charismatic speaker with an even littler mustache tell them how to get out of a tough economic pinch .
He , too , posed as a man of order , but everyone , and especially the Germans , agrees that led only to chaos and destruction .
But today ’s Germans also love keeping to the slowly forged consensus because , as the last 60 - odd years have demonstrated , it really does run pretty well for them .
Despite reasonable working hours and long vacations , this country of 82 million people is the largest exporter of goods in the world , beating even China .
But the kind of society built to excel at tinkering with precision - tuned industrial machines may not be so good at retooling policies on the fly .
German stubbornness in resisting a shift of responses to the current economic crisis has led more than a few Keynesians to pull out more than a little of their hair .
It might be for the best if those fans of vigorous impromptu spending came along to the pool with me  not to relax , but to learn how to coax Germans to cross a red line , rather than expect them to do what is hardest for them , which would be to just jump over it with both feet .
Nokia might be best known as a global mobile phone giant , but it's also making waves in the open source software business , too .
The company 's Qt Software division this week released the latest edition of its open source application framework , Qt version 4.5 , with improvements that will expand cross-platform capabilities and increase performance .
Blue energy , or reverse electrodialysis , generates electricity through the convergence of fresh and salt water using artificial semi-permeable membranes .
The technology is currently in use in the Netherlands , but the possibilities for its application exist wherever saltwater and freshwater mix .
It ’s not a new discovery , but until now , the cost of the membranes has been prohibitive for most applications .

Also called osmotic power or pressure retarded osmosis , blue energy capitalizes on the chemical differences between saltwater and freshwater .
A concentrated salt solution and fresh water are brought into contact through an alternating series of anion exchange membranes ( AEM ) and cation exchange membranes ( CEM ) .
The chemical potential difference generates a voltage over each membrane and the overall potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences .
Here ’s a short animation of the process :
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2BtdtvLrjk
Sound like Greek to you ?
I have to admit that I do n’t fully understand the scientific principle behind the technology , but because this is a sustainable , non-polluting energy source , applicable wherever a large estuary is located , I can really get behind it .
There are many places around the globe where this could be deployed , bringing safe , renewable energy to the masses through a natural energy source .
One estimate is that blue energy could supply up to 7 % of the world ’s energy needs .
That ’s significant .
Ulfberht Viking Swords of Inferior Quality Detected
According to a report in The Guardian , published in December 2008 , Viking swords in some of the most famous weapons collections are counterfeit .
However , the age of the fakes is the same as the one of the genuine swords , about a thousand years .
The fact is that the best swords that were used by the Vikings bear the maker ’s name , Ulfberht , in raised letters at the hilt end .
Such swords were made from ingots of crucible steel brought by the Norsemen from far away .
The tests show that high quality steel of the Ulfberht swords is from the mines on the territory of modern Afghanistan and Iran .
However , in the 11th century the trade route was blocked by Russians and the supply of steel with high carbon content ended .
The demand was huge and soon low quality fakes flooded the Scandinavian market .
In outward appearance they were identical to genuine Ulfberhts and their blades were very sharp .
Nevertheless , due to the fact that the carbon content of the steel from which they were forged had only a third of the same in genuine high quality swords , they could fatally disserve Vikings who bought them .
The locally worked iron of such inferior swords was hardened by quenching , which made the blade sharp , but also brittle because of the low carbon steel that was used .
The whole point became obvious when a private collector brought a Viking sword to the London museum .
Dr. Allan Williams , a consultant to the Wallace collection of that museum , found out that the collector ’s sword was an ancient fake , whereas the Wallace ’s was the real McCoy .
In collaboration with Tony Fry , a senior researcher at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington , south - west London , Dr. Williams was able to prove that other famous collections have a few counterfeit Ulfberhts .

April 2 , 2009 Honda has taken some very significant steps into what could be an absolute revolution in human - computer interface .
Honda Research Institute , Japan , has demonstrated a Brain - Machine Interface ( BMI ) that enables a user to control an ASIMO robot using nothing more than thought .
Wearing a headset containing both electroencephalography ( EEG ) and near - infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) sensors , the user simply imagines moving either his right hand , left hand , tongue or feet - and ASIMO makes a corresponding movement .
The system is still huge and slow , and the commands are quite crude and imprecise - but Honda 's baby steps represent a huge leap in technology .
The next step is to refine the system to work with fine motor controls , add the ability to decode non -motor brain signals and speed it all up .
Then , the doors will be open for a whole range of machines that can sense your thoughts , intentions and feelings , and act directly upon them .
BMI has staggering potential - this is just the beginning .
The keyboard , mouse and gamepad are n't going anywhere any time soon - but Honda 's BMI brain - reading technology , still in its infancy , could open up some very exciting options in the future .
We 've already seen toys like the Force Trainer hitting the market that can sense relaxation patterns in the brain and reward them - now Honda is showing how the idea can be extended to incorporate more precise controls .
Honda 's original experiments in 2006 , using functional MRI scanning of the brain , had one huge problem to overcome - the huge size and dangerous magnetic fields used in MRI scanning severely limited the locations and applications in which the technology could be used .
The more recent BMI unit uses a combination of EEG ( which measures changes in electrical potential on the scalp ) and NIRS ( which measures cerebral blood flow ) to develop a picture of the brain 's activity in real time .
The user puts the headset on , and imagines moving either their left hand , right hand , tongue or feet - without actually moving that body part .
The user 's EEG and NIRS readings are processed and statistically analyzed by a computer , with tests showing impressive accuracy - the signals were correctly interpreted more than 90 % of the time .
Finally , in a bit of showmanship , Honda 's famous ASIMO robot goes on to move the body part the user was imagining .
Honda are currently viewing the BMI technology as an interface into its robotics and articificial intelligence products - mind - controlled household assistant robots and the like .
But once this non-invasive , safe technology becomes more refined and precise , there 's no reason why it should n't be applied much more widely - and then , imagination is the only limit ... mind - controlled movies and video games that can sense when you 're scared , or offended , or bored , and adjust their content levels to keep you in the right zone .
Climate control systems that can sense when you think it 's too hot , and turn on the aircon or have a drink brought to you .
And of course , what we 're all really waiting for : magnificent sex robots that can read and recreate your every fantasy , or somehow let you make mind - controlled whoopie with yourself .
Actually , that one could cause some problems ; no one would get any work done at the RIAA .
See the video below to watch the current state of Honda 's Brain - Machine Interface technology , as demonstrated by the ever - friendly ASIMO .

Japan 's population had its sharpest decline ever last year as deaths outnumbered births , posing an escalating economic threat to growth prospects amid a global recession .
With low birthrates and long lifespans , Japan 's shrinking population is ageing more quickly than any other economic power .
Health ministry records estimated the population fell by 51,000 in 2008 .
The number of deaths hit a record of 1.14 million ... the highest since the government began compiling the data in 1947 , and the number of births totalled 1.09 million .
Japan 's births outnumbered deaths until 2005 , when the trend was reversed .
About one - fifth of Japan 's 126 million people are now aged 65 or over .
Japanese increasingly marry at a later age , and working women wait to have children .
The survey showed the number of births last year increased by just 0.02 % from a year earlier .
The ministry forecast that Japan 's fertility rate - the average number of children born to a woman aged between 15 and 49 - would rise slightly to 1.36 in 2008 from 1.34 in 2007 .
Exact figures for 2008 were unavailable .
The country 's fertility rate is far lower than that of the US , 2.10 , and France , 1.98 .
In recent years , the government has tried to encourage women to have more babies .
But it is rare for fathers to take paternity in Japan , where traditional values tend to keep mothers at home .

Advertisement A new video released by demonstrators shows a police officer beating a man in the head with a riot shield at the London G20 protest earlier this month .
The man is barged with a shield on the side of his head in the footage , shown on the Sunday Times website .
Scotland Yard said it would be assessed and referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission if necessary .
The IPCC earlier said it was looking into a third claim of police abuse at the protest .
It follows probes into the death of one man and the assault on a woman .
Punched with shield Newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson died after being pushed over by police on 1 April and a female protester says she was hit by police in the face a day later .
The IPCC is dealing with three claims of heavy - handed policing The video of the latest incident to emerge was released by Climate Camp protesters .
In it , 24 - year - old IT worker Alex Cinnane is shown being forcibly hit in the left temple with a round shield by a policeman wearing a balaclava and a visor .
The footage , which was edited before it was released , does not show Mr Cinnane making any threatening behaviour towards the police officer .
" I had turned around to go to someone who was screaming because they were being crushed when he reached out and hit me on my forehead with his shield , " Mr Cinnane told The Sunday Times .
More footage on the nine - minute long video shows an unidentified officer punching a man as a line of police push protesters back .
The third incident being probed by the IPCC is believed to follow a complaint that an officer used excessive force in Cornhill on 1 April .
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said it was taking steps to identify the officer involved in the incident which prompted the third referral .
And Scotland Yard also said it was examining video footage from the protests which was released on Saturday by the Climate Camp group .
A spokesman said : " This material has been passed to the Met 's investigation team to make an assessment .
" The investigation team is currently assessing the material .
If necessary it will be referred to the IPCC . "
Charge ' likely '
A policeman has already been interviewed under caution on suspicion of manslaughter after new tests overturned the initial post - mortem into the cause of Mr Tomlinson 's death .
Mr Tomlinson , 47 , was filmed being struck and pushed over by a police officer .
A fresh post - mortem examination found he died of abdominal bleeding , not a heart attack , as first thought .
Lawyers for the family said the new post - mortem raised the likelihood of a manslaughter charge .

Film footage also showed an officer hitting Nicola Fisher , 35 , from Brighton , across the face with his hand and on her leg with a baton on 2 April .
" He just said ' get back ' , pushed me and then hit me across the face , " she said .
Ms Fisher admits pushing the officer .
The sergeant accused of striking Ms Fisher works for the Territorial Support Group and has been suspended from duty pending the IPCC inquiry .
Ms Fisher , who is being represented by PR agent Max Clifford , was making her way to a vigil for Mr Tomlinson when the incident occurred .

Could the Gulf Stream be used as a renewable energy source to supply much - needed electricity to Florida 's heavily populated southern region ?
That 's what a team of researchers from Florida Atlantic University ( F.A.U. ) in Boca Raton are hoping to find out from four acoustic doppler current profilers ( ADCP ) that they dropped into the Atlantic Ocean between five miles ( eight kilometers ) and 22 miles ( 35 kilometers ) from the sands of Dania Beach .
The ADCPs , which were placed in the water in February at depths between 725 feet ( 220 meters ) and 2,115 feet ( 645 meters ) , use high - frequency , low - power sonar to measure the Gulf Stream 's water velocity at different locations , according to the school 's Center for Ocean Energy Technology ( COET ) .
View a slide show of images of the ADCPs as well as illustrations of COET 's future plans
COET researchers ( see video of them at work ) want to determine whether it is feasible to use underwater tidal turbines — like those now being tested in New York City 's East River and elsewhere — to generate renewable energy from the powerful Gulf Stream without harming the underwater ecosystem .
The scientists plan to gather as much information as possible about the North Atlantic 's massive stream over the next eight months , before putting their prototype 20 - kilowatt tidal turbine in the water .
Their goal , says Howard Hanson , COET 's scientific director : to pin down where the current is strongest .
The deployment of the ADCPs is the first step in COET 's plans to create a National Open - ocean Energy Laboratory ( NOEL ) with a permanent infrastructure off the south Florida shore where makers of tidal turbines and other marine - based renewable energy technology would be able to test their devices .
NOEL is expected to provide access to federal and state agencies , technology developers , and universities for testing and evaluation of ocean energy systems , from small subscale outfits to full - scale commercial complexes .
" Most companies are n't going to want to put the infrastructure in place to do it themselves , " Hanson says .
" Our mission is to become a national laboratory for companies to do this . "

IN THE 1850s , the titans of the American billiards industry faced a vexing problem .
A mere eight balls could be carved from the tusks of a large Asian elephant , but the species , once populous , had been hunted into near extinction — a casualty of the demand for ivory for everything from cue balls to corsets .
Fearing the parlor game ’s demise , manufacturer Michael Phelan offered a $ 10,000 reward to anyone who could create an artificial material that mimicked ivory ’s unusual mix of pliability and durability .
“ If any inventive genius would discover a substitute for ivory , possessing those qualities which make it valuable to the billiard player , he would make a handsome fortune for himself , and earn our sincerest gratitude , ” Phelan pleaded .
When a New York chemist named John Wesley Hyatt subsequently debuted a synthetic ivory pool ball made from a compound called celluloid , it was lauded as revolutionary .
Plastic had arrived , ready to save the planet .
More than 150 years later , the story could hardly be more different .
As the most visible evidence of a disposable , trash - addled society , plastic has become the emblem of a world swimming in waste .
Reportedly , plastic shopping bags are used an average of just 12 minutes before being thrown away .
Every year , more than 500 billion plastic bags are discarded worldwide ; they wave from tree branches so abundantly that South Africans have dubbed them their “ national flower , ” and no fewer than six countries have enacted bans .
Shredded packaging fouls shorelines and turns up in the stomachs of trout , albatross , and sea turtles ( which mistake plastic bags for jellyfish ) .
In the Pacific Ocean , currents feed scraps into a thousand - mile - wide gyre of synthetic jetsam .
( See Where Plastics Go to Kill . )
Plastic ’s capacity for near - infinite proliferation initially seemed like a boon .
Compared with wood or metal , it was seen as “ an infinite material , ” notes Jeffrey Meikle , the author of American Plastic : A Cultural History .
Originally made from coal tar , the waste produced by coking coal for incineration , plastic used almost no extra resources and yet could be churned out by the ton .
“ It was a striking innovation , ” Meikle says .
“ From the scrap heap of industry , you could create essentially as much plastic as you want . ”
And therein lay the rub .
Inexpensive to make and easy to discard , plastic morphed from an engineering triumph into a global scourge .
In 1960 , Americans sent 390,000 tons of plastics to the landfill ; today we annually trash more than 28.5 million tons — around 11 percent of all municipal waste .
Plastic does n’t biodegrade , and the very characteristic that makes it so versatile — its protean ability to be resilient or stiff , soft or hard , opaque or transparent — makes it extremely difficult to recycle efficiently .
Even the most common recyclable categories of plastic ( No. 1 water bottles , for instance ) consist of incompatible polymers with different melting points .
In 2007 , less than 7 percent of Americans ’ plastic waste was recycled ( mostly milk jugs and water and soda bottles ) , as opposed to 55 percent of paper .
A 2000 survey by the American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) found that fewer than half of Americans had a positive opinion of the miracle material ; 25 percent “ strongly believed ” that plastic ’s environmental negatives outweighed its benefits .
The industry claims the ratings have improved , though it declines to release new data .
Even loyalists admit that plastic has an image problem .
When I asked Robert Krebs , spokesman for the ACC , for ways in which plastic has benefited the environment , he sent me a digital dump of documents and studies — everything from an EPA review asserting the superiority of plastic grocery bags over paper ( they take less energy to produce and transport , and consume fewer resources ) to a report on the fuel savings from plastic car parts .
But Krebs sounded glum when he contemplated plastic ’s pariah reputation .
“ Fifty percent popularity puts you down there with the trial lawyers , ” he said with a tired sigh .
For a popular material , plastic is remarkably unpopular .
Yet there is still a case to be made for plastic .
In the spring of 1980 , a young researcher at the Worldwatch Institute named Christopher Flavin published a 55 - page report titled “ The Future of Synthetic Materials . ”
Obscure as it was , the paper created a stir .
Flavin challenged the environmentalist dogma that plastic was an eco­logical disaster and was bleeding the country of large amounts of petroleum — in the midst of an oil crisis , no less .
In fact , Flavin argued , plastics were uncommonly efficient , often taking less energy to produce than the materials , like aluminum and glass , that they replaced .
And plastics were relatively thrifty , energy - wise .
( Today , 120 billion pounds of plastic are generated each year using less than 5 percent of world oil supplies .
In the United States , most plastic is made with natural gas , using about 5.6 percent of our gas output . )
Moreover , plastics begat other savings , Flavin noted .
They made packaging lighter , reducing the amount of fuel needed for shipping , and preserved food more effectively , meaning less breakage and waste .
Plastic window tinting reduced the use of air conditioning , while spray foam insulation minimized heat loss .
Now the president of Worldwatch , Flavin has moderated his opinion of plastic .
He now worries about toxicity ( the carcinogens in PVC and additives such as bisphenol - A in food - grade plastics , for instance ) , plastics in the ocean , and solid waste , a byproduct of the “ massive throwaway culture ” that he believes plastics have engendered .
Nonetheless , he still considers synthetics “ one of the higher and better uses for oil , ” especially on the carbon front .
“ It ’s a better value for the material , ” he explains .
“ You ’re not throwing carbon into the atmosphere ” — because making plastic does n’t burn oil — ” and the quantities are so much smaller than what we use for transportation .
My guess would be that we ’ll end up using oil for synthetic materials long after we stop using it for basic combustion . ”
Though he ’d like to see us use a lot less plastic , Flavin recognizes that there are n’t always sustainable alternatives .
“ It would certainly be very difficult to live a plastic - free life today , ” he says .
“ It ’s in so many things .
But there are a lot of problems with natural materials , too .
There ’s really no bright line between ‘ natural is good ’ and ‘ synthetic is bad . ’
The world is more complicated than that . ”
We may be stuck with plastic , but sometimes it may be the lesser evil .
However , plastic requires more than just an image makeover if it ’s going to make a positive contribution to a more energy efficient , less disposable world .
“ I think the case is fairly clear that we need to stop wasting petroleum for single - use products , like plastic bags and water bottles that get used for a few minutes and discarded , ” says Allen Hershkowitz , a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ What ’s less clear is what we do next , and how we do it in a cost - competitive and ecologically sound way . ”
The solution may be for plastic to keep doing what it does best — evolving , in essence , to become a better substitute for its current form .
Flavin has hopes for the next generation of compostable plastics , like the corn - based plastic that ’s turning up in cutlery and food packaging .
These “ natural ” plastics are less toxic to produce and more easily disposed of , yet they still have complicated environmental lives .
( See “ Infinite Pest . ” )
Many plastics labeled as biodegradable will break down only in high - heat commercial composting facilities , not if they ’re put in backyard composts or just left to the elements .
Nonetheless , when they ’re disposed of properly , bioplastics easily beat conventional plastics on the waste front .
Future generations of bioplastics made from agricultural waste and produced with renewable energy could even be carbon negative .
The quest for the 21st century ’s artificial ivory cue ball — a plastic that ’s “ nontoxic , totally biodegradable , easily recycled , ” as Flavin puts it — has a long way to go .
Market analysts estimate that it could be another 20 years before bioplastics make up even 5 percent of the global plastics market .
Yet Hershkowitz says demand , and rising oil costs , will push companies like DuPont and BASF to pursue alternatives .
“ The writing ’s on the wall for this , ” he says .
“ And that ’s a good thing . ”
The key , explains Flavin , is to focus not solely on what new plastics will be used for , but where they will go when they ’re thrown away , and then engineer them to break down accordingly .
Making plastics whose final feat is to disappear without a trace , he says , “ will be a complex engineering challenge that will keep many people employed for years to come . ”

This is great comedy :
SCIENTISTS say they are haunted by the failure to convey to the world just how close Earth is to climate catastrophe .
Top researchers who gathered in Copenhagen for a climate change conference said they were worried that people could not psychologically deal with the enormity of the problem and were reverting to doing nothing .
French glaciologist Claude Lorius , one of the first scientists to publish in 1987 evidence that global warming was real said he despaired of getting the message across .
“ At first , I thought that we could convince people .
But there is a terrible inertia , ” he said .
“ I fear that society is not up to the challenge of a crisis like this .
Today , as a human being I am pessimistic . ”
The Daily Telegraph
Glad you ’ve come along to the party , Dr. Lorius .
Let me explain a few things :
People are accustomed to being manipulated by the media .
They do n’t trust you to be telling the truth and not just tweaking all of us for your own gain .
For example , it ’d be convenient to demand action on global warming to equalize rich countries with poor and create a powerful world government .
Many of us do n’t want that .
You have a terrible track record .
The last 20 crises came and went and we ’re still here .
Nuclear war , drugs , hackers , Nazis , Satanists , UFOs , global cooling , etc .
Some of these were just crises we blew off that got worse — pollution , overpopulation and nuclear proliferation — but in general , we ’re not motivated to act .
People are individualists .
They ’re not lazy ; they ’re self - centered .
They act as if the world is there for their benefit , and all that matters is that they get what they want .
They do n’t care if society falls down as long as it does n’t happen during the years when they ’re young .
Global warming will take another 20 or 50 years to really get cooking ?
Well , deal with it then , they say , feeling wiser for having ducked a bullet .
People fail it .
Most people have no money , no power , and can barely live their own lives coherently .
In fact , numerically most of them live as disasters .
You expect them to do what … sell all their stuff , buy new stuff , and devote themselves to being green ?
They ca n’t put dinner on the table every night and end up ordering pizza twice a week .
They ca n’t pay their taxes on time .
Their homes get repossessed .
It ’s not that they lack the money — they ’ve spent it on other things , or lost it due to their own stupidity .
You want them to do what again ?
By the end of this paragraph , most people , like 90 % , will have forgotten the topic .
Our economic and social system forbids it .
We ca n’t tell others what to do or talk about offensive truths .
Furthermore , we cannot do anything that causes us to lose money , or someone else not doing that thing will come in and wipe us out .
How do you explain that to your family ?
So in other words , even if we accept what you ’re saying as truth , our dysfunctional society has failed us .
Remember all those old people in the past dozens of generations telling us stuff was getting worse ?
Looks like they were right .
But not for the reasons you mention , Dr. Lorius .
In general , the academics I ’ve met have been strikingly clever but not smart at all .
They know the right specialized vocabulary , usually an additional 5,000 words ; they know the topics of currency and have a thesis to handle each of the five big issues in their discipline .
But beyond that , they ’re useless .
They have no knowledge of the world .
This is why all philosophers should be thrust into the world to make their own way , according to the wisdom of an ancient philosopher .
Yet academics kept this society surging forward as much as anyone else .
You supported political correctness .
You supported big industry .
You supported fond notions that if we stop all offensive words , we ’ll turn out OK , and that those words can be defined subjectively .
You supported relativism .
And now you want us to snap to your command ?
Forget it — you blew it years ago , Dr. Lorius .
But you did n’t notice because you were in your lab , thin intelligence that you are , looking at partial representations of reality .

CATaLOG | An RFID Cat Tracker
The CATaLOG project aims to track our two cats Bobbin and Tuffin as they go in and out of the house so we can see which cat spends more time outside , what their favourite time to go out is , and also get sent SMS messages if a cat goes missing for a certain amount of time .
The current cat status and statistics are viewable at http://catalog.nermal.net.
You can also follow the cats on Twitter .
The system is designed around the Arduino Microcontroller linked to a low cost RS232 RFID reader and uses the Arduino Ethernet Shield and a Linksys WAP11 router acting as a wireless network bridge to send the data over the internet .
The tags used are standard 125 Khz RFID keyfobs attached to the cat 's collar ; the RFID reader coil is stuck to the bottom of the cat flap tunnel .

The RNC has transferred $ 250,000 to the Minnesota GOP to help pay legal fees in Norm Coleman ’s ongoing recount battle against Al Franken for the Minnesota Senate seat .
RNC sends $ 250 K for Coleman recount
The Republican National Committee has transferred $ 250,000 to the Minnesota GOP to help pay legal fees in Norm Coleman ’s ongoing recount battle against Al Franken for the Minnesota Senate seat .
A spokesman for the RNC , Alex Conant , said the committee had made Coleman ’s legal battle “ a priority because we think he has a case and because we think he deserves to return to the Senate . ”
The money was transferred last month .

“ We certainly appreciate the RNC ’s commitment to Minnesota as we are continuing full speed ahead , ” said Minnesota Republican Party spokeswoman Gina Countryman .
While the RNC cannot legally earmark funds for specific purposes , RNC sources said the deposit was made under the presumption that it would benefit Coleman ’s campaign .
The hefty payout underscores the rising costs associated with the ongoing legal battle , which has left Minnesota without a sitting senator for the first seven weeks of the 111th Congress .
Financial disclosure reports show Franken and Coleman spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees since the close of the election .
Franken paid his law firm , Perkins Coie , $ 389,276 in legal bills between Nov. 25 and Dec. 31 .
Coleman paid Knaak and Kantrud and Dorsey & Whitney $ 105,000 .
Coleman has raised $ 5 million since the close of the election to fund the legal battle , and the Minnesota Republican Party received a $ 10,000 transfer from the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
I ’m loving it !
Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan , two of the wisest foreign - policy analysts around , who never fuck up and write anything stupid and never support any dumb-ass foreign adventures and have a proven record of great judgment when it comes to foreign policy , have started a new think tank !
Once I get my laptop , I ’m going to apply for an internship at FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVE and live - blog the whole incredible , exhilarating experience !
By the way , why is the globe in their logo all lopsided and off - axis ?
Did someone drop a nuclear bomb on the Earth from Mars and blow it off course ?
Anyway , I ’m just so happy that these guys have landed OK .
It would send the wrong message if Kristol and Kagan somehow suffered the slightest professional inconvenience or humiliation as a result of their astonishing record of success .
Local Green Jobs Rise as SF Solar and Energy Efficiency Incentive Programs Expand
March 26th , 2009 by Gavin Newsom
Editors Note :
This is a guest post by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
His last post covered wave energy generation of the coast of California .
Watch a live press conference for this event at 10 AM today .
Every day more San Francisco residents and businesses are signing up for two San Francisco programs that will cut monthly utility bills and help the City meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals .
One is SF Energy Watch , which provides technical assistance and financial incentives that pays over half the cost of energy efficiency upgrades to commercial and multifamily properties .
The other is GoSolarSF , which , when combined with federal tax credits and state incentives , can reduce the cost of installing a residential solar power system by more than 50 percent .
In the past 2 years , 1,500 businesses and multifamily properties have saved over $ 5.7 million in energy bills through SF Energy Watch .
The program has also delivered 6 megawatts ( MW ) of energy efficiency savings , which in turn reduces the amount of energy generation we need from polluting power plants .
San Francisco currently has nearly 8 MW of in - City solar power , including the massive installation at Moscone Center .
But the real San Francisco solar gold rush came when we rolled out GoSolarSF in July 2008 .
In the first seven months , 640 residents and enterprises had taken advantage of the program ’s considerable incentives , applying to install nearly 2 MW of clean , renewable energy — 25 percent of the City ’s overall solar portfolio .
All of this activity has been a big boost for companies that provide energy efficiency and solar services in the Bay Area .
Because of the way San Francisco has structured these programs ; local companies that hire locally benefit the most .
SF Energy Watch has helped to sustain and / or expand companies — both service providers and suppliers — and currently supports 150 new and ongoing jobs in this emerging green field .
GoSolarSF has specific bonus incentives for employers who hire new staff through the City ’s workforce development program .
We have placed dozens of new employees in the local solar industry , and of the 640 projects under GoSolarSF , 83 percent are employing workforce development trainees .
On Tuesday of this week I introduced a resolution that will expand the SF Energy Watch program by nearly $ 4 million .
The money for SF Energy Watch comes from California ’s Public Goods Charge , a fund for renewable energy and energy efficiency that you pay into with a percentage of every utility bill .

G4 recently travelled to Activision HQ to play Prototype and came back with fresh and hot video ( viewable after the break ) from the game .
It might not make you come rainbows , but it 's damn sexy nonetheless .
The footage only has a sliver of coherent story .
It starts with a scene where Alex -- the hooded protagonist -- is told that a chick at GenTek knows something about his history .
Then it abruptly cuts to action shots of Alex running around New York City like a madman , battling army dudes and weird creepy crawlies .
It ends with an epic battle scene where you ’ll observe some badass Wolverine action and witness
Alex ’s ability to eat bullets .
It 's thrilling stuff and I can’t wait to get my hands on Prototype this June .
How about you guys ?

( CNN ) -- North Korea says it will attack the Japanese military and " major targets , " if Japan shoots down a rocket Pyongyang plans to launch in the coming days , North Korea 's state - run news service , KCNA , reported Thursday .
Japan recently deployed its missile defense system in anticipation of North Korea 's planned rocket launch .
" If Japan recklessly ' intercepts ' [ North Korea 's ] satellite for peaceful purposes , the [ Korean People 's Army ] will mercilessly deal deadly blows not only at the already deployed intercepting means but at major targets , " KCNA reported .
Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system in response to the planned North Korean launch , Japanese officials said .
The move , noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution , is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory .
U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles have also been moved to the Sea of Japan , a Navy spokesman said .
The threat of retaliation comes as North Korea has begun fueling its long - range rocket , according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence on the matter .
The fueling signals that the country could be in the final stages of what North Korea has said will be the launch of a satellite into space as early as this weekend , the senior U.S. military official said Wednesday .
Other U.S. military officials said the top portion of the rocket was put on very recently , but satellite imagery shows a shroud over the stage preventing a direct view of what the stage looks like .
The officials said the satellite payload appears to have a " bulbous " cover , which could indicate there is a satellite loaded on it .
Such a cover protects a satellite from damage in flight .
While the sources did not know for sure what the payload is , they did say there is no reason to doubt it is a satellite as indicated by North Korea .
Pyongyang has said it will conduct the launch sometime between April 4 and April 8 .
It 's a launch that may violate a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution .
Resolution 1718 " [ d] emands " that North Korea " not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile . "
" It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718 , " U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week .
" And if they persist and go forward , we will take it up in appropriate channels . "
Pentagon officials worry less about the payload and more about the launch itself , saying any kind of launch will give the North Koreans valuable information about improving their ballistic missile program .
" I do n't know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile , " U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Sunday .
Defense analysts say the same rocket could be used to push a satellite into space or deliver a nuclear warhead .
Gates noted that while the United States believes it is North Korea 's " long - term intent " to add a nuclear warhead to any such rocket , he " personally would be skeptical that they have the ability right now to do that . "
Gates said that the U.S. military could shoot down " an aberrant missile , one that was headed for Hawaii ... or something like that , we might consider it , but I do n't think we have any plans to ( do ) anything like that at this point . "
He does not believe North Korea currently has the technology to reach Alaska or Pacific coast .
CNN Senior Pentagon Producer Mike Mount contributed to this story .
All About North Korea • Nuclear Proliferation • Kim Jong-il
We 're veering off - topic , but you 've all been on one end or the other of this particular confrontation -- perhaps both -- so buckle up .
I 'm hurtling eastbound toward Boston in the high - speed lane of the Massachusetts Turnpike on a Saturday morning when a glance in the rear - view reveals flashing headlights on a vehicle that 's close enough to kiss my , uh , bumper .
First thought was state trooper .
Not so .
Second thought : one of those people ; the peevishly impatient , self - absorbed lead - foots -- also known as " jerks " -- who believe the high - speed lane is exclusive property of the motorist willing to go the highest speed at any given moment .
Third thought : I 'm not going anywhere but straight , no matter how feverishly lead - foot flashes .
After all , why should I move ?
I 'm using the lane for its intended purpose , passing cars regularly and lickety - split .
My kick - ass Toyota Corolla is advancing at a rate 5 to 10 mph over the speed limit of 65 .
What ?
I should get out of the way so that some knucklehead can break the law more egregiously ?
I think not , as I take another peek rearward and notice something that had n't registered earlier about this flasher :
He was n't some lunk - head in a pickup truck or teen - age hellion in a muscle car .
In fact , he was n't a he at all ; this irritant was a soccer mom ... in a minivan .
Now ask yourself :
Does this realization make it more likely or less likely that I 'm going to swallow my pride and slink over to the middle lane ?
Right !
I might have had to move , however reluctantly , for the lunk - head in the pickup truck , because I 've read enough road - rage stories to know he might beat me senseless .
Soccer mom ?
Unless she 's packing heat , I 'm not concerned .
Moreover , the only bow to chivalry I 'm willing to make at this point is that I wo n't give somebody 's mother the finger .
But I do give her a single , unmistakably angry wave of my arm across the rearview .
The message ?
If you want to go faster and pass more cars than I 'm passing , feel free to go around .
Which , eventually , she did -- without us making eye contact -- after which I settled back into the middle lane just in case she was looking .
But traffic was moderate to heavy and now the high - speed lane was n't moving so speedily ; in fact , it was the middle lane -- my lane -- that was now setting the pace .
A moment later I up and pass Mrs. Minivan , not on purpose , mind you , but just because that 's the way traffic was working .
I know this is a long story , but bear with me , there are miles yet to travel .
Eventually , traffic in the fast lane eases and soccer mom sprints by my car once again .
Enough of this nonsense , I 'm thinking .
As my left - lane exit approaches , I scoot back over to that side , hit the turn signal , and see immediately that Mrs.
Flasher -- still unable to get wherever she 's going any faster -- is taking the very same exit right at the very same time .
I wonder if she 's noticed me .
She goes through the toll booth 's lone transponder lane , as do I , right behind .
I wonder once more if she 's noticed .
She takes a right , I take a right .
OK , now I 'm starting to be concerned that she 's concerned that I 'm following her .
I 'm not ; this is pure coincidence .
She goes right onto Storrow Drive .
Guess what ?
Yes , indeed .
Even I 'm thinking this has gone a bit too far ... and I know it 's unintentional .
When I hit my blinker for my next exit , she continues on straight ... our paths not to cross again .
And two thoughts occur once it's all over : First , I was genuinely worried that she would be calling the cops to report some madman in a Toyota Corolla stalking her for no reason ; second , if she was worried , it was her own damn fault because I was just going where I was going and if you flash your headlights at people you never know if the guy you 're flashing them at is a madman .
That and it 's just plain rude .
Mining on the moon
According to news sources , the motivation behind a future expedition to the moon is the metal , Helium - 3 , which is commonly used in nuclear reactors and microchip technologies .
This material is very rare on earth , but is thought to be in abundant supply on the Moon .
Due to its scarcity , it is typically manufactured instead of recovered from natural deposits .
Mining is just one of the factors behind the establishment of a potential moon base , as it could also provide the framework for industries considered as being harmful to the Earth ’s environment and eco-system .
At present , it is just an idea , as the Russian government does not appear willing to support Sevastyanov ’s plans .
Many close to the situation however , believe that he will get the necessary state funding and that the project will become the subject of a sustained promotional campaign .
Russian actions in this matter may well determine whether the world will see another “ space race ” in the near future .
Helium - 3 is the new “ black gold ” ( which used to be the term for oil when it was discovered on a property ) and the stakes could n’t be much higher .
According to scientists , there could be close to one million tons of Helium - 3 on the moon .
Via fusion energy , twenty - five tons of this rare metal could meet US energy requirements for an entire year .
Fossil fuels are rapidly being depleted and Helium - 3 could balance out the difference .
Will Russia be mining on the moon in the next 20 years ?
Time ( and energy ) will tell .

Introducing WxGeneric May 3 , 2008
I recently decided to rethink and reimplement AutoForms .
This post will be the first of a series that explains the hows and whys of this reimplementation .
Why AutoForms need a replacement
AutoForms started simply as a library to generically construct GUI forms , such as a settings dialog .
But as development has progressed more and more features has been been added .
It has gotten to the point where AutoForms tries to be a complete GUI library on top of WxHaskell , in stead of just a library to generically construct widgets in cooperation with WxHaskell .
The feature creep has let to several problems :
Less separation of concerns than possible
Too much to maintain and develop
For potential users of a AutoForms I am asking a lot , as they will have to understand a hole new and complex library .
By exploring many different features , non have really been explored to a satisfactory level .
AutoForms has become Jack of all trades , master of none .
I have dealt with these issues in two ways .
Firstly I have created an interface to AutoForms ( called AFWx ) which is very simple for a person that already knows WxHaskell .
Secondly to better separate concerns , I have been factoring out the different parts into independent modules .
While these remedies have helped , it was not enough .
I wanted a library that focused on generically constructing Widgets from data types .
As such , large parts of the code in AutoForms were unneeded .
And large parts needed to be changed .
Therefore starting from scratch seemed attractive .
While I was not sure it was the best choice it did seem like an experiment worth performing .
And in retrospect I think it turned out really well .
Another issue that led me to reimplementation were composability .
Just like most data types are composed of other data types , a library like AutoForms needs to compose widgets to bigger widgets .
Unfortunately WxHaskell lacks in composability .
Thus AutoForms contains the WxM monad to compose widgets .
The interface of the WxM monad is considerably different from ordinary WxHaskell code and those places a burden on the user .
But as I recently discovered it is possible to achieve composability , while still keeping the WxHaskell look and feel .
This makes a strong argument for scraping the WxM monad .
And as the WxM Monad is a central piece of AutoForms , it also makes a strong argument for reimplementing AutoForms .
The Reimplementation
The reimplementation resulted in not one , but two new libraries .
The first library is called WxGeneric and constructs widgets generically .
In contrast to AutoForms , it do not try to reinvent the GUI library .
While it does make GUI creation easier , most of the GUI application code will still look like ordinary WxHaskell code .
Indeed most of the GUI application code will call WxHaskell directly .
When constructing AutoForms , I discovered that some of the hardest to implement code was not specific to any one GUI toolkit .
It therefore seemed natural to abstract this code into a separate library .
This library is called SybWidget and WxGeneric builds upon it .
However , as it is very difficult to make a generalization from just one example , I also refactored AutoForms to use SybWidget .
The refactoring indeed resulted in changes to SybWidget that made it more generally useful .
It is my hope that GUI toolkits similar to WxHaskell ( like Gtk2Hs ) will find SybWidget useful and implement there own generic widget libraries .
Separating the WxHaskell specific parts from the rest , allowed me to make a library that do not use the IO monad .
This makes it possible to test SybWidget with QuickCheck .
For some functions the important aspect to test was not so much varying values , but varying types .
Here QuickCheck approach do not make much sense and I opted for HUnit instead .
I use Haskell Program Coverage for measuring SybWidget ’s test coverage .
Future of AutoForms
The simplicity of WxGeneric ( as compared to AutoForms ) is very attractive , but it is not without cost either .
For example AutoForms tries to be “ intelligent ” about the automatic layout of widgets .
This “ intelligence ” will be lost when using WxGeneric .
Also AutoForms has better static type safety than both WxGeneric and WxHaskell .
In the future I might try to develop these ideas further .
Either as part of AutoForms or in a separate library .
But I do not think that these features should be included in WxGeneric .
It should be as it is , a simple library to generically construct widgets .
The next post
In the next post we will look at how to use WxGeneric .

Minister beaten after clashing with Muslims on his TV show
A Christian minister who has had heated arguments with Muslims on his TV Gospel show has been brutally attacked by three men who ripped off his cross and warned : ‘ If you go back to the studio , we ’ll break your legs . ’
The Reverend Noble Samuel was driving to the studio when a car pulled over in front of him .
A man got out and came over to ask him directions in Urdu .
Mr Samuel , based at Heston United Reformed Church , West London , said : ‘ He put his hand into my window , which was half open , and grabbed my hair and opened the door .
Frightened : TV minister Noble Samuel
He started slapping my face and punching my neck .
He was trying to smash my head on the steering wheel .
Then he grabbed my cross and pulled it off and it fell on the floor .
He was swearing .
The other two men came from the car and took my laptop and Bible . ’
The Metropolitan Police are treating it as a ‘ faith hate ’ assault and are hunting three Asian men .
In spite of the attack , Mr Samuel went ahead with his hour - long live Asian Gospel Show on the Venus satellite channel from studios in Wembley , North London .
During the show the Muslim station owner Tahir Ali came on air to condemn the attack .
Pakistan - born Mr Samuel , 48 , who was educated by Christian missionaries and moved to Britain 15 years ago , said that over the past few weeks he has received phone - in calls from people identifying themselves as Muslims who challenged his views .
‘ They were having an argument with me , ’ he said .
‘ They were very aggressive in saying they did not agree with me .
I said those are your views and these are my views . ’
He said that he , his wife Louisa , 48 , and his son Naveed , 19 , now fear for their safety , and police have given them panic alarms .
‘ I am frightened and depressed , ’ he said .
‘ My show is not confrontational . ’
The case against 12 Muslim men involved in what Gordon Brown described as a " major terrorist plot " amounted to one email and a handful of ambiguous telephone conversations , it emerged last night after all the men were released without charge .
Eleven Pakistani students and one British man were freed after extensive searches of 14 addresses in North - west England failed to locate evidence of terrorist activity , according to security sources .
Police did not find any explosives , firearms , target lists , documents or any material which could have been used to carry out an attack .
Last night Lord Carlile , the reviewer of terror laws , said he would be heading an immediate " snapshot " investigation into the arrests .

The Home Office said it would deport the 11 Pakistani men , who are aged 22 to 38 and were in Britain on student visas , because the Government believed they represented a threat to national security .
According to security sources , the operation was launched after the interception of telephone calls and emails which pointed towards a bombing campaign orchestrated by al - Qa'ida .
But yesterday a senior Pakistani defence official said the British authorities had failed to consult them adequately before carrying out the arrests and greater co-operation would have avoided " embarrassing mistakes " for the British Government .
The official said : " They really started asking for our help properly after the arrests had been made over here .
We have not arrested anyone in Pakistan , the families of these men or their friends , because we could not find anything against them , and we have a big file on terrorist suspects . "
It has also emerged that there were disagreements among the various British security agencies about the way aspects of the operation were conducted .
Muslim groups and lawyers for the 12 men arrested two weeks ago in connection with the alleged terror attack plot on the North - west said the police operation had been a fiasco from start to finish .
The only British man questioned for 13 days in connection with the alleged plot may have been held on the strength of a single " cryptic " email , it emerged last night .
Lawyers for Hamzah Khan Shenwari , a 42 - year - old security guard and delivery driver from Cheetham Hill , Manchester , disclosed that he had entered Britain nine years ago and was granted political asylum following his treatment at the hands of the Taliban .
The Pashtu- speaker , who comes from the North West Province of Pakistan , where his family and children still live , was questioned over the course of 14 hours at a police station in Coventry although no substantial evidence was put before him , it was claimed .
He claims he suffered bruises and a cracked rib during his arrest .
Police believed that he was the " teacher " of the group because he was the oldest , his lawyers said .

His solicitor , Sawar Khan , said : " He was elated this morning but his words to me were ' it is going to be difficult for me ' .
Even though he has been released without charge how will he be treated now ?
Most of the men come from north - west Pakistan but where they come from or what faith they are should not be a deciding factor in anything . "
Lawyers for the men are furious that Gordon Brown and the Home Secretary made statements on the alleged plot during their detention period .
Mr Khan said it was regrettable that , even though his client had been released , the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police had again talked up the threat of an unspecified terrorist attack .
He said there were question marks over the initial detention period of his client between 8 and 14 April .
He was eventually released after Mr Justice Blake , who heard the application for a third extension of custody via a video link in the High Court , expressed " grave concern " over the progress of the investigation .
Mr Khan said Mr Shenwari was not seeking publicity or money .
Police appeared to have few definite facts during the course of the questioning , it was claimed and no surveillance evidence was put to him .
" A lot of the questions were repeated – he was asked whether he was involved in the preparation or instigation of terrorism . "
Mr Shenwari , who does not own a computer , was asked by police about an email sent by one of the arrested men although the contents of the message were never made available to his defence team .
It is understood that the email was cryptic and open to misinterpretation if taken out of context .
Mohammed Ayub said he would consider lodging an appeal for asylum on behalf of his clients , Sultan Sher , Mohammed Rizwan Sharif and Mohammed Umer Farooq , who were held at a police station in Bradford where they underwent up to six hours of questioning a day .
Mr Ayub said his clients , who all came from the North West Frontier territories of Pakistan , faced serious dangers should they be returned to their homeland .
" They face an uncertain future in Pakistan now they have been labelled as being engaged in potential terrorist activity , " he said .
" They can not go back to living normal lives in Pakistan .
The authorities may be obliged to put them into custody where they may be subjected to torture , " he said .
" They were sustained by the belief that they were not involved in any wrongdoing and they maintained their innocence throughout .
What put the police on to them in the first place ?
That is a very difficult question , " he said .
During the interviews , Mr Ayub said no specific evidence had been put to his clients – no video footage or surveillance photographs were shown to them , though they were asked directly whether they were members of al - Qa'ida .
Last night , 10 of the men were being held at detention centres .
Their lawyers have seven days to present their cases to an appeals panel .
The North - west arrests : Key questions
When were the men arrested ?
Manchester police officers were rushed into making the arrests after Bob Quick , then Britain 's senior counter - terrorism officer , accidentally displayed information prejudicing the operation .
Officers raided homes and universities across the North - west of England on 8 April .
Twelve men were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 .
Mr Quick later resigned .
How long were they held ?
One was released to the UK Borders Agency while the remaining 11 were questioned by police .
Under terror laws suspects can be held without charge for up to 28 days .
By yesterday all 12 had been released , two weeks before the maximum time limit expired .
Why did n't the police keep the men in custody longer ?
The Terrorism
Act includes judicial safeguards to ensure that the police are not simply detaining people while conducting " fishing expeditions " for evidence .
The first time the police sought judicial permission was after 48 hours of detention .
But they had to go back to court to authorise detention every week .
After 14 days ' detention the Crown Prosecution Service asked further permission from a High Court judge to keep the men in custody .
It is understood that at this point the judge expressed concerns about the quality of the evidence being used to justify their detention .
The investigation had clearly made little progress and the men were released .
What did the judge have to decide ?
The court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that further detention will help obtain or preserve relevant evidence .
But the judge must also be happy that the investigation is being conducted " diligently and expediently " .
What happens next ?
The Home Office says it will deport the 11 Pakistanis on grounds of national security .
It is understood that the men want to carry on their studies in the UK and their lawyers are expected to go to court to contest this action .
Who will win ?
It 's hard to say .
The Home Office must show that the men's presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good or that they represent a threat to national security .
Their lawyers will argue that no evidence has been provided to support such a claim .
The case is expected to end up before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ( Siac ) which can hear evidence in secret .
What are they likely to say ?
In the past Siac has blocked deportations to countries where the suspects face possible torture or execution .
Now that the 11 students have been arrested on suspicion of what Gordon Brown described as a " major terrorism plot " they will almost certainly be of interest to the Pakistan security forces .
So what threat do they face upon their return ?
The Pakistan police and security forces are known to have tortured terror suspects , some of whom are British citizens .
Pakistan also retains the death penalty .
Now that the names of the students are known to the Islamabad authorities the men may wish to pursue claims for asylum in the UK on humanitarian grounds .
How long will this case take ?
It could go on for years .
Several Algerians are still being held in the UK five years after they were accused of links to terrorism .
It has taken that long for the House of Lords to rule that they can be safely deported .

That ’s exactly what Harris County Constables Office Precinct 4 investigators recently discovered !
Going by the Houston Chronicle Saturday reports , a Somerset , Kentucky resident - Anthony Scott O'Shea , 24 - has been arrested and accused of imploring and sharing an 11 - year - old Houston girl ’s nude pictures - using his PS3 .
According to the investigators with the High Tech Crimes Unit , it was during the course of playing a game – Warhawk - by way of the PS3 ’s online network late last year that O'Shea came in contact with the girl .
Sgt. Gary Spurger said O'Shea convinced the girl to send pictures “ of her breasts and from below her waist , ” using the Webcam on the PS3 .
Once he received the pictures , he shared them with others via the Internet from his PS .
The scared girl told her parents , who contacted the police .
The girl told police that O'Shea “ kept pressuring her for more pictures and wanted to set up a meeting with her in order to engage in sexual activity . ”
O'Shea has been charged with promotion of child pornography ; online solicitation of a minor ; and sexual performance of a child .
Since the girl belongs to the Houston area , O'Shea faces extradition to Texas .
The Fedora development community has announced the availability of the first Fedora 11 beta release .
The new release gives users the opportunity to get an early look at the features that will be included in the next major version of the popular Linux distro .
Fedora 11 , which is codenamed Leonidas , is scheduled for final release at the end of May .
It will include several new features and noteworthy improvements , such as RPM 4.7 , which will reduce the memory consumption of complex package activity , tighter integration of PackageKit , faster boot time with a target goal of 20 seconds , and reduced power consumption thanks to a major tuning effort .
This version of Fedora will ship with the latest version of many popular open source software programs , including GNOME 2.26 , KDE 4.2 , and Xfce 4.6 .
This will also be the first Fedora release — and possibly the first mainstream distro release — to use the new Ext4 filesystem by default .
I typically quote the release announcement in my beta coverage , but Fedora release manager Jesse Keating claims that his clever remarks about the beta release vanished into the ether when his cat crashed his X session .
I share in your profound disappointment , but we will have to make do without official commentary .
He cites automatic font installation , fingerprint reader support , and kernel modesetting as several of the top features in Fedora 11 .
The feature list has a few very nice items and the effort to ship Ext4 by default is very ambitious , though perhaps a bit premature .
The reliability of Ext4 is still somewhat questionable and there is evidence that the potential for data loss still exists .
Fedora 's deep integration of PackageKit is one area where the distro continues to impress me .
PackageKit is a generic distro-neutral package management front - end framework .
It includes a universal package management user interface and provides APIs for integrating package management capabilities into other applications .
In Fedora 10 , the developers introduced support for using PackageKit to request automatic installation of multimedia codecs .
In Fedora 11 , they have taken it to the next level by using it to handle automatic firmware installation .
Fedora 11 also has a new sound preferences and volume control tool that gives users access to some of the advanced features in the PulseAudio sound server , including support for per-application volume control .
I used the installable GNOME Live CD image to test the beta release in VirtualBox .
Aside from some VirtualBox - specific performance problems , this release is pretty strong .
It is , however , still a work in progress .
Some of the early testers have encountered various problems with the release .
The Fedora community had a test day event on Thursday with a focus on power management .
All things considered , Fedora 11 progress looks good and the release is shaping up nicely .
The developers are already looking to the future and have begun the process of drafting a schedule for Fedora 12 , which could potentially arrive in October .
For more details about the Fedora 11 beta , check out the official release notes .
Installation media is available from the Fedora website .

Nationwide customers have erupted in fury and incredulity at a ruling from the mutual that bars borrowers who pay to escape a fixed - rate mortgage from applying for a new loan .
The exclusion applies even if they have a huge deposit , excellent earnings and perfect credit ratings - and pay a hefty early redemption charge ( ERC ) .
Mark Couves from Oxfordshire has been a Nationwide mortgage customer for 25 years .
Last July , he took out a mortgage fixed for five years at 5.83 % .
" I got that wrong .
I 'm happy to pay the £ 3,250 exit fee but I want to stay with Nationwide - it 's loyalty as well as being less hassle .
I owe about £ 105,000 .
My home is worth at least four times that and I can easily afford the loan .
I was told the decision to refuse me another mortgage was ' taken in the best interests of Nationwide and its loyal members ' .
I 'm a loyal member and this is not in my best interests .
One adviser even told me he thought the policy was absolutely insane . "
Erica Plowman has two Nationwide loans totalling £ 135,000 on her east London home .
" As one of my mortgages is now on a low rate and the other still on the 5.68 % fixed I 'd taken out in September 2007 , I wanted to know whether moving the fixed rate was worthwhile .
But its customer services refused to do the sums saying I would have to go elsewhere .
I was told Nationwide had received loads of complaints about this .
Yet the option is in my terms and conditions .
" It 's probably not worth me switching but there is a principle here and Nationwide is stopping my choice as a consumer .
I have been very happy with the society .
Now I 'm very angry . "
Bryn Lewis from south London took out a 5.85 % Nationwide five - year fixed rate mortgage last spring .
" I believe I could save each month by paying the early repayment charge and opting for a tracker or a lower cost fixed deal , " he says .
But Nationwide told Lewis in late January he would have to go elsewhere if he left his deal .
" I have had no notification .
It contradicts my mortgage offer which said I would pay a 3 % early repayment charge if " you repay the mortgage or transfer to another product within the benefit period " .
Guardian Money asked other lenders for their policy .
None of those we contacted would force customers away - most said they could not understand Nationwide 's reasoning .
One says it is " bonkers to give up good customers to another lender " .
Halifax says : " We allow borrowers to redeem , pay the ERC and take out a new loan . "
" There are no restrictions .
Mortgage customers can remortgage on to any deal they wish if they leave a fixed rate early , " says Woolwich .
" We do n't have a policy of banning , " says Yorkshire building society .
Abbey said : " Providing they pass our credit tests and pay a new fee , they can remortgage with us if they wish . "
NatWest and Britannia said they do not bar customers who redeem loans early .
Nationwide said : " Under the terms of a customer 's fixed - rate mortgage offer they can pay an early repayment charge and redeem their mortgage early , however there is no obligation for Nationwide to provide an alternative product for customers to move to if they wish to break their deal early .
When a customer exits a mortgage deal early we incur a cost and this is not necessarily covered by the early repayment charge .
We do not wish to lose customers . "
Religion , or at least religious inquiry , is something that nearly all humans share in common .
In all corners of the world and in all eras of history , people have wondered about the meaning of life , how to make the best of it , what happens afterwards , and if there is anyone or anything " out there . "
The goal of this website is to provide free , reliable information — " just the facts " — on the various answers that have been given to these questions , as well as the rituals and customs that go along with them .
This very broad goal means that we cover a wide variety of religions , belief systems , and world views — the grounds for a group 's inclusion are only that it offers an explanation of ultimate reality or the purpose of life and has ( or had ) a significant number of followers .
ReligionFacts is an objective guide and does not promote any one religion or belief system nor even a particular view of religion .
Our only " value statements " are these : ( 1 ) religion is interesting ; ( 2 ) knowledge is good .
These two opinions led to the creation of ReligionFacts in 2004 .
Other than that , we aim to keep our opinions to ourselves and give you the facts in the most unbiased and objective manner possible .

A new , fan - generated mock - up of a fictitious magazine is a direct response to recent comments J.J. Abrams made about Star Trek followers who might be dissatisfied with the redesigned look of his new movie .
The original starship Enterprise was designed by Matt Jefferies in 1965 , but Abrams commissioned a redesign by Ryan Church for the new film .
Some fans were n't pleased with the retooled ship and , in an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Abrams said : " The key is to appreciate that there are purists and fans of Star Trek who are going to be very vocal if they see things that are n't what they want .
But I can't make this movie for readers of Nacelles Monthly who are only concerned with what the ship 's engines look like . "
While Abrams may wish to reconsider antagonizing the core fan group for his new movie months before it hits theaters , TrekMovie.com 's Anthony Pascale and 3D artists Tobias Richter and Thorsten Wulff teamed to design a cover for the magazine Abrams hopes you 'll never read .

Terminally ill cancer patients who drew comfort from religion were far more likely to seek aggressive , life - prolonging care in the week before they died than were less religious patients and far more likely to want doctors to do everything possible to keep them alive , a study has found .
The patients who were devout were three times as likely as less religious ones to be put on a mechanical ventilator to maintain breathing during the last week of life , and they were less likely to do any advance care planning , like signing a do - not - resuscitate order , preparing a living will or creating a health care proxy , the analysis found .
The study is to be published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association .
“ People think that spiritual patients are more likely to say their lives are in God ’s hands 
’ Let what happens happen ’  but in fact we know they want more aggressive care , ” said Holly G. Prigerson , the study ’s senior author and director of the Center for Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care Research at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
“ To religious people , life is sacred and sanctified , ” Dr. Prigerson said , “ and there ’s a sense they feel it ’s their duty and obligation to stay alive as long as possible . ”
Santa did n’t bring me what I really wanted for Christmas , but I hardly expected him to .
Do n’t get me wrong -- I was good last year , and Santa was generous .
But what I really wanted was a Clover® Brewing System , the kind they have at the Starbucks on Beacon Street , and in only a handful of other Starbucks around the country .
It was a lot to ask for , I knew , even before I found out that a Clover® machine costs $ 12,000 .
But I swear , if I found $ 12,000 on a sidewalk , I ’d buy one .
If you do n’t understand why , some part of your psyche will always be a mystery to me .
I do n’t get people who do n’t like coffee , and I distrust writers who do n’t drink it .
How can anyone be a writer without coffee ?
Writers are the original Coffee Achievers .
At the risk of dating myself , I still love this commercial : Yes , that was David Bowie … and Cicely Tyson … and Kurt Vonnegut .
Coffee has been an essential tool of almost all the greatest modern writers , and certainly of the most prolific ones .
Voltaire reportedly drank 50 cups a day ( and I ’ve seen estimates as high as 72 cups a day ) .
Jean Jacques
Rousseau wrote what amounted to a love letter about freshly roasted coffee .
Arthur Conan Doyle and his fictional sleuth , Sherlock Holmes , loved coffee almost as much as they loved cocaine ( Holmes : “ A cup of coffee would clear my brain ” ) .
Anthony Trollope , admirably disciplined , rose every morning at exactly 5:00 and drank his coffee before writing for three hours , after which he went to work at the post office .
Edgar Allan
Poe drank coffee by the gallon ( the tell - tale heart ’s pounding : conscience or caffeine overdose ? ) .
Maigret ’s creator , Georges Simenon , could write a detective novel in three days on the power of his bottomless coffee cup .
Beethoven loved his coffee strong , and Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated a sonata ( BMV 211 ) to the glories of coffee .
I would argue that coffee has been far more important to literature than alcohol .
We think of Hemingway , for instance , as a hard drinker , but he was equally addicted to coffee , and wrote some of his best work with its help .
If you ever visit Montreux , Switzerland , you can take a Hemingway walking tour that includes a visit to the railway café where he wrote A Farewell to Arms .
The master Coffee Achiever , though , is surely the great Honoré de Balzac .
Balzac wrote 16 hours a day on specially - prepared Parisian coffee , and no writer was ever more obsessed with it .
His essay “ The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee ” [ link : http://www.newpartisan.com/home/balzac-the-pleasures-and-pains-of-coffee.html]describes its power and gives advice for overcoming caffeine tolerance ( ultimately , by dumping raw grounds into an empty stomach ; do n’t try this at home ) .
Once coffee hits your system , Balzac wrote , “ ideas quick - march into motion like the battalions of a great army . ”
He once claimed he drank 50,000 cups of coffee during his lifetime .
Maybe that ’s how he was able to turn out 100 novels by the time he died , at 51 .
( Or maybe that ’s why he died at 51 . ) Coffee has been the official American drink since 1773 , when colonists revolted against King George III ’s tea tax by dumping a load of British tea into Boston Harbor ( to which King George III allegedly responded , “ So they threw their tea in the harbor .
Let them drink coffee . ” )
No wonder , then , that the Continental Congress declared coffee the official beverage of the Colonies .
And yes , there have always been exceptions .
Henry James was , of course , a tea drinker .
Henry David Thoreau railed against coffee as an expensive luxury .
“ [ W ] ater is the only drink for a wise man ; wine is not so noble a liquor ; and think of dashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of coffee . ”
I bet he did n’t get invited to many parties … and of course , that was before Starbucks took over Concord Center .
Coffee is part of my earliest memories .
My parents ground their own beans , years before it became common practice ; the sound of the coffee grinder used to wake me up on school mornings , and I ’d come downstairs to that intoxicating smell .
I did n’t start drinking it myself until college , but once I did , I quickly figured out the difference between the good stuff and the – uh – not .
When I was a student , for example , you could n’t drink coffee in England .
The first time I drank coffee in London , I spit it out .
( Agatha Christie , a tea drinker , once remarked , “ Coffee in England always tastes like a chemistry experiment . ” )
Now , though , you can get amazing coffee in England – at the Monmouth Coffee Company in Covent Garden and Flat White in Berwick Street , among other places .
And there are Caffe Neros all over the place , almost as abundant as Starbucks .
Lee Child , quintessential Englishman , loves coffee and drinks it black ( like his hero , Jack Reacher ) .
My British - born assistant , Claire Baldwin , drinks only coffee , not tea .
Coffee gets credit for modern civilization , in more ways than one .
Both the American and the French Revolutions began in coffeehouses .
My friend Malcolm Gladwell , in a piece in the New Yorker [ link : http://gladwell.com/2001/2001_07_30_a_java.htm] some years ago , pointed out that coffee helped give rise to the Enlightenment : Voltaire , Robespierre , Napoleon , Victor Hugo and Rousseau gathered at coffeehouses in Paris .
Coffee also fueled the American Industrial Revolution , by helping workers get up early , work long hours , and coordinate their shifts .
And what are novelists but shift workers at the fiction factory ?
I space my working day out in cups of coffee .
It ’s my reward for getting work done , and also my stimulation to do more work .
I need that psychoactive alkaloid stimulant crossing my blood - brain barrier .
In fact , I ’m sitting here drinking a perfect espresso as I write this .
Every week I buy a couple of bags of fresh - roasted Peets coffee to make at home .
At the office , though , I drink only espresso , using a Gaggia espresso maker and Starbucks pods ( less mess than grinding , and fresher - tasting than the Illy pods ) .
It ’s excellent , though it does n’t compare to the coffee produced by a machine my friend Giles McNamee recently turned me onto : the Jura Impressa Z6 [ link : www.capresso.com/automatic-coffee-centers-z6.shtml].The Z6 makes espresso even better than I ’ve had in Italy … almost as good as the Clover .
And at a mere $ 3,699 , it ’s a bargain in comparison .
I have n’t yet sprung for it , and probably wo n’t – but could n’t I call it a business expense ?

Some hospitals have already shown they can reduce readmissions by taking seemingly simple steps to make sure patients get necessary follow - up care when they go home or to a nursing facility .
At Geisinger Health System , a network in Pennsylvania that has been a leader in improving the quality of hospital care , doctors say they are taking varied approaches to reducing readmissions rates , depending on why the patient was initially hospitalized .
With surgery patients , for example , Geisinger has focused on educating people before they come to the hospital about what they are likely to experience and what they should expect when they leave .
The effort could reduce readmission rates by as much as 20 percent , said Dr. Ronald A. Paulus , a senior executive at the health system .
Geisinger ’s early findings , he said , indicate that if patients “ are not ready by the time they come in , it ’s too late . ”
Geisinger has also found it effective to alert the patients ’ doctor about the hospital visit , including a brief summary of the patient ’s discharge plan that is sent the doctor within 72 hours of the patient ’s departure .
That kind of simple step , Dr. Paulus noted , does not require an overhaul of the current system .
Successful measures elsewhere have included working more closely with patients or their caregivers to better manage conditions like diabetes , said Dr. Eric A. Coleman , one of the study ’s authors and a policy specialist at the University of Colorado at Denver .
Coaching patients to be more diligent about taking their medicine and recognizing when their condition is deteriorating helps people stay out of the hospital , he said .
But Dr. Coleman also said doctors needed to take more responsibility for their patients ’ continuing care .
“ Physicians have n’t really been stepping up to the plate and taking on this accountability , ” he said , although he said several professional societies were expected this spring to clarify the doctors ’ roles .
Many policy analysts say that insurers like Medicare must change the way they pay hospitals and doctors  rewarding medical providers that help patients get and stay better .
Under the current system , reducing the number of returning patients can work against the financial interests of a hospital needing to fill empty beds .
About one in four of the nation ’s hospitals derive 25 percent of their admissions from return visits by patients , according to the study .
“ Reducing admissions in a hospital is quite punitive in today ’s environment , ” said Dr. Amy E. Boutwell , a policy specialist at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement .
The institute is working with states including Massachusetts , Washington and Michigan to determine how to change the payment system to encourage hospitals to work more closely with doctors and others to prevent needless round trips .
Before some more practicing , it is time to finish the last post about IP addressing .
One important concept is missing : network masks .
After CIDR adoption , the network mask became essential for splitting the IP address in network ID and host ID .
This way , the default masks for classes A , B and C could be increased ( typical case for sub - networking ) or even decreased ( common in routers for saving routing tables entries ) .
In fact , the network mask is built putting bits in 1 from left to right in the part corresponding to the network ID and leaving the remaining bits in 0 ( host ID part ) .
For instance , consider the class A network address 10.0.0.0 .
We will use the network mask 255.255.255.0 .
This mask has 1 in the first 24 bits ( three consecutive bytes with 255 ) creating the network ID “ 10.0.0 ” and leaving one additional byte for host ID .
The CIDR notation for this mask is “ / 24 ” , an abbreviated expression to say the amount of bits set .
Different machines in this network will have distinct host IDs , just changing the bit values in the host ID .
Two host IDs are reserved : the first one ( all bits in host ID reset ) and the last one ( all bits in host ID set ) .
As you have already guessed this first address is the network address but the last one is new in our discussion .
It is called broadcast address and it is reserved for sending messages for all machines in this subnet .
In summary :
Network : 10.0.0.0
Mask : 255.255.255.0 or /24 ( CIDR notation )
IP addresses range : 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254 ( to be used in your machines )
Broadcast : 10.0.0.255
Let ’s examine a more complex example .
Suppose you received the following network / mask from your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) :
Network : 200.201.145.128
Mask : 255.255.255.192 or /26 ( CIDR notation )
Quite strange no ?
In fact , no .
I will show you .
Put your attention in the mask .
The first two significant bits in the last byte of the mask are set ( 192 is 11000000 in binary – we will use suffixes ‘ d ’ and ‘ b ’ to denote bases ) .
This means that the first two significant bits in 128 ( 10000000b ) belongs to the network ID and only the last six bits can be used to host ID .
So , when all bits in host ID are reset ( 10000000 b or 128d ) we have the network address and when they are set we obtain the broadcast address ( 10111111 b or 191d ) .
In summary :
Network : 200.201.145.128
Mask : 255.255.255.192 or /26 ( CIDR notation )
Broadcast : 200.201.145.191
IP addresses range : 200.201.145.129 to 200.201.145.190 ( to be used in your machines )
How about use this knowledge for creating a adhoc connection between two smartphones ?
Really simple .
Just select one reserved network , define your mask , choose two different host IDs for IPs and set your security parameters / protocols .
The connection setup will require a default gateway .
If you do not want to access any network / computers outside your ahdoc network , use your own IP as default gateway .
In fact , default gateway is related to routing , defining the path to reach other networks .
But this is subject for another post …

Women 's Beach
Palić Film Festival
Seven kilometers to the east of Subotica is the village Palić and next to it lies a tranquil body of water that bears the same name .
The shallow saltwater lake of aeolian origin is rich in thermal springs .
Since the mid-19th century the area around the lake has prospered into a prestigeous health resort and vacation area .
Although the avarage depth of the lake is only 2 m , it has cosy and tended beaches along its 17 km long shores , offering opportunities for various water sports and fishing .
A large park embraces the lake and dotted with picturesque villas and hotelsis becoming a popular excursion point for tourists .
Palić can be reached by from Subotica , a nearby urban center close to the border with Hungary , or by train that stops here twice a day and continues on to Szeged .
The bus stops in front of the main entrance of the park by the Water Tower ( Vodotoranj ) , the symbol of the resort .
Like all the other prominent buildings here , it is the work of Marcel Komor and Deže Jakab from 1912 , when Palić was given its present appearance .
The main park promenade begins at the Water Tower and leads to the stocky Grand Terrace , a beautiful Art Nouveau building also built 1912 .
On the other side of the Terrace , next to the lake shore , is the memorial well with an inscription about the founding day of the resort .
To the right of stands the fairytale - like wooden Women ’s Lido , rich in detail and reminescent of local ethnic motives .
The characteristic Villa Lujza is near by , built in Swiss style ( deemed to be the most adequate for spas ) and the ruined Owl Castle , once home of the famous sportsman Lajoš Vermeš .
Palić also has a ZOO garden ( phone : 024/753-075 , open every day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ) and a large open air stage that hosts the annual Palić International Film Festival in July .
Towards the East along the same road there is another water basin , Lake Ludoško , a wetland reserve rich in waterfowl .
There are 214 species of birds that can be seen throughout the year , 40 of which nest here .
The lake is also an archeological locality with evidence of early human settlements .
There several farmsteadsand fish taverns ( salaš and čarda ) with culinary specialites and old - style rural accommodation .
Palic , the 7 km long lake and tourist centre used to be an elite resort and spa at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries .
The image of Palic has permanently been changing , improving and modernising , although it avoided the temptation of industrialisation .
The two architects , Komor and Jakab , who left a permanent impression on the architecture of the city , also designed remarkable buildings in Palic as well , and these were also built in Hungarian art nouveau and dominated by woodcarvings inspired by folk handicrafts .
The Water Tower , now the symbol of Palic , was built at the beginning of the 20th century as a multipurpose facility : a water tower , gate of the resort and a tram station .
The construction of the Grand Terrace ended in 1911 and at that time it was also used as a multipurpose facility ( confectionery , restaurant , while the upstairs premises were intended for entertainment and balls ) .
Two open terraces embellish the front of the building and they are decorated by magnificently carved parapet .
Right in front of the Grand Terrace is the tiniest art nouveau style , special purpose facility , the Musical Pavillion , which , in the spirit of time , used to be a venue for promenade concerts .
A memorial fountain was erected in the honour of the completion of constructions in the city and Palic , which perfectly fit in the newly created atmosphere of the promenade in front of the Grand Terrace and the Musical Pavilion on the lake front .
The Women ’s Beach is another magnificent example of art nouveau style buildings .
The colourful resort houses - villas round up the Palic image .
Villa Lujza was built in eclectic style and Bagolyvár ( an interesting name for an interesting building : “ the owl ’s castle ) are “ Swiss - type ” villas , and their roofs are covered with multicoloured plain tiles made by the Zsolnay Manufacture .
In the heart of the Grand Park there is specific facility , the Summer Stage , where the Palic International Film Festival is held every summer .
The Palic Summer Stage hidden in the shade of the Grand Park 's hundred year old trees opens its gates to the Palic International Film Festival during the third week of July .
This Festival is dedicated to the promotion of the most recent productions in the European filmmaking and is accompanied with various programmes .
Last Updated on 26th February 2020
I travel a lot and when away there are two main Internet sites that cheer me up without fail – BBC IPlayer and Pandora .
Unfortunately it can be difficult to both watch BBC iPlayer abroad and Pandora outside the US are actually quite tricky because they will only work with a UK or US workstation respectively .
Fortunately because I always surf through a secure proxy on the Identity Cloaker network , this does n’t really matter to me as my location is defined by whichever proxy I am surfing through .
So I simply select a UK server for watching it ’s kind of a BBC IPlayer proxy .
Identity Cloaker is the most sophisticated security software on the internet , it allows you to surf completely protected via a network of private proxies across the planet .
These are fast , secure properly run proxy servers not the free slow ones infested with viruses that people normally try to use !!
You might have also seen the dedicated VPN , smart dns and proxy servers promoted for unblocking bbc iplayer or other online TV stations – they are very often simply a single server set up quickly .
Why ?
Simply because when the BBC legal department threaten them ( which they usually do ) , they end up disappearing suddenly .
So when I am in Turkey and want to watch – I simply connect via one of the UK proxies and watch BBC iPlayer , if I want to listen to Pandora outside the US I just select one of the US proxies .
It does n’t matter where I am as long as I have a working internet connection , because it ’s encrypted I can watch from anywhere .
The same goes for a TV channels in lots of other countries as they have Australian , Canadian , German , French , Irish and a host of other proxy servers to watch in addition to the huge number of UK servers .
Anyway I have made this rather bad video to illustrate how I access the BBC iPlayer abroad .
I ’m afraid I do n’t do the ease of this any justice with my video though , the best thing about the Identity Cloaker to access these programs is the huge choice of proxies and their speed .
If you ’ve ever tried using iPlayer through a slow proxy or VPN then you ’ll realise how painful it can be .
Using a BBC iPlayer Proxy with Identity Cloaker
I ’ve never used the video software before so apologies for the amateurish video editing .
I just wanted to make sure people were able to see how easy it is to use this security software .
There are dedicated services for just watching BBC iPlayer that cost well over twice the price of Identity Cloaker , they offer just a single proxy server to do this – Identity Cloaker has proxies all over the planet and dedicated software to control and protect your connection , from an icon in your taskbar .
It takes a minute or so to install and then you just point and click .
It is actually a fundamental point of using a proxy abroad , your IP address defines who you are and what you can see .
So if you surf via a UK proxy this is how any web server you visit will see you also exactly the same as a UK Internet surfer .
Because Identity Cloaker has fast proxies in lots of other countries you can use it to access similar restricted broadcasts in Sweden , Germany , France , Canada , US and many others .
If you like music try Pandora for an awesome US only radio station – just select the right countries proxy and you ’ll be away .
Of course you used to be able to sample this method by using a free proxy .
Do n’t try this out now though as it has n’t worked from about 2014 .
You need something that ’s hidden from the BBC , even many popular VPNs do n’t work anymore .
Identity Cloaker is one of the few VPN / proxy services that has consistently been working with the BBC , I personally have been using it since 2008 !
So can you use BBC iPlayer anywhere ?
Pretty much , as long as you pick one the UK proxies , it manages your connection in the background and encrypts you connection .
You can even run it from a USB stick if you remember to take your login details with you , watch it through firewalls and when countries try to censor what you watch .
If you travel a lot it also means you can access lots of other sites which have country restrictions stopping you watching the BBC IPlayer abroad .
For instance I can access UK poker and casino sites from the States who would normally block an American IP address , Turkey often block Youtube and social networking sites but Identity Cloaker users just bypass this .
Anyway I ’m off to Turkey in a few weeks and I ’ll be keeping up with all the latest BBC programs watching BBC IPlayer outside the uk via Identity Cloaker .
In a few minutes you can be watching your favourite BBC shows through a safe , fast and secure proxy
If you like to watch or listen to any UK TV shows and you spend any amount of time abroad , you ’ll find it a fantastic investment .
The software is simple to work and you just pick a proxy to connect to and off you go , remember free proxies are very slow and many are full of viruses .
If you do manage to find a safe , fast free proxy server to watch the BBC Iplayer on , chances are it will be gone in a day or so .
The ability to watch media is not advertised on the web site but drop them a line if you want to check , the support staff are very responsive and will check out problems with any channels .
Unblocking BBC
iPlayer is straight forward as are most of the UK TV stations online .
Be very careful of companies who do advertise this TV facility openly through things like a smart dns proxy facility , they frequently disappear overnight , after legal threats from the media companies themselves i.e.
BBC , Hulu and ITV etc .
Why not treat yourself here :
With the Identity Cloaker trial to check it works – it ’s the ultimate BBC iPlayer proxy completely guaranteed and for the price of a coffee and sandwich you ’ll be impressed I ’m sure !

BRUSSELS , Dec. 16 ( Xinhua ) --
New car sales in Europe fell by 25.8 percent in November compared to the same month of last year , declining for the seventh month in a row , the European automakers association ACEA said on Tuesday .
It was the largest monthly drop since 1999 , which ACEA said should be blamed on the financial and economic crises .
Markets in Western Europe and the new European Union ( EU ) member states contracted at a similar pace , down by 26 percent and 22.6 percent respectively .
All national markets in Europe decreased except Finland , Poland and the Czech Republic .
In Western Europe , a total of 854,698 new passenger cars were registered in November .
The downturn hit all countries except Finland , ranging from 3.5 percent in Portugal to 55.9 percent in Ireland .
Markets in the new EU member states echoed the November drop recorded in Western Europe .
The central and eastern European markets had long showed more resilience , in relative terms , because of the greater number of first - time buyers as opposed to the replacement market of Western Europe .
Cumulatively from January to November , 13,788,256 new cars were registered in Europe , representing a 7.1 percent downturn .
Faced with shrinking consumption in the economic downturn and credit crunch in the wake of the financial crisis as well as stricter emission rules , the European car industry , like their U.S. rivals , came under distress in recent months .
In October , ACEA asked the EU for 40 billion euros ( about 55 billion U.S. dollars ) in loans to help the industry develop green technologies , which has not been accepted .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde , whose country holds the EU rotating presidency , called on Monday for action to save European car industry since the U.S. government is considering a massive bailout for its carmakers .
" We can not sit on our hands while others are doing things .
We should be concerned about what is going on the other side of the Atlantic , " Lagarde told the European Parliament in Strasbourg , France .
Easter is one of the most popular times of year for chocolate - makers and it has been revealed that despite the current economic downturn , confectionery sales in 2009 have continued to rise , with predictions of record sales this Easter .
Tony Bilsborough shows the BBC how they make the eggs at the Cadbury 's factory in Bournville , Birmingham .
So this is how badly Fox wants to develop new hit sitcoms : it is holding a script contest .
It is doing so for the second year in a row , actually .
In a partnership with the New York Television Festival , the network will solicit scripts from aspiring writers , with the promise of a development deal for the winner .
On Monday the festival is expected to announce that a production company is also participating in the contest this year , making it more likely that the winning idea will make it from script to screen .
The four - year - old festival , held each September , tries to replicate the independent film festival circuit for small screen content creators .
Fox and other networks are sponsors of the event .
Not a jury in the world would convict her .
Think about it .
This is why celebrities are coming up with names like Apple , Tweetie , and Moxie Crimefighter .
They ’ll be plenty Googleable .
One of the best things on here .
Best on here I can think of in the last dozen years .
* EU to honour pledge to poor nations - environment chief
* Rich regions must clarify ambitions , he says
* Concern over progress at climate talks in Copenhagen
BRUSSELS , March 20 ( Reuters ) -
The European Union will surmount internal disputes and honour pledges to help poor states tackle climate change , the bloc 's environment chief said on Friday , urging other rich regions to make clear their goals .
The call by Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas echoed a warning this week by United Nations climate chief Yvo de Boer , who expressed concern over the slow progress being made before climate talks in Copenhagen in December .
Success at the meeting hinges on whether rich nations can agree a fund worth tens of billions of dollars annually to persuade poor countries to tackle the problem .
The EU promised to do its fair share , but Dimas told Reuters that it could move no further until other rich nations spell out their targets for cutting global warming gases .
" It is obvious that in order to calculate the amount of funding for our contribution , we need to know what other developed countries will do , " Dimas said in an interview .
" Japan has announced they will come up with a number in June .
I hope it will be earlier .
In the United States there is still a shaping - up of policy , " he said .
U.S. President Barack Obama will visit Europe in early April and EU officials hope the trip could yield insight on his plans .
The EU aims to lead the battle against climate change after last year agreeing to cut carbon emissions by about 20 percent by 2020 -- the world 's most ambitious target so far .
But Poland said on Friday it had won " full influence " on any EU funding plan , suggesting it had the right to veto if it looked too costly in a climate of economic and financial crisis .
However EU leaders in Brussels stood by their commitment to help poor countries cut emissions and to adapt : " The European Union will take on its fair share of financing such actions in developing countries , " they said in a final statement .
Developing nations blame industrialised regions like Europe for climate change and say they need financial help adapting to its impact , with investments in drought - or flood - resistant crops , or helping build barriers to rising sea levels .
Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk said informal discussions had so far focused on an annual EU contribution of between 20 billion euros and 40 billion to developing nations by 2020 , and Dimas said that estimate was not far off the mark .
The EU will decide by late 2009 how member states will carve up the financial burden amongst themselves , said Polish European Affairs Minister Mikolaj Dowgielewicz .
" Poland will have full influence on the Union 's decisions , " he added , suggesting Warsaw had negotiated veto powers .
But Dimas said the concerns of Europe 's poorer states would be addressed just as they were during tough EU negotiations last year to clinch a deal on the emission - cutting target .
" We are going to find a solution , " he said .
" We will be guided by the principle that whatever we do is equitable and fair for all countries . "
But he said Europe would struggle to make any further progress on agreeing funding for the developing world without other rich nations revealing their mid-term emissions targets .
" We do move ahead of everybody else ... but we expect opinions and ideas from other countries -- the earlier they do so the better , " he said .

Meditation Driven Development
In the beginning
Tim is a veteran programmer .
He works at a world renowned software company .
Despite this , in his long career he has seen many projects fail and only a few succeed .
After 15 years developing software , he decides he wants to get out of the trenches and start managing projects .
He 's tired of seeing projects fail for entirely preventable reasons .
He realises that the only way to fix these things is to be the guy who makes the decisions on these wayward projects .
Tim , like most developers , is quite a eccentric man .
He is an open source enthusiast and he has written a great variety of open - source software .
Before writing any code on his projects , he usually spends an hour doing yoga followed by intense meditation .
After doing his meditation he finds that he writes cleaner , better designed code .
One day , he is meditating when it strikes him : " Maybe this is the solution to the software crisis , everyone needs to meditate before they write a line of code . "
Meditation Driven Development ( MDD ) was born .
Tim goes to work and tells his team about his new methodology .
Being good friends of Tim they decide to give it a try !
Tim waits patiently for a project that he can try it out on .
The first project
It 's day one of the implementation phase of the project .
Tim rides his bicycle to work with extra-gumption .
" Today will be the start of something great , " he says to himself .
It 's 9 AM and it 's time of the first team meeting .
Tim asks everyone to sit around on the floor in a circle and reflect deeply on a particular passage from the Bible .
At first , his team are uncomfortable .
They 're unsure of what to do , but under Tim 's careful direction he manages to get a result .
His team manages a 45 minute meditation and afterwards they 're energized and ready to write great code .
Tim mandates that all the team members must meditate twice a day , once when they come to work and once when they return from lunch .
Each meditation session will be no shorter than 45 minutes long .
This will be done without fail , every single day of the project .
The project was scheduled to last three months but Tim 's team was done two weeks early .
Not only that , his team 's software contained 20 % fewer bugs than the company average .
Tim concluded that MDD must have been responsible .
" MDD WORKS , " Tim exclaimed !
Spreading the gospel
Given his early successes , Tim decides to roll out MDD across all his projects .
His early successes were repeated .
His boss is impressed and asks why he thinks his projects are enjoying so much success .
For Tim , the answer is obvious : " MDD .
MDD allows us to produce higher quality software , to budget , on time . "
Tim convinces his boss that the whole company should use MDD .
Tim sends out his disciples to other teams to convert them to MDD .
Slowly but surely his company converts to MDD .
Tim realises that other people could benefit from MDD , so he makes a deal with O'Reilly and writes his transformational book , " Meditation Driven Development -
The way to cheaper , more reliable software . "
The initial reaction is positive .
Before long , a line of people are queueing up at Tim 's door to get in on on the new MDD craze sweeping the industry .
The MDD Manifesto
A year or two after Tim 's book on MDD , it was clear that MDD was being misapplied in some companies .
Some teams were having trouble making MDD work in their company .
Some people were not following the strictures of the book correctly .
They were having 20 minute meditations instead of the mandated minimum of 45 and they were only having one of these per day !
Tim exclaimed , " How could they possibly expect the methodology to work when they 're only doing one meditation per day ! ? "
Something needed to be done .
By this point MDD had fractured in to a series of closely related but slightly different methodologies .
Some preferred to meditate to music , other liked to meditate on the words of famous poems .
Others preferred four shorter sessions per day instead of the original two .
The differences mattered less than the similarities .
As long as there was an hour and a half of meditation per day , every day , it was MDD .
Tim and his disciples sat down and bashed out a manifesto that bound these various strains of MDD under a common political philosophy .
They vowed to take forth the central message of MDD and transform the industry .
MDD becomes mainstream
It 's now nearly a decade after Tim wrote his transformational book .
Once a year he keynotes at " MDD - con " in San Diego .
He has released a series of books on the subject and makes a substantial amount of money in consulting on everything and anything related to MDD .
MDD is now an established cottage - industry with a series of satellite conferences spanning the globe .
It 's now so popular that even the pointiest of pointy - haired bosses is starting to hear about it .
Yet , all is not well in the MDD community .
Ordinary companies are having real trouble getting the benefits of MDD .
Projects are still late , expensive and buggy .
Tim 's career has become a continual fire - fight .
His consultancy gigs are no longer about getting people to adopt MDD but are about fixing problems in projects that already use MDD !
MDD fifteen years on
It is now over fifteen years since Tim wrote his award winning book .
MDD is now thoroughly mainstream and used by a huge variety of teams .
Despite Tim 's initial success , MDD projects on average tend to be late , over - budget and low quality .
Tim still extols the merits of MDD but he finds dissatisfaction wherever he goes .
A whole generation of programmers has now grown up with MDD and they 're disillusioned by failed project after failed project .
Tim can't understand why people were having such a bad time with MDD .
He just knows that MDD works !
He 's seen it with his own eyes !
In his own mind , he concludes that the problem must be that nobody is doing it right !
One day , Tim comes across a team led by a bright - eyed manager called Cathy .
Cathy 's projects are on time , to budget and much less buggy than the company average .
Cathy was a developer for fifteen years and has only recently become a manager .
Tim is suitably impressed by her success , he asks her what her secret is :
" It 's our new methodology , QDD .
QDD allows us to produce higher quality software , to budget , on time .
It 's going to transform our industry . "
Afterword
Why did MDD work at first and then fail when it became mainstream ?
The reason that MDD worked initially had nothing to do with strictures of MDD .
Tim was a talented developer working in a company filled with talented developers .
Pretty much any methodology you care to think of was going to work with these people .
Moreover ,
Tim 's initial team were the earliest of early adopters hand - picked by Tim himself .
They were the very people that would develop high quality software naturally anyway .
The only role the MDD had was in helping the team to gel , and once they had they looked like an impossibly productive team .
Tim misidentified the source of this productivity as being the result of his methodology , rather than his competence of himself and his team .
As MDD became more widely used , the average quality of the developers using the methodology dropped and so did the success rate of using MDD .
By the time it was used by the average team , MDD got average results .
I 'll close with a quote from one of the greats of our field , Robert Glass :
People matter in building software .
That 's the message of this particular fact .
Tools matter .
Techniques also matter .
Process , yet again , matters .
But head and shoulders above all those other things that matter are people .
This message is as old as the software field itself .
It has emerged from , and appears in , so many software research studies and position papers over the years that , by now , it should be one of the most important software " eternal truths . "
Yet we in the software field keep forgetting it .
We advocate process as the be-all and end - all of software development .
We promote tools as breakthroughs in our ability to create software .
We aggregate miscellaneous collections of techniques , call that aggregate a methodology , and insist that thousands of programmers read about it , take classes in it , have their noses rubbed in it through drill and practice , and then employ it on high - profile projects .
All in the name of tools / techniques / process over people .
Do n't fall in to Tim 's trap .
Great developers create great software not because they follow the strictures of some methodology but because they are truly great , gifted artisans .

Rice gave early ' waterboarding green light '
Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday April 23 , 2009

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The CIA first sought in May 2002 to use harsh interrogation techniques including waterboarding on terror suspects , and was given key early approval by then - national security adviser Condoleezza Rice , a US Senate intelligence document said .
The agency got the green light to use the near - drowning technique on July 26 , 2002 , when attorney general John Ashcroft concluded " that the use of waterboarding was lawful , " the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a detailed timeline of the " war on terrorism " interrogations released Wednesday .
Nine days earlier , the panel said , citing Central Intelligence Agency records , Rice had met with then - director George Tenet and " advised that the CIA could proceed with its proposed interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , " the agency 's first high - value Al - Qaeda detainee , pending Justice Department approval .
Rice 's nod is believed to be the earliest known approval by a senior official in the administration of George W. Bush of the intelligence technique which current Attorney General Eric Holder has decried as " torture . "
The Senate panel narrative is the most comprehensive declassified chronology to date of the Bush administration 's support for the highly controversial tactics .
According to the Senate narrative , Rice was among at least half a dozen top Bush officials , including vice president Dick Cheney , who were in 2002 or 2003 debating , approving or reaffirming the legality of the interrogation practices used on Zubaydah and two other terror suspects .
After a July 2003 meeting in which Tenet briefed Rice , Cheney , Ashcroft , then White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and others on the use of waterboarding and other interrogation methods , " the principals reaffirmed that the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration policy , " according to the panel report .
The revelations come amid a raging controversy over whether President Barack Obama would seek prosecutions of Bush officials who devised legal cover for the interrogation tactics .
Last week Obama blew the lid on harsh CIA terror interrogations approved by Bush by releasing four so - called " torture memos " prepared by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel that detailed the tactics , including waterboarding as well as the use of insects and sleep deprivation .
Obama said operatives who carried out the interrogations would not be prosecuted , saying they acted on orders and were defending their country .
The CIA had asked to be able to waterboard Zubaydah , a Saudi - born Palestinian whose real name is Zayn Al Abidin Muhammad Husayn , fearing he was withholding information about " imminent " terrorist attacks , the panel said .
The committee did not wade into the growing controversy over whether so - called " enhanced interrogation " methods used on Zubaydah -- who was waterboarded 83 times in August 2002 -- yielded solid information .
US forces captured Zubaydah in a late March 2002 firefight in Pakistan , tended to his serious injuries , and began to question him , according to the timeline .
The agency asked senior officials in Washington , including Rice , in mid-May 2002 to discuss the possibility of using methods , including waterboarding , that were rougher than traditional interrogation methods .
The CIA made the request because it " believed that Abu Zubaydah was withholding imminent threat information during the initial interrogation sessions . "
The US Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel orally advised the CIA on July 26 , 2002 , " that the use of waterboarding was lawful , " a finding it put in writing on August 1 , 2002 , the timeline said .
A US congressman , Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , spoke out Thursday in an opinion piece against Obama 's decision to release details of the enhanced interrogation techniques , saying " members of Congress from both parties have been fully aware of them since the program began in 2002 . "
" We believed it was something that had to be done in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks ( of 2001 ) to keep our nation safe , " Republican Hoekstra wrote in The Wall Street Journal .
" After many long and contentious debates , Congress repeatedly approved and funded this program on a bipartisan basis in both Republican and Democratic Congresses . "

According to major news sources more than fifty percent of Americans are mired in debt .
If you are one of those people then the very best thing you can do for yourself is get out of debt and start building your personal wealth .
The benefits are obvious .
When you eliminate your debt your paycheck becomes your own .
When you eliminate your debt your life becomes your own .
Using the snowball method to compound the principle will help you achieve this goal .
You can start right now , but if your spending is out of control or if you have not created and held fast to a budget it will be much harder to successfully complete .
I would suggest that you first read and apply How To Take Control of Your Spending .
After you have done that , you will want to read about and create a budget .
This article will get you on your way : How To Set Up A Personal Budget .
Things You Will Need
All your debts showing minimum payments and current balance
A Spreadsheet for Record Keeping
Tip : Clicking an image will enlarge it so you can see the example screenshots
Step 1
Make a list of all your debts .
For this article your debts are anything that you owe money on , will have an effect on your credit report , and lists a minimum required payment .
On this list you need to list who you owe , how much the minimum payment is , and about how long it will take you pay it off .
Exact payoff time is only an estimate since interest often accrues daily .
But , a general figure will be sufficient .
Step 2
Sort the list so that the shortest payoff is number one and the longest is the last on the list .
We are going to attack this list by killing each debt one at a time .
Your creditors use the power of compound interest against you .
We are going to use the snowball method and the power of compound principal against them .
Step 3
On the first of the month begin to put the snowball method into action .
You will pay every payments minimum payment only , except the top one .
For now you are going to cut your discretionary funds by about half .
Add that half to the number one payment .
By doing this , you are taking a chunk of principal of the debt .
The next month when they compute how much to charge you in interest they will have X number of dollars less on the principal to levy that interest on .
Let 's look at the math so you can see it clearly .
January Balance Due : $ 100.00 Minimum Payment : $ 5.00 You Paid $ 8.00
That extra three dollars must come off the principle balance of $ 100 .
Your interest is computed first , and virtually all your 5.00 minimum is interest .
This way they keep the principle high and can charge nearly the same amount of interest next month .
Your 3.00 just maxed their principle to 97.00 .
So your next 5.00 will have slightly more going to principle than it had this month because the principle is reduced by a minimum of 3.00 .
Each month you will pay all your minimums , and you will add however much you can afford to the payment of that top debt .
When that debt is cleared you will have won the first battle in the war using the compound principle .
Step 4
When the first debt is cleared , move it from the active debts portion your list .
Now take the minimum payment from that paid off debt , in this case 3.00 , and add it to the minimum payment of the next debt on the list .
You are now using the snowball method and the compound principle to your own benefit .
Take a look at the picture and you will see it in action .
The picture illustrates simple math from one payment .
The fact is that the progression is n't linear .
It is a very steep hill , hence the name snowball method .
Your payoff will reduce itself far faster than simple math can illustrate here .
Repeat step four until the second debt is paid off .
Then apply the minimum payments from debt one and debt two to the minimum for debt three .
Your snowball is getting larger .
If you keep this up , we 'll have to change the title from the snowball method to the avalanche method .
Compounding the principle works .
And you can compound the principle all the way up to paying your mortgage off if you desire .
Tips & Warnings
The compound principle used in the snowball method works best when you are able to double or triple your minimum payment .
If you can reduce your spending to add more money to the snowball , or even take a second job , the snowball method will work far faster than this simple article illustrates .

Pakistan 's top judge has called for a court hearing into the public flogging of a teenage girl , which was captured on video and shown around the world .
Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has ordered police and government officials from the north - western Swat Valley to bring the girl to court next week .
The film shows apparent Taleban members holding her down and hitting her with a strap as she cries out in pain .
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned the incident as " shameful " .
Local sources said the girl had been accused of illicit relations with a man and that the flogging took place about a month and a half ago .
Since then , the provincial government in the North West Frontier Province agreed to implement Sharia law as part of a peace deal with militants there .
A press release quoted Chief Justice Chaudhry - who was only recently restored to office - as saying the action was a cruel violation of fundamental rights that gave Pakistan a bad name .
Forced to marry
The language in the video is of the Swati dialect of Pashto , says the BBC's Abdul Hai Kakar .
The burka - clad woman is heard crying throughout the two - minute flogging and at one point swears on her father that she will not do it again .
Relatives of the man involved in the incident told the BBC he had gone to the house of the girl in the village of Kala Kalay to do repairs as an electrician , but militants accused him of having a relationship with her .
They dragged him from the house and flogged him before punishing the girl , his relatives said .
The Taleban made the girl 's brother hold her down during the flogging , they said .
After the incident , the Taleban forced the couple to marry and instructed the man not to divorce his wife .
His relatives say he has been left mentally scarred .
The incident happened weeks before the new Sharia courts began to be introduced in Swat .
Militants ' still in control '
Prime Minister Gilani said he strongly condemned the " shameful " incident in a statement issued by his office .
Mr Gilani said it was contrary to Islamic principles , which teach Muslims to treat women politely and gently .
He said the government believed in the rights of women and would continue to take every measure to protect their rights .
The Sharia system was agreed in Swat to try to stop the Taleban from imposing their harsh brand of justice , the BBC's Islamabad correspondent Barbara Plett says .
Previously they had beheaded dissidents and killed women accused of un-Islamic behaviour .
That seems to have significantly decreased after the Taleban leader officially accepted the Islamic courts .
However , it is not clear whether this new justice system will replace Taleban rule in practice .
The courts seem to be operating with some effect in Swat 's main city of Mingora but not in outlying rural areas .
There witnesses say the militants continue to exercise control , if not as brutally as before .

Obama administration : Guantanamo detainees have ' no constitutional rights '
Joe Byrne
Published : Sunday March 15 , 2009
Print This Email This Court documents filed Friday reveal that Obama 's lawyers are arguing that Ex-Guantanamo detainees have no constitutional rights .
The Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , a non-profit legal advocacy group , is supporting four British citizens - Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal , Rhuhel Ahmed and Jamal al Harith  in their suit alleging religious mistreatment and torture at Guantanamo Bay .
Defendants in the case include Donald Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard Myers , the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The four men say that they were beaten , shackled in painful stress positions , threatened by dogs and subjected to extreme medical care ,  according to the Miami Herald .
In addition , they reported being forced to shave their beards , being banned from prayer , being denied prayer mats , and watching a copy of the Koran get tossed in the toilet .
Last year , the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal in D.C. voted unanimously against the 4 ex-detainees .
The Appeals Court claimed that the men did not fit the definition of ' person ' in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , because they were foreigners being held outside the United States .
Months later , the Supreme Court instructed the Appeals Court to reconsider their decision , based on a Supreme Court ruling that Guantanamo detainees have some rights under the constitution .
On Friday , the CCR re-filed their brief in the D.C. Court of Appeal .
Obama 's justice department is using an old strategy employed by the Bush administration .
Their primary argument is that Ex - Guantanamo detainees do n't have any constitutional rights .
Even if they did , the brief continues , Rumsfeld and other officers should be immune from prosecution because detainees  right not to be tortured and to practice their religion without abuse was not clearly established  at the time of their detention .
The Obama administration supports the earlier decision by the Appeals Court that the ex-detainees do not have constitutional person - hood .
The case should be dismissed because of special factors involving national security and foreign policy ,  the government 's brief concludes .
However , it has long been established that there is an irreducible constitutional minimum that government officials owe to human beings under their control  whether citizen or alien  that necessarily includes the prohibition of torture ,  the plaintiff 's brief contends .
CCR is disappointed the new administration squandered this opportunity to separate themselves from the policies of the past and to speak with moral force about torture and religious freedom ,  said Michael Ratner , president of the organization .
Obama has decided to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by 2010 .
On the same day as the ex-detainee 's brief was filed , the White House dropped the term ' enemy combatant ' from legal documents .
The assertion that ex-detainees have no constitutional rights is a problem for non-citizens being detained outside of U.S. borders , who worry that this case will set precedent and enable the military to legally disobey the constitution .

Want a 2,200 % return on capital ?
Hire big shot Capitol Hill lobbyists and let them do their thing .
A study reported in the Washington Post Sunday says companies that hire lobbyists see $ 220 in revenue for every $ 1 it costs them .
University of Kansas professors looked at the impact of a one - time tax break that let multinationals " repatriate " profits earned overseas , cutting their tax rate from 35 percent to 5.25 percent .
The over 800 companies that got in on the deal saved an estimated $ 100 billion in the process .
The Post says :
“ The largest recipients of tax breaks were concentrated in the pharmaceutical and technology fields , including Pfizer , Merck , Hewlett Packard , Johnson & Johnson and IBM .
Pfizer alone repatriated $ 37 billion , representing 70 percent of its revenue in 2004 , the study found .
The now - beleaguered financial industry also benefited from the provision , including Citigroup , J.P. Morgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch , all of which have since received tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout money . ”

A reader writes :
I had not even considered that for some reason , but later that night my son dropped by and I asked him if he could get us a little since all my connections were gone .
That evening , when my wife came out of the bathroom after throwing up for the sixth time that day , I suggested she try it .
She had never been a pot smoker .
( Those few times she had tired it , it tended to make her sleepy .
So she would have a Margarita when we were relaxing at home alone . )
The effect was immediate and dramatic .
Not only was she not throwing up any more , she got a bit of her appetite back .
And the little aches and pains from the steroids went away too .
I 'll never forget that night because I took a couple of hits too .
( I told her that I had to test it .
She said if I use that logic I should test the chemo too .
HA !!!)
We laughed and giggled like kids .
And we talked about things that she had not been able to talk about before .
Like her regret of not going to see the grandkids grow up .
And that she was going to leave me alone .
I made us some hot chocolate and we talked well into the night .
After we had gone to bed I woke up to find her head laying on my chest and her looking up at me .
She asked if we could smoke a little more and talk .
I 'll tell you Andrew , I almost started crying .
She had been so closed off since the doctor told her she had cancer .
We had quite a few more evenings like that .
I honestly do n't think she would have lasted the two months that she did if she had not used the pot .
She used it for the last two months that she lived and was no longer apprehensive when going for her chemo .
She even put on some weight .
And she start sleeping through the night .
I can tell you without any doubt that her life , and our relationship , was good for those two months .
It will be two years April 18th .
I miss her terribly but I am so glad we had those evenings of smoking pot and talking about the inevitable .
26 years of marriage is a long time .
Those evenings made us stronger .
I sincerely hope you and Aaron have the kind of marriage we did , Andrew .
Keuppia levante , one of three new species of 95 million - year - old octopuses .
Octopus fossils are among the rarest and unlikeliest of fossils .
It 's hard enough to find fossils of hard things like dinosaur bones .
Now scientists have found evidence of 95 million - year - old octopuses , among the rarest and unlikeliest of fossils , complete with ink and suckers .
The body of an octopus is composed almost entirely of muscle and skin .
When an octopus dies , it quickly decays and liquefies into a slimy blob .
After just a few days there will be nothing left at all .
And that assumes that the fresh carcass is not consumed almost immediately by scavengers .
The result is that preservation of an octopus as a fossil is about as unlikely as finding a fossil sneeze , and none of the 200 to 300 species of octopus known today had ever been found in fossilized form , said Dirk Fuchs of the Freie University Berlin , lead author of the report .
Fuchs and his colleagues now have identified three new species of octopuses ( Styletoctopus annae , Keuppia hyperbolaris and Keuppia levante ) based on five specimens discovered in Cretaceous Period rocks in Lebanon .
The specimens , described in the January 2009 issue of the journal Palaeontology , preserve the octopuses ' eight arms with traces of muscles and rows of suckers .
Even traces of the ink and internal gills are present in some specimens .
" The luck was that the corpse landed untouched on the sea floor , " Fuchs told LiveScience .
" The sea floor was free of oxygen and therefore free of scavengers .
Both the anoxy [ absence of oxygen ] and a rapid sedimentation rate prevented decay . "
Prior to this discovery only a single fossil species was known , and from fewer specimens than octopuses have legs , Fuchs said .
What most surprised Fuchs and his colleagues Giacomo Bracchi and Robert Weis was how similar the specimens are to modern octopus .
" These things are 95 million years old , yet one of the fossils is almost indistinguishable from living species , " Fuchs said .
This provides important evolutionary information , revealing much earlier origins of modern octopuses and their characteristic eight - legged body - plan , Fuchs said .
Unlike vertebrate animals , octopuses lack a well - developed skeleton , which allows them to squeeze into spaces that a more robust animal could not .
" The more primitive relatives of octopuses had fleshy fins along their bodies .
The new fossils are so well preserved that they show , like living octopus , that they did n't have these structures , " Fuchs said .
This insight pushes back the origins of the modern octopus by tens of millions of years , he said .

In What if 4E was open ? , I discussed the business possibilities available to Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro via opening up the licensing for Dungeons & Dragons , 4th Edition .
It was an idea that basically picked up where 6D6 Fireball ’s own
What if 4e was free ?
left off .
The core premise of What if 4e was free ?
was essentially that , if you were in charge of 4E business strategy :
The best possible thing that you can do is give away ALL the 4e books as free , black & white only , PDFs .
The point of this would be that the availability of core books as free PDFs would serve as part of a loss leader marketing strategy .
Loss leaders are things that are given away for free , or at least sold for below cost , because the losses can be made up via some related revenue stream that gains extra customers thanks to the loss leader .
In short , a loss leader is what you get when you turn something that is traditionally a product into a marketing tool .
It may seem like a counterintuitive move for a for - profit business to make , but it actually makes perfect sense when you break everything down to a comparison of costs vs. revenue .
Television commercials , booths at conventions , and advertising brochures all typically end up costing any but the very largest company a noticeable chunk of its marketing budget , and giving away a product as a loss leader is no different in this respect .
Television commercials , booths at conventions , and advertising brochures all help to build awareness of , and interest in , revenue generating products and services ; loss leaders are no different in this respect , either .
Calculating the relative value of the costs for marketing efforts ( including loss leaders ) , lost revenues for loss leaders that could otherwise have generated their own profits , and the long - term profit boosts for other revenue streams that are gained through those marketing efforts is what makes the difference between one marketing strategy and another .
Any time a potential marketing strategy yields benefits that exceed its costs significantly , it ’s worth considering , and there ’s a decent chance that in the long run the loss leader strategy proposed by 6D6 Fireball would meet those criteria , especially when WotC / Hasbro has already done so much to damage its image in the RPG industry in the last year or so .
In What if 4E was open ?
I discussed the idea of making 4E open , rather than free ; of opening up the licensing , as an alternative to giving the core game away for free .
Overall , I think this would generate a greater quantity of goodwill and word of mouth marketing amongst players .
Even if , in direct consequence of such a strategy , it only matched the goodwill and popularity that could be generated by free distribution without open licensing , it would generate far greater marketing benefits by way of ensuring that third - party publishers had a way to generate their own profits by effectively marketing D&D for WotC / Hasbro , free of charge .
WotC / Hasbro has decided to take a different approach , however .
Instead of building further goodwill with both players and third - party publishers , it has continued its current trend of pissing off everyone it possibly can .
As if the obviously punitive , anticompetitive intent of the 4E GSL were not off - putting enough , WotC has demanded that all third - party distributors of WotC PDFs cease selling them .
The first I heard of it was when my SigO told me this morning she had gotten an email from Paizo ( publishers of the upcoming Pathfinder RPG , already available as a free beta test PDF ) announcing the cessation of WotC PDF sales in the company ’s online store .
Of course , I got the same email , so when I checked my email this morning I got the following message from Paizo myself :
Dear Chad , Wizards of the Coast has notified us that we may no longer sell or distribute their PDF products .
Accordingly , after April 6 at 11:59 PM
Pacific time , Wizards of the Coast PDFs will no longer be available for purchase on paizo.com ; after noon on April 7 , you will no longer be able to download Wizards of the Coast PDFs that you have already purchased , so please make sure you have downloaded all purchased PDFs by that time .
We thank you for your patronage of paizo.com .
Please check out our other downloads at paizo.com / store / downloads .
Sincerely yours ,
The Paizo Customer Service Team
( Meanwhile , Paizo will continue offering free PDF downloads of the beta test version of Pathfinder RPG , at least until the final release version becomes available this August — and after that point , it ’ll still be licensed under the terms of the OGL , and they ’ve stated they ’ll offer an SRD containing all OGL materials from the core game for free , too .
It ’s paying off for Paizo , which has seen sales rate increases and huge increases in goodwill amongst gamers , building a loyal community of fans . )
This is a very puzzling move by the purveyors of the D&D brand , from the perspective of someone looking for the good business sense in it .
WotC / Hasbro derived nontrivial profits from PDF sales through third party distributors , and because of the lower price to players for PDFs as opposed to hardcopy books , at least some minimal part of the sort of benefit proposed at 6D6 Fireball could be had .
James Mishler at Adventures in Gaming addressed this move by WotC in Wizards cuts OBS Loose ?!?.
In comments , someone named Scott reveals that “ A WotC rep has posted on their forum that the change is a response to illegal file sharing . ”
In another comment , Jeff Rients ( yes , that Jeff Rients , of the much ballyhooed Threefold Model of gaming ) succinctly summed up the stupidity of such a move in two sentences :
So in response to piracy they ’re going to make sure the only way I can get a PDF copy is by piracy ?
That ’s pure fucking genius , right there .
In fact , the comments are the best part of the Adventures in Gaming posting , and worth reading , because of the demonstration of the effect WotC / Hasbro ’s actions are having on its popularity amongst gamers and game developers among other reasons .
Jeff Rients has his own Weblog post about this move by WotC / Hasbro and its “ piracy ” reasoning , titled It ’s a visceral reaction .
It ’s short and sweet — and I ’m coincidentally wearing a t - shirt with that picture on it right now .
It ’s a very appropriate picture , considering Johnny Cash ( the angry gentleman in the photo ) used it as a billboard ad campaign for his independent label , and the gesture was aimed at the major players in the record industry who ( like WotC / Hasbro ) set out to punish all customers for supposed transgressions by a few , to screw over symbiotic businesses , and to really hose its content producers .
I ’ll close this with a quote from Bandit Country ’s Who Owns ? , yet another reaction to WotC / Hasbro ’s latest antisocial move :
A number of connected issues have come to the fore .
At what point does the game you play become your own ?
Where is the transition from purchased ( or pirated ) product to private play ?
Who Owns ?
You do .
Game on , friends .
Do n’t let “ the man ” keep you down .
I saw this on the news last night and found quite a few articles online after that as well .
The Paldang Dam is located on the Han River and is the source of water for the capital area .
You can see it here :
View Larger Map
If you zoom out you can see that it 's located just to the east of the major urban area where Seoul and all its adjoining satellite cities are .
This dam supplies water to 24 million people ( so says the second article ) .
One article can be seen here , and another here ( both in Korean ) .
Here 's my translation of part of it :
Due to drought continuing from last year , the water quality of the Paldang Dam , the source of water for the capital region , has gotten much worse .
On the 9th the Environmental Ministry announced that the BOD ( biological oxygen demand ) of the water in the Paldang Dam as investigated in March had reached 2.4 mg per litre .
This is an increase of 0.8 mg over the 1.6 mg in February , and 1.4 mg more than the 1.0 mg in January .
This is also the highest monthly level reached since 1989 since monthly measurements began to be taken .
It is also quite bad compared to the average 1.6 mg average rate recorded from 2004 to 2008 .
A large influence for this worsening of water quality is the continuing drought that has continued since last autumn .
Precipitation has decreased a great deal along with entry volume into the river , and the flow of the river has slowed down ... during the winter the remaining fertilizer and excrement from livestock from farmland has been carried away with rainwater , increasing the pollution .
The Environmental Ministry says that in order to improve the water quality of the Paldang Dam it would strengthen basic facility management such as the sewage system and waste processing facilities .
By the way , over the past three days or so the weather has also gotten extremely warm , reaching highs of 24 or 25 each day .
Just a bit over a week ago it still felt a bit like winter .

HIV evolves mutations to counter the immune system HIV is evolving rapidly to escape the human immune system , an international study has shown .
The Nature study highlights just how tough it could be to develop a vaccine that keeps pace with the changing nature of the virus .
The researchers showed HIV was able to adapt rapidly to counter human genes controlling immune system molecules that can target it for destruction .
However , they stressed this would not affect the impact of anti-HIV drugs .
The implication is that once we have found an effective vaccine , it would need to be changed on a frequent basis to catch up with the evolving virus
Professor Philip Goulder
University of Oxford HIV has already killed 25 million people , and an estimated 33 million are currently infected .
However , HIV does not kill all people at the same rate .
On average , without treatment it takes 10 years for the infection to progress to Aids , but some people develop the disease within 12 months , while others do not do so for more than 20 years .
The rate of progress is tied to genes which control production of key immune system molecules called human leucocyte antigens ( HLAs ) .
Humans differ in the exact HLA genes they have , and even small differences can have a big impact on how quickly Aids develops .
The researchers examined HIV genetic sequences and HLA genes in over 2,800 people in countries , including the UK , Australia , South Africa , Canada and Japan .
' Escape ' mutations
They found mutations that enabled HIV effectively to neutralise the effect of a particular HLA gene were more frequent in populations with a high prevalence of that specific gene .
For example , a HLA gene called B *51 is particularly effective at controlling HIV - unless the virus is carrying an " escape " mutation in its genetic make - up .
The researchers found that in Japan , where the B * 51 gene is common , two - thirds HIV - positive people without the gene carry HIV armed with the " escape " mutation .
In contrast , in the UK , where the gene is much less common , just 15 % - 25 % of this group of patients are infected with HIV which carries the same key mutation .
Lead researcher Professor Philip Goulder , of the University of Oxford , said similar effects were seen for every HLA gene examined .
He said : " This shows that HIV is extremely adept at adapting to the immune responses in human populations that are most effective at containing the virus .
" This is high speed evolution that we 're seeing in the space of just a couple of decades .
" The temptation is to see this as bad news , that these results mean the virus is winning the battle .
" That 's not necessarily the case .
It could equally be that as the virus changes , different immune responses come into play and are actually more effective .
" The implication is that once we have found an effective vaccine , it would need to be changed on a frequent basis to catch up with the evolving virus , much like we do today with the flu vaccine . "
Big challenge Jo Robinson , of the HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " HIV is a complex virus which is constantly changing .
" This kind of research suggests that if we 're able to create a vaccine that works against HIV , the virus will always be one step ahead .
" In that case we'd be in a situation where we need to constantly update the HIV vaccine , a bit like we see with a different flu vaccine each year . "
Keith Alcorn , of the HIV information service NAM , said : " These findings indicate the enormous challenge involved in developing a vaccine against HIV .
" People need to be aware that the research required to develop a successful vaccine may take decades , during which the virus will continue to evolve , as this research shows . "

When I saw the ad for ‘ Free Cleaner ’ on Glasgow ’s GumTree I thought that poor bugger has really been hit hard by the recession , they ’ll clean your house for free just for the chance to get paid work .
However , it turns out that this particular cleaner has an immense love for the job .
So much so that payment is not even wanted providing appropriate maid clothing can be worn .
But before those lonely red-blooded scottish blokes browsing GumTree think they ’ve hit the jackpot with a free maid they better read the small print :
‘ Marie ’ is so keen to get the job she has even posted a video which showcases a sample of her maid ‘ skills ’ .
Before the recession ‘ Marie ’ might have been able to charge for these valuable services .

They are : Sears , Bacardi U.S.A. Inc. , Westar Energy Inc. , Cracker Barrel Old Country Store , Williams Companies Inc. , the Questerra Corporation , Diversified Collection Services Inc. and Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care Inc .
Texas prosecutors say the investigation is continuing .
" What has emerged is the outline of an effort to use corporate contributions to control representative democracy in Texas , " said Ronald Earle , the district attorney in Travis County .
Mr. Earle , a Democrat , would not say whether Mr. DeLay was a target of the investigation .
" Anybody who has committed a crime in this context is a target , " he said .
In an interview earlier this year , Mr. Ellis said that he , Mr. DeLay and Mr. Colyandro had created Texans for a Republican Majority P.A.C. and that Mr. DeLay served on a five - member advisory board that decided which candidates to endorse .
Mozilla and Khronos Hook Up in 3D Graphics Initiative
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 25 , 2009
Mozilla and graphics consortium the Khronos Group have announced a far - reaching new initiative to bring accelerated 3D graphics to the web .
With many representatives from Khronos on hand at this week 's Game Developer 's Conference in San Francisco , the joint initiative is being discussed there .
As BBC News notes , " it could lead to widespread browser - based gaming as well as creating 3D environments in social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace . "
We 've written widely about how open source , 3D worlds , and 3D gaming are converging , including here , and here .
In a blog post , Mozilla 's Graphics Team Lead , Vladimir Vukicevic says :
“ Finally , people are doing more and more on the Web , and are coming to expect more from the applications that they use .
Web applications already have access to features that have traditionally been reserved for desktop apps , including being able to work while offline , storing data locally , multiple choices for 2D graphics , and native audio and video support .
Adding 3D to this mix ensures that current Web apps can experiment with new user experiences , while also enabling new classes of web applications . ”
Chris Blizzard , Mozilla ’s director of evangelism , adds that work done by Mozilla and Khronos will probably arrive in the release of Firefox that immediately follows the upcoming 3.5 release ( 3.5 is the new name for Firefox 3.1 ) :
“ This is a pretty big deal for us and for the web , and is really a reflection of the continued acceleration of open web technology well beyond just the classic HTML and JavaScript that we ’ve seen in the past .
“ It ’s our intention to include this as base functionality in the release after Firefox 3.5 , assuming all goes well on the standards front . ”
Mozilla and Khronos intend to develop a standard that would let developers use JavaScript to tap into powerful OpenGL graphics interface technology .
On the gaming front , this could allow users to play immersive 3D games directly through their browsers , without time - consuming downloads .
Extensions for games could also take off , just as Firefox extensions have , and I agree with BBC News that social networks such as Facebook and MySpace could start to see widespread use of 3D graphics .
The initiative could also make development speedier and easier for 3D worlds such as Second Life .
This is exactly the kind of next - generation browser technology that Mozilla should be focusing on .
New research suggests that campaigns to promote exercise may have an unintended consequence : they make people eat more .
In a study in the March issue of the journal Obesity , 53 college students were asked to judge a series of posters from an exercise campaign and , on another occasion , a group of similar - looking posters that did not mention exercise .
They were told they would be given a few raisins afterward , which they were to taste and rate .
After the students looked at the exercise posters , they ate an average of 18 calories , but they ate only 12 calories after viewing the posters with no mention of exercise .
In a second test , 51 different students , told they were participating in a computerized test of hand - eye coordination , were randomly assigned to be exposed to action words like “ active ” and “ go ” typically used in exercise advertising .
A control group was exposed to neutral words like “ pear ” or “ moon . ”
Again , they were offered food ( peanuts , raisins and M& M ’s this time ) , and the results were similar : those who had heard the action words ate more .
Dolores Albarracin , the lead author and a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois , said that context was important .
“ When the setting of the advertising is more conducive to eating than exercise , people eat , ” she said .
“ If you just wallpaper everyplace with these kinds of posters , it may not do much good . ”

I find that I have considerably more patience with the task of explaining the meaning of atheism and correcting misconceptions about it with religious believers than I do with other atheists .
I realize that may be unfair , but I suppose I expect that those calling themselves atheists will know what the term means .
Needless to say , such an expectation is an error on my part .
There is at least one serious and common misconception about the meaning of atheism , held by theists and atheists alike .
I have written several posts on the meaning of atheism , but they have resolved little .
The questions keep coming .
Odds are good that this post will not change this situation , and so this is unlikely to be the last time I find it necessary to address the meaning of atheism .
That does not mean it is not worth the effort though .
If those of us who identify ourselves as atheists cannot be clear on what atheism means , we have little reason to expect others to understand it .
Defining Atheism
In looking back over some of my previous posts on this subject , I daresay I said it clearly the first time I addressed it even though I may have diluted what I was attempting to communicate in the rest of the post .
Simply put , atheism means the absence of theistic belief .
That 's it .
It does n't mean anything else .
Atheism is not a religion , a philosophy , a worldview , or anything similar .
It is not the conviction that there are no gods , ghosts , angels , etc .
Rather , it is the absence of a belief that these things are real ... Atheism is nothing more than the lack of belief in a god or gods .
Reasons why people become atheists are varied and are some are useful for understanding atheists .
Some are more common than others , but they are not particularly relevant for understanding the meaning of atheism .
Again , an atheist is simply someone who responds with anything other than " yes " to the question of whether he or she believes that god(s ) exist .
Still not clear ?
Allow me to draw upon another prior post :
Atheism comes from the Greek " a - theos , " and since the " a " prefix means " without " or " the absence of , " we must first make sure we understand theism .
Theism refers to the belief that some sort of god or gods exist .
A theist is one who accepts the theistic claim ( i.e. , some sort of god or gods exist ) .
An atheist is one who does not accept the theistic claim .
That is , atheism means " without theism " and refers to the absence or lack of theistic belief .
What Atheism Is Not
Now that we know what atheism is , it is time to examine what it is not .
This brings us to the common misconception to which I referred above .
Atheism does not require absolute certainty that god(s ) do not or cannot exist .
Some atheists may indeed claim such certainty .
These individuals are sometimes described as " strong atheists " or " gnostic atheists . "
Nobody disputes the existence of such atheists .
The point is that certainty is not a necessary condition of atheism .
One who asserts that there " probably " are no gods is still an atheist .
In fact , one need not assert anything to be an atheist .
One need only refuse to accept the theistic belief claim .
I suppose this should be the part of the post where I list as many misconceptions about the meaning of atheism as possible in order to more fully explain what atheism is not .
Such a list would include terms like Communist and Satanist .
It would also have to include things about how atheists do not hate any particular god , are not merely looking for excuses to be immoral , and so on .
I 'm not going to do that here because I trust that most of my readers will already be aware that these are misconceptions .
For those who are n't they can be addressed in other posts .
Why Should We Care About Defining Atheism ?
Let us dispense with all the obvious reasons why accuracy is preferable to inaccuracy and why dictionaries are not necessarily above reproach .
We can keep this brief : defining atheism accurately reduces epistemological confusion and reminds us where the burden of proof rests .
I am willing to cut theists , particularly evangelical Christians , considerable slack in misunderstanding atheism .
I know all too well what they have been taught about atheism ( and atheists ) and why .
To my atheist colleagues , this is where we should be expected to lead .
Until we can accurately define ourselves , it is folly to expect anyone else to do the same .
I have written previously that I do not find distinctions like " strong atheist " or " passive atheist " to be particularly useful .
This needs some clarification .
I believe that such distinctions may eventually be meaningful as ways of describing within - group differences .
However , I maintain that they are not useful at present because too much confusion remains over the meaning of atheism itself .
Within - group distinctions are premature when the group itself is as fuzzy as we have allowed atheism to be .
I do refer to myself as an agnostic atheist at times because that is an accurate description ; however , I generally prefer to shorten my self - identification to atheist when I am communicating with people who do not understand atheism .
( CNN ) -- Investigators in Australia believe some of the deadly wildfires ravaging dry southeastern bushland may have been set , a conclusion prompting Australia 's prime minister to call such acts " mass murder . "
This hotel in Marysville was reduced to rubble .

State officials in Victoria have launched arson investigations into some of the blazes , which have killed at least 173 people , decimated massive spans of land and left thousands of people homeless .
Nine Network 's Tom Steinfort told CNN there were 25 fires still burning out of control Tuesday .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Monday : " I think it 's important that the nation braces itself for more bad news .
This is a little horror which few of us anticipated . "
News that some fires may have been deliberately set brought a note of disgust from the prime minister .
Watch the devastation brought to homes »
" What do you say about anyone like that ? " Rudd said .
" There 's no words to describe it , other than it 's mass murder . "
Wildfires are an annual event in Australia , but the unprecedented carnage wrought by the fast - moving infernos , called the worst ever by police , have shaken and surprised the nation .
This year , a combination of factors has made them especially intense : a drought , dry bush and one of the most powerful heat waves in memory .
And , finally , officials think some of the fires might have been deliberately lit .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
The number of dead is exceeding the toll of 75 in the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983 , state police said , and the toll is expected to rise .
The blazes have so far spared major urban areas but have swept across nearly 200,000 hectares ( 500,000 acres ) of bushland in Victoria , leading some firefighters and police to describe the destruction " as something of a holocaust , " said state police inspector Phil Shepherd , who reported that two towns -- Marysville and Kinglake -- have been " completely wiped out . "

Fire authorities reported nine large fires , including urgent threat messages for two of them .
Around 4,500 firefighters are battling the blazes .
More than 3,000 people have been displaced .
Victoria Premier John Brumby said more than 800 homes have burned and he expects the " devastating event " to push the death toll higher .
He said flames narrowly spared his parents , with fire stopping outside their house in the western part of the state .
Watch Brumby describe extent of disaster »
As many as 400 Australian troops will be heading to affected areas to aid in rescue and recovery efforts , and resettlement services will be provided to displaced families , Rudd said .
Firefighters on the scene have been working with other emergency service personnel to cut fire breaks while police erect roadblocks to evacuate residents , Shepherd said .
Victoria Police Chief Christine Nixon said investigators think " 14 people were killed as a result of one particular fire that we believe was laid by arsonists . "
iReport.com : ' Thank God we were spared '
Victoria authorities have banned the use of barbecues and any equipment that might spark a fire .
One man has been charged with violating the ban and of " conduct endangering life " in connection with a grass fire , and another has been charged with lighting fires in the neighboring state of New South Wales .
As darkness descended Monday , the flames continued to lick the night sky .
Aerial views showed rivers of orange trickling in all directions amid the dense vegetation .
Police expect that some of the fires will burn for a number of days , while others may take weeks to completely extinguish .
Temperatures in parts of Melbourne reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit ( 48 degrees Celsius ) in the past few weeks .
Dozens of heat - related deaths have been reported .
Officials were hoping for some help from milder weather moving in .

Gen Korabelnikov had led the Main Directorate of Intelligence since 1997 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has dismissed the head of the country 's powerful GRU military intelligence service , the Kremlin has said .
Mr Medvedev signed a decree on Friday replacing Gen Valentin Korabelnikov with Gen Alexander Shlyakhturov .
Officials gave no reason for the move .
Gen Korabelnikov had led the Main Directorate of Intelligence since 1997 .
He reportedly tendered his resignation earlier this year over objections to proposed reforms of the agency .
The Main Directorate of Intelligence ( GRU ) of the General Staff is Russia 's largest intelligence agency .
It is believed to have six times as many agents in foreign countries as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) , one of the successors to the Soviet KGB .
Protest
In a statement on Friday , the Kremlin announced that President Medvedev had signed a decree that " released " Gen Korabelnikov from his post and from military service .
The GRU is said to have a massive worldwide spy network The BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says this is potentially one of the most significant decisions Mr Medvedev has taken since being sworn in almost a year ago .
It reinforces statements he made last month that he intends pushing ahead with a major overhaul of the armed forces despite opposition from some senior officers , and that those who do stand in the way such as the military intelligence chief risk being swept aside , our correspondent says .
Gen Korabelnikov had been the head of military intelligence for 12 years and was a four - star general .
Analysts say the 63 - year - old was one of the main opponents of the planned military reforms , which could see the Russian armed forces shrink from 1.3 million serving men and women to one million .
The majority of those cuts would come from the officer corps , which could see the loss of around 200,000 posts , including many generals .
Some of the proposed reforms were said to have included the disbanding of several GRU - controlled army special forces ( Spetsnaz ) brigades and the redistribution of the command of some GRU structures to the SVR .
Gen Korabelnikov is reported to have submitted his resignation in protest last November .
When rumours again circulated in March , defence officials announced that his term of service had been extended by two years .
The Russian armed forces could see its manpower reduced by up to 300,000 Unnamed GRU sources told Russian media that one of the reasons why the general 's resignation had not been accepted at the time was that many of his deputies had refused to assume his post .
The Kremlin said the new GRU chief , Gen Shlyakhturov , had been one of Gen Korabelnikov 's deputies .
He is reportedly seen by some in the military as a more compliant figure who may not challenge ministers .
Although President Medvedev has insisted that the reforms of the military will go ahead , it is not clear when , our correspondent says .
The country is in the grip of a severe economic crisis which has already seen millions of people thrown out of work , he adds .
In a separate development , three districts in Chechnya have been officially designated zones of counter - terrorist activity only a week after Russia said it had ended its decade - long military campaign against separatist rebels in the southern republic .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Citigroup Inc Chairman Richard Parsons said on Thursday that the bank does not need any more capital injections from the government and expressed confidence that Citi would remain in private hands .
Incoming Citigroup Chairman Richard Parsons speaks at the New York State Bar Association meeting in New York , January 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
Asked in an interview with Reuters whether Citigroup needed additional government capital injections , Parsons said : “ No , I think actually , particularly with the latest conversion ...
Citi is actually one of the better capitalized banks in the world . ”
Parsons was speaking on the sidelines of a Business Roundtable event where President Barack Obama addressed business executives .
The Citigroup leader also brushed aside any prospect of the U.S. government nationalizing the bank .
“ I do n’t think the administration is heading in that direction , ” Parsons said .
“ But I have a lot of confidence in the future viability and strength of a privately held Citi . ”
The Obama administration and regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have said they do not want the government to take full control of the nation ’s banks .
Citi ’s shares on Thursday closed 13 cents higher , or 8.4 percent , to $ 1.67 on the New York Stock Exchange .
For the first time , Citi shares fell below $ 1 on March 5 .
The U.S. government said last month it would boost its equity stake in Citigroup to as much as 36 percent through the conversion of up to $ 25 billion in preferred shares to common stock .
In total , Citi has received $ 45 billion of taxpayer - funded capital since October .
This marked the third attempt by the U.S. authorities to prop up Citigroup in the past five months .
Citigroup is among many financial institutions that have received government bailout money to shore up their capital in a U.S. economy stuck in a recession during the credit crisis .
Earlier this week Citi said it was profitable in the first two months of 2009 and is confident about its capital strength , easing concerns about the bank ’s survival prospects .
As a precautionary measure U.S. regulators recently began work on a contingency plan to stabilize Citigroup if problems mounted , but no imminent rescue was planned , a person familiar with the planning said on Tuesday .
The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions .
Citi and other banks are waiting for the U.S. government to announce a plan to absorb soured assets banks are holding on their balance sheet .
The regions of our DNA that wire some people to “ see ” sounds have been discovered .
So far , only the general regions within chromosomes have been identified , rather than specific genes , but the work could eventually lead to a genetic test to diagnose the condition before it interferes with a child ’s education .
It has long been known that synaesthesia – which can take many other forms , but generally involves a cross- wiring between the senses – seems to run in families , although it also appears to be affected by environmental factors .
To investigate the nature of the genetic component of the condition , Julian Asher , now at Imperial College London , and colleagues from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford took genetic samples from 196 individuals of 43 families .
Of these , 121 individuals exhibited the synaesthetic trait of seeing a colour in response to a sound .
“ When I hear a violin , I see something like a rich red wine , ” says Asher , who is a synaesthete himself .
“ A cello is more like honey . ”

Autism link
The team performed a genetic analysis that tracked common “ markers ” – specific sets of base pairs that are repeated throughout the genome and which vary from person to person .
By comparing these markers within the family , the researchers were able to infer which regions had been inherited from each parent .
Together with knowledge about who exhibited synaesthesia within the families , the team identified the regions of DNA linked to the condition .
A region on chromosome 2 , which has been associated with autism , exhibited the strongest link .
This is particularly intriguing : the autistic savant Daniel Tammet , for example , possesses extraordinary abilities and also has a combination of the two conditions , as do some other autistic savants .
The region is also thought to be involved in epilepsy – which Tammet also suffered from as a child – and this could indicate that the three conditions may share some underlying genetic or neurological mechanisms .
Quiet please
Three other areas on chromosomes 5 , 6 and 12 also returned promising results .
All these regions are known to be involved in regulating neuronal activity and the way the brain structures itself , and future work that pinpoints the exact genes and their functions could help to explain exactly how synaesthesia occurs .
The work could also lead to a simple diagnosis of the condition .
Although synaesthesia is thought to help improve memory , it can also be very distracting – particularly in a teaching environment .
“ For some it is benign , but for others it can impact on their learning , ” says Asher .
“ Early diagnosis is then key for their future academic success . ”
For example , synaesthetes who “ see ” sounds might find it hard to work in a noisy classroom .
“ It ’s a more intense experience , ” says Asher .
People who attach colours to letters might also find reading confusing .
Some synaesthetic children get confused between the colour of numbers and their numerical properties , thinking that a “ blue ” number plus a “ yellow ” number must make a “ green ” number , for example .
Julia Simner at the University of Edinburgh believes a genetic test would have many advantages over behavioural tests , which can be difficult to perform on children who do n’t understand the procedures .
“ A genetic test is very appealing , ” she says .

Well , there are lots of people , including this humble writer , who think that intuition also has considerable role especially in complex situations .
Why so ?
Let us understand what intuition is .
My Pocket Oxford Dictionary defines intution vey succinctly as “ the ability to understand something immediately without conscious reasoning ” .
Does it apply to chess ?
Purists will argue that in chess , there is nothing hidden like in card games ( except of course the thoughts in your opponent ’s head ! ) .
You can see all the pieces , you know all the moves each piece can make in given situation , so it is a matter of cold reasoning and calculation to find the best sequence of moves .
But question arises about how deep you can calculate .
I have said elsewhere that in complex positions in the middle game , the sheer numbers of possibilities will make it impossible to go beyond next 4 - 5 moves .
Let us assume that each move by a player can result in only two viable options for the opponent .
So your first move has to consider 2 responses from the opponent , then you get 4 options for your second move and going this way , you have to calculate 16 for 3rd
move , 64 for 4th move …!!
Well , even accepting that many of the options on later moves may really not be possible , but considering that you may have more than one option to start with ( which is true
in most cases ) , there will still be a lot to take into account for your 4th or 5th move !
So what if something looks good up to 4 or 5 moves by your calculations , but proves to be a disaster after , say , the eighth move ?
In this instance , how much help did you get from your calculating ability ?
Intuition is something else .
In the aforesaid dictionary definition , the last four are the key words .
There may be some calculations going on behind your ideas , but you are unaware of it .
You appear to be jumping to conclusion .
All you do is take in the situation , get that big “ hunch ” and play something that later gets you a brilliancy prize !
Calculation is the king ?
Computers can do many more calculations in much less time compared to a human brain , so they should always win against the poor , dumb humans – but do they really ?
Nowadays computers have become much more powerful , but even then Deep Blue ( with ability to make 200 million calculations per second ) could win against Kasparov ( 2 - 1 with 3 drawn ) only with some unfair help from IBM who did not venture for return match with Kasparov .
Otherwise , you ’ll not find many instances of computer defeating a GM or IM .
In earlier days when computer chess programs were less advanced but still capable of defeating amateurs by virtue of their speed of calculation , I won some games by the trick of playing a completely unexpected silly move at some other part of the board !
The computer would go into a huddle to logically analyze an illogical move and end up making an equally silly move allowing me to win !
An amateur player would readily recognize the move as silly and punish me for it by just looking at it ( intuition ? ) without the need of calculation .
I ’ve mentioned that your brain may be making unconscious calculations that prompted your “ gut feeling ” .
I can believe that such must be the reality .
How many times have you seen a fresher to play by intuition ?
That subconscious thinking comes out of your database of knowledge from games played or seen by you , ideas you ’ve read about ( including those at this site ! ) , chess puzzles you have solved and so on .
All these experiences have registered somewhere in your brain .
You are like an actor on the stage delivering crisp dialogs that comes to you from the prompter in the wings who is reading from a script , so no mistakes !
Frank Marshall ( 1877 – 1944 ) , US Chess Champion from 1909 - 1936 and one of the great masters , is famous for many sacrificial plays ( one line now known as Marshall Gambit ) .
Some of these were spectacular successes , some were failures .
It makes me think that Marshall ’s intuitions had a major say in his making such moves !
It will be interesting to know what you all think about the role of intuition and how it comes about .
Start a discussion on this blog .
The billionaire stockpicker Warren Buffett has been stripped of his business empire 's top - notch credit rating after a series of self - confessed " dumb " decisions contributed to his worst year in four decades .
The rating agency Moody 's downgraded Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway investment company by two notches from triple - A to AA2 .
The setback is a blow to the prestige of the world 's second richest man , who commands a vast following among private investors across the US .
Moody 's said the capital cushion of Berkshire 's core insurance operations had been eroded by 22 % as its stock holdings lost value .
Elsewhere in Buffett 's sprawling portfolio , businesses tied to construction , retailing and consumer finance suffered a squeeze in the recession .
Moody 's analyst Bruce Ballentine said the downgrade reflected " the impact on Berkshire 's key businesses of the severe decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted recession " .
Some of Berkshire 's non-insurance businesses have not been spared in the US recession " which has caused a meaningful drop in earnings and cash flows , particularly for businesses tied to the US housing market , construction , retailing or consumer finance , " Ballentine said .
" The downgrade of the parent company rating to AA2 , from AAA , reflects the potential for further declines in the support available from these dual sources . "
While Berkshire posted a net profit of $ 4.99 bn for 2008 , its assets have lost nearly a tenth of their value .
Berkshire has already lost its top credit rating at rival agency Fitch , which pointed to its reliance on its 78 - year - old founder , known as the Sage of Omaha .
The third major credit - rating agency , Standard & Poor 's , has kept the company 's top rating but put it on " negative " watch for a possible downgrade .
The investor has had to tell shareholders in his company that 2008 had been the worst year since he took the helm 44 years ago .
The Nebraska - based billionaire has businesses ranging from Fruit of the Loom underwear to Geico insurance , Justin Brands cowboy boots and Dairy Queen cafes .
In Britain , Berkshire has a 4 % stake in Tesco and owns Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric through a holding company , MidAmerican Energy .
Usually a consistent performer , Berkshire saw its book value drop by 9.6 % a share in 2008 , its worst performance since Buffett took the reins in 1965 .
In his annual letter to shareholders in February , Buffett admitted he had done what he called some " dumb things " as the global financial crisis worsened , including errors of omission : " Sucking my thumb when new facts came in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and promptly take action . "
Loss -making manoeuvres included buying stock in the energy firm ConocoPhillips just as oil prices peaked .
Financial holdings such as US Bancorp , Wells Fargo and American Express have taken a battering from the credit crunch .
Buffett also suffered an 89 % loss after investing $ 244 m in two unnamed Irish banks .
In Forbes magazine 's annual rich list , Buffett has lost his spot as the world 's wealthiest man to Bill Gates after seeing his personal fortune slump by an estimated $ 25 bn to $ 37bn .
Buffett , who cites Cherry Coke as one of his main vices , has pledged the bulk of his wealth to Gates ' charitable foundation for healthcare in developing countries .
Moody 's rating downgrade applies to Berkshire 's long - term debt and to its insurance subsidiary , National Indemnity Corporation .
Berkshire 's short - term borrowing is unaffected and the group 's other major insurers have suffered a one - notch downgrade .
Lower ratings are likely to make it more expensive for Berkshire to borrow and could affect the pricing of its insurance policies .
Coincidentally , Moody's is 20 % owned by Berkshire Hathaway , though Buffett has made it clear that he has no involvement in its management .
Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to Omaha next month for Berkshire 's annual shareholder meeting .
Many of his admirers see themselves as long - term followers and are unlikely to be deterred by a single poor year .
Justin Fuller , a Chicago investment manager who runs a website called Buffettologist.com , said that ratings agencies were queasy about giving top - notch ratings after misjudging the banking crisis .
" The rating agencies have made a lot of mistakes over the last couple of years and now they 've got an overly conservative mentality , " said Fuller , a partner at Midway Capital Research & Management .
He said nobody , including Buffett , was immune from the downturn but added : " When people start to throw him under a bus and say he 's lost his touch , that 's usually a signal to me to be buying Berkshire Hathaway stock . "
The notorious Louisiana - based white supremacist leader , David Duke , has visited Syria last week , where he delivered an anti-Semitic speech attacking ' Zionists occupying New York ' and the State of Israel .
The speech was carried by Syrian state television .
Television footage of the rally has been made available by the Arabic translation service , MEMRI .
To see video of speech , please follow this link .
Duke , who was once a “ grand wizard ” of the Klu Klux Klan , addressed a cheering crowd waving Syrian flags , saying : “ I come from the peace - loving people in America to the peace - loving people of Syria . ”
“ It is only in America and around the world , it is only the Zionists who want war rather than peace , ” Duke said in a speech which seemed to illustrate the convergence of white supremacist ideology with the rhetoric of radical voices in the Arab world .
“ It hurts my heart to tell you that part of my country is occupied by Zionists , just as part of your country , the Golan Heights , is occupied by Zionists .
The Zionists occupy most of the American media and now control much of American government , ” he added .
' A message from many Americans '
Duke said that “ it is not just the West Bank of Palestine , it is not just the Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists , but Washington D.C. , and New York , and London , and many other capitals in the world . ”
“ I bring you a message from many Americans ; from many people in Britain , and around the Western world .
We say in unison : No war for Israel , ” he concluded .
According to the Anti-Defamation League , in an article entitled “ The black plague , ” Duke once wrote in an editorial : " ( A ) black ... gets a job with a white - owned company .
He is the only black at the firm .
He works hard , but he 's fighting a losing battle against his genes . "
Duke ’s latest website entry contains a pro-Holocaust denial message in which he laments the “ Zionists who use the Holocaust as the sword and shield of the racial - supremacist state of Israel . ”
His website carries a quote by Syrian parliament member Muhammad Habash , in which Habash welcomed " Duke ’s wonderful visit . "
Habash is reported to have added : " He has given us a new and very positive view of the average American . "
At the height of cold season , it seems worth mentioning a recent article in one of my favorite journals , Medical Hypotheses , that claims that sex alleviates cold symptoms .
The logic is as follows : a cold results in congestion and inability to breathe through the nose .
Decongestants can solve the problem , but they ’re addictive , ultimately ineffective — worse yet — they may blunt the taste buds .
Of course , blowing the nose clears the nasal passages , but a recent Times article reported that nose blowing is actually bad because it reverses the flow of mucus into the sinuses , building up pressure and slowing down drainage .
The safer , more natural way to alleviate sinus pressure , according to the Medical Hypotheses authors , is to have sex — and to adhere to “ proper scheduling ….[ to keep ] the nose clear for the rest of [ one ’s ] life . ”
Arousal stimulates adrenergic receptors , which are under the control of the sympathetic nervous system .
The receptors in turn trigger vasoconstriction of blood vessels , which in turn help unstuff the stuffy nose .
( According to a similar theory , sex may also cure a headache . )
Focusing on men , the authors note that relief should immediately follow orgasm .
In short , the nose should n’t be blown — rechannel your blowing efforts below the belt .
But does it really help ?
In theory , frequent sex ( or masturbation ) should keep the blood vessels constricted and the nose clear .
Anecdotal reports say yes , sex clears the nose ( and even the mind ) , but no serious study has been done to prove it really works .
My guess ?
I suspect that it ’s true , sex really does clears nasal passages , but relief probably does n’t not last long before you need to do it again — in which case , Sudafed must be replaced by Viagra .
KBR 's Convenient Contract
Halliburton 's offshoot , KBR , is awarded a $ 75 million U.S. Army Corps contract to provide emergency power to Western states days before a wildfire sweeps California , ' threatening the power of the city of Los Angeles '
Now , that 's what I call a coincidence !

Holy convenience , Batman !
Fire - Related Blackouts Begin to Surface 15 Nov 2008
A power outtage struck several areas through Southern California , according to the Los Angeles Fire Department .
From 9:40 am to 10:05 a.m. areas throughout the Valley and Southern California - including Sherman Oaks , Mid City , Crenshaw and Harbor City experienced rolling black outs .
Power was restored to those areas thereafter .
According to Joe Ramallo , DWP , approximately 1,000 customers remained without power in the fire - ridden areas .
DWP Shuts Off Major Power Lines Due to ' Sayre ' Fire 15 Nov 2008
The Sayre fire , which began around 10:30 last night in Sylmar has caused several transformers in the hills above the San Fernando Valley to explode , and as a result , the DWP has taken action to ensure the public 's safety and to help the firefighters battle the blaze .
According to a press release from early this morning : The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began taking major power transmission lines near the Sayre Fire out of service at 5 AM today as the fire moved west toward the I - 5 Corridor in Sylmar .
Transmission lines were taken out of service due to the threat posed by the fire in order to assist firefighters and protect the public 's safety .
The I - 5 corridor through Sylmar serves as a major utility corridor for the LADWP and other utilities , bringing imported power to Los Angeles from power plants in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern US .
As the fire moved toward the high - voltage transmission lines , the LADWP turned off these lines to ensure the safety of firefighters and the public .
Because of the significant role these power lines play in supplying Los Angeles with energy , should they remain offline for a long period of time , the DWP may initiate rolling power outages in part of the City to handle the demand .
Fire prompts rolling blackouts in L.A. 15 Nov 2008 L.A. officials launched rolling blackouts across the city for about an hour this morning after deactivating some transmission lines in the Sylmar fire zone out of fear that winds could blow them down and cause more blazes .
Several blackouts were reported in the San Fernando Valley , with entire neighborhoods losing power and traffic jammed because traffic signals were off ...
The Department of Water and Power said transmission lines along the Interstate 5 corridor north of Sylmar were taken out of service this morning .
These lines are considered a major source of imported power to Los Angeles from power plants outside California .
Wildfire threatens Los Angeles power supply - mayor 15 Nov 2008
A fast - moving wildfire in suburban Los Angeles is a threat to the city 's power supply , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said on Saturday .
The fire , concentrated in the Los Angeles foothill suburb of Sylmar , could hit transmission lines that bring electrical power to Los Angeles .
" The fire is threatening the power of the city of Los Angeles , " Villaraigosa said .
" We may have to move to rolling blackouts . "
State of Emergency in California as Blaze Rages -- Thirteen Injured and More Than 100 Homes Destroyed in Fast - Moving Fire 14 Nov 2008 California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Santa Barbara County , Calif. , as firefighters have been unable to control a wildfire that has already damaged at least 100 homes and injured 13 people .

Sitting down to play an early version of Red Faction on an almost - sunny London day , I do get a moment ’s cognitive dissonance when I think of myself here , at a corporate event , playing a multi-million dollar product of capitalism designed to simulate the thrill of armed insurrection , when I could just head across town and get involved in the real thing .
Except if I did that , I ’d probably get in more trouble when I hit someone with a sledgehammer .
And I would n’t get to play with nanite - disolverers .
Or , at least , I do n’t think I would .
Man !
So – Red Faction then .
Voilition ’s shooters had an odd history , especially involving the PC .
Its Geo-Mod technology in 2001 was – ahem – revolutionary , to the point where a tech - demo lead to the magazine I was working to giving it a cover feature with a hyperbolic coverline along the lines of “ Half - life move over ” .
And then when it came out , it was thoroughly average with its ability for you to mine into any surface not used to any real effect , so the reviewer gave it an averagey - sixty - percent or so mark .
It was a hit over on the PS2 – which you can mainly put down to FPS - shortage on that particular format – leading to a sequel which I ignored so much I had to check whether it came out on the PC or not on Wikipedia just now .
It did .
Which means what would normally be the bad news is in fact good news .
Red Faction : Guerrilla is n’t anything at all like its prequels .
Yeah , it ’s got a load of nods in the game to its history .
Yes , it ’s still set on Mars and about a rebellion of miners .
And yes , destruction still plays a key part of the game .
It ’s moved from a first - person shooter to a third - person open - world action game , and is easy to see as a more serious sci- fi sister game to Volition ’s hilarious and playful Saints Row 2 .
And while destruction is key , it ’s no longer about the the “ you can dig a big hole ! ” , instead concentrating on actually taking apart buildings .
It ’s a total betrayal !
A total betrayal which was probably a good thing .
Red Faction is much more interesting as a Mercenaries - inspired blow - everything - up game , with revolutionary flourishes .
I mean that in tone rather than mechanics or structure .
In terms of the latter , you ’ll be immediately familiar with having major missions to complete , interspersed with more random other activities you can get up to .
The you - are - a- revolution element is added in those side - missions .
Activities can decrease the security level in the area – so unlocking the main missions leading to your cheery victory – or raise the morale of the people , making it more likely that a passer - by will pick up arm and fight the fascist bastards .
So you ’ll soon find yourself rescuing kidnapped victims , joining in defence of areas , taking down parts of the enemy infrastructure , having demolition challenges and … oh , that kind of stuff .
I found it immediately easy to buy into the fiction of the place .
Obviously the high - lights are the enormous set - piece missions where … well , stuff goes bang .
Lots of it .
It ’s a game about banging .
The vast majority of your weapons – the iconic ones being repurposed mining equipment – is designed to bring down buildings .
While it ’s amusing to work your way into a base by just banging holes in everything you see in the way , the moment it clicked – and I found myself openly laughing – was bringing down a smoke - stack .
I ’d accidentally set the charges in a way which the whole thing collapsed on a nearby other building , taking that out too .
Both of my targets taken out in one pyrotechnic flourish .
This could grow on a guy .
The explosions continue into the multiplayer , which embraces the destroy - stuff ethos .
As well as capture the flag and general deathmatch - esque stuff , there ’s ones based around destroying – or reconstructing with a makes - brickies - nervous - about - jobs magical building healing gun – structures and similar .
Even the standard missions are enlivened by this destructive tendency .
Take the CTF map where the direct route is an enormous bridge .
While the superstructure resists , you soon see hammer - weilders determinedly heading from one side to the other bashing to improvise a trench .
The on - fly class - based system is another striking part of the game – spread around the level there ’s specialist backpacks , which supplies you with a new power .
Want to rush for the flag , grab the one which allows you to speed boost or the splendid jetpack .
Want to fight close up ?
Try the firepower boost .
Support the team ?
Try the heal .
Want to run through walls cackling ?
Choose the Rhino one .
I chose the Rhino one a lot .
The few hours play actually leave me liking Red Faction a lot .
I suspect it is n’t going to end up as a genre - redefining classic – it ’s too happy with the post GTA - open - world conventions for that – but it does look like it ’s going to manage what no Red Faction game has so far .
That is , be a lot of fun .
Seriously , the Rhino backpack .
It ’s hilarious .
Try that thing out .

Ministers and army chiefs came under intense pressure from the United States after the Taliban used the deal to seize control in neighbouring Buner and Lower Dir districts , where they patrolled with weapons and set up checkpoints .
Reading the news that General Motors and Chrysler are now lining up for another $ 20 billion or so in government aid  on top of the billions they ’ve already received or requested  leaves me with the sick feeling that we are subsidizing the losers and for only one reason : because they claim that their funerals would cost more than keeping them on life support .
Sorry , friends , but this is not the American way .
Bailing out the losers is not how we got rich as a country , and it is not how we ’ll get out of this crisis .
G.M. has become a giant wealth - destruction machine  possibly the biggest in history  and it is time that it and Chrysler were put into bankruptcy so they can truly start over under new management with new labor agreements and new visions .
When it comes to helping companies , precious public money should focus on start - ups , not bailouts .
You want to spend $ 20 billion of taxpayer money creating jobs ?
Fine .
Call up the top 20 venture capital firms in America , which are short of cash today because their partners  university endowments and pension funds  are tapped out , and make them this offer : The U.S. Treasury will give you each up to $ 1 billion to fund the best venture capital ideas that have come your way .
If they go bust , we all lose .
If any of them turns out to be the next Microsoft or Intel , taxpayers will give you 20 percent of the investors ’ upside and keep 80 percent for themselves .
If we are going to be spending billions of taxpayer dollars , it ca n’t only be on office - decorating bankers , over - leveraged home speculators and auto executives who year after year spent more energy resisting changes and lobbying Washington than leading change and beating Toyota .

AT&T is trialling sales of a netbook for just $ 49.99 .
But the catch is that buyers must subscribe to a two - year internet plan which may wipe out any savings .
The deal is currently only available in Philadelphia and Atlanta but will be expanded if it ’s a success .
The lowest price machine offered is the Acer Aspire One , which comes with 1GB of memory and a 160 GB drive – not too shoddy for an ultra-portable machine .
Under the deal , it will cost $ 49.99 , a $ 400 saving on the regular price charged by AT&T .
The deal is only available to customers who sign up for at least two years to a data plan .
The cheapest available is $ 59.99 , so you will be paying more for your first month ’s service than for the machine itself .
The way the numbers add up , you ’d only be saving cash if you could n’t find an equivalent or better data plan elsewhere for $ 43 a month or less .
It ’s also worth noting this data plan is n’t particularly generous .
It offers both a home DSL connection and mobile broadband .
However , the DSL is only 768 k , which barely qualifies as ‘ broadband ’ .
The mobile connection limits users to 200MB of data a month , meaning you wo n’t be able to do much more than occasionally check e-mails on the move .
Another option is to get a mobile data only plan ( no DSL connection ) which gives you a more generous 5 GB data allowance , though that ’s still not enough if you regularly stream video or play online games .
( Insert “ World of Warcraft / Never leaving the house ” gag here . )
This has the same monthly cost but puts the purchase price up to $ 99.99 .
Such pricing plans are a growing , if fledgling trend .
Radio Shack already runs a similar deal , with Verizon apparently working on such offers .
At the moment it ’s tough to see how most people would benefit : it might be useful for people on tight budgets who ca n’t afford to pay the full cost of a netbook upfront , though in those cases sixty bucks a month for a data plan might also be too high .
It might make sense to combine such deals with cellphone service so that users pay a single charge for both phone and netbook usage .
However , the risk there is that anyone on more expensive phone packages probably has such a feature - packed smartphone that a netbook becomes virtually redundant .
President Obama , terming the outbreak “ cause for deep concern but not panic , ” took the unusual step of using a prime - time televised news conference , convened to mark his 100th day in office , to deliver a public health message to the American people .

“ Wash your hands when you shake hands , cover your mouth when you cough , ” he said from the East Room of the White House .
“ It sounds trivial , but it makes a huge difference .
If you are sick , stay home .
If your child is sick , take them out of school .
If you are feeling certain flu symptoms , do n’t get on an airplane . ”
With public health officials recommending that schools close if there are more confirmed or suspected cases , Mr. Obama urged parents and businesses to “ think about contingency plans ” in case of such closings .
He said he was calling on Congress to authorize an immediate $ 1.5 billion to “ support our ability to monitor and track this virus ” and to build the supply of antiviral drugs .
“ The more recent illnesses and the reported death suggest that a pattern of more severe illness associated with this virus may be emerging in the U.S. , ” the C.D.C. said on its Web site .
More hospitalizations and deaths are expected , the site said , because the virus is new and most people have no immunity to it .
Dr. Chan said that government preparedness plans could include steps like ensuring that laboratories can test for the disease and that health systems can identify and treat cases , track an outbreak and prevent the virus from spreading in hospitals and clinics .
She said governments should also decide on measures like closing schools and discouraging or banning public gatherings .
Mexico , for instance , has prohibited people from eating in restaurants and ordered most stores and other businesses to close for several days starting Friday , a move apparently intended to keep people at home during what is traditionally a long holiday weekend .

After Bruce Springsteen very publicly spoke out against the big Live Nation - Ticketmaster tie - up , no other major artist has come out to defend the deal , even though supposedly Jay - Z , Bono or Don Henley was going to .
What happened , Shawn ?
But , finally , someone is defending high ticket prices .
It 's Stevie Nicks , who happens to be represented by Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff .
During a teleconference this week to promote an upcoming Fleetwood Mac tour , Nicks explains why ticket prices are so gosh darn expensive .

" The price of life in general is a gazillion dollars more than it was four years ago , " she said .

That 's what we do ; we 're performance artists . "

On Monday , we released an early look at the Android 1.5 SDK .
Not only does this platform update contain numerous new features , APIs , and bug fixes , but Android 1.5 also brings a new default look for the Android UI framework .
After Android 1.0 and 1.1 , our designers worked hard to refine and polish the appearance of the system .
The screenshots below show the same activity ( creating a new contact ) on Android 1.1 and Android 1.5 :
You can see in this example that the buttons and checkboxes have a new appearance .
Even though these changes do not affect binary nor source compatibility , they might still break the UI of your apps .
As part of the UI refresh , the minimum size of some of the widgets has changed .
For instance , Android 1.1 buttons have a minimum size of 44x48 pixels whereas Android 1.5 buttons now have a minimum size of 24x48 pixels .
The image below compares the sizes of Android 1.1 buttons with Android 1.5 buttons :
If you rely on the button 's minimum size , then the layout of your application may not be the same in Android 1.5 as it was in Android 1.1 because of this change .
This would happen for instance if you created a grid of buttons using LinearLayout and relying on the minimum size yielded by wrap_content to align the buttons properly :
This layout could easily be fixed by using the android : layout_weight attribute or by replacing the LinearLayout containers with a TableLayout .
This example is probably the worst - case UI issue you may encounter when running your application on Android 1.5 .
Other changes introduced in Android 1.5 , especially bug fixes in the layout views , may also impact your application — especially if it is relying on faulty / buggy behavior of the UI framework .
If you encounter issues when running your application on Android 1.5 , please join us on the Google groups or IRC so that we and the Android community can help you fix your application .
Happy coding !
They may not have realized it , but the folks who snapped up as much as $ 4 - million worth of limited - edition prints by artist Takashi Murakami two years ago at the special Louis Vuitton boutique inside his exhibition at L.A. 's Museum of Contemporary
Art apparently were getting nicely mounted handbags -- minus the snaps and straps .
At least one buyer , Clint Arthur , is steamed enough to have sued Louis Vuitton for fraud .
“ Louis Vuitton . . . knew that neither [ Arthur ] nor anyone else would pay $ 6,000 " if it was clear they were getting factory leftovers from handbag production , says a legal memo that Arthur ’s attorneys filed last week in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , countering Louis Vuitton ’s attempt to have Judge A. Howard Matz dismiss the case as groundless .
The point of installing a boutique inside the “ Copyright Murakami ” exhibition at MOCA ’s Geffen Contemporary building was to highlight the Japanese pop artist ’s trademark blurring of the lines between art and commerce , MOCA officials said at the time of the 2007 - 08 show .
But Arthur contends that selling repurposed handbag material as 500 collectible art prints priced at $ 6,000 and $ 10,000 crossed the line from commerce to fraud because Louis Vuitton allegedly hid the fact that the prints were made from the same fabric sheets as the Murakami - designed bags and accessories selling nearby for almost $ 1,000 .
When Arthur initially sued Louis Vuitton North America and MOCA last June , those class - action lawsuits alleged only that both had failed to provide information about the artworks required under California ’s Fine Prints Act .
He and his attorneys added the fraud allegation in August , after finding a 2007 interview in the journal ArtInfo in which MOCA ’s chief curator , Paul Schimmel , admitted that he was “ surprised ” that Murakami “ took the materials that he had printed for various [ Vuitton ] products . . . and he had them stretched like paintings and made into a very large but numbered edition ” of prints to be sold in the boutique .
Schimmel had invited the artist and Louis Vuitton to set up the store inside the Geffen exhibition -- a rare , if not unprecedented , move for a major art museum .
Attorneys for the multibillion - dollar luxury goods company argue in legal papers that Arthur has no case because , as an experienced collector of fine art prints , he should have known from the context that he might be getting something that would blur the lines between art and manufacture .
“ Such ambiguity is . . . part and parcel of the Murakami aesthetic and thus , was part of the bargain , ” says one Louis Vuitton legal memorandum in the case .
Louis Vuitton also argues that because the boutique ’s sales brochure advertised the prints as “ canvasses revisited by Takashi Murakami , ” and because their design was identical to handbags in the same boutique , Arthur should have known that he was n’t getting what he says he expected : works created specifically as limited - edition prints .
Arthur ’s refusal to take a refund of the $ 12,000 he paid for two prints , plus interest , shows that his suit is merely an “ opportunistic ” bid for “ windfall profits , ” Louis Vuitton further contends .
A hearing is scheduled for Monday on the motion to dismiss .
A spokeswoman said Wednesday that the company had no comment beyond what ’s in its legal briefs .
Arthur , a Los Angeles resident who owns a company that sells gourmet butter to restaurants , says he ’s driven more by the urge to reveal art - world wrongdoing in high places than to reap a big verdict or settlement .
“ For this to happen with one of the world ’s top artists in one of the world ’s top art museums stinks . . . and that ’s why I ’m going to keep going until I get to the bottom of this , ” he said .
“ Who came up with this scam ?
Why did they do it ?
Is this some sort of mischief Murakami ’s having at the expense of his collectors ? ”
Arthur scoffs at Louis Vuitton ’s suggestion that the handbags on sale nearby should have tipped him off that the prints were not an original design : “ It ’s not my responsibility to inspect their handbags .
I ’m only interested in collecting fine art . ”
As for the prints being sold as “ revisited ” Murakami works , Arthur said : “ ‘ revisited ’ means he ’s gone back and done another take . . . another riff on that same concept or idea ” -- rather than putting a frame around pre-existing handbag material .
Another new development in the case is Louis Vuitton ’s admission that it ignored some provisions of California ’s 39 - year - old Fine Prints
Act , which requires dealers in limited - edition prints to disclose an array of information , including how the works were created and to post a sign informing customers of their rights under the law .
“ Louis Vuitton is not ordinarily in the business of selling fine prints , but rather is in the business of manufacturing and selling luxury handbags , luggage and accessories , ” contend the company ’s attorneys in a memo intended to persuade the judge that its violation of the act was not done “ willfully . ”
If it was , the merchant could be subject to damages under the Fine Prints
Act of triple what it originally charged for the prints -- potentially $ 12 million if Arthur ’s case goes forward as a class action .
The separate class - action suit against MOCA in Los Angeles Superior Court , reported by The Times last year , alleges no fraud but concerns failure to provide proper certificates for three Murakami prints that Arthur bought for $ 2,655 at the regular museum shop .
Judge William Highberger is expected to rule by summer whether that case should go forward .
MOCA contends that the suit should be dismissed because last month it gave Arthur the legally required certificates it had previously failed to provide ;
Arthur says that in describing two of his purchases as “ posters , ” the certificates raise even more troubling questions about whether MOCA was cheating buyers by charging inflated , limited - edition prices for mere posters .
Suing to assert his rights under the Fine Prints Act is “ not some trifling nuisance , ” Arthur said .
“ These are investment - quality art products .
The disclosure impacts their value , and the success or failure of my investment .
It also tells whether or not I was scammed . ”

Of Interest to Investors , Survivalists and Others Concerned About Their Economic and Financial Futures _________________________________________________________________________________________________________
With a focus on the Plutocrats , Goldsmiths , Super - Rich Insiders , and their Allies and what they are conspiratorially doing to manipulate the financial markets , make more profits , rip us off and install a world government under their control By R. D. Bradshaw
In the early days of ancient Greece , governmental units called city - states developed .
As these entities were feudalistic , the local fat cats controlled them .
Perhaps from this organizational concept , other city - states developed in other parts of the world and often with surrounding walls .
Over the centuries , these city - states proved hard to defend .
So they largely vanished from the world scene ; though some survived .
For example , in ancient times , there was a city - state called Jebus on the lower spur of Mount Moriah in old Canaan land .
This Jebus was inhabited by Jebusites .
By about 1000 BCE , King David of Israel captured the city and made it his capitol , and called it Jerusalem .
The old city of Jerusalem even today still has a surrounding wall .
By Roman times , in Britain , there was a city - state called London on the Thames .
It was protected by an ancient city wall and covered an area of about one square mile .
This one still exists today as a city - state within the so - called United Kingdom ( it is called � The City� today throughout much of the world ) .
It still has much of its feudalistic character from its ancient past , though the city walls have vanished over the ages .
While the greater city of London grew up around it , this ancient city still remains with its own identity ; and it is largely independent from the rest of the United Kingdom .
Over the centuries , it gained fame as the world�s most important trading , commercial and financial center .
While New York evolved as being extremely important in commerce and finance in the late 20th century , there is still some opinion that The City remains the world center for finance and commerce .
The City is governed by the historic Corporation of London , now called the London City Corporation ( evidently chartered by the British government ) .
This entity rules supreme in The City with the exception of two enclaves called the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple .
These independent enclaves represent the professional bar associations in Britain ( that shows you how powerful lawyers are in Britain ) .
The London City Corporation governs The City ( with its own constitution and local government ) .
It controls the local government made up of the Lord Mayor , a Court of Alderman ( Justices of the Peace elected in the wards ) and the Court of Common Council ( chosen by voters in the wards ) .
The Lord Mayor and two Sheriffs are chosen by Liverymen , from Livery Companies , meeting in Common Hall ( there are some 100 livery companies which were originally trade associations ) .
While voters choose the corporation , it is actually a feudalistic corporation owned and controlled by the local city fat cats .
Corporation members are chosen by voters as follows : Eligible voters must be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the United Kingdom , an EU country , or a British Commonwealth country , and either : A resident of The City
A sole trader a partner in an unlimited partnership or
An appointee of a qualifying body .
Each body or organization , whether unincorporated or incorporated , whose premises are within the City of London , may appoint a number of voters based on the number of workers it employs .
Limited liability partnerships fall into this category .
This provision allows the businesses in the City to choose its government because there are only some 7,800 people living there , while the businesses employ some 340,000 workers .
The business employers have votes for its employees ( actually 32,000 votes ) ; meaning that they literally control the corporation elections .
Of course , there are a variety of businesses in The City .
But the primary big businesses are the banks and financial institutions .
The London Stock Exchange and the Rothschild owned Bank of England are both located there .
In Lucifer�s Children , Milan Martin says that some 560 banks are located there ( including the powerful N. M. Rothschild bank ) .
With 560 banks and with their power to appoint the governing corporation , we can be sure that the banks own and direct The City .
The City has its own independent police force .
Martin puts the number of police at 2,000 to control the one square mile area ( with only some 7,800 local residents , as noted above ) .
Martin adds that if the Queen wants to visit The City she must have permission .
She must walk ten paces behind the Lord Mayor .
This means that The City is virtually an independent nation ( much like the Vatican ) for all purposes ; despite being a theoretical part of the United Kingdom .
It is not a part of the greater city of London or of any of the English counties ; yet , it largely functions like one of the English counties but with great independence and little or no UK oversight .
Along with being perhaps the commercial and financial capitol of the world , The City has to be the gold center of the world .
It has several distinctions on gold worthy of mentioning .
First , it is the headquarters of the primary goldsmiths in the world -- the world ruling House of Rothschild and the N. M. Rothschild bank .
Next it reportedly is home to the London Bullion Market Association which fixes the gold price at 10:30 AM and 3 PM daily .
While these fixes may largely be symbolic today , they nevertheless are important historically .
The London Gold Fixing is done by five members of the Association .
They sit down and discuss the price until they come to an agreement .
This has , in the past , taken some time but these days it usually takes only a few minutes .
Regardless of the present role of the London Bullion Market Association , it is a fact that The City has to be defined as the primary centre of world activity in the gold markets .
If there is such a thing as the gold capitol of the world , it likely is The City .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand something about The City in order to appreciate the global control and manipulation of the world�s gold prices .
I submit that the gold manipulations now going on in the commodity markets are directed and controlled precisely from The City - - surely by the goldsmith House of Rothschild .
Unless otherwise indicated , the above summary on The City and The City of London Corporation were essentially taken from the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia , the Internet�s Wikipedia Encyclopedia and Answers.com .

A few hundred movie fans got a sneak peek at 22 minutes the upcoming Sacha Baron Cohen comedy “ Bruno ” at the South by Southwest film festival .
Baron Cohen ’s Bruno character is a “ flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion correspondent hoping to make it big in Hollywood , ” and he ’s just as crazy and provocative as his now - famous Borat character .
In the first bit of footage , Bruno has decided to achieve celebrity by adopting a black baby , and wants to feature the child in an avant - garde performance art project .
( “ Ich bin pushing the limits , ” he explains in broken German . )
He interviews several mothers and fathers to determine whether their children would be suitable to play guest stars , and his questions grow increasingly absurd :
Are they afraid of stuffed animals ?
Reptiles ?
Hornets ?
Would they be OK with being dropped off a four - story building , or willing to have liposuction ?
Regardless of the request , the parents categorically say “ yes . ”
Part two , which was shot just north of Dallas , finds Bruno appearing on a Jerry Springer - style talk show in leather pants , looking for Mr. Right .
Members of the predominantly black studio audience are appalled by his in - your - face homosexuality , and they get even angrier when he brings out his adopted baby and shows them a self - consciously artsy photograph of the child posing as Jesus on a cross .
Although it appears there are a few plants in the crowd to ask the right questions , the majority of them seem genuinely disgusted as they storm out .
Finally , Bruno decides to reinvent himself by going hetero and changing his name to “ Straight Dave . ”
Dressed like Ted Nugent in camouflage , long hair and a scruffy beard , he stages a mixed - martial arts contest , which was shot last summer in Arkansas .
When Bruno ’s ex-boyfriend crawls into the ring and the two start making out , stripping and rubbing all over each other , spectators in the conservative crowd holler , make anti-gay slurs and throw plastic cups of beer at them .
They end up storming out , too .
Recession has taken toll on alternative energy GREEN ENERGY
Worldwide sales of solar cells , biofuels and wind turbines soared 53 percent last year to hit $ 115.9 billion before the global recession started sapping their strength , according to an annual report issued Tuesday .
The report by the Clean Edge research firm shows the alternative energy industry at a turning point in 2008 .
After years of rapid growth fueled by rising oil prices and fears of global warming , the industry was finally making serious cash .
Green businesses were hiring , with solar and wind companies accounting for a total of 600,000 jobs worldwide , according to the report .
But as 2008 wore on , the world slid deeper into recession , the oil market crashed and banks stopped lending to green startups .
As a result , the report 's authors expect the industry 's sales to flatline or fall slightly in 2009 .
And some green - tech companies wo n't live to see 2010 .
" This is going to be an extraordinarily challenging year , and there 's no question there 's going to be a shakeout , " said Joel Makower , one of the report 's authors and a co-founder of Clean Edge .
" It 's really unfortunate timing , just at the point when clean energy has been reaching critical mass . "
Makower and the report's other authors do n't expect the alternative energy business to wither away .
President Obama 's economic stimulus package devotes more than $ 70 billion to clean energy and transportation .
The administration also appears determined to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions , potentially making fossil fuels more expensive to burn .

" If it were just about oil prices , some of these companies would be in real trouble , " said Clean Edge co-founder Ron Pernick , another of the report 's authors .
" But it 's not . "
Once the financial crisis ends , Pernick expects the industry 's growth to resume , albeit at a slower pace .
The report projects that by 2018 , revenue from solar power , wind power and biofuel companies will hit $ 325.1 billion , and the three sectors will produce 2.7 million jobs .
Their growth in recent years has been substantial .
Worldwide revenue for wind power companies jumped 71 percent from 2007 to 2008 , reaching $ 51.4 billion .
Biofuel revenues surged 37 percent , to hit $ 34.8 billion .
More than 19 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel were produced worldwide , according to the report .
Photovoltaic solar power sales , including the equipment and installation , rose 46 percent to $ 29.6 billion .
By 2018 , Clean Edge predicts that revenues will hit $ 139.1 billion for wind , $ 105.4 billion for biofuels and $ 80.6 billion for photovoltaic solar .
As large as those numbers are , they still represent just a fraction of the world 's energy market .
For example , 2008 revenue for just one oil company , Exxon Mobil Corp. , hit $ 477.4 billion .

Enlarge AP Osama bin Laden was last seen in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan before he fled in 2001 .
ENLISTING GEOGRAPHY , SATELLITES ENLISTING GEOGRAPHY , SATELLITES Enlarge Source : UCLA
This is a " distance decay theory " map suggesting the likelihood that Osama bin Laden is located in a given region .
The center is Tora Bora , Afghanistan , where bin Laden was last seen in public .
The theory is that elusive species , and people , hide closer to their last known locale .
Geographers drew circles 6.1 miles apart , a day 's walking distance , over a mosaic of satellite images .
They contend that the farther away from Tora Bora , the less likely it is that bin Laden is there .
In addition to the map , the analysis factors in local town information , patterns of nighttime electrical use and bin Laden 's known characteristics .

Tech rebound : New start - ups can rise from the economy 's ashes Video clutter : eGuiders helps you find the Web 's best videos Cybersecurity : Obama taps expert to assess U.S. defenses against cybercrime Fugitive terrorist Osama bin Laden is most likely hiding out in a walled compound in a Pakistani border town , according to a satellite - aided geographic analysis released today .
A research team led by geographer Thomas Gillespie of the University of California - Los Angeles used geographic analytical tools that have been successful in locating urban criminals and endangered species .
Basing their conclusion on nighttime satellite images and other techniques , the scientists suggest bin Laden may well be in one of three compounds in Parachinar , a town 12 miles from the Pakistan border .
The research incorporates public reports of bin Laden 's habits and whereabouts since his flight from the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan in 2001 .
The results , reported in the MIT International Review , are being greeted with polite but skeptical interest among people involved in the hunt for bin Laden , the al - Qaeda leader behind 9/11 .
Bin Laden 's whereabouts are considered " one of the most important political questions of our time , " the study notes .
" I 've never really believed the sitting - in - a - cave theory .
That 's the last place you would want to be bottled up , " Gillespie says .
The study 's real value , he says , is in combining satellite records of geographic locations , patterns of nighttime electricity use and population - detection methods to produce a technique for locating fugitives .
Essentially , the study generates hiding - place location probabilities .
It starts with " distance decay theory , " which holds that the odds are greater that the person will be found close to where he or she was last seen .
Then the researchers add the " island biographic theory , " which maintains that locales with more resources — palm trees for tropical birds and electricity for wealthy fugitives — are likelier to draw creatures of interest .
" Island biogeographic theory suggests bin Laden would end up in the biggest and least isolated city of the region , " Gillespie says , one among about 26 towns within a 20 - mile distance of Tora Bora .
" To really improve the model , you would need to include intelligence data from 2001 to 2006 , " Gillespie says .
" It has been eight years .
Honestly , I think it is time to be more open .
This is a very important issue for the public . "
The study also makes assumptions that bin Laden might need : • Medical treatment , requiring electricity in an urban setting .
• Security combining few bodyguards and isolation that requires a walled compound .
•
Tree cover to shield outdoor activities from aircraft .
" Of course , it all depends on the accuracy of the information on most recent whereabouts , " Gillespie says .
" I assume that the military has more recent information that would change the hiding place probabilities . "
Says geographic - profiling expert Kim Rossmo of Texas State University in San Marcos , who has worked with the military on adapting police procedures for finding criminals to counterterrorism : " It 's important to think outside the box , and this is an innovative idea worth more pursuit .
However , the authors are much too certain of their conclusions .
" The idea of identifying three buildings in a city of half a million — especially one in a country the authors have likely never visited — is somewhat overconfident . "
The researchers contacted the FBI with their findings , and USA TODAY asked Defense Department officials for reaction , before publication of the study .
" The combination of physical terrain , socio- cultural gravitational factors and the physical characteristic of structures are all important factors in developing an area limitation for terror suspects , " say John Goolgasian of the federal National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency in Bethesda , Md . His spy satellite agency " looks forward to reviewing the article once it is published . "
Gillespie is an expert on finding endangered species on remote islands , typically birds .
A co-author , UCLA 's John Agnew , is an expert on satellite - based population estimates .
The study grew out of an undergraduate seminar on applying geographic profiling to real - world problems .
" We are all wondering where bin Laden is hiding , " Gillespie says .
" We just wanted to offer the techniques we have to help . "

Advertisement A 97 - year - old man from Dorset is believed to have become Britain 's oldest skydiver after jumping out of a plane at 10,000 ft ( 3,048 m ) .
George Moyse , who will celebrate his 98th birthday on Wednesday , landed safely on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire .
Mr Moyse , of Bournemouth , who was strapped to an instructor , carried out a freefall for the first 5,000 ft ( 1,524 m ) at nearly 120 mph ( 193 k mh ) .
He is raising money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) .
Mr Moyse was joined by his 43 - year - old grandson , Edward Brewer , who also completed a tandem jump in aid of the Royal Air Force Association .
It was the first time but it wo n't be the last
George Moyse
After the jump Mr Moyse said : " It was lovely , I really enjoyed it , I was n't frightened at all .
" It was the first time but it wo n't be the last . "
Mr Moyse said that he was an outgoing person who put his old age and agility down to luck .
" I do not sit around , I get about , I go for a walk every day and I do my own cooking , washing , ironing , everything , " he said .
" I have just been lucky to be so agile . "
Earlier , Mr Brewer , of Petersfield , Hampshire , said : " This is all my grandfather 's idea ; he has supported the RNLI all his life so they were the obvious beneficiaries when he decided he really wanted to do the jump . "
In 2008 , RNLI lifeguards in the south west responded to about 8,400 incidents on the beach , helping nearly 10,000 people and saving 39 lives .
The charity operates more than 230 lifeboat stations in the UK and Ireland and has more than 100 lifeguard units on beaches around the UK .

Baltimore ’s Inner Harbor was about as rainy as I ’ve ever seen it on April 15 , so my first reaction to the Tax Day Tea Party being hosted there was surprise ; there were a lot of people , particularly considering the weather , and many had handwritten signs to accompany their umbrellas and ponchos .
Some were angrier than others , and a few just seemed excited for the photo op with friends , but numbers are numbers , and the Baltimore metro area ’s Republicans deserve some credit for sheer mobilization .
All modern - day protests suffer the same nagging sense of inconsequentiality as Baltimore ’s Tax Day Tea party , and most also devolve into a theater of progressively wide - ranging anger like this one , but even by those standards this faux - populist uprising was a chaotic display .
When I say that there were plenty of people there , I mean there were somewhere between 60 and 100 , which is an impressive number for a midweek , mid-afternoon protest set outdoors during a torrential rain .
But the protesters - to - reasons - for - protesting ratio bested those of even the most fringe elements of the 2003 antiwar rallies .
One parent held a sign saying , “ Where ’s My Bailout ? ” while her preteen son ’s sign asked why the government kept stealing his family ’s money .
So are we angry about not receiving government aid , or are we upset for having to pay taxes ?
You ca n’t have both .
( Although , to be fair , maybe the boy and his mother are at odds about the role of government in society . )
It was momentarily heartening to hear the day ’s first speaker — an earnest , megaphone - wielding young man who had helped organize the rally — express his pride in the supposedly diverse crowd .
He mentioned that there were “ Republicans , Democrats , Libertarians , Ron Paul - ites ” and more in attendance , and each demographic was greeted with modest hurrahs .
He explained that we were just one of hundreds of similar groups making our voices heard simultaneously throughout the country , employing the same Up With People rhetoric used by Glenn Harlan Reynolds in his predictably fawning Wall Street Journal op - ed .
What a glorious grassroots movement this is !
And how lucky these righteously angry community organizers have been to coincidentally receive such lavish coverage and star appearances from “ followers ” ( Reynolds ’ term ) like the Fox News Channel !
This of course is the same network that spent months trying to delegitimize Barack Obama ’s experience with street - level activism and earlier expressed the notion that antiwar protests in 2003 were the result of widespread “ ignorance . ”
Nevertheless , an olive branch seemed visible at the Tea Party ’s outset , and my appreciation for the organizers ’ earnestness and peaceful assembly remained .
No one alive would argue that , in a well - functioning economy , the Obama administration ’s deficit - expanding spending plan would be the way to go ; the issue is whether or not the current crisis requires such measures , and civil public discussion about that issue should be welcome by all sides .
But protests are n’t good venues for discussion , and by the midpoint of the second speaker ’s address , things had devolved into a gumbo of rote right - wing talking points .
Addressing the crowd from a raised platform in the Inner Harbor amphitheater , the president of nearby Loyola College ’s College Republicans started by saying that debt is bad , and that it ’s an unfair practice for one generation to pass it along to the next .
So far so good ; who ’s in favor of greater debt ?
Then , apropos of nothing ( and following an unprompted outburst from one crowd member that “ We ’re not pacifists anymore ! ” ) , the young man switched gears and bemoaned the fact that our Navy was unable to defeat the Somali pirates during Easter weekend , information that must have surprised those news - reading protesters among us .
“ Our sailors are left defenseless , ” the speaker continued , “ because they ’re not allowed to arm themselves , ” an odd statement to make before acknowledging , as he did subsequently , that our Navy has over 280 ships — more than three times that of the second biggest Navy in the world .
But , the speaker reminded us , that ’s down from “ the almost 600 that we had under Ronald Reagan , ” which occasioned light kudos from the crowd .
We were then treated to yet another iteration of the incorrect Right - fueled meme that Obama is cutting Defense spending .
“ It ’s going to cut jobs and make us less safe , ” the speaker said , prompting widespread clapping .
And then , just in case we were n’t getting enough red meat right off the Hannity assembly line , the young man repeated the sage bits of wisdom that “ Republicans believe every day is the Fourth of July , and Democrats believe every day is April 15 , ” and so this will be the day that “ we declare our new Declaration of Independence . ”
So much for the unification promised by the opening speaker .
I get it ; people are angry about the economy , about the special treatment that Wall Street ’s been getting in the form of TARP funds , et al .
Maybe they ’re upset about their own financial and employment instability , and maybe , like most people , they do n’t enjoy paying taxes every year .
And since our political process often leaves people feeling like they have no clear outlet for their anger — no one to feel their pain — it can be empowering to gather with other superficially like - minded citizens and emote publically for a few hours .
There ’s no shame in that .
But when you gussy up this kind of impotent yelling with comparisons to Thomas Paine , the Boston Tea Party , Howard Beale , or whatever other agreed - upon symbol of general social anxiety that the Fox anchors start referencing , you give undue credit to anger as a legitimate political position — the foundation for a “ movement , ” as Baltimore ’s gathering was referred to more than once .
If you ’re angry about the economy , then by all means protest the various factors that led to its collapse — greed on Wall Street and in Washington , a culture of unearned loans and insupportable credit , the inordinate rise ( begun under Reagan ) of high finance as a means of earning billions and accruing political influence .
But it ’s all too coincidental that such widespread “ anti-tax , ” “ anti- spending ” fervor gets drummed up right as a new liberal president implements a tax cut on 95 percent of society , and after a Republican president presided over across - the - board spending increases , the initiation of two as - yet - unfinished wars , and unprecedented government encroachment into citizens ’ private lives .
The involvement and excitement of Fox News with these tea parties disproves any possible “ centrist ” or “ common sense ” value therein .
This is the same old Bush - turned Palin - era red- meat Republicanism where defense is the only legitimate spending , taxes are akin to slavery ( another sign in the Baltimore crowd ) , and the value of certain civic activities , like community organizing and presidential protest , is dependent on who ’s doing them .
March against increased federal spending with a few dozen other tax - hating Cold War aficionados and you resemble the Founding Fathers ; march with hundreds of thousands of others against a voluntary , preemptive war , and you ’re dangerous and insane .
And with all this anger , this resentment and mistrust and Job - like misery in Baltimore - area Republicans ’ hearts , they were last week dealt what I ’m sure was a crushing blow given the circumstances : Glenn Beck ’s summer comedy tour is n’t even stopping within 100 miles of their city .
The Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , said today the video images of an officer striking Ian Tomlinson moments before he collapsed and died during the G20 protests in London last week " raise obvious concerns " and should be investigated fully .
His comments come amid growing calls for an independent criminal investigation into Tomlinson 's death .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) has appointed the City of London force , whose officers were involved in policing the march and can be seen on the video footage next to Tomlinson , to investigate the incident rather than using its own independent investigators .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , defended the role of the IPCC in the inquiry , saying there would be a criminal investigation if necessary .
" What 's extremely important from the events last week , from the sad death of Ian Tomlinson , is that there is an inquiry through the IPCC , " she said .
" If it identifies the need for a criminal investigation , then that also needs to be pursued . "
Boris Johnson , the London mayor , is pressing for a " speedy and thorough " inquiry by the police complaints body , his chief spokesman said .
He said the mayor watched the footage today and had been seriously concerned by what he witnessed .
Johnson , who is chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority , is sending his vice - chairman , Kit Malthouse , who is deputy mayor for policing , to meet the IPCC tomorrow .
Many opposition and backbench Labour MPs called for a fully independent inquiry into the attack after the Guardian obtained video footage that showed Tomlinson , a 47 - year - old newspaper seller , being knocked to the ground by a police officer in riot gear moments before he suffered a fatal heart attack .
The Labour MP David Winnick , a member of the home affairs select committee , said questions would be asked about " misleading " police statements in the hours after Tomlinson 's death .
He said : " One thing is quite clear – the inquiry taking place by City of London police is hardly satisfactory , even if that inquiry is being managed or monitored by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
" In view of the unfortunate death of Jean Charles de Menezes four years ago , there is all the more reason for concern , which I share , that all the circumstances of this case must be thoroughly looked into .
It does seem that the original police statement was , to say the least , misleading in view of what has emerged . "
The Liberal Democrat justice spokesman , David Howarth , said : " This video clearly shows an unprovoked attack by a police officer on a passerby .
It is sickening .
There must be a full - scale criminal investigation .
The officer concerned and the other officers shown in the video must immediately come forward . "
Howarth described the " shove " by the police officer as " very heavy " and " done with a great force " .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " Legally , that counts as an assault .
If the consequence of that is bodily harm , then it 's a more serious assault ; if the consequence is grievous bodily harm , then it 's a very serious matter indeed . "
The shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , said the video footage was " extremely alarming " and leaves " big questions to be answered by the police " .
He said : " It 's right that there should be an independent investigation .
The inquiry must be completed quickly so that any further appropriate action can be taken . "
The IPCC said it was analysing footage of the attack on Tomlinson provided by the Guardian .
A spokeswoman said : " We continue to call for witnesses to the incident in Royal Exchange passage to contact us on 0800 096 9071 or email Tomlinson@ipcc.gov.uk . "
LOS ANGELES , April 11 ( UPI ) -- Marijuana is widely sold across California cities , including Los Angeles and Oakland , where some observers say the pot trade has been a boon .
The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that marijuana is available at thousands of storefronts in the two cities .

The newspaper said Los Angeles applications for retail pot outlets have surged since Feb. 26 , when U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. announced the Drug Enforcement Administration would no longer raid dispensaries .
Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis
Zine said about half the city 's sales outlets might be forced to close to control the growth in the number of dispensaries .
" We 're not getting complaints about people smoking marijuana , " he said .
" We 're seeing complaints about the proliferation of facilities .
They opened up right down the street from my district office , in the same complex as a liquor store .
Got the big green leaf in front . "
Although government surveys indicate about 100 million Americans have smoked pot or its resin , hashish , in their lifetimes , and 25 million have done so in the past year .
the public is still wary of pot 's legalization .
In California , some officials are eying pot to help solve the state budget crisis .
Betty Yee , chairwoman of the California State Board of Equalization , in February endorsed legislation to regulate the estimated $ 14 billion marijuana market .
" I think the tide is starting to turn in terms of marijuana being part of the mainstream , " she said .
" The pieces seem to be falling into place . "

Apr-13-09 kernel7025 : Nice Game !
Apr-13-09 ToThe Death : 13 ...a5 may be better to slow down
White 's advance .
Apr-13-09
Once :
Now that was fun .
Black played the usual King 's Indian pawn storm on the kingside and white attacked on the queenside .
But then the tables turned .
White parked a knight on c8 for ages and black left it there cos it had not escape route .
Witty .
Then white attacked on the kingside that was supposed to be black 's territory .
No matter , white does use the b file for a rook incursion .
The finish is cool .
After 42 ... Qd1+ 43 . Ne1 , black has no more meaningful checks and no defence to white 's attack .
It takes some cojones to leave your king so close to the enemy 's queen and a protected passed pawn but in this case he is perfectly safe .
Thanks , CG.com - thoroughly enjoyed that one .
Apr -13-09 BlazeTaktix :
Very interesting game .
Thanks , CG.com !
Keep em up Apr -13-09 furrer :
I agree with ToTheDeath , slowing down the queensideplay after 13 .
a4 is neccesary Apr-13-09
kevin86 : A good game for white - too bad this game could have been played in Los Angeles - AKA : shaky - town .
Apr-13-09 goodevans : Good game .
Better than other games of the day that I ’ve recently looked at .
The only thing that spoilt it slightly for me was that I looked at the result before playing through the game .
I ’d have enjoyed it more if I had n’t known the outcome as I do n’t think I could have guessed it at around move 24 .
25 ... Qg5 seems a complete waste of time .
I think 25 ... Kf7 would have been my choice , intending to compete for the open h - file .

This game was very different , interesting and instructive .

Apr-14-09 UnsoundHero : Black 's troubles started with 30 ... Bx b2 . Instead , I like 30 ... Qf8 with the idea of ... Qg8 , hoping to neutralize white 's attack .
Removing white 's b-pawn actually gives white more possibilities to penetrate on the b-file .
Black has good prospects if he can force a queen trade , and maybe more piece trades .
Because of black 's advanced pawns on the kingside , endgames are favorable .
Apr -14-09 computer chess guy : 35 . a 6 ! was a fine move , much stronger than alternatives .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Simon Johnson ’s article in The Atlantic Monthly continues to generate attention and controversy .
His thesis is essentially this :
In its depth and suddenness , the U.S. economic and financial crisis is shockingly reminiscent of moments we have recently seen in emerging markets ( and only in emerging markets ) : South Korea ( 1997 ) , Malaysia ( 1998 ) , Russia and Argentina ( time and again ) .
In each of those cases , global investors , afraid that the country or its financial sector would n’t be able to pay off mountainous debt , suddenly stopped lending .
And in each case , that fear became self - fulfilling , as banks that could n’t roll over their debt did , in fact , become unable to pay .
This is precisely what drove Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy on September 15 , causing all sources of funding to the U.S. financial sector to dry up overnight .
Just as in emerging - market crises , the weakness in the banking system has quickly rippled out into the rest of the economy , causing a severe economic contraction and hardship for millions of people .
But there ’s a deeper and more disturbing similarity : elite business interests — financiers , in the case of the U.S. — played a central role in creating the crisis , making ever - larger gambles , with the implicit backing of the government , until the inevitable collapse .
More alarming , they are now using their influence to prevent precisely the sorts of reforms that are needed , and fast , to pull the economy out of its nosedive .
The government seems helpless , or unwilling , to act against them .
Top investment bankers and government officials like to lay the blame for the current crisis on the lowering of U.S. interest rates after the dotcom bust or , even better — in a “ buck stops somewhere else ” sort of way — on the flow of savings out of China .
Some on the right like to complain about Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , or even about longer - standing efforts to promote broader homeownership .
And , of course , it is axiomatic to everyone that the regulators responsible for “ safety and soundness ” were fast asleep at the wheel .
But these various policies — lightweight regulation , cheap money , the unwritten Chinese - American economic alliance , the promotion of homeownership — had something in common .
Even though some are traditionally associated with Democrats and some with Republicans , they all benefited the financial sector .
[ my emphasis ]
My only worry about Johnson ’s argument is that he portrays the crisis as the result of individuals ’ actions .
His experience with emerging economies trained him to view the “ Masters of the Universe ” as oligarchs corrupting politics .
But what I think is going on is more insidious .
The problem is not that democracy is becoming oligarchy – although this is a danger we are closer to than we realize given the escalating consolidation of wealth – it is a financial sector that has grown out of balance with the real economy .
Johnson and Paul Krugman both point this out repeatedly in their work – but neither of them identifies this as the problem .
They instead see this as a symptom .
They are probably right – but I have a nagging suspicion that the core of this financial crisis – and that of the Great Depression – is at root a similar imbalance between the size of the financial markets and the size of the real economy .
Fundamentally , it seems there must be a limit as to what percentage of an economy can be managed by the financial markets .
Just as the centralization of decision - making in the government can lead to inefficiencies , so can the centralization of decision - making in large financial instituions .
Many of these factors that Johnson and Krugman talk about – increasing income disparity , asset bubbles , solvency issues , etcetera – can easily be seen as causes and / or effects of this central imbalance .

Last week , Gulf Onshore , a publicly traded , over - the - counter , oil leasing company acquired the assets of Cannex Therapeutics , a cannabis research and development company that was started by Dr. Robert Melamede , Richard Cowan and yours truly .
In simple terms , the owners of Gulf have decided to exit the oil business , sell off their oil leases and merge with Cannex .
For them , our venture is just the ticket for an environmentally friendly , 21st century company .
Best of all , we acquired controlling interest and , with their full support , replaced their team with ours .
Hopefully , people will appreciate that in merging our two companies , we recycled an ugly old oil company , into a cannabis - friendly company instead .
Fox News and other financial networks covered the event , as did Bio Century , a $ 4,000 per year trade magazine for the biotech industry .
Meanwhile , many of my Libertatrian friends were left scratching their heads and wondering , “ Are these guys nuts ?
They 'll NEVER get FDA approval for their cannabis - based medicines . ”
Of course , when we explain our plan , the lights go on and people understand why we are confident we can succeed .
For example , the FDA has already approved phase 3 human trials of another cannabis based product by a pharmaceutical company .
We believe our product is very similar in formulation and much more effective .
In fact , we conducted tests in Canada that confirmed that our product was more desirable .
However , the important point here is that the precedent has already been established for us .
Another objection that we hear is that our venture is too risky and uncertain .
Yes , our venture is a risk and investors could lose everything , but where is there a “ safe ” investment these days ?
Let 's say we had a deal with Lehman Bros .
It was guaranteed by AIG and funded by RBS and our cash is managed by Madoff & Co .
Think how safe that would have looked !
Meanwhile , in the real world , we attempted to launch our new endeavor , while we confronted a stock market crash and a collapse of the credit markets .
Despite such overwhelming challenges , we have persevered and we have made business history .
So , for us , right now , acquiring a publicly traded company is a significant accomplishment , not just for us , but for all who believe in this miraculous , healing herb .
Everyone congratulates us , but then they go out of their way to inform me that the odds are just too staggering for me to pull this off .
Well , excuse me , but I have a proven track record of repeatedly defying enormous odds and still succeeding :
No one has ever survived my form of cancer for more than a few years , yet this is my 35th year of surviving this deadly disease and cannabis is the only medicine I use .
For most of those 35 years people laughed at me when I told them the cannabis was keeping my cancer under control .
Today , our company has a database of 510 scientific , peer - reviewed studies showing that cannabinoids kill cancer cells .
No one believed me when I promised to deliver the half million dollars we needed to collect signatures and qualify Prop. 215 for the ballot , but I did .
Everyone said we would never succeed , but I knew we had the polling numbers and the element of surprise .
I told our wealthy sponsors , “ It will never be easier or less expensive than NOW . ”
Fortunately , they listened and gave us the money .
No one believed I could fight off 19 felony charges with a minimum of 40 years in prison , but I did AND so did you , because you supported my battle with the Blue Meanies and many of you even contributed to my defense fund .
No one , not even my closest friends and family , believed me when I insisted that I would ultimately be vindicated , my convictions dismissed , and my record expunged , yet that is exactly what came to pass .
As you can see , I have an extraordinary track record of overcoming seemingly impossible odds .
I ask that you respect my track record and join our venture .
Vote with your wallet , so we can work together to show the world that we mean business .
Even if you are only investing $ 100 through an online brokerage site , you 'll still be making a statement and you 'll be investing in a prosperous future of your own values and beliefs .
It amazes me how excited my friends and fellow activist become about paying the government $ 100 million in taxes .
How about creating a $ 100 million cannabis - based medicine company instead ?
Personally , I find that far more exciting and creative .
Can we actually create a viable , cannabis - based pharmaceutical company with FDA approved medicines that are nontoxic , organic , and highly effective ?
All I can tell you is what I tell everyone else :
“ It will never be easier or less expensive then NOW . ”
If it would be a suitable investment for you , we are a publicly traded , over - the - counter ( Bulletin Board , not Pink Sheets ) stock , you can look us up with our current symbol NASD OTCBB : GFON and invest and own a stake in a future world where cannabis is accepted and approved for medical use .
But what about the name ?
Do n't worry , we will be announcing a change in the company name to Cannabis Science Inc. ( CSI ) , later this week .
A new find in Arctic Canada strongly suggests that animals migrated from Asia to North America not around Alaska , as once thought , but directly across a freshwater sea floating atop the warm , salty Arctic Ocean .
In 2006 , John Tarduno , professor of geophysics at the University of Rochester and leader of the Arctic expedition , led an expedition to the Arctic to study paleomagnetism — the Earth 's magnetic field in the distant past .
Knowing from previous expeditions to the area that the rocks were rich with fossils , Tarduno kept an eye out for them and was rewarded when one of his undergraduate students uncovered the amazingly well preserved shell of a turtle .
Together with collaborator Donald Brinkman of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Canada , they later named the fossil Aurorachelys , or aurora turtle .
The turtle strongly resembles a freshwater Mongolian species , which raised obvious questions about how it came to be in the marine waters of the North American Arctic .
Tarduno 's paleomagnetic expertise , which allows him to ascertain when points on Earth 's crust were at specific locations , allows him to rule out the possibility that millions of years of tectonic activity had brought the fossil from southern climes .
The turtle was clearly a native of the area .
Pictured is Aurorachelys , a fossil of freshwater turtle found in the Arctic .
Credit : University of RochesterPublished today in Geology , the finding also suggests that a rapid influx of carbon dioxide some 90 million years ago was the likely cause of a super - greenhouse effect that created extraordinary polar heat .
"
We 've known there 's been an interchange of animals between Asia and North America in the late Cretaceous period , but this is the first example we have of a fossil in the High Arctic region showing how this migration may have taken place , " says John Tarduno , professor of geophysics at the University of Rochester and leader of the Arctic expedition .
" We 're talking about extremely warm , ice - free conditions in the Arctic region , allowing migrations across the pole .
" As to how a freshwater turtle migrated across a salty ocean ; Tarduno points to the results of drilling by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program 's ACEX expedition that demonstrated episodes of unusually fresh surface waters in the past Arctic Ocean .
Tarduno and his students had been studying massive lava flows that cover some of the High Arctic islands , and believes the same volcanic events that produced those igneous rocks also could have produced a series of islands along a low underwater mountain range in the Arctic Ocean called Alpha Ridge .
If the ridge did indeed poke above the surface of the water at one time , it would have given the turtles — and countless other species — the ability to island - hop all the way from ancient Russia to Canada .
At the time the aurora turtle lived , the Arctic Ocean was probably even more separated from the global oceanic circulation system than it is today .
Numerous rivers from the adjacent continents would have poured fresh water into the ancient Arctic sea .
Since fresh water is lighter than marine water , Tarduno thinks it may have rested on top of the salty ocean water , allowing a freshwater animal such as the aurora turtle to migrate with relative ease .
Tarduno also believes it 's possible that the same volcanic rock may not have allowed only the turtle 's migration , but also would have contributed to creating the climate in which the turtle thrived .
"
We found this turtle right on top of the last flood basalts — a large stretch of lava from a series of giant volcanic eruptions , " says Tarduno .
" That leads us to believe that the warming may have been caused by volcanoes pumping tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide into the Earth 's atmosphere .
There 's evidence that this volcanic activity happened all around the planet — not just the Arctic .
If it all happened on a short enough timescale , it could cause a super - greenhouse effect .
"
He notes that current changes in the recent Arctic climate have affected his field studies .
" It is difficult to separate short - term climate trends from a longer - term pattern , but our last few field seasons in the High Arctic have been extraordinarily warm , " says Tarduno .
" Sometimes students exchange parkas for short - sleeve shirts .
" Tarduno plans to return to the Arctic to look for places where other fossils might be located .
He says the site he 's found is incredibly rich , already yielding fossils he and his team are still analyzing .
He says he hopes to paint a more complete picture of the time when the Arctic was warm .

Born of god but raised by humans , Perseus , the demigod son of mighty Zeus , the king of the gods , vows to take his revenge on Hades , the terrifying ruler of the Underworld , when he sees his mortal family perish .
As the race of men summons up the courage to rebel against the gods of Olympus , the doomed city of Argos becomes a battlefield , as Hades threatens to unleash the legendary sea-monster , Kraken , unless the fair Princess Andromeda willingly offers herself as a sacrifice .
Now , having nothing more to lose , Perseus embarks on a daring , peril - laden quest to stop the forces of evil before Hades plunges the world into chaos and darkness .
But , to survive the relentless onslaught of demons and terrible adversaries , Perseus must first embrace his destiny .
Will Perseus defy the gods , and save humankind in the clash of the Titans ?

THERE is nothing particularly unusual about the living room of the two - story town house that Scott Veazie shares with his wife in Washougal , Wash . , except for one piece of furniture in a corner : a full - size replica of the captain ’s chair from the bridge of the U.S.S.
Enterprise , as seen in the original “ Star Trek ” television series .
Mr. Veazie , 27 , was not yet born when that show first went on the air in the 1960s ; even his parents were only teenagers .
During his childhood , there were “ Star Trek ” spinoffs on TV with more sophisticated special effects than the original , and a more contemporary sensibility , and there were also movies featuring the old show ’s actors aboard updated versions of the Enterprise .
But Mr. Veazie , who watched endless reruns of the original series with his mother in the 1980s , was never drawn to those later incarnations .
“ The original show was the first one I saw , ” he said .
“ It was so idealistic .
A lot of us kids wanted to be Captain Kirk  and part of that was the chair . ”
Mr. Veazie , a manager at Underwriters Laboratories , built the chair himself last year , and has been gratified to find , since installing it in the living room in May , that “ when someone comes in , it ’s the first thing they comment on . ”
Actually , no .
There is a major economic power out there which has yet to face a single bank failure - Canada .
He continues to insist that the economic environment in the UK is a global problem that nobody could have foreseen .
So has every country had to rescue its financial sector and refinance its banks ?
Surely that would be the case if such a claim were accurate ?
Our beleaguered Prime Minister has spent much time of late trotting around the globe , offering his unique brand of optimism to all those countries he believes to be in a worse economic state than his own .
Unabashed by stinging criticism from , among others , the French President and a German Finance Minister , Gordon Brown still believes that he alone has the answers to the world ’s problems .
With its geographical proximity and close economic ties , you could easily assume that Canada would suffer more from the US economic meltdown than most .
So I 'm forced to ask , how is it that Canada has managed to stave off the crisis we face here in Britain ?
Now I know that Gordon is n't prone to taking constructive advice from members of the Conservative Party , or from anybody else for that matter , but perhaps this is the question that he himself should now be asking .
Clearly he would n't be the first if he did .
Perhaps this was the reason for the newly - elected American President , Barack Obama , making the first Presidential visit of his administration to Canada and not the UK .
He clearly wanted to see what lessons he could learn from his northerly neighbours .
The contrast in Canada 's record with that of the UK is quite startling .
To begin with , the European bank capitalisation ratio is a hefty 60 to 1 , whilst that of Canadian banks is a much healthier 18 to 1 : common sense regulation is a wonderful thing .
The Canadian economics lesson does n't stop here .
During the global period of prosperity , Canada had twelve years of budget surpluses .
As the rest of the world acted like students who had just received their first real pay cheque , Canada foresaw the problems which lay ahead and prepared .
The Canadian Government has restructured the national pension system , placing it on a firm fiscal footing , unlike Gordon 's raid on our own to the tune of over £ 100 billion .
Canada has a points - based immigration system , allowing sufficient numbers into the country to meet its needs for growth , but not so many as to overload local services .
Canada has proven that it is possible to invest in healthcare and education whilst at the same time being fiscally prudent .
What a shame it is that for Britain , in years to come this will be known as the " lost decade " .
During that decade , Gordon Brown has ransacked our pensions , mortgaged our children 's futures , failed to regulate banks and wasted trillions - all after being gifted a golden opportunity during a period of prosperity , to ensure economic security and stability for our country for generations to come .
Perhaps somebody should have pointed out this Canadian efficiency to Gordon Brown 's Government before the decision was made not to award the Intercity Train contract to Bombardier , in Derby , a company with strong Canadian connections .
The Canadians , it would appear , know how to run things .
You 've got to admire Canada , especially for showing how so very different things can be .
And as world leaders continue to discuss their various plans for saving the global economy , we should all look to one man .
Perhaps not as well known as President Obama and perhaps not as globally savvy as President Sarkozy , the Canadian Prime Minister , Stephen Harper is the only G20 leader with reason to be confident .
Is n’t the picture below , of Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan and his wife , marvellously illustrative of our politicians ’ attitudes towards us ?
The Chavans are n’t expressing their inner feelings here — they ’re showing us that they have voted .
The election commission has mandated that in these elections , indelible ink is to be applied to the middle finger of every voter .
So if your sleazy neighbourhood politician accosts you in the street and asks you if you voted for him , show him the finger .

“ It ’s a self - conscious emotion , reflecting how you feel about yourself , and it has this important social component , ” Dr. Tracy said .
“ It ’s the strongest status signal we know of among the emotions ; stronger than a happy expression , contentment , anything . ”

In one continuing experiment , Dr. Tracy , along with Azim Shariff , a doctoral student at British Columbia , have found that people tend to associate an expression of pride with high status  even when they know that the person wearing it is low on the ladder .
In their study , participants impulsively assigned higher status to a prideful water boy than to a team captain who looked ashamed .
The implications of this are hard to exaggerate .
Researchers tend to split pride into at least two broad categories .
So - called authentic pride flows from real accomplishments , like raising a difficult child , starting a company or rebuilding an engine .
Hubristic pride , as Dr. Tracy calls it , is closer to arrogance or narcissism , pride without substantial foundation .
The act of putting on a good face may draw on elements of both .
But no one can tell the difference from the outside .
Expressions of pride , whatever their source , look the same .
“ So as long as you ’re a decent actor , and people do n’t know too much about your situation , all systems are go , ” said Lisa A. Williams , a doctoral candidate in psychology at Northeastern University .
The various flavors of pride may even feel similar on the inside , when the stakes are high enough .
“ She was always scrupulous about keeping up appearances to herself , ” wrote Edith Wharton of her tragic heroine Lily Bart in “ The House of Mirth . ”
“ Her personal fastidiousness had a moral equivalent , and when she made a tour of inspection in her own mind there were certain closed doors she did not open . ”
If you believe it , so will they .
A feeling of pride , when it ’s convincing , acts something like an emotional magnet .
In a recent study , Ms. Williams and Dr. DeSteno of Northeastern had a group of 62 undergraduates take tests supposedly measuring their spatial I.Q .
The patterns flashed by too fast for anyone to truly know how well they did .
Sen .
Bob Corker said that Democrats were considering a new stimulus package this morning on Fox News Sunday and was incredulous about it which of course is nonsense .
Corker :
Still the major issue in our country is credit and it's very difficult for me to believe we 're considering talking about another so - called stimulus package when , in fact , we still have not dealt seriously with the credit issue .
That is absolutely incredible to me .
Barney Frank would n't let Corker 's comments stand .
Frank : Chris , Chris , excuse me , but can I respond to Bob Corker 's partisan attack in the name of partisanship ?
Because the fact is nobody in the administration or on our side in Congress is focusing on the second stimulus .
We only answered that when asked about it .
Frank :
This notion that oh , stop focusing on this second stimulus , we 're not .
My committee and the committee I chair , we are focusing on the credit issue .
Mr. Geithner is ...
Chris Wallace seemed reluctant to let Frank rebut the charges .
" Congressman , can we turn to the -- I know you like to talk substance , " said Wallace .
Frank :
Well , I do want to rebut a false charge , that we have somehow focused on a second stimulus and not credit and that 's simply not accurate .
Wallace : " I can give Sen .
Corker , I was trying to stay on substance .
Frank :
Well , Chris , do n't let political attacks go , " he replied .
Wallace : " I can give Sen .
Corker , I was trying to stay on substance .
Wallace : Go ahead Sen .
Corker , if you 'd rather get into a food fight , go ahead .
John Amato :
Who says Palestinians and Israelis can't work together to solve problems ?
A story ( via Abu Muqawama ) from the Department of Things That Could Have Turned Out Much Worse :
A young Israeli woman who works as a stripper was found intoxicated in Ramallah Friday morning , and returned to Israel with the aid of the Palestinian security sources .
She was handed over to the police .
Palestinians called the offices of the Civil Administration Friday morning and reported that an Israeli woman in her twenties was seen at the heart of town .
" They said that she did n't quite understand what was going on , " said Major Shadi Seif of the Ramallah District Coordination Office .
The IDF immediately alerted a police unit to the nearest checkpoint , and within 10 minutes the woman was brought to the place by the Palestinian officers .

Yes varies Yes
Update : Due to popular demand in the comments we have also reviewed DropBox Storage here .
Welcome to a review of five on - line storage solutions that are on offer today on the net .
I have chosen them because if you type , “ on - line storage ” into Google , these are the ones that take up the top spaces .
I have also chosen a sneaky gdrive too which may be of interest if you like using existing technologies like gmail creatively .
Read on for more …
Mozy
So , without further ado , and in no particular order , lets look into the first offering from Mozy .
With the free account you are entitled to 2GB of storage , and with the referral scheme , for every person that uploads their data , you and the referred , get an extra 256MB of disk space .
They assure us in the blurb , they have powerful computers that can multiply by 256 !
You can also pay roughly £ 3.50 per month for unlimited space .
Mozy has a client that sits on your computer .
And after you sign up to Mozy , you are invited to download the client , and set it up .
Once you put in your username and password , that is e-mailed after sign - up , you go on to choose what you want to back up .
Simply check the boxes that you wish to back up , and click next .
Now , the Achilles heal of all these programs is your upstream bandwidth .
The line I was using was supposed to be 512 kbps , which is pretty pretty good , however …
Well , the initial backup is always going to take a while , so do n’t be put off .
The client disappears into the system tray , and you do n’t notice that it ’s happening .
Still , three hours for under 200 meg is a while , and if I wanted to back up my main computer at 200 MB every 3 hours , well you can apply the maths .
Once the upload is done , that ’s it , further backups will take a much shorter time .
You can now repeat this process on as many machines as you like , as long as your storage limit holds out .
Also , to restore data , the time it takes should be much quicker than the upload .
Here is where the benefit of an installed client comes into it ’s own .
If you right click on your client in the taskbar , you then get access to a host of options .
You can select your own files to backup , select a schedule to backup , and a myriad of other options to tinker with .
To restore your files , you have several options as well .
With the client installed , a new drive appears in “ My Computer ” , you can simply drag and drop .
You can right click on a file that needs to be restored , and choose restore , going back to a previous version .
Or , you can backup from the web
Finally for Mozy , the website is set out well , and as far as ease of use is concerned , it very user friendly .
There is a choice of encryption on the server , so all files will be safe from prying eyes .

Humyo
Humyo is the next one I would like to write about , although I signed up for 123 - drive powered by Humyo .
I later tried to sign up for Humyo , and was told I already had an account , so I will treat them the same .
Again , this offering is completely free , and for no investment , you get 10 GB of disk space , oddly split into two 5GB partitions .
One for media files , and one for your other files .
With an investment of £ 3.99 per month you can upgrade to 100GB .
The site uses a Java drag and drop to upload your files , the Java client has the advantage of not needing to be installed , and already working on many devices .
Once you sign up , you see a quickly fathomable website that benefits from a simple interface .
If you chose not to run with Java , there is the option of a standard upload .
This is a pop-up that lets you select files you would like to backup .
You can also use the Java drag and drop .
Once the files have been uploaded , they appear in the main window .
From here you have some nice options that appear to be missing from the previous offering , you can share your files and folders with one another .
There is a space for your files , a “ Teamspaces ” folder , and an “ Other People ’s Files ” folder .
All of this means you can make collaboration easy .
Or simply share your holiday photos with the folks .
There is an inbuilt ability to view photos and video from within the browser , great for taking huge amounts of photos , and boring your mates with on their own computer .
If you fancy splashing the cash with a business account , you also get a snap shot capability .
The encryption used is 256 bit , more than enough .
They also boast that the servers are held in an old Bank of England vault , so physical security should not be a problem .
Although it does leave me wondering why it ’s ex-Bank of England if it ’s so secure ?
Overall , Humyo is a decent offering that allows many devices to share data due to the Java client .
It also offers 10 GB for free !
Ca n’t be bad .

Livedrive
The first of the non -free offerings is Livedrive .
This service is £ 39.95 a year which works out at about £ 3.40 a month .
With Livedrive , you get either a Java drag and drop upload , or you can download the client .
The client is easy to install , but you do need the .
Net framework 1.1 .
You get 100GB on the standard account , and unlimited with the pro account .
Then , once installed , you get both the Livedrive conrol panel , and an L : drive .
The L : drive works just like an internal drive in your computer , you can simply drag and drop files in and out .
The control panel lets you configure quite a few options , I will mention just the main ones .
First is bandwidth throttling that makes sure the app does not squeeze out any other important services running over your line , a very useful feature .
You can also configure the off - line file settings .
You can allow Livedrive to store your files on a cache for off line browsing , and to speed things up a bit if you have a slow line .
You can also configure exceptions to files you do n’t want cached .
Certain documents can also be given priority when uploading and downloading , so that word document you have been slaving over will be backed up first .
For all the files you have uploaded , there is either a web editor , or viewer depending on what you are looking at .
You can also manage your Facebook photos with the built - in Facebook application .
There will also be support for all your mobile devices soon , including iPhones and Blackberrys .
The website looks polished , and the file structure view will be familiar to anyone who has used a computer .
There is also a section for files that have been shared with you .
Collaboration just being given the nod .
A fully featured offering that gives you all options the free ones do , but at a price .

Box.net
UPDATE : The folkes at box .
net have been on to us regarding their accounts .
Apparently they do offer a 1GB lite account with a 25 MB upload limit .
Hope this clears things up .
The next on - line storage solution is again one that offers no free disk space , although for £ 5.55 per month , you get 5 GB at your disposal .
The site has no client , and upload is driven either by Flash or Ajax , the decision can be made in the settings .
The web page you are confronted with is good and simple .
Moving your cursor over the picture files gives you a small preview which is good .
Not the same for video files though .
Clicking on the arrow to the right , then gives you a list of options partly depending on the content .
As you would expect , the usual suspects are there , delete , properties , rename .
And a few you may not expect , Send with Gmail , Version History , and invite collaborators .
A really nice feature of Box is the option to create on - line documents .
At the moment , this seems limited to a Word type document called a webdoc .
You also seem to be unable to edit it in any other way apart from a browser .
The good news is you can get people to read it or write on it simply by sharing it on the web , or by sending whomever an e-mail containing the link .
As well as the document pages , you can create discussion threads , and add bookmarks , and they all live on your front page within easy access .
With the documents , you also have a revision history , so when the cat jumps over your keyboard and manages to save it , you can go back to a pre-catted version .
Do n’t be too disheartened by the lack of office compatibility though , because Box has a few tricks up it ’s sleeve .
If you go to the OpenBox link you find a whole host of applications that you can add that offer so many options .
There are apps for opening MS Word documents , apps for PDFs , Excel files , Powerpoints , and Open Office documents .
There are apps for Facebook , image editing , and even faxing .
In fact there is so much here you could accomplish almost any office task with Box alone .
Box offers a lot more than the other three in terms of connectivity and compatibility with the office , and is obviously aimed more at collaboration .

Gmail
My last option is not only free , but if you have a Gmail account , you are already half way there .
If you know this trick , then you are aware that there are a few limitations .
For example , you can only upload files of up to 10MB , and the client will only work on XP , but once your file are uploaded , you will be able to get you files from anywhere you can access your Gmail account .
Once you have installed the client , click on the drive object that appears in “ My Computer ” , and enter your details into the dialog .
Once connected , you can drag and drop files into your drive .
These files will then appear in your Gmail inbox .
Simple !
If you decide to go this route , realise that this is not supported by Google , so one day , the party could be over on a whim .
Now your data is there , you can view your pictures , send them on , or download them to a computer .
Although this option is cheap , it does have some fairly big limitations .
And be aware , it could stop at any time .

Data Backup Technology
Worth a mention , though I ’m afraid I was unable to test it , is Backup - technology .
This site is for the business end of online data storage , that would like to entrust their backup regime to a company that can offer instant off - site backup .
They can offer on - line backup , disaster recovery , and business continuity , all through the virtue of an off - site backup solution .
If , heaven help us , your company headquarters became the towering inferno , could you say that all your tapes would be safe ?
Your servers in a fireproof enviroment ?
Quite a few people would probably say no , simply because the resources are not there .
Imagine then a sinario whereby if the worst did happen , then you could relocate , and restore all your data to your temporary offices , and away you go .
Better still , the responsibility for the backed up data is in someone elses hands .
Belive me , the IT team will have enough to do , and the benefit of someone else restoring your data will be a god send .
They can also offer a hot E - mail backup , and virtual server backup .
Invaluable resources if yo work in the corporate sector .
My worst nightmare is loosing exchange .
The idea that we can fail over to a working copy makes me feel a lot more easy .
E-mail scares are the worst !
As I say this option may not be for the every day user , but those of us who work in IT may well benefit from one of these solutions , and who knows , maybe , if your data is that important , give them a call .
Never costs to get a quote .
Hopefully you now have a better idea of what is on offer out there , and as ever , the rule of thumb seems to be you get what you pay for .
I have to say that all of the offerings have something to offer , and to a degree , are tailored for different needs .
If it were me I think I could live with Mozy .
However , if I needed the office anywhere features , you could not do better than Box .
WASHINGTON : Terrorism pays .
That may well be the message the United States and its allies send out to the world this week as they line up billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan despite the country���s military and intelligence agencies being implicated by American officials in acts and practice of terrorism .
Ignoring confirmation about the Pakistan���s continued support and use of terrorism obtained through electronic surveillance and informants , and even brazen affirmation by Pakistani officialdom itself , the Obama administration is set to lavish a bonanza that might eventually add up to more than $ 30 -$ 35 billion over the next decade .
About half the windfall will come from the US and the other half from its allies such as Japan , EU , and Gulf countries .
Washington is set to announce its largesse of around $ 15 billion of US tax - payer money in course of its new Af - Pak policy to be unveiled Friday , followed by a conference in Tokyo on April 17 of the so - called '' Friends of Pakistan ' ' where Islamabad is pitching for $ 10 billion .
This is in addition to the $ 7.6 billion pledged by the IMF and various donors , all at the instance of the United States , which believes Pakistan will disintegrate , with disastrous consequences all around , if it is not rescued with massive amounts of aid .
Congressional staff and sources associated with drawing up the aid package say there will be stringent conditions and tough oversight attached to the assistance , but critics of the policy regard the assurances as credulous .
The Indian government has not opposed the package .
'' If they ( the United States ) have not learned from the past , there is little we can do , '' one official said on background , referring to the Reagan era bonanza when untrammeled support for Pakistan���s military emboldened the country to adopt terrorism as a state policy .
That policy is still very much in place , going by a stunning page one New York Times account on Thursday in which Pakistani officials admit first - hand knowledge of ties between the ISI and extremists and even justify .
They tell the paper that the contacts are less threatening than the American officials depict and are part of a strategy to maintain influence in Afghanistan for the day when American forces would withdraw and leave what they fear could be a power vacuum to be filled by India .
'' In intelligence , you have to be in contact with your enemy or you are running blind , '' the paper quotes a senior Pakistani military officer as describing Islamabad���s strategy of backing the terrorists .
But evidently , Pakistan 's activity constitutes more than just contact with the enemy .
The NYT account , striking for the candid detail revealed by unnamed US and Pakistani officials , said Pakistan���s support to the Taliban and other militant outfits is coordinated by operatives inside the shadowy S Wing of the ISI .
The report says the ISI also shared intelligence with Lashkar - e - Taiba accused in the Mumbai attacks and '' provided protection for it . ''
It did say when this cooperation and protection took place .
But other new details reveal that the ISI is aiding a broader array of militant outfits with more diverse types of support than was previously known , even months after Pakistani officials said that the days of the ISI ���s playing a double game had ended , the paper reported .
One such outfit is the Haqqani network , which by American accounts bombed the Indian Embassy in Kabul with help from the ISI .
The attack killed 54 people , including an Indian diplomat and a military commander .
Pakistan���s army chief Pervez Kiyani , a former ISI Director - General , subsequently described the Haqqani network as Pakistan���s '' strategic asset . ''
But according to the NYT , the ISI ���s S wing not only helps such networks with fuel and ammunition to fight American troops in Afghanistan , but also replenishes its ranks with recruits from madrassas in Pakistan .
There is even evidence that ISI operatives meet regularly with Taliban commanders to discuss whether to intensify or scale back violence before the Afghan elections , it said .
None of this appears to have made a whit of a difference in the planned US largesse for Pakistan .
If anything , US officials and analysts argue it is all the more reason to rush aid to Pakistan so that its democracy and social sector can be strengthened and it can be walked away from the abyss .
'' If there is a better way to do this , we are all ears , '' a senior Congressional aide involved in the process , said .
While some analysts say that Pakistan extracts aid by pointing a gun to its own head , key figures in the Washington establishment do n't want to take the chance that Pakistan ends up falling into the abyss .
US officials , who typically make strenuous effort to shield the Pakistani leadership from charges of fomenting terrorism , maintain that mid-level ISI operatives cultivate relationships that are not approved by their bosses .
They say it is unlikely that top officials in Islamabad are directly coordinating the clandestine efforts .
But Pakistani officials themselves appear to scoff at American credulity in the NYT report , saying it is part of their long term strategy to keep their options open when the U.S withdraws from Afghanistan .
That expectation got a boost this week when US President Barack Obama spoke of an '' exit strategy ' ' in Afghanistan .
Although Obama did not specifically refer to any troop withdrawals ( on the contrary , he has just directed induction of 17,000 more troops ) , the fact that Washington is even contemplating an exit strategy seems to justify Pakistan���s outlook of keeping its Taliban and terrorism powder dry .
Rise of the child women :
The new breed of girls as young as ten who dream of manicures , diets and breast implants
Model ambition : Georgie Swann , 10 , wants to have breast implants to look like Jordan as soon as she turns 18
Georgie Swann fashions herself on the celebrity icons in Heat and Look - the weekly glossies she loves to read - and spends a lot of time in her bedroom trying on her favourite outfits and her large collection of shoes and handbags .
' Georgie finds it almost impossible to walk past a mirror without checking her appearance and seeing if she 's put on an ounce of weight , ' says her proud mother Dawn .
Dawn , a 47 - year - old teacher , lives in Shirley in Solihull with her husband Julian , also 46 , who works for the National Grid .
The couple have two older daughters , Stacey , 25 , and Laura , 20 .
Georgie , you may be disturbed to discover , is only ten .
' The model Jordan is Georgie 's absolute idol , and she tells me and her father that as soon as she 's 18 she 's going to have breast implants so she can be just like her .
She 's been saving up her pocket money for the operation for the past few years .
' She adores make - up , too - she must have 20 lip glosses .
She 's seen an expensive designer set of make - up , and that 's what she wants now . '
Forget pass the parcel or musical bumps : the last party Georgie went to involved a stretched pink limousine , a disco and oodles of make - up .
' I can't remember when she last played outside , ' says her mother , who insists that regardless of what others may think of her daughter 's desire to grow up fast , she can do little about it anyway .
' It does worry me that people often take her for 13 or 14 .
And she 's so independent , I can't tell her anything . '
Georgie - a charming , beautiful child - is already ambitious and wants to be a model when she grows up .
Not that she has n't grown up already .
And , in that , she is not alone .
Bob Reitemeier is chief executive of the Children 's Society , which recently reported on a two - year study into childhood in the UK .
' There 's no doubt that we are putting so much pressure on our children today to grow up too quickly , ' he says .
' What really worries me are the increasing levels of anxiety among children , especially young girls , who feel they are not thin enough , not beautiful enough , and compare themselves to the impossible images of their airbrushed idols in magazines . '

Another recent survey , by children 's organisation TellUs3 , questioned 150,000 children and found that an astonishing 26 per cent of ten - year - old girls are obsessed with their weight and feel they 're not thin enough .
Meanwhile , more and more girls under the age of ten are being diagnosed with anorexia .
Reitemeier says : ' Childhood is changing so much .
We are allowing them to access information which is way beyond their level of maturity in terms of sexual and relationship behaviour . '
The irony is that children like Georgie are by no means in the minority .
Today , the majority of ten - year - old girls are obsessed by hair , fashion and make - up .
Their favourite TV shows are American soaps such as Friends and Saved By The Bell , which centre around relationships .
Reitemeier says : ' Children are being inundated with images which they are simply not emotionally mature enough to cope with . '
His fears are supported by recent statistics which showed that fewer than 20 per cent of children play outside on a regular basis .
As parents work longer hours and have less time to spend with their children , it is all too easy to dump them in front of a television screen .
Yet many TV programmes aimed at teenagers , and music videos which are virtually soft porn , are played on an almost continuous loop on satellite channels .
' The key to a happy , secure childhood - which is vitally important in creating stable and responsible adults - is to feel good about yourself and know who you are , ' says Reitemeier .
' If you 're constantly measuring yourself up against an impossible image and being made to desire emotions for which you are simply not ready , then I am very concerned about the level of anxiety and depression these young people may face .
' It is a ticking time bomb for the future . '
Though many people will be disturbed that these girls are so mature - and even precocious - parents like Dawn feel their daughters ' obsessions are harmless and fun .
She does , though , admit her daughter is driven .
' She really cares about looking her best at all times , and she 's always wanting new things , ' says Dawn .
' We can't walk past a shoe shop without her wanting to go in . '
Other parents find themselves struggling to keep their daughters ' increasingly adult obsessions in check .
Daisy Phillips is obsessed with clothes and watching teen soaps
Yet there are other mothers who positively encourage their daughter 's fascination with shopping and consumerism .
Annalie Maher , who runs her own public relations firm , has two children , Olivia , ten , and Krishna , five .
Annalie is married to Mahesh , a computer consultant , and the family live near Milton Keynes .
' Olivia and I have really bonded over shopping , ' says Annalie .
' I adore fashion , and Olivia and I flick through the magazines like Vogue and Elle together .
' I find it terrifying how precocious she is , but she 's highly intelligent and she really knows her own mind .
' She is extremely grown - up for ten , and has very definite ideas about her own style .
She spends ages blow - drying her hair to make sure it is perfect , and she always looks immaculate .
She spends a lot of time on her skin , using a face wash and moisturiser . '
Annalie says Olivia is very conscious of what she eats and of the need to be slim .
' When she was born , she had to have an operation which left her with a rounded tummy , but I told her when she 's older , if she wants , I will pay for a tummy tuck . '
In the school holidays , Olivia is booked in for manicures and pedicures , and she 's recently held a girls ' makeover party .
Annalie says : ' She certainly knows about designer items and their desirability .
Recently , when we had to wait at an airport , Olivia spent her time negotiating for a Chanel lip gloss .
It 's now her proudest possession . '
The recent Children 's Society report , The Good Childhood Inquiry , made some substantial demands for a change to this galloping trend to turn children into mini-adults , exposing them to all manner of inappropriate imagery , much of it sexual .
One particularly disturbing figure is that 16 per cent of girls in the UK now start puberty at eight - the youngest age ever recorded .
The EU is so concerned that a team of clinical experts is investigating why the onset of puberty is happening to younger and younger girls .
Bob Reitemeier says it is up to parents to stand firm , and establish clear boundaries as to what is appropriate and what is not appropriate to wear , or watch on TV .
But it 's almost impossible to stop ten - year - old girls from chatting to their friends , reading certain magazines and being obsessed about their figures .
Headstrong : Abigail Dyer ( L ) with Georgia .
Abigail wore high heels , make - up and a boob tube for her school disco
Catherine Phillips ' daughter Daisy is also ten .
Like many girls of her generation , she is obsessed with clothes and loves to watch teen soaps .
Catherine , 37 , from Braintree in Essex , is married to John , 43 , a chartered land surveyor , and the couple have an eight - year - old son , George .
' Daisy wo n't listen to me any more , ' she says .
' Some of the outfits she puts together are terrible , but she insists she knows what suits her .
She 's into the " Gothic " look .
At her age , I was playing down by the river and climbing trees , whereas she 's painting her nails and doing her hair .
' And the TV set would be on all day and every day if she had her way .
' I worry that she 's trying to look too old , but it 's very hard to put my foot down .
She looks much older than she is , and she goes off shopping with her friends .
Although I think it 's sad that she 's growing up so fast , I do n't want to isolate her from her friends .
It 's what they all like to do . '
It 's a complaint that 's all too familiar to Nicole Dyer , whose daughter Abigail is very fashion - conscious - so much so that Nicole says she often has to put her foot down about what she wears .
Nicole , who is 38 and a housewife from Romford in Essex , lives with her husband Gary , 41 , a businessman .
The couple also have a son , Henry , eight , and a daughter , Poppy , three .
' Abigail has always been headstrong , and she knows her own mind , ' says Nicole .
' She went to a performing arts school at primary level , and she 's always wanted to be a model .
From the age of five , she was telling me what she wanted to wear . '
Nicole says now that Abigail has started secondary school , she 's dressing more like a 14 or 15 - year - old .
' It does worry me , ' she says .
' She 'll come down before the school disco wearing loads of make - up , high heels and a tight boob tube with a T - shirt underneath .
' She looks amazing - but certainly not 12 years old .
She 's often taken as being much older than she is . '
Occasionally , Nicole does put her foot down .
' I do n't like her looking false and tarty , ' she says .
' And I hate to see her caked in make - up .
' My parents say she 's growing up way too fast , but what can I do to stop her ? '
WASHINGTON  President Obama delivered an ultimatum to General Motors and Chrysler on Monday , telling them to adopt radical changes in short order or face bankruptcy  a move that came after a series of somber discussions in which he concluded that a controlled bankruptcy might be the best way to reorganize the two ailing auto giants .
In the end , the president decided to throw the companies a short lifeline .
He gave G.M. 60 days and Chrysler one month to avert bankruptcy and restructure on their own .
But during that period , Mr. Obama warned on Monday , the automakers will have to drastically reshape their businesses in a way that experts say will severely shrink them .
For G.M. , the president ’s decision means not only the loss of its chief executive , Rick Wagoner , who was forced out as part of the deal , but also some tough negotiations with the United Automobile Workers and bondholders , who have thus far balked at the company ’s demands .
The arrival of Mexican lorries proved controversial in the US Mexico will impose higher tariffs on a range of US goods in retaliation for a " protectionist " law passed in the US , Mexico 's economy secretary has said .
Last week the US government stopped a pilot scheme which had allowed Mexican lorries to use roads in the US .
Gerardo Ruiz Mateos said the decision violated a free - trade deal between the nations and said higher tariffs would affect $ 2.4bn ( £ 1.7 bn ) worth of goods .
The US government promised to work on a new lorry programme .
Mr Ruiz Mateos said the US decision broke a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) , signed in 1994 , which was supposed to have opened cross - border transportation by January 2000 .
" We consider this US action to be wrong , protectionist and a clear violation of the treaty , " he said .
" By deciding to protect their trucking industry , they have decided to affect other countries and the region . "
' Legitimate concerns '
He said the tariffs would affect agricultural and industrial products from 40 US states .
These will not include corn , beans or wheat , upon which Mexicans depend , reports the BBC's Stephen Gibbs , in Mexico .
But Mexico gave no further details of how high the tariffs would be set , with Mr Ruiz Mateos saying that his department would issue a full list later in the week .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said US and Mexican officials would work on legislation for a new plan " that will meet the legitimate concerns of Congress and our Nafta commitments " .
The initial pilot scheme had been a pet project of former US President George W Bush .
He faced years of legal wrangling and opposition from Democrats , environmentalists and lorry drivers ' unions .
They had argued variously that Mexican lorries did not meet US safety standards , produced too much pollution and would harm the job prospects of US drivers .
Mr Bush finally launched the scheme last year , but a law backed by the Democrats pulled the funding last week .
This dispute reveals wider concerns on the part of Mexico , our correspondent says .
As a presidential candidate , Barack Obama indicated that he would like to renegotiate the Nafta agreement , partly in order to protect American jobs .
The Mexican government is firmly in favour of Nafta , which it sees as a major economic boost for the country , and it is determined that the agreement is not altered , unless through formal negotiation , our correspondent adds .

notes about this webpage :
This is not my ' personal site , ' ' blog , ' or online repository .
I dont ever use my university web locker , Im just in a hurry .
12:00 AM : I inventoried the work I need to hand in before noon tomorrow .
It came out to about a 20 hour queue .
No problem , friday noon was 36 hours away .
12:01 AM : The following question bubbled up from the attentional soup of a wandering mind :
In Conways game of life , what is minimum number of logic gates needed to implement a single cell ?
3:xx AM : I get the answer 1091 and find it unsatisfactory .
( details later )
5:xx AM : I can not beat 1091
7:xx AM : Im still confident 1091 is way too large , but my simple tests verify it and i cant bring myself to do anything more sophistocated
11:xx AM : I am still working on this ... 1091
12:00 PM : I have come to the realization that I have just taken 12 hours I couldnt afford to loose and spent them on a thought I could have forgotten had anything other than nothing happened at 12:02 AM
========================
update
So apparently reddit is full of awesome hardware hackers .
fuck yeah .
I humbly link you to a solution submitted by klodolph which is an elegant 35 gate solution
Other redditors suggested reusing chunks of hardware by syncrhonizing the circuit and using a clock to dump monotypical data blocks in and out of the same combinational logic blocks .
This is clever , but not really what I originally had in mind .
To be fair , this sort of technique is bread and butter in real systems .
As far as my nonsense 1091 gate solution I made the mistake of trusting the algorithms without actually using my brain .
UncleOxidant pointed out that boolean algebraic reduction schemes ( like k- maps ) depend heavily on the grouping of terms and ordering of reduction and therefore running my truth table through an algorithm like espresso ( which is what i did ) gives absolutely no garuntee of optimality .
This proposes a new challenege .
The task is the same , minimize the gate count of a combinational GOL cell , but do it by starting from the truth table and designing an algorithm to do the reduction .
If i have time later tonight , my plan is build a reduction tree based on recording each grouping / reduction option at each step in the process and then searching the tree for the optimal solution .
Ill post the result .
Also for clarification , the circuit need not have a mechanism for executing the " one- step - update " , which would mean adding registers at all the inputs and outputs and dumping the output back into the input register that represents the state var .
All were building is the purely computation function , F : { 0,1}^9 ->{ 0,1}^1
Others pointed out that the restriction on using certain gates was arbitrary ... indeed .
But rather than dig up all sorts arguments about CMOS / TTL logic , gate size in transistors , and other junk , I just dumped the restriction on .
One redditor offered up : " just compile some vhdl with no timing and strict area constraints . "
Now thats just cheating .
Also , while I 'm sure $ oftware $ does a pretty good job circuit optimization , I would doubt that they can achieve true optimality .
Also , most of these methods are non-deterministic , using some sort of monte - carlo sampling to try and traverse the solution space .
Thanks for playing !
impressive solutions and enthusiasm blew my mind
========================
I really need to get my real work done lest I miss a significant and impending deadline .
My queue is still 20 hours .
There are 24 hours remaining to empty that queue .
If I fail , I will be forced to add an additional straw to the back of the burdened camel that is my academic career .
I fear for that camel .
But im sure many of you programmers recognize the compulsion to continue meaningless programming tasks at the expense of important responsibilities .
Some of you may understand the feeling of your brain actively and absolutely restraining you from moving on to other tasks until an acceptable task - termination condition is met .
For me there are 2 .
The first is to prove that the minimal number of gates needed to implemenet a GOL automata is significantly less than 1091 ...or ....
The second option .
Find some way to be confident that someone else is working on the same problem .
Then you can stop , and check back with them later .
Because i need to break out of this loop , this post is me executing that second option .
Hopefully you are familiar with the game of life , if not , then go look it up .
You are given 3 primitive logic gates , AND , OR , and NOT .
( Yes i am aware that both the NAND and the NOR gates can be composed into all of the others allowing for any circuit to be build from only one primitive ) .
Each GOL cell can be thought of as a function F : { 0,1}^9 ->{0,1} .
That is to say , you must build a circuit with 9 inputs and 1 output .
Of the 9 inputs , 8 of them represent the 1/0 state of the cell 's neighbors in a 2d grid , the other input represents the 1/0 state of the cell itself .
This function could be written down as a truth table , with 2^9 rows and 10 collumns .
This table provide an output value for every single permutation of the 9 inputs .
More commonly , this function is instead described as a set of nested conditionals .
For clarity , the inputs are labelled I0 , I1 , I2 ... I7 and S . The output is O . The Game of life is played by computing S[ n+1 ] = F( I0 .... I7 , S[n ] ) .
If S[ n ]=0 :
S[ n +1 ] = 1 if exactly 3 neighbors are ' alive ' ( state=1 )
otherwise S[ n+1 ] = 0
If S[n ] =1 :
S[ n +1 ] = 1 if exactly 2 neighbors are alive OR if exactly 3 neighbors are alive
otherwise S[ n+1 ] = 0
This is obviously alot easier to write down than a 512 row truth table .
There are alot of nice ways to write the update function down so it appears compact and simple .
The simplicity of the various expressions of this function is what makes the 1091 minimum - gate implementation so unbelievable .
In fact , I think its just plain wrong .
To Win , you must find a circuit composed only AND , NOT , and OR that implements the above function .
In addition , the sum of the number of ANDS , ORS , and NOTS must be less than 1091 .
For the curious , 1091 result was found using the algorithm Espresso , which is a logic reduction algorithm .
All of my stabs at this problem have started with python code to generate the full 512 row truth table for the function .
More python code implements either a karnaugh map reduction or an espresso reduction .
Good luck , let me know in the reddit boards how it goes
A year ago , I wrote :
Think Social Security will be solvent until 2041 ?
Think again .
The next president will face rapidly growing problems by the end of his or her first term .
At the time , the concern was that the substantial Social Security surpluses we have experienced during the past 22 years would begin to shrink .
An updated version of a Congressional Budget Office chart I presented last year shows that the shrink has indeed begun ( information is at the “ data ” link at this CBO page ) :
Social Security ’s surplus for the year ended September 30 , 2008 , fell to $ 180.2 billion , reducing its subsidy to the rest of the government .
What ?
That ’s right ; I said “ subsidy to the rest of the government . ”
Social Security ’s surpluses have been raked off by Uncle Sam and have subsidized the rest of the government since 1968 , when President Johnson began “ including Social Security and all other trust funds in a ‘ unified budget . ' ”
At that point , as I wrote last year , “ Social Security ’s Trust Fund , instead of being a separate , untouchable stash of cash and investments ( i.e. , instead of being run like a normal pension plan ) , thus became money that the rest of the government could raid . ”
And raid it they have , as you can see above .
Since 1986 , Social Security surpluses have subsidized the rest of the government to the tune of over $ 2.3 trillion , enabling reported deficits to be lower than they really have been .
Social Security ’s so - called “ Trust Fund ” consists of a stack of IOUs from Uncle Sam , who is now over $ 11 trillion in debt .
A year ago , the annual Social Security surpluses were expected to shrink to zero by 2017 .
That ’s because , starting last year , the annual demographic wave of millions of baby boomers reaching the system ’s minimum age of 62 for collecting began to hit .
This wave will continue for the next two decades .
I wrote about that 2017 estimate two months or so before Nancy Pelosi , Barack Obama , and Harry Reid brought us the POR ( Pelosi - Obama - Reid ) economy .
That Democratic - driven downturn began during June .
I recognized what was happening in early July , and a week later observed that “ businesses and investors are responding to their total lack of seriousness by battening down the hatches and preparing for the worst . ”
In June , Pelosi , presidential nominee Obama , and Reid drove the POR economy ’s initial dive , which is now a recession as normal people define it , by clearly telling investors , entrepreneurs , and business owners that an Obama administration and the congressional majority would starve the nation of energy and massively increase taxes on the productive once in power .
Then their party ’s decades - in - the - making disaster in the housing sector came to a head in September .
Initially fueled by the collapses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Democratic - driven housing and lax credit mess ultimately led to what has been a seemingly endless string of bailouts of the financial and then other sectors .
The economy has seriously retreated and continues to perform poorly , as has the stock market .
It should n’t surprise anyone that , as a result of all of this , Social Security ’s fiscal situation has headed downhill at breakneck speed .
Tanking the economy ( possibly deliberately ? ) has consequences .
In a mini-preview of things to come , Social Security went negative in February for the first time in decades .
Outgo exceeded income by over $ 1.2 billion :
February was a bit of a fluke , because there were only 28 collection days to offset a full month ’s payments .
But according to the CBO , per Heritage , “ the Social Security surplus will only be $ 16 billion this year , and only $ 3 billion next year ” ; it will show a deficit , or “ go negative , ” in 2011 .
How can this be happening ?
I thought Pelosi , Reid , and the left all assured us several years ago that there was “ no crisis . ”
That they did .
In May 2005 , during the Bush administration ’s weak attempt to build support for partial privatization of the system , “ Pelosi accused President Bush of creating a crisis and manufacturing an issue . ”
Before that , in late 2004 , as it became clear that Bush would try to mount such an effort , the pair jointly said , “ We cannot support any plan that relies on massive and irresponsible increases in debt , which could destabilize financial markets and lead to large tax increases . ”
The current irony of that joint statement is provided at no extra charge .
The fact is that a crisis has been building for decades .
It has seemingly come out of nowhere only because the POR economy ’s recession has sharply reduced Social Security tax receipts .
Any recovery in collections arising from an economic comeback will necessarily build on a smaller base .
That is why Social Security is on track to go negative six years earlier than was anticipated just a year ago .
If February ’s monstrous stimulus package does n’t reignite job growth , it will probably go negative in fiscal 2010 .
The “ save ” part of Team Obama ’s risible “ save or create jobs ” goal will do nothing to increase Social Security tax collections .
Once Social Security goes negative , we will have come to the point so many have long feared we would reach .
To cover the system ’s cash drains , the government will have to , in some combination , raise taxes , borrow more , or reduce benefits , year after year after year .
More importantly and tragically , the “ no crisis until 2040 or so ” crowd , which has been lying all along , will have accomplished what I believe has been their long - term goal , which is making even partially privatizing Social Security politically and financially unachievable .
It appears that they ’ve “ won . ”
The economy and personal liberty have lost .
Pelosi , Obama , and Reid deserve the blame for the statists ’ early “ victory . ”
This is from the Globe & Mail :
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney is signalling frustration with the Obama administration ’s handling of the financial crisis , saying delays in shoring up the banking system in the United States have exacerbated the recession in Canada .
With remarkable frankness , Mr. Carney singled out the U.S. government for criticism in his quarterly economic report Thursday , placing much of the blame for Canada ’s economic woes on U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s abortive attempts to cleanse financial institutions of their toxic assets .
“ Timely and credible action is required to address the impaired assets on bank balance sheets and to restore the normal flow of credit – a precondition for sustained economic recovery , ” the central bank said .
“ Progress on these measures has been slower than expected in the United States and other major financial centres . ”
Mr. Carney ’s criticism sets the stage for a tense meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven rich industrial countries Friday in Washington , where banking issues will be the main topic of discussion .
In BLONDES I discuss how tall , super - skinny hipless bodies are n’t as desirable to most men as many women think .
The average catwalk strutter has a body mass index of 16.5 — skinny enough to be subfertile .
Among other reasons why fashion models are long and wispy is that clothes appear more striking on them than on shorter , curvy women .
The industry also happens to be dominated by gay men .
Fair enough .
But what about porn models ?
Would n’t those gals represent the male ideal of the female form ?
The answer is not really , according to Eric Holland in the latest issue of Archives of Sexual Behavior .
Responding to an earlier study on the measurements of successful porn actresses , Holland , who has become a public voice for the “ red- blooded ” straight male , made the following points :
1 . Porn stars did n’t achieve success in their profession because they have optimal bodies .
Holland points out that it ’s wrong to assume that just because a woman represents the feminine “ ideal ” just because she has made it to the top as a porn actress .
Her success is attributed to more than looks alone .
It may be that those who make it to the top are willing to partake in more extreme acts with more enthusiasm .
2. Women who have many sex partners , or high sociosexuality , tend to have higher testosterone levels . [*]
According to Holland , many porn stars have high - testosterone “ masculinized ” features , e.g. a higher waist - to - hip ratio ( more tubular shape ) , flatter backside , and stronger and more prominent jawline .
Men prefer a more feminine body type , says Holland .
Breast implants , airbrushing , posing , and fancy filtered lights confuse the eye because they feminize an otherwise high - testosterone look .
Holland claims many top porn stars have body types that , if seen pre-op and without light tricks , would strike us as surprisingly masculine .
( Focusing on stars , he fails to address the legions of poorly - paid no -name actors with unambiguously feminine body types . )
3 . Playboy centerfolds are more masculine because they ’re picked by a man thought to be bisexual .
Hugh Hefner , the magazine ’s editor - in - chief ( who has a strong role in the selection process ) tends to choose women with more masculine features , especially stronger jawlines .
( Hefner , in his bio , has admitted to having had gay sex . )
Holland claims that Hefner ’s tastes are n’t necessarily those of most straight men .
Holland ’s photo gallery of popular “ masculinized ” centerfold models is here .
4 . Porn actress measurements are often unreliable anyway .
The stats indicate that the median BMI of popular porn stars is 18.3 , which is below the threshold of a healthy body weight , whereas some studies have found that men in western societies actually prefer a BMI more like 19.5 - 20.5 or higher .
That said , Holland claims the measurements that accompany a centerfold ’s photo might not always be a true reflection of her weight .
Sizing up the centerfolds ’ bodies , it appears they are heavier than reported .
( I describe women ’s WHR and BMI in some depth in the book . )
The interesting questions , some unanswerable :
Do straight men agree with Holland ?
To what degree are men ’s tastes influenced by porn ?
Would a guy subtly shift his sensibilities after seeing an erotization of androgenization ?
Are preferences context - specific — e.g. , in porn , are hard tubular bodies and fake oversized breasts hot , whereas in wives they ’re not ?
To what extent does race matter ?
What does it take to be a porn star , and is there really an implicit selection process that favors more “ masculinized women ” ?
Given the range of men ’s erotic tastes , which surely involve more than beauty , is Holland ’s hypothesis even testable ?
Only one thing is clear here :
When it comes to women ’s bodies , many have much to say , but there ’s no clear arbiter of taste .
Nor should there be .
* A reader wrote to ask for a study that supports Holland ’s assertion that high testosterone in women is associated with having more sex partners .
Here ’s one ( sorry , full - text version for subscribers only ) .
Straight guys :
Do you agree with Holland ’s points ?
You might be used to your landlord hassling you about messy pets or damage to his property , but now he might also be narcing on you .
Miami lawmakers have drafted a half - baked resolution that would require landlords to inspect properties every 60 days to look for marijuana plants and drug labs .
Citing the explosive danger of meth labs and the seedy element that hangs out around weed growing houses , the Miami - Dade County Board of Commissioners wants owners to keep a close eye on their tenants .
The Board is also worried about the electrical skills of certain potheads .
" Marijuana grow houses pose fire risks due to extensive electrical rewiring and the use of hot grow lamps , " the resolution states .
So it sounds like drug - dealing tenants should make sure their landlord is a customer .
The band Nine Inch Nails ( NIN ) has always been fan - friendly on the Internet , blogging , giving away free tracks , releasing songs in formats that allow listeners to easily remix tracks , Tweeting , and even licensing its music for a popular iPhone game .
Because of this , it should come as no surprise that the band has taken yet another step in giving its fans having total access to all things NIN , all the time .
nin : access is a free iPhone application that brings a few cool features to the table for those looking to follow the band as closely as possible .
The application , which is official ( and not some fan knock - off ) , allows users to download NIN - inspired iPhone wallpapers , stream the band 's music , listen to remixes by fans , watch videos from the " fan archive , " use the NIN forums , and even chat with other fans nearby .
While the application is free , users do need to register on NIN official site in order to make use of it .
This may not be your cup of tea , but registration is free .
If you are a fan , you 'll probably be registering anyways .
There is n't anything new in terms of content here , though it makes sense to jump onto such an emerging and popular platform as the iPhone OS .
NIN and other early adopters will only be the tip of the iceberg ; we 'll undoubtedly see many bands releasing similar applications in the coming months .

Tiny holes all over the cloak bend the light around the bump Scientists have rendered objects invisible under near - infrared light .
Unlike previous such " cloaks " , the new work does not employ metals , which introduce losses of light and result in imperfect cloaking .
Because the approach can be scaled down further in size , researchers say this is a major step towards a cloak that would work for visible light .
One of the research teams describes its miniature " carpet cloak " in the journal Nature Materials .
This " carpet " design was based on a theory first described by John Pendry , from Imperial College London , in 2008 .
Michal Lipson and her team at Cornell University demonstrated a cloak based on the concept .
Xiang Zhang , professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California , Berkeley , led the other team .
" Essentially , we are transforming a straight line of light into a curved line around the cloak , so you do n't perceive any change in its pathway , " he explained .
This is not the first time an invisibility cloak has been made , but previous designs have used metals , whereas the carpet cloak is built using a dielectric - or insulating material - which absorbs far less light .
" Metals introduce a lot of loss , or reduce the light intensity , " said Professor Zhang .
This loss can leave a darkened spot in the place of the cloaked object .
So using silicon , a material that absorbs very infrared little light , is a " big step forward , " he says .
Transforming light
The cloak 's design cancels out the distortion produced by the bulge of the object underneath , bending light around it - like water around a rock - and giving the illusion of a flattened surface .
Professor Zhang explained that the cloak " changes the local density " of the object it is covering .
" When light passes from air into water it will be bent , because the optical density , or [ refractive ] index , of the water is different to air , " he told BBC News .
" So by manipulating the optical density of an object , you can transform the light path from a straight line to to any path you want . "
The new material does this via a series of minuscule holes - which are strategically " drilled " into a sheet of silicon .
Proving Professor Pendry 's theory , Professor Zhang 's team was able to " decide the profile " of the cloaked object - altering the optical density with the holes .
" In some areas we drill lots of very densely packed holes , and in others they are much sparser .
Where the holes are more dense , there is more air than silicon , so the optical density of the object is reduced , " Professor Zhang explained .
" Each hole is much smaller than the wavelength of the light .
So optical light does n't see a hole - it just sees a sort of air - silicon mixture .
So as far as the light is concerned , we have adjusted the density of the object . "
He pointed out that his demonstration cloak is very tiny - just a few thousandths of a millimetre across .
But there are applications even for a cloak of this size .
Such a device could be used , for example , in the electronics industry , to hide flaws on the intricate stencils or ' masks ' that are used to cast processor chips .
" This could save the industry millions of dollars , " he said .
" It would allow them to fix flaws rather than produce an entirely new mask . "

The launch pad has been picked up on satellite images Japan says it is deploying missile interceptors to destroy any parts of a North Korean rocket that might fall on its territory .
North Korea has said it will launch a satellite into orbit next month .
South Korea , Japan and the US say the launch is cover for a test of the Taepodong - 2 ballistic missile .
The US said a launch would violate UN Security Council resolutions .
Russia said North Korea should " abstain " from testing any missiles .
' Assure safety ' Japan 's Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada issued the orders to mobilise Japan 's missile defence shield after a meeting with Prime Minister Taro Aso and cabinet ministers .
" We will do our best to handle any flying object from North Korea in order to assure the Japanese people 's safety and security , " said Mr Hamada .
North Korea 's missile programme " A satellite or a missile - we are displeased with anything that is going to fly over our land , and such an action must be stopped . "
It is the first time that constitutionally pacifist Japan has deployed the shield .
The country 's military is also expected to deploy warships off its coast .
North Korea says it intends to test - fire the rocket between the 4 and 8 April .
The trajectory issued by Pyongyang shows the rocket will pass over Japan , with the first booster stage landing in the sea to the west , the second in the Pacific Ocean to the east .
The interception is only likely to be activated if the launch does not go as planned and debris appears to be falling towards Japan .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin told journalists that the launch had led to increased tensions in the region , " and this is why it would be better if our partners in North Korea abstained from this " .
Japan revised its Self - Defence Forces Law in 2005 , legalising possible interceptions of ballistic missiles .
But the country 's pacifist constitution does not allow it to intercept a missile if it is clearly heading elsewhere .
The Japanese government had previously warned it would try to shoot down any missile or debris that threatens to hit its territory .
North Korea has said it would regard any rocket intercept as an act of war .

Kann ein Richter , der Mitglied in Lobby - Vereinigungen ist , in einem Verfahren unabhängig urteilen , das Interessen dieser Lobby - Vereinigungen berührt ?
Diese Frage stellt sich offensichtlich nun im Verfahren gegen die Betreiber des Torrent - Trackers Pirate Bay .
Ein schwedisches Gericht hat vier Verantwortliche von The Pirate Bay der Beihilfe zur schweren Urheberrechtsverletzung für schuldig befunden und zu einjährigen Haftstrafe sowie Schadensersatz in Millionenhöhe verurteilt .
Der Schadensersatz in Höhe von 30 Millionen Schwedischen Kronen ( 2,75 Millionen Euro ) soll verschiedenen Film - und Musikunternehmen zugutekommen .
Nun gibt es schwere Vorwürfe gegen den Richter in dem Verfahren :
Er ist nach Berichten des Nachrichtenprogramms von Sverige Radio Mitglied in einer Organisation zum Schutz des Urheberrechts , in dem auch Repräsentanten der Medienindustrie vertreten sind , die als Kläger an dem Verfahren beteiligt waren .
Außerdem soll er in einer Vereinigung mitwirken , die sich aktiv für eine Verschärfung des Urheberrechts einsetzt .
Schwedische Rechtsexperten sehen darin laut der schwedischen Nachrichtensite The Local einen Interessenkonflikt , der eine Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens notwendig machen könnte .
Die Anwälte von Pirate Bay müssten dies allerdings sofort vor Gericht zur Sprache bringen .
In einer ersten Reaktion auf den Bericht forderten die verurteilten Pirate - Bay - Betreiber , die bereits Berufung eingelegt hatten , dass das Urteil gegen sie aufgehoben werden müsse .
Der Richter selbst dementierte nicht , Mitglied in den aufgeführten Organisationen zu sein , wies Vorwürfe der Befangenheit aber zurück : " Meiner Ansicht begründen diese Aktivitäten keinen Interessenkonflikt " , erklärte er gegenüber dem Radiosender .

After a few weeks of intense criticism , Time Warner Cable last week temporarily halted most of its experiments in charging broadband customers by the byte .
But the consumer advocacy group Free Press is n't mollified and is asking a powerful House committee to investigate whether such billing plans are anti-competitive .
Last Thursday , Time Warner Cable shelved plans to charge its customersa in four cities by the number of GBs of data they download a month , with penalties for going over the limit .
But the company is n't giving up on the idea and says charging heavy users more money is only fair .
What data exists , however , shows that heavy downloading has little relation to a cable company 's bandwidth costs .
That leads critics such as Free Press to charge that the switch is intended to protect TWC 's cable - television business from innovative online video services .
Free Press is now asking the House Energy and Commerce Committee ( .pdf ) to investigate whether Time Warner Cable and AT&T 's trials of usage - based billing for home broadband is actually " price gouging in an insufficiently competitive broadband market . "
Less than two weeks ago , the group called generally for a Congressional investigation and asked its 500,000 members to send anti-cap letters to their representatives .
Imposing arbitrarily low usage limits and arbitrarily high usage fees on Internet access may have substantial negative impacts on competition , innovation , and long - term economic growth .
These price gouging schemes will discourage consumers from using high - bandwidth Internet applications — especially video , damaging the nascent market for Internet delivery of video , a market that increasingly competes with traditional cable television services .
Popular high - bandwidth services such as YouTube , Flickr and online gaming might never have flourished if each use resulted in an additional charge .
TWC and AT&T are both still testing caps in Beaumont , Texas .
The calorie - counting model is much like cellular phone plans , and is not unheard of in the United States or abroad .
For instance , satellite and 3 - G network cards impose low usage caps and high overage fees .
Other examples include Lawrence , KS's Sunflower Broadband cable internet and DSL providers in remote areas .
TWC did not respond to a request for comment .
First - term New York lawmaker Eric Massa ( D ) promised to introduce legislation that would ban such pricing tiers , but has not yet released the text of the bill .

Speedup search with parallelism !
Recently , I learned about improved support for semi-explicit parallelism in the Glorious Haskell Compiler GHC :
[ Programmers ] merely annotate subcomputations that might be evaluated in parallel , leaving the choice of whether to actually do so to the run-time system . [...] programmers should be able to take existing Haskell programs , and with a little high - level knowledge of how the program should parallelize , make some small modifications to the program using existing well - known techniques , and thereby achieve decent speedup on today 's parallel hardware .
One of my favourite research topics is non-deterministic programming .
Let 's see whether semi-explicit parallelism helps to enumerate the search space of such programs faster .
This post is generated from a literate Haskell file in case you want to reproduce my results .
Non-deterministic programming in Haskell
import Control .
Monad
import Control .
Parallel
import System ( getArgs )
As a running example I will use permutation sort , one of the least efficient sorting algorithms ever invented :
sort l = permute l `suchthat` isSorted
Admittedly ,
this is a toy example and
sorting is usually not expressed as a search problem
but it is a representative program in the so called generate - and - test style and it generates a huge search space quickly .
It should be possible to explore that in parallel leaving us with a promising case study .
We can express non-determinism in Haskell using lists of successes .
The functions used to define sort could be defined using list comprehensions :
suchthat :: [ a ] -> ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ]
suchthat xs p = [ x | x <- xs , p x ]
permute :: [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ]
permute [ ] = [ [ ] ]
permute ( x:xs ) = [ zs | ys <- permute xs , zs <- insert x ys ]
insert :: a -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ]
insert x [ ] = [ [ x ] ]
insert x ( y:ys ) = [ x :y:ys ] ++ [ y:zs | zs <- insert x ys ]
suchthat is a convenient renaming for flip filter defined using a list comprehension and the functions permute and insert return a list of possible results instead of only one .
For example , the call permute [ 1,2 ] yields [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,1 ] ] .
The predicate isSorted checks whether a list of numbers is sorted :
isSorted :: [ Int ] ->
Bool
isSorted ( x:y:ys ) = x <= y && isSorted ( y:ys )
isSorted _ = True
With these definitions , the call sort [ 3,2,1 ] is evaluated to [ [ 1,2,3 ] ] because [ 1,2,3 ] is the only sorted permutation of [ 3,2,1 ] .
Lazy lists are great to represent the result of enumerating the search space of a non-deterministic computation .
But they fix the search strategy to sequential depth - first search .
I want to define a different search strategy ( viz. , parallel depth - first search ) so this is too restrictive .
We can generalize the above definitions using the MonadPlus type class of which the type constructor [ ] for lists is an instance of .
So let 's step back for an interlude that explains monads for non-determinism .
Interlude that explains monads for non-determinism
A monad for non-determinism is a type constructor m that supports the following four functions :
return :: a -> m a
(>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
mzero :: m a
mplus :: m a -> m a -> m a
The first two functions belong to the type class Monad , the last two belong to the type class MonadPlus which is a subclass of Monad .
A value of type m a can be interpreted as non-deterministic computation that yields results of type a .
The intuition behind these four operations is as follows :
return constructs a non-deterministic computation with a single result , viz. , the one given as argument ,
>>= applies a non-deterministic function to every result of a non-deterministic computation and merges the results ,
mzero constructs a non-deterministic computation without results , i.e. , a failing computation , and
mplus merges the results of two non-deterministic computations .
We can rewrite the non-deterministic functions for sorting using monadic combinators :
suchthat :: MonadPlus m => m a -> ( a -> Bool ) -> m a
suchthat xs p = do x <- xs
guard ( p x )
return x
permute :: MonadPlus m = > [ a ] -> m [ a ]
permute [ ] = return [ ]
permute ( x:xs ) = do ys <- permute xs
zs <- insert x ys
return zs
insert :: MonadPlus m => a -> [ a ] -> m [ a ]
insert x [ ] = return [ x ]
insert x ( y:ys ) = return ( x :y:ys ) `mplus` do zs <- insert x ys
return ( y:zs )
Now , our sort function can return results in any monad for non-determinism .
Especially , it can still yield a list of results .
Parallel search with a dumb instance of MonadPlus
In order to define parallel search algorithms , we define a different instance of the MonadPlus type class that represents the search space as a tree structure .
The idea is to simply replace calls to monadic combinators with constructors .
Only >>= is implemented as a function :
data MPlus a = MZero | Return a | MPlus ( MPlus a ) ( MPlus a )
instance Monad MPlus
where
return = Return
MZero >>= _ = MZero
Return x >>= f = f x
MPlus l r >>= f = MPlus ( l >>= f ) ( r >>= f )
instance MonadPlus MPlus
where
mzero = MZero
mplus = MPlus
The implementation of >>= is borrowed from laws for Monad and for MonadPlus .
We can now define different search strategies as functions of type MPlus a -> [ a ] .
For example , sequential depth - first search looks as follows :
search :: MPlus a -> [ a ]
search MZero = [ ]
search ( Return x ) = [ x ]
search ( MPlus l r ) = search l ++ search r
This function is inspired by the MonadPlus instance for [ ] .
Let 's count on the promise of semi-explicit parallelism :
In the last rule defining search , the results of the right branch r of the search space will probably be needed later and it might be beneficial to compute them in parallel .
We can express this using the combinator par from the module Control .
Parallel and define a function for parallel depth - first search :
parSearch :: MPlus a -> [ a ]
parSearch MZero = [ ]
parSearch ( Return x ) = [ x ]
parSearch ( MPlus l r ) = rs `par` ( parSearch l ++ rs )
where rs = parSearch r
This use of par forks a so called spark , i.e. , a computation that might be chosen by the run-time system for parallel execution .
We do not need to fork a spark for searching the left subtree because parSearch l is evaluated by the call to ++ immediately .
Does this tweak speedup search ?
Here is a simple benchmark to try it out .
main = do n <- liftM ( read .
head ) getArgs
mapM_ print ( parSearch ( sort [ 1 ..n ] ) )
We compile this benchmark with GHCs - threaded option in order to get code that runs on multiple cores :
$ ghc -- make - threaded - O2 -o permsort - par speedup - search - with- parallelism.lhs
With a single core the run-time of permsort - par 11 is about 20 seconds .
Using two cores the run-time is reduced to 11 seconds .
Twice the cores gives almost half the run-time .
Using three and four cores is again a little bit faster .
I have measured the run-times using GHC 6.10.1 on an Intel Core2 Quad CPU with 2.83 GHz providing 1 GB of initial heap .
Using a current snapshot of GHC 6.11 did not show significant differences on a MacBook with Intel Core2 Duo CPU .
This may well be due to the specific nature of the solved problem : there is a huge search space with a single solution , so most of the search space is just an expensive failing computation .
Feel free to try other examples , the parSearch function is on Hackage .

The FIA has announced that Formula 1's cost cap will be increased to £ 40 million when it is introduced next season .
The original figure mooted was £ 30 million , but has been revised upwards following consultation with Formula 1 teams instigated by FIA president Max Mosley last week .
The FIA confirmed that the budget cap would run from January 1 to December 31 , with the £ 40 million figure covering all team expenditure , with certain exceptions .
Most notable among these is that engine costs will not be included in the budget capped expenditure for 2010 .
Also excluded from the budget cap are marketing and hospitality , driver pay , fines and penalties imposed by the FIA , anything that teams can demonstrate has no influence on its on - track performance and dividends paid from profits relating to participation in the championship .
The FIA will allow those teams that sign up to the budget cap to have increased technical freedom to make it easier to compete with the uncapped teams .
This includes adjustable front and rear wings as well as an engine that can run without a rev limit .
In addition , the budget cap teams will be allowed unlimited testing outside of the racing season , and will not be restricted by the wind tunnel scale and speed stipulations
The budget cap will be monitored by a new Costs Commission that will be set up to ensure that teams are adhering to the regulations .
A chairman and two commissioners will be appointed to the body by the WMSC for a term of three years .
It was also stipulated that one of the commissioners should be an expert in finance and the other someone with high - level experience in motor sport .
The governing body also annouced that the maximum number of cars permitted to enter the championship has been increased to 26 , from 24 .

Is buying new music equipment a benefit or a distraction ?
Is buying new music equipment a benefit or a distraction ?
Today I wanted to write a little bit about purchasing equipment for making music .
This could be anything from getting the tools to start your studio ( computer , soundcard , midi controller etc .. ) to the extra goodies that can make your studio more interesting and fun ( upgrades , new plug - in ’s , the latest and greatest in hardware or software ) .
I ’ve found myself in circumstances which I have really benefited from buying the right equipment and other times I have purchased new gear as a way of delaying my own creative output .
Lets first talk about buying equipment ….
When you are putting your studio together , there are simply going to be neccesities that you ca n’t get around if you want a good shot at getting the ideas out of your head with ease and enjoyment .
The question typically comes up about what you should buy .
* Should you buy the most expensive piece of gear or can you get by with something cheaper ?
* Does more expensive really mean better ?
* Is this new piece of gear really going to benefit you or are you just buying another toy that you will be bored of within the next week ?
From my personal experience I have suffered for not buying the right tools when I really needed them .
Sometimes you get so used to shoddy tools that you consider all the extra trouble you go through to just be a normal part of the process .
What you do n’t realize is that what you are saving in dollars might be costing you pretty heavily in creativity , productivity and inspiration .
When it came to my early productions with a computer in 1998 , my production partner and I invested in a pentium 2 , 300 mhz PC .
At the time this was pretty decent but as technology leaped forward , so did the minimum requirements of the software that was coming out .
I ca n’t even begin to tell you the amount of crashes , lock ups , and unsaved work that went down the drain .
On the other hand , when I decided to take DJ’ing more seriously , I spent the money and bought the best turntables , headphones and needles for the job ( Technics 1200 ’s , Sony DJ headphones , and Shure white label needles ) .
This made my life much easier , and also put me in the same mindset of the DJ ’s I admired because we were essentially working on some of the same equipment .
It also made playing live much easier since the clubs were stocked with equipment I was familiar with .
( I did however use a cheap mixer , which although I “ got by ” with , it cost me in overall sound quality and I looked a bit unprofessional when having to ask someone how to properly use the Pioneer or Allen and Heath mixers .
I currently use the xone 64 and ca n’t even explain the positive impact it has had . )
Another thing to consider , although you do n’t want to get too hung up on this , is perception .
The way you are perceived can have a pretty big impact on your music career .
If people see you working on substandard equipment , they may look at you as a person who does n’t take themselves seriously enough to invest more in themselves .
I have found that investing in good equipment has more than paid for itself financially as well as in personal productivity .
Using good equipment is simply more inspiring .
There is certainly an angle that I would like to put out there before I take things too far and have you maxing out your credit cards … .
There is something to be said about using what you ’ve got and getting the maximum productivity from it .
Norman Cook ( aka ..Fatboy Slim ) has unquestionably been incredibly successful with his productions but are you aware that he did nearly all of those songs on an old Atari sequencer ?
This is a classic example of not buying into the hype of the “ latest and greatest ” and sticking to what works best for him .
I ’m certain however that he has an engineer that drops his work into Pro Tools or Logic and gives his work that polished finished sound we know and love .
All of this really comes down to knowing yourself and being honest with your purpose for purchasing new ( or vintage ) equipment .
Is what you are purchasing really going to give your productions better quality and give you more enjoyment and productivity ?
Have you become so afraid of creating that you are using new gear as a distraction from seeing what you are really capable of with what you ’ve got ?
Be very aware that it ’s human nature to be in a constant mode of “ wanting ” .
Having what we want rarely satisfies us for very long .
Think of all the CD ’s and DVD ’s you have bought and have n’t listened to or watched .
How many songs or full albums have you downloaded but never got around to enjoying ?
( I ’ve certainly been guilty of this ! )
If you are in the process of accumulating more often than in the process of putting what you ’ve got to use , you might be stuck in an endless cycle and it ’s time to pull yourself out .
If you must get more gear ( and everyone needs an upgrade at some point ) , a great idea is to buy one piece of gear and put it to use for 30 days to see if you really get good use out of it .
If you do n’t , turn around and sell it .
If you do really get a lot of use from it , great !
Now find something in your collection that you do n’t get much use from and pull it off your computer ( you can always reload it if you later find use for it ) .
You probably have n’t used the thing in 6 months or more , but notice the sense of loss you feel as you remove it …
Strange huh ?
This is a sign that you might have a kind of “ pack rat ” mentality and are n’t able to let things go , even if you are n’t using them .
It ’s almost always a good practice to get rid of soemthing old whenever you bring in something new .
Try something non musical … go through your closet and pull out the things that no longer fit you , or that you simply never wear .
Do you still have a hard time pulling it out of your closet and taking it to goodwill ?
What are you settling for ?
Does your creativity call for better tools or are you sinking in a pool of plugin ’s and hardware ?
Are you giving yourself so many choices that it ’s stalling your creativity ?
Give it some thought and then do something about it …
happy music making ,
Jason
The attack happened in the Rosemount Gardens area of Derry A man shot in both legs in a paramilitary - style attack in Londonderry was awaiting sentencing for raping a 15 - year - old schoolgirl .
Keith Burnside , 37 , was shot in his Rosemount Gardens home by two masked men in front of his girlfriend and two children at about 2315 BST on Monday .
Burnside was convicted in March of raping a girl in his car at Sandbank Cottages in 2000 .
He is being treated in hospital for his injuries .
SDLP Councillor Mark H. Durkan said he had spoken to Keith Burnside 's girlfriend who witnessed the attack .
" She 's in an awful state of shock , it was an extremely traumatic experience for everyone involved , " he said .
" There were two young children in the house , a 12 - week - old baby and a six - year - old who saw everything . "
Councillor Durkan said he did not discuss the motive for the shooting .
" This attack must be condemned regardless of what it was in connection with , " he added .
" We cannot have this law of the jungle where people are taking the law into their own hands . "
Burnside was due to be sentenced for the rape shortly .
During the trial the court heard that his victim blocked the attack out of her mind for seven years before reporting it , after the accused smirked at her outside a nightclub .
A defence application was due to be heard in Londonderry Crown Court on Tuesday but was adjourned when the court was told of the attack .
Community worker Tommy McCourt said such incidents made people fearful of a return to violence .
" It takes you back to the bad old days , " he said .
" We believed that those days had passed and nobody wants to see this kind of thing happening again . "
SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey also condemned the attack .
" The people who carried out this shooting have no support from the local community and no place in a civilised society , " he said .
The police said that those responsible were of slim build and wore tracksuits , baseball caps , and scarves over their faces .
The first man was 5ft 10ins and the second 6ft 2ins .
They want anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen the men to contact them .

Will the process known as globalisation survive the recession ?
FT journalist Gideon Rachman and Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee discuss if the demise of globalisation would be such a bad thing .
APRIL 9-- A Florida woman who used a live Internet video feed to monitor the interior of her home was shocked yesterday when she saw two men burglarizing her residence in real time .
Jeanne Thomas , 43 , was seated at her office desk when two strangers appeared in her living room ( the intruders got into Thomas 's Boynton Beach house through a doggie door at the rear of the home , according to a probable cause affidavit ) .
Thomas , who set up the live video stream after her home was burglarized last October , immediately called 911 to report the burglary ( click here to listen to her conversation with a police operator ) .
Cops raced to her home and arrested the two men inside the house : Curtis Williams , 20 , and Steven Morales , 19 .
Two other suspects -- Scott George and Jonathan Cruz , both 20 - - were nabbed at a nearby residence and charged with helping plan the burglary .
The amazing surveillance video from inside Thomas 's house was uploaded to YouTube by the Boynton Beach Police Department and can be seen above .

Dick Cheney : “ I guess my general sense of where we are with respect to Iraq and at the end of now , what , nearly six years , is that we ’ve accomplished nearly everything we set out to do… . ”
What has Dick Cheney really accomplished in Iraq ?
An estimated 4 million Iraqis , out of 27 million , have been displaced from their homes , that is , made homeless .
Some 2.7 million are internally displaced inside Iraq .
A couple hundred thousand are cooling their heels in Jordan .
And perhaps a million are quickly running out of money and often living in squalid conditions in Syria .
Cheney ’s war has left about 15 % of Iraqis homeless inside the country or abroad .
That would be like 45 million American thrown out of their homes .
It is controversial how many Iraqis died as a result of the 2003 invasion and its aftermath .
But it seems to me that a million extra dead , beyond what you would have expected from a year 2000 baseline , is entirely plausible .
The toll is certainly in the hundreds of thousands .
Cheney did not kill them all .
The Lancet study suggested that the US was directly responsible for a third of all violent deaths since 2003 .
That would be as much as 300,000 that we killed .
The rest , we only set in train their deaths by our invasion .
Baghdad has been turned from a mixed city , about half of its population Shiite and the other half Sunni in 2003 , into a Shiite city where the Sunni population may be as little as ten to fifteen percent .
From a Sunni point of view , Cheney ’s war has resulted in a Shiite ( and Iranian ) take - over of the Iraqi capital , long a symbol of pan-Arabism and anti-imperialism .
What do these events have in common ?
Jon Stewart 's entertaining , meatless takedown of Jim Cramer .... Rick Santelli's Chicago tea party .... White House and Congressional anger over AIG bonuses ....
Republican distress over the 98 % - earmark free omnibus budget ?
These are all examples of the performance of populist outrage in the theatres of the elite .
Their targets are n't exactly straw men , but you could be forgiven for wondering why CNBC , employment contracts , earmarks and mortgage assistance for non-delinquent homeowners come in for so much approbation .
To paraphrase Megan McArdle , earmarks did n't persuade China to invest its savings glut in U.S. Treasuries ; Jim Cramer did n't invent leverage ( or greed , or the desire to make money in the stock market ) and AIG 's derivative traders profited from the government 's desire to secure homesteads for as many Americans as possible .
Anyway , these performances make for good television and for better politics .
But if this populist backlash extends beyond the circle of the elite , then it is probably grounded in more fundamental causes .
Income inequality has ( basically ) been growing for thirty years ;
Republicans paid no need to it , believing it to be an artifact of the miscarriage between statistics and modern standards of living , and Democrats failed to figure out how to stop it .
The American political class failed to anticipate the negative effects of globalization and failed miserably to educate its citizenry about the tradeoff between low prices and wage stagnation .
Government conflated the idea of growth in the financial services industry with the health of the economy .
Add to that anxiety over health care , infrastructure , education , and the rest .
Santa Clara County officials have declared a local emergency after they said someone intentionally cut an underground fiber optic cable in south San Jose , causing a widespread phone service outage in southern Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties today that included disruption to 911 emergency phone service .
John Britton , a spokesman for AT&T , said it appears somebody opened a manhole in South San Jose , climbed down eight to 10 feet and cut four or five fiber - optic cables .
Britton also said there was a report of underground cables being cut in San Carlos .
AT&T is offering a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for the sabotage , Britton said .
The outage initially affected some cell phones , Internet access and about 52,200 Verizon household land lines in Morgan Hill , Gilroy and Santa Cruz County , according to the Santa Clara County Office of Emergency Services .
The cell phone networks affected are Verizon , Nextel , Sprint and some AT&T .
Verizon is the sole provider of land lines in the South County area .
“ We ’ve never to this extent in recent history had this kind of phone outage , ” said Gilroy police Sgt. Jim Gillio .
ATMs in South Santa Clara County were not working .
Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy cancelled all elective surgeries in response to the emergency , according to county officials .
“ It ’s kind of like an earthquake ” said Jack Ahlin , a driver with T. Marx Towing who was standing outside the Gilroy police department .
Service is also affected in South San Jose around Monterey Road and Bailey Avenue .
Crews are repairing cut wires located underground on Monterey Road just north of the Blossom Hill Road exit in South San Jose .
As of 2 p.m. one of the cables had been repaired and some service had been restored , Britton said .
Full service is not expected to be restored until about midnight .
San Jose police spokesman Sgt. Ronnie Lopez said the manhole covers are heavy and would take quite an effort to lift , perhaps even requiring a tool .
AT&T ’s contract with the Communication Workers of America expired at 11:59 p.m. Saturday , but Britton said “ we have a really good relationship with the union ” and that negotiations continue between the two sides .
Asked if the potential sabotage had anything to with the strike - threatened contract negotiations between AT&T and the Communication Workers of America , union national spokeswoman Candice Johnson replied : “ Absolutely not .
Our members are not involved in this . ”
Johnson said that CWA would cooperate with the investigation .
Any implication that a disgruntled worker cut the wires was false , she said .
“ That would be counterproductive , ” Johnson said “ We are on the job .
So it does n’t make any sense .
Our goal is to get a quality , fair contract and that us our focus right now . ”
Johnson said she did not know if police had contacted the local union .
Meanwhile the disruption continues for thousands of residents .
The Santa Clara County Emergency Operations Center has been activated ; the Santa Clara County Fire Department has moved more firefighters to south county fire stations ; the county sheriff has increasing staffing and patrols ; and additional ambulances have been positioned in the area .
Authorities say that residents with an emergency who ca n’t reach 911 should use a cell phone if possible to call the police dispatch numbers for help .
The numbers are : Gilroy ( 408 ) 846-0350 ; Morgan Hill : ( 408 ) 779-2101 ; unincorporated areas : ( 408 ) 299-2311 ; and San Jose : ( 408 ) 277-8900
Search and rescue crews have set up the following locations to respond to residents reporting locations : Uvas and Watsonville roads , near Gilroy ; McKean and Bailey roads , near South San Jose and Morgan Hill ; Oak Glen and Edmonson roads , near Morgan Hill ; Watsonville Road and Highway 152 , near Gilroy ; New and Church avenues , near San Martin ; and Maple and Foothill avenues , near San Martin .
Gilroy police called in eight officers to help patrol the city , more the doubling the force of seven officers on the streets on a typical day , according to Gillio .
He said residents should flag down an officer if they need help .
The city of Gilroy is also sending out emergency notifications on cable channel 17 and 1610 a.m. radio and setting up freeway signs directing people to the cable and radio outlets , according to city spokesman Joe Kline .
The city also sent fliers to the schools with information about how to report an emergency .
Children were asked to bring the fliers home to their parents .
Elsewhere , officials are urging people to go to their nearest fire or police department or local hospital or flag down an emergency vehicle .
“ Verizon is completely down ; other carriers are intermittent at best , ” said Zachary DeVine , a Santa Clara County spokesman .
The damaged fiber optic line owned is by AT&T and leased out to Verizon , DeVine said .
The problem was first reported around 2 a.m. when police in Morgan Hill and Gilroy contacted Santa Clara county dispatchers to report their phones were down .
That began a chain of reactions as Santa Clara County officials responded immediately , DeVine said .
The county has held over fire crews and has sent additional sheriff ’s deputies to Morgan Hill and Gilroy .
Police and fire radios remain operational , meaning field officers are able to get calls from dispatchers and communicate with one another to coordinate aid for anyone reporting to a local fire or police station , DeVine said .

One has to understand that when he applies the ubiquitous " they , " Beck is tapping in the process of dehumanization of an objectified " other . "
Indeed , Beck , now alluding to the " socialist menace , " has made a career of tapping into racist and pseudo - religious fears of the Joe the Plumber audience .
During a May 11 , 2006 Clear Channel radio broadcast of The Glenn Beck Program , Beck said : “ I say we nuke the bastards .
In fact , it does n’t have to be Iran .
It can be everywhere , any place that disagrees with me . ”
During the July 12 , 2007 edition of his CNN Headline News show , Beck stated : “ We ’ve got World War III to fight .
Yes , it is the end of days … .
Here ’s what I do know about … the impending apocalypse .
One , we ca n’t coexist with people who want to blow up trains and subways ….
I also know that whether you like it or not , this is a religious war .
Radical Muslims want to wipe everybody else off the face of the earth . ”
During an August 10 , 2006 airing of The Glenn Beck Program , after calling out Muslims for not being “ the first ones in the recruitment office lining up to shoot the bad Muslims in the head , ” Beck added , ominously , “ I ’m telling you , with God as my witness … when people become hungry , when people see that their way of life is on the edge of being over , they will put razor wire up and just based on the way you look or just based on your religion , they will round you up .
Is that wrong ?
Oh my gosh .
It is Nazi , World War II wrong , but society has proved it time and time again :
It will happen . ”
“ The Middle East is being overrun by 10th Century barbarians , ” Beck announced during the September 12 , 2006 CNN Headline News broadcast .
“ If they take over …we ’re going to have to nuke the whole place . ”
On October 4 , 2006 Sharida McKenzie , a Muslim American and organizer of the Muslim Peace March was Beck ’s guest on his CNN program .
He asked , “ How do we know the difference between you and those who are trying to kill us ? ”
On November 16 , 2006 it was Representative Keith Ellison ( D.MN ) , the first Muslim ever to be elected to the United States Congress .
“ I have been nervous about this interview with you , ” Beck tells Ellison , “ because what I feel like saying is , ‘ Sir , prove to me that you are not working with our enemies . ’”
Beck then added , “ I ’m not accusing you of being an enemy , but that ’s the way I feel , and I think a lot of Americans feel that way . ”

Becks ' style is closest to an evangelical TV preacher and this probably resonates with his audience .
There have been a couple of suicides in his immediate family , so you have to actually fear for his sanity .
Also having converted to the Mormon religion does not reassure one of his mental sharpness .
He 's on the high cycle now , what happens if he falls ?

Honestly , Gos , Pete 's comment does n't look like any more to me than a mild disdain for religion itself , and also does n't come under the heading of a racial slur .
He said it about a public person , not using religion to attack another commenter , so , truly , I do n't see how that comment should merit such a tizzy .
And why are you griping to Brad about it ?
Are you just determined to find fault with Brad ?
Seems to me you want to beat him up about something every other day .
Beck reminds me of Tammy Faye Bakker ....

Gos asked :

Why would n't I ?
I know you believe that I 'm the Supreme Protector for all things Jewish and / or related to Israel in this world , somehow , since that seems to be all you ever have to suggest in your comments .
I 'll presume that 's because you 've decided I'm Jewish , as based on my last name .
And you 're right !
I am Jewish , but if you 've confused someone born Jewish with someone who protects all things Jew and Israel , well , you may want to convert to Mormonism ( I 'm not even sure how that 's supposed to be a slur , but since you thought it was , I figured I 'd use it to make my point ) .
You 'll find plenty of objectionable racist stuff in user comments here , including , no doubt , anti-Semitic stuff that you may have posted here ( at least if I listened to others who complained about you ) .
Though we have , on very rare occassions , deleted incredibly inappropriate , incredibly offensive racist comments , we 'd prefer not to be the PC Police or the Kindergarten Cops here .
Often , we 'll let such comments stand because they reflect so poorly on the poster who wrote them ( go back and look at some of those threads following the L.A. May Day Police Riot , for example ) .
Maybe you were out to dinner I wish .
Have n't had time to eat anything all day , as usual .
Had to get out the Green News this morning , been working on another story for most of the day since then , until I had to spend hours watching a live hearing in the Nevada state legislature concerning a bill to move the state to paper ballots .
I hope that 's okay with you , Gos .

First off I 've only ever posted under this name so please do n't ascribe any comments made by any others to me .
Now , I can see how people might think that I 'm a bit anti-semitic because I 'm always harping on Israel and whatnot but it's not without reason and it's not based solely on your last name either .
The first post I ever made on this blog was during the Gaza offensive when I noticed a trend on many left leaning blogs including this one to completely ignore what was happening there , and the larger issue of excessive Israeli / Jewish influence in U.S. politics especially foreign policy .
I felt you were helping keep your readers in the dark ( along with MANY other progressive media outlets ) about serious questions our country should be asking .
Just like I feel your helping keep them in the dark largely about Obama , who really is no progressive , and JUST SO HAPPENS TO STAND ACCUSED OF GAMING THE PRIMARIES himself .
Another topic you seem pretty disinterested in .
So whatever man , make your jokes about being the supreme defender of all jews wherever and hint at me being a coward that posts racial slurs under other names , I still say you 're a sell out that MANAGES THE PERCEPTION of his readers and does n't tell us the whole truth and nothing but the truth .
Just answer me this , Brad , do you feel like we 're given a ( pardon the phrase ) fair and balanced look at matters concerning Israel and our support of them here in this country or not ?
Any opinion on Jewish interests in Canada successfully preventing someone from entering the country because of his criticisms of Israel ?

Kinda disappointing that you act like this elephant in the room does n't exist .
Oh , and the reason that I got in a " tizzy " about the mormon comment is because it 's unthinking , presumptuous , and arrogant .
It 's no different from someone like say , Glenn Beck , saying that liberals are a bunch of limp wristed mama 's boys that got their ass whooped too much in high school so now they want to tell everyone what to do .
Lumping a bunch of people together into a group is the sign of a lazy mind that does n't want to think anymore .
I 've read in several places that Mormons tend to be a very well represented group in many of the intelligence organizations of the U.S. , so maybe they are n't quite as stupid as you think .
But beyond that people need to realize that lazy divisive thinking like this is what KEEPS AMERICANS FROM COMING TOGETHER .
It just boggles my mind how supposedly enlightened and intellectual liberals can't see that the assumptions they make about right wingers are no different from the assumptions they make about us , it 's just a different archetype .

Gos : I 'm with you on the lazy divisive thinking part , but I also think that flipping over what is n't exactly politically correct is part of exactly what you say KEEPS AMERICANS FROM COMING TOGETHER .
There 's too much pull to group think on both sides ... and , yes , I 'd go so far as to say as much on the liberal / progressive side as on the conservative / regressive side .
You can't talk about ANYTHING deeply and seriously without someone 's buttons getting pushed .
So , personally , I 'd love it if people could grouse openly , without getting bashed to smithereens or causing a big old hairy flame war .
Pete 's comment only read to me that Pete does n't think highly of the intelligence of religious people .
That 's his right , and as long as he's not being hatefully inflammatory or trying to hurt the feelings of someone else on the thread , I really think it 's okay to just let people read it the way they see it .
I think liberals should learn to watch who / what they call " racist " , " homophobic " , " sexist " , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera , because they blank out their own brains when they leap to incant that stuff .
I happen to think derogating the intelligence of religious people is way counterproductive , not strictly the problem , and divisive , but there are a great many people out there who feel the threat from religious fanaticism has gotten completely out of hand and have become militant atheists to battle it back .
Some are among the best minds we have .
I agree with their premise , even though I think their approach is wrong , so unless they 're being hateful and hurtful about it , I do n't think it rises to the level of needing to be deleted .
I can't speak to the rest of your issues , but I do n't think you should jump down Brad 's throat because someone comes in and makes a mildly disparaging comment about religious people .
I do n't think you should have jumped down Pete 's either , because I agree with you about lazy and divisive thinking , but that 's just me .

Gos -
You do understand that I can't possibly read every comment , much less reply to them all , right ?
Hope so .
So I hope you similarly appreciate how I 'm doing my best to deal with you respectfully .
With that in mind ...
I have n't " ascribe[d ] any comments made by any others to " you .
If you inferred that from what I wrote , I 'll apologize , as that was n't my attempt to suggest any such thing , but rather to note that what commenters write here cannot be my sole responsibility .
If so , I 'd have had to have banned you long ago due to complaints about your perceived anti-Semitism .
You were offended by Pete 's comment , you were allowed the ability to respond to it .
Do so respectfully , without personally attacking other commenters , and you wo n't have a prob .
( As noted in the rules , you are welcome to personally attack me , or public officials all you like , but not other commenters . )
You said :
The first post I ever made on this blog was during the Gaza offensive when I noticed a trend on many left leaning blogs including this one to completely ignore what was happening there , and the larger issue of excessive Israeli / Jewish influence in U.S. politics especially foreign policy .
And I believe I replied to that comment by telling you that I can't possibly cover everything .
I can't cover everything I wish to cover here , much less everything that you wish I covered .
Just like I feel your helping keep them in the dark largely about Obama , who really is no progressive , and JUST SO HAPPENS TO STAND ACCUSED OF GAMING THE PRIMARIES himself .
I 've " kept them in the dark " about Obama ?
Really ?
I 've not been critical enough of him for your taste ?
Sorry , chief .
Luckily , you 've got a place to offer your own opinions to readers right here .
For the record , I believe I 've held his feet to the fire when deserved , and when I 've had the time and space and resources and interest in doing so .
Though , while I did n't vote for him , I do n't seem to have the tremendous problems with what he 's doing that you seem to .
Perhaps that 's because the bar has been so lowered in the last eight years , that I 'm willing to give him more than two months before tearing him a new one .
But if that 's not soon enough for you , I 'd welcome you to say your piece here when appropriate , or otherwise get your own blog and beat him up all ya like .
It 's free at Blogger , ya know .
You 'll be up and spewing in no time .
As to accusations of " gaming the primaries " , you 'll understand if what I looked at in that regard did n't particiularly impress me one way or another .
Sorry .
But , again , you and other Obama - bashers are welcome to disagree all you like and share whatever evidence you believe people should see with the world in order to make your case , if you feel that 's the best use of your time .
So I hope that 's okay .
Just answer me this , Brad , do you feel like we 're given a ( pardon the phrase ) fair and balanced look at matters concerning Israel and our support of them here in this country or not ?
No .
Any opinion on Jewish interests in Canada successfully preventing someone from entering the country because of his criticisms of Israel ?
Based on the article you linked to , I think it sucks , though I have n't read enough about it to offer anything to the issue .
So , again , I hope that 's okay .
Kinda disappointing that you act like this elephant in the room does n't exist .
I think you need a bigger living room , Gos. BTW , for the record , this blog was one of the first in the country to cover Galloway at all , way back in 2005 .
Gave him quite a bit of coverage and received huge traffic from all over at the time .
Was even contacted by his office and had tried to help get him on the air way back when .
Do some Googling here , Gos .
And yeah , get a bigger living room , amigo .

So today ’s ancient Chinese story is really a poem .
I had recently bought a book by Arthur Waley containing all sorts of ancient Chinese tales and poetry .
This is the sad truth of ancient Chinese women and their lives .
So today before I write the translation from Arthur Waley I will give a brief history of the women in China .
During the ancient times , women in the world generally ( not always though depending which society you speak of ) were not so highly respected .
In China , where Confucianism eventually would become the dominant Chinese philosophy , women in ancient Chinese society would gradually be seen as inferior to men .
They were there essentially just to treat the men well and be the typical housewife .
When a woman was born , there was no joy to be found and women were placed under the bed for the first few days ( mind you I researched this and thought it was a lie until I read of it in actual Chinese texts still in Chinese ) in order to humble the ancient girls .
This ancient Chinese poem will tell you the rest .
Now on today ’s on Chinese Tales and stories post I will only change some words from Wade - Giles into ping yin .
The title of the poem is called To Be a Woman originally written by the Chinese poet Fu Xuan .
— — — ——
How sad it is to be a woman !
Nothing on earth is held so cheap .
Boys stand leaning at the door
Like Gods Fallen out of Heaven .
Their hearts brave the Four Oceans ,
The wind and dust of a thousand miles .
No one is glad when a girl is born :
By her the family sets no store .
When she grows up , she hides in her room
Afraid to look a man in the face .
No one cries when she leaves her home -
Sudden as clouds when the rain stops .
She bows her head and composes her face ,
Her teeth are pressed on her red lips :
She bows and kneels countless times .
She must humble herself even to the servants .
His love is distant as the stars in Heaven ,
Yet the sunflower bends toward the sun .
Their hearts more sundered than water and fire -
A hundred evils are heaped upon her .
Her face will follow the years ’ changes :
Her lord will find new pleasures .
They that were once like substance and shadow
Are now as far as Hu from Qin
Yet Hu and Qin shall sooner meet
Than they whose parting is like Can and Chen
— — — –
While this is usually the case , there were some exceptionally powerful women in China .
Today ’s ancient Chinese Stories ’ poem actually is from the time of Empress Wu , who was known as one of the harshest leaders in the Tang , but she also did help it develop as well .
I could go on for quite a while about her , but perhaps I will reserve that for another post .
Before I end off today ’s tale , the picture I took here is from the summer of 2007 and the water was still so warm from the fountains .
Thanks again for reading everyone .
Ontario will enact the toughest rules in Canada when its pesticide ban takes effect today , a move that could land the province in the legal crosshairs of an international trade dispute .
Ontario is joining Quebec in restricting the use of pesticides , but its rules go further by prohibiting the sale and cosmetic use of more than 80 ingredients and 250 products , with few exceptions , experts say .
Other provinces are considering similar restrictions to protect the environment and public health , including British Columbia , Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick , said Lisa Gue of the David Suzuki Foundation .
Science has n't yet proven what effect , if any , pesticides have on our health , but given the risks , governments must err on the side of caution , Gue said from Ottawa .
" The lack of scientific certainty cannot be an excuse to delay action to protect health and the environment , " she said .
" And that 's exactly what Quebec , and now Ontario , have done . "
Both provinces have even banned weed killer 2,4 - D even though it has been deemed safe by Health Canada – a move that sparked a NAFTA challenge of Quebec 's ban .
Dow AgroSciences LLC , which manufactures 2,4 - D , has decided to sue the federal government and seek $ 2 million in damages , arguing that Quebec 's rules violate Canada 's trade obligations because it prohibits a product without any scientific basis .
The company would n't say whether it will go after Ontario 's ban as well .
" Our legal action is focused solely on Quebec at this time , and I wo n't speculate on any other action that we might take in Canada , " said spokeswoman Brenda Harris .
" What I do think is important is that when provinces or jurisdictions are considering these types of things , that they really look closely at science , and making sure that science is part of the process . "
Ontario's environment minister said he is n't worried by the potential threat of a lawsuit .
" We think we 're doing absolutely the right thing by banning pesticides from our laws and gardens , and we 'll have to wait and see what the courts say about that , " said John Gerretsen .
" But I 'm quite confident that they will uphold the right of Ontario to take this kind of an action . "
Experts , such as the Ontario College of Family Physicians , have warned that the long - term effects of exposure to pesticides can be devastating , especially to pregnant women and children .
But unlike Quebec , Ontario municipalities are forbidden from enacting tougher anti-pesticide rules .
When Premier Dalton McGuinty announced the ban a year ago , he mistakenly said towns and cities could have stronger bylaws if they wanted to – a move many applauded .

Two weeks later , he admitted that he " screwed up , " but shifted the blame to Gerretsen , who had failed to correct his boss in front of reporters .
The government 's refusal to change the legislation angered some municipalities and health groups , as well as the Ontario New Democrats .
" I still think municipalities should be able to go beyond what the province put in place , " said Peter Tabuns , the party 's environment critic .
" The City of Toronto had rules in place that had gone beyond what 's going to be enforced in Ontario . "
Ontario will still allow pesticides to be used in farming , forestry or for health and safety reasons , such as controlling mosquitoes that can carry diseases like the West Nile virus .
Golf courses will also be able to use pesticides , but must meet certain conditions to minimize the effects on the environment .
CropLife Canada , a pesticide industry association , says lawns and gardens represent only about four per cent of the pesticide business across Canada .
Quebec , which announced its ban in 2003 , prohibits the use and sale of 20 ingredients in lawn pesticides and has additional restrictions for their use outside public daycares and schools .

Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPhone business is great for Apple :
It 's providing the company 's strongest source of growth , it 's a technology leader , and it 's very profitable .
But it 's still very small , all things considered .
Mobile research firm ABI Research estimates 258 million mobile phones were shipped worldwide in Q1 .
With 3.8 million March quarter shipments , Apple 's iPhone represented just 1.5 % of the market , if ABI 's estimate is accurate .
That means that there 's lots of room for Apple to grow .
But it also means that the vast majority of the world 's population are choosing non-Apple phones .
Not all of them have the opportunity to buy iPhones , but many do .
We believe that the mobile market is going to become more like the desktop market :
As software becomes more important , people will be more loyal to mobile platforms .
BlackBerry users will be more likely to stay with BlackBerries , iPhone users will be more likely to stay with iPhones , etc .
So at some point , Apple will want to build its market share .
Yesterday , we outlined a few things Apple should to do to keep its iPhone business growing .
And you left some great comments .

How did humans evolve from early primates ?
How did “ human like ” traits such as a smaller jaw relative to apes and hairlessness pop up when they do n’t appear in the wild in any real frequency ?
The typical explanation for why humans have smaller jaws than early primates is that our diets changed and our brains got bigger , pressures that caused a smaller jaw .
But there ’s another way to look at this – what if our diets changed and our brains got bigger due to proto - human society dealing and adapting to an increasingly frequent and nearly catastrophic mutation of the jaw ?

The human and chimpanzee genomes have both been mapped , so we are able to make comparisons between them .
This is extremely useful , as chimpanzees and humans shared a common ancestor , but genetic lines split apart approximately 7 million years ago .
So examining the differences may tell us something about how humans evolved .
There is a protein called myosin heavy chain 16 ( aka MYH16 ) which in chimpanzees and other non-human primates is expressed almost exclusively in their powerful jaw muscles .
These strong jaws are an adult trait – a logically complex one that would be more sensitive to random mutations .
And that ’s exactly what seems to have happened .
Non-human primates have DNA that codes for the complete MYH16 protein .
The corresponding part of human DNA is missing a random chunk – which causes a frameshift mutation .
Frameshift Mutations
What is a frameshift mutation ?
Well , first let ’s find out how we build proteins .
We have a strand of messenger RNA ( imagine a long tape with letters on it ) which a ribosome ( hell , imagine a tiny elf ) uses to produce proteins .
The critical thing to consider is that a ribosome builds a protein by reading three nucleotides at a time , and these three nucleotides code for a certain amino acid .
These amino acids are chained together to produce proteins .
Some combinations of three nucleotides can also act as “ punctuation marks ” .
So our wee elf looks closely at the long tape of letters , and starts off with the first three .
His “ frame ” , the little chunk he works on , is three letters long .
This frame is an instruction to build a certain amino acid , which he makes .
He then goes along the tape , three letters at a time , making an amino acid each time that he sticks onto the last .
This will eventually create a long chain of amino acids that we call a protein .
But each frame does n’t need to code for just an amino acid – it can also code for other instructions ( those “ punctuation marks ” ) starting or stopping this chaining process .
Now you may have guessed what a frameshift mutation is by now – it ’s where a single letter in our tape disappears , or a new random one gets thrown in , causing our frame to get shifted slightly .
This means that the resulting triplets after this error will be horribly wrong .
It ’s like the difference between
HEY MAN HOW ARE YOU BRO and
HEY MAN HWA REY OUB RO_ or HEY MAN HOQ WAR EYO UBR O__
if one were to speak in sentences containing only three letter words .
The first sentence makes sense if we parse three letters at a time .
The two others have a random letter removed , and a random letter added in .
If we parse them three letters at a time , the sentence turns into garbage halfway through !
The resulting nonsense ( or malformed protein ) is a result of a random insertion or deletion of information ( nucleotides ) and our “ frame ” , the manner in which we interpret it .
Consequences
So a frameshift mutation occured in early humans that affected the production of the protein MYH16 .
This protein is involved in the strong powerful jaws that primates have , but not humans .
We often think of mutations as a simple little “ blip ” in the genetic code , but the way our bodies parse this code can cause cascading effects .
Instead of MYH16 having a slightly different amino acid in a random spot from a random mutation , the specified amino acids after the mutation will change completely !
So you might think that we ’ll have some odd protein that ’s mostly normal , and the parts after the mutation affected by the frameshift will be wonky .
But – and this is an important but – the triplets code for “ punctuation marks ” too , remember ?
In this MYH16 mutation , it turns out that this frameshift caused a punctuation mark ( aka a stop codon ) to just pop up – so the protein is cut off far sooner than it should be !
Not too good for any traits relying on that protein .
Look at the differences between these gorilla and human skulls below .
The large bony ridges on the gorilla skull on the left are where the larger jaw muscles attach – otherwise they would literally tear off of the skull .
You can also see how the gorilla skull seems “ empty ” on the sides – that ’s because it is filled with large jaw muscles , reducing space available for the brain .
The red tinted parts are where the jaw muscles attach – you can see how much more “ anchoring ” a gorilla ’s jaw muscle requires .
And this is where it gets interesting .
This mutation in our human ancestors happened approximately 2.4 million years ago .
Right before our ancestors stopped looking like primates and started looking like us .
If you lacked the protein that operated a powerful jaw muscle , you could not carry a large jawbone around and use it effectively .
If you ca n’t carry a large jawbone around , there is strong selection pressure for those with smaller jaws to survive .
If your jaw gets smaller , then the loading of the jaw on the skull decreases – bony ridges disappear , and the skull can get larger and lighter since it does n’t need to be as strong .
A larger and lighter skull can accommodate a bigger brain .
It appears that a random mutation , flipping a single bit of genetic information , has beautifully complex cascading results .
Viewing the world as a hostile agent of noise and fury , winding down to an eventual death by entropy is wrong .
You can fold a piece of paper , give it to a child , and have them cut crude holes in it with cheap scissors – and when you unfold it , the snowflake is beautiful .
So too can randomness be folded and twisted by logical structures in biology and physics – and the result is our amazing world .

What is the chance that alien life exists ?
Nasa 's latest mission - the Kepler Space Telescope due to launch on Friday night to survey the heavens for Earth - like planets - could take us a step closer to an answer .
Kathryn Westcott asks four experts whether mankind prefers the idea of being alone and unique or whether we long for cosmic cousins .

Vatican observatory Robert J Sawyer is a Hugo Award - winning science fiction writer Throughout the history of science , there have been a series of developments from Copernicus ( who displaced the Earth from the centre of the Universe ) to Darwin ( who showed we were n't created full - blown by the hand of God ) that knocked out our status of being special .
The one claim to being special that we have been able to hold on to is the belief that Earth is the only place in the Universe where intelligent life exists .
We already know that our galaxy is teeming with planets - that was the first step in dethroning us from being the only abode of intelligent life

For many people , there is a psychological need to be special , and so Kepler - which I bet will succeed in its quest - will take away from that .
But for those of us who believe that Earth is merely a typical example and that life - bearing planets are common , Kepler 's success will be a wonderful thing .
We already know that our galaxy is teeming with planets - that was the first step in dethroning us from being the only abode of intelligent life .
Kepler takes us on the next step : determining if many of those planets are Earth - like .
After that , we need to determine if such planets have life , and then if that life is intelligent .
Still there are only two possible answers to the question of whether other Earth - like worlds exist - and whichever answer we get will be astonishing .
If we were to find intelligent life on an Earth - like planet , that civilisation would almost certainly be more advanced than ours , given that our Universe is 11 billion years old ; we are absolute newborns on the cosmic state .
And , because we are so young , we are facing a huge crisis : our civilisation is on the brink of disaster because of our immature use of technology , both through climate change and through weapons of mass destruction .
Many people think we wo n't survive ; there 's been a resurgence in the belief in Armageddon .
To learn that an extraterrestrial civilisation has survived its technological adolescence would be an inspiring object lesson for us , and would help put an end to all the nay - saying and doom - mongering .
At the moment , people 's focus is incredibly narrow - there is a lot of navel - gazing .
We are not thinking about the big questions .
If the Kepler mission is successful , our focus will widen - and that 's all to the good .

In the past 15 years , the area of exo-planet research has been one of massive progress .
Since 1995 , more than 300 planets have been discovered orbiting other stars relatively near to us in space .
Earth 's circumstances are really far too special to be easily replicated
But when it comes to whether Earth - like systems are common or not , we really are into the realms of pure speculation .
If Kepler finds Earth - like systems , the next question would be whether this is the kind of environment in which one might start looking for life .
That next level of detail requires a few steps in inference .
The conditions must be right for life to evolve .
These planets would have to be the right distance from their star to have liquid water , and would have to have a similar temperature to Earth .
And , in terms of the host star itself , you need very special conditions : it would need to be the right age , mass and luminosity for life as it we know it to develop .
And if the planet is much lighter than the Earth , or much heavier , then the conditions would not be right either .
In terms of what Kepler might find , the best knowledge at the moment is that it might discover some 50 - 100 Earth - like planets , but we simply do n't know .
Astronomers would not be surprised if that many were found .
It 's an exciting experiment , because it might find many more - or perhaps many less !
Whatever it finds , it 's going to advance our knowledge .
But is life as we know it common or unique ?
Earth 's circumstances are really far too special to be easily replicated - there are so many coincidences , chances and conspiracies that seem to be needed for life to take hold and thrive .
Perhaps primitive life forms could exist out there amongst the almost infinity of worlds that probably exist , but as for intelligent life I 'm putting my money on the fact that in the whole Universe , we are pretty much unique .

The idea that there could be other intelligent creatures made by God in a relationship with God is not contrary to traditional Judeo - Christian thought .
The Bible has many references to , or descriptions of , non -human intelligent beings ; after all , that 's what angels are .

Our cousins on other planets may even have their own salvation story  including other examples of the incarnation of the second person of the Trinity .
We are open to whatever the Universe has for us .
I am , however , sceptical that we will be able to have these conversations with any life form that is discovered ... certainly , not in my lifetime !
The idea that there might not only be us is a wonderful one .
It does not question our uniqueness or contradict our belief in God .
For most people , if new forms of life were to be discovered , it would not mean everything they believed was wrong , it would only reinforce what they believed all along .
John Herschel , son of the discoverer of Uranus and a founder of the Royal Astronomical Society , argued that it would have been a waste of a Universe if God had only created one place where there were people He loved .
This is not an argument based on logic , science or philosophy , but an aesthetic one .
The important thing is to keep in mind that the Universe is the deliberate creation of a loving God .
Catholics should not be afraid to embrace such speculations , but we should always remember that they are just speculations .
We do n't know .
But reflecting on these possibilities lets us appreciate in a deeper way what God 's redemption actually does mean for us .
My science tells me how God created the Universe and that he loves that Universe .
We should n't be afraid of the truth .
I would be delighted if other Earths harbouring intelligent life were discovered .
For most people , however , it would be nothing more than a nine - day wonder .
I think that we 've lived with the idea so much , from speculations by scientists to creatures in science fiction movies , that the human race is already well used to the idea that we are not alone .
We need to look beyond ourselves  that 's what religion does when it 's done right and what astronomy does when it 's done right .

Dr Steven J
Dick is an astronomer and chief historian at Nasa The Kepler mission is definitely a landmark one , and finding an Earth - sized planet will raise the debate about whether we are alone or not .
Because of popular culture , such as Star Trek , a lot of people would be expecting intelligent life to exist
We have known for a long time that we are not the centre of the Universe , the question now is whether biologically we are central .
It 's all we have left .
Even if intelligent life were discovered , we would remain unique in terms of morphology and form .
The chances are another civilisation would be more advanced than us because of the age of the Universe and the fact that our species is comparatively young .
For the human mind , this is a natural question going back to ancient Greeks .
Because of popular culture , such as Star Trek , a lot of people would be expecting intelligent life to exist , and are already prepared .
The whole idea of life on another world would certainly raise a lot of debate , particularly in terms of how unique our religion and our philosophy is .
This would be good , we have got into a rut of looking at everything from a terrestrial point of view .
Is it scarier to learn that we are alone or not ?
Well , there are those who would warn us to be careful but most people would be open - minded .

This telescope could have quite a profound impact on the human race .
Hubble opened our eyes and imagination to the wonders of the galaxy & universe so will Kepler spark the imagination of what could inhabit an Earth like planet within the 3000 l/y region .
Taking in images of continents and land masses will truly inspire generations of thinkers and leaders .
Perhaps it will give mankind the boost of inspired curiosity it needs to reach for the stars once again .
We can only speculate for the moment what pictures of Earth did to those civilizations in our stellar neighbourhood .
Allen Array / SETI , get ready for some hot leads !
Alex , London I am sure that there is or has been life in the universe , but nobody appears to have mentioned that because of the vast distances measured in Light Years , between other Star systems and our own , any radio or other form of communication that we might receive would have had to have been sent hundreds or thousands of years ago .
Therefore these civilisations may have become extinct themselves by the time their signals reach us .
Likewise any signals that we send today will not be received by other civilisations until thousands of years into the future by which time we will no doubt be extinct as a species ourselves .
John Grinham , Weston super Mare , UK
It may well be that we are currently the only sentient species in the universe , but there 's no way of knowing that of course .
There is no doubt in my mind however that sentient species arise , exist for a time , then die out as suns expire .
Chances of two such species being around at the same time and close enough to communicate ?
Virtually nil - but that does n't mean it 's impossible , merely improbable .
The only way for any life to escape destruction when their parent star dies is to become space - faring and find a habitable planet to colonise - again a highly improbable scenario to my mind .
Barry , Burton - in - Kendal , UK
It 's amazing that the discussion seems to be centred around the search for ' intelligent ' life .
Surely even the discovery of alien bacteria would be astonishing .
Given the tens of thousands ( even millions ) of variations in life on earth - from microbes to plant to animal - logic would say that if life is found anywhere other than Earth , intelligent life MUST also exist elsewhere .
If the universe is infinite ( if it is n't then what 's on the outside ? ) - and we know that life evolves into many forms to cope with even the most extreme conditions , then even bacterial evidence would be enough to know that somewhere out there must be every form of life we can possibly imagine ?
A one in infinity chance is still infinite .
Pete Vox , London
While your writers suggest that alien life may be more advanced than ours , there 's no guarantee that such life would have advanced morality , at least not from our point of view .
In order to survive for so long , alien life may have habitually removed any competition , and when we signal our presence perhaps that 's how we will be regarded .
There could be a short interlude before , in line with their own impeccable morals , we are simply squashed like bugs .
Stormerne Hunt , Glasgow , UK
It 's sheer arrogance to believe our life form is special - or correct .
There are assuredly other life forms well - suited to their environment that exist in the wide universe that may be more capable of survival than we fragile humans .
The apparently hard - wired tendency for humans to invade new territory and destroy existing cultures and beings ( European invasions of the Americas , for example ) may be our downfall when we go to space .
Dorey , Washington DC
Let 's hope we do n't find an intelligent species out there .
Our history on Earth shows that we would try and dominate and exploit them .
And if they are more advanced than us ... oh dear .
paul taylor , monte carlo , monaco Brother Guy Consolmagno , why would you say that mentioning a god makes any sense in this discussion ?
Just a question , why do you question and search for known planets while you blindly believe in a deity for which there is no evidence ?
Tim B. , Sasebo , Japan
If you feel you need an explanation for why the human race exists then this search provides as good an answer as any .
We are here to understand the Universe .
This works just as well for people of no religion as it does for people of any religion .
On this basis , this is one of the most wonderful efforts of human civilization and we are fortunate to be around as it happens .
jeremy slawson , Plymouth UK Humans finding a similar planet : .......... you are joking ?
Do you really need to ask what we would do ?
With the track record our species has .
This has to be the most facile comment to date .
THE VERY SAME WE ARE DOING TO THIS ONE !
We can only hope that any species we may find will be less developed than our own .
l could be terminal for our very existence to come across a truly advanced , objective species .
Mark Webb , B C Canada
The sheer size of the universe indicates that even the most improbable event - Intelligent life - is likely to occur many many times over .
However the age and size of the Universe suggests that for two intelligent lifeforms to exist simultaneously and close enough to see / hear each other the chances are tiny .
' Humans ' have been around for a few 10,000s of years yet only in the last couple of hundred have we been at an advanced stage to be seen or heard by anyone so for us to be found there would need to be an intelligent lifeform present in our backyard .
The question is similar to putting 5 people randomly across the Saraha over a period of a year each with only 2 days food and water and working out how likely it is any of them would meet another living person .
Karl , Cambridge UK
I love the idea of there being other planets with life , but I think we need to focus on sorting ours out first .
Its the equivalent of having guests round to your house without tidying it up first ... imagine they came to visit ... what they will think when they see how untidy we are ...
John Wroath , London
Here we go again !
" to Darwin ( who showed we were n't created full - blown by the hand of God ) that knocked out our status of being special . "
First of all ..
Darwin NEVER proved or showed that we were not created " full - blown " by the hand of God .
It was and continues to be a theory .
A " Theory people ... a theory !!!!
Not proof , not truth , but simply a theory .
One that has never been proven , but many times over has been shown to be majorly flawed even in its very basic concept .
As for there being life outside of the Earth ..
I have no problem with that idea or concept .
As a creationist , I am not appalled by the idea that if God created us , and this earth and system ..
He could have very well of created another .
Does that make me any less special ?
No it does n't .
Does it make me nervous .. not at all .
Dr. Phillip D. Murray , Martinsburg , WV I agree with Dorey , the arrogance of Dr Perryman to assume that intelligent life could only evolve under the exact circumstances seen on Earth is unbelievable .
On Earth there are examples of life in what we as humans would consider extreme environments such as undersea thermal vents at huge temperatures and pressures .
Who is to say that given another 3 billion years , these would not evolve into a completely different ( but still intelligent ) form of life .
Jamie , Leeds , UK
We are probably unique .
Our sun is not ' average ' as many like to think .
It is not large , but is quite dense and white - not yellow .
Our Earth is in the ' life ' zone and shielded magnetically from much of the radiation .
It has a high water content .
In a statistical sense , we are ' off the curve ' .
Mathematicians use a set of averages to try to prove we are one of many , but their arguments are flawed .
( If Sapiens existed out there , we would see blue glowing areas within the galaxy showing us where ' Star Wars ' were happening . )
Wungulai , Toowoomba Australia
I hope there are other intelligent life forms out there , it would be fantastic to find some !
Lets hope the powers that be do n't try and destroy them like we seem to do so well with things on our own planet !
Julian Wilson , Godalming if there was an intelligence species , we would have found one by now .
victor , dubai , UAE
It seems likely that we will come across other intelligent life .
And , I believe that by the time we do and have the ability to communicate with them us humans will be evolved enough to respect and understand our own and others cultures .
Simon , Yambol , Bulgaria
I believe that , chances are , there is intelligent alien life out there .
Considering the philosophical and scientific advances mankind has made over the past ( relatively short ) few thousand years , it seems to me that if there is intelligent life , it could easily be a few thousand years more advanced than us .
I just hope they are n't hungry , and consider us a delicacy .
Nor that they ruined their planet 's environment and decide that our planet would suit them very nicely thank you very much , and consider us to be nothing more than cockroaches to be exterminated from their new home .
Scott , Amsterdam , Netherlands
It would be good for all of us , as a race as we would be forced to think of ourselves as humans not black , white , Muslim , Christian etc etc .
Nigel Bratt , Stafford , England I 'm still looking for intelligent life on Earth .
Kathleen , New Orleans , LA
If the universe is 12 billions years old and our earth only 4.5 , this means that during 7.5 billions years no intelligent life developed elsewhere , for the simple reason that THEY would have encountered us , or given us clear traces of them .
The fact that no credible trace was found is a sufficient sign we are alone , although I cannot exclude the possibility of the contrary .
zorbek , Bangkok
It 's generally accepted that , for all practical intents and purposes , the universe is infinite .
Mathematically , therefore , in an infinite universe there must be an infinite number of planets with intelligent life forms .
Or at least one ...
Jan Vingerhoets , Johannesburg , South Africa
The search for life on other " worlds " is the most ridiculous quest that humanity has ever entertained .
Despite all our faults , we are the only intelligent beings in our space / time .
The Universe we are aware of is a miracle for us alone to wonder at , and even explore , so that we could see the power of the Creator we try to deny .

One of the most accurate forecasters of the global economic crisis , Nouriel Roubini , said last week that last September 's spree of bank takeovers deepened the crisis because it made the already - too - big banks even bigger .
He may well be right ; more interesting is what this tells us about the U.S. banking system going forward .
" The institutions are insolvent , " Roubini said in a Bloomberg Radio interview .
" You have to take them over and you have to split them up into three or four national banks , rather than having a humongous monster that is too big to fail . "
The tale was enough to get the panel to advance legislation that would legalize the use of medical marijuana in Illinois .
Describing her condition , the 46 - year - old Joliet woman testified at a House committee that she illegally uses marijuana to relieve the constant pain she suffers from neurofibromatosis and from a surgery that fused her spine incorrectly .
SPRINGFIELD --- Marijuana user Lucie MacFarlane said she munched a ginger snap cannabis cookie before talking to lawmakers at the Capitol today .
The bill passed the Democratic - controlled House Human Services Committee on a 4 - 3 party - line vote .
It 's the first time such legislation has cleared a House panel .
It now goes to the full House for consideration , so it 's far from becoming law .
Rep. Lou Lang ( D - Skokie ) , who sponsored the legislation , said he wants to create a three - year test program allowing anyone with a “ debilitating medical condition ” to have seven dried cannabis plants and two ounces of dried usable cannabis to relieve the pain and nausea associated with conditions like cancer , HIV or Crohn ’s disease .
The bill would allow the Department of Public Health to give registry identification cards to people who have received recommendation for cannabis use from a doctor , Lang said .
If it becomes law , the bill would make Illinois the 14th state to allow the medical use of cannabis , Lang said .
A similar bill is pending in the Senate .
David Jocson , statewide drug enforcement coordinator with the Illinois State Police , opposed the bill because he said marijuana is not an FDA - approved medication and because allowing people using cannabis for medicinal purposes would make it easier for others to obtain .

Dellums ' presence as risky as his performance On the East Bay
The shooting deaths of four Oakland police officers have touched Oakland and the entire nation , and have also exposed the growing disconnect Mayor Ron Dellums has with the city he is supposed to lead .
Friday 's public memorial service at Oracle Arena for Oakland police Sgts.
Mark Dunakin , Ervin Romans and Daniel Sakai and Officer John
Hege took on an unintended political tone when at least two families did not approve of Dellums ' inclusion on a speakers list that included Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , state Attorney General Jerry Brown , and U.S. Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer .
Dellums ' omission at an event of national interest was both a personal humiliation and the strongest public condemnation yet since taking office more than two years ago .
Friday 's decision was made in deference to the officers ' last wishes and with the support of their colleagues , but also served as a no - confidence vote from rank - and - file officers .
Those sentiments are shared by many residents and elected officials in Oakland .
There is little disagreement among business leaders , residents and Dellums ' elected colleagues that he has largely abdicated his duties and responsibilities as the city 's leader .
Former state Sen .
Don Perata said the events of last week have persuaded him to run for mayor in 2010 .
" I was n't trying to be coy ( on a mayoral run ) , but this just galvanized it for me because you just can't stand there and do nothing , " Perata said .
" People know what I 've done to ban assault weapons and other things I 've done , so they ought to know that I 'm running for mayor . "
Perata , who attended the Friday memorial , said he was stunned by the decision to leave the mayor without a role in the service .
It was an awkward moment , but Dellums ' failed performance , even his presence , has become a collective sore point - and an obstacle - for the members of the Oakland City Council and the community at large .
" You would expect that when something like this happens , the mayor would show up , but he did n't , " one city official said .
Dellums arrived at the police officers ' union hall five hours after the shooting .
A council member said the mayor - by his own inaction - has become " irrelevant " and of no use .
Even with a week to come up with something - anything - to acknowledge the sense of moral outrage felt by the community - and the nation - Dellums shows no resolve , no gumption to use police resources to confront criminal elements in our city .
Dellums was gracious , eloquent and sincere in his apologies , condolences and sympathies to the officers ' families , but he never captured the outrage felt in his city .
" I want to know why the mayor is n't on CNN or a national news show talking about what happened here , " said Sgt. Dom Arotzarena , president of the Oakland Police Officers Association .
" What the hell are we going to do about these parolees in our town ? "
Arotzarena spent the last week attending private and public wakes , hosting thousands of officers from across the nation , and consoling his colleagues .
The police officers too , are searching for answers , and direction and leadership from the city .
" Parolees have been killing people forever in this town .
For -ever , " he said with emphasis .
Sadly , it is n't only law enforcement issues that Dellums has mishandled , rejected or simply ignored .
Dellums says he will not cast the deciding vote at tonight 's meeting of the Oakland City Council to send Measure OO back to voters for modifications .
The measure is a costly voter - approved plan that allocates more than $ 16 million annually to after - school programs .
With Oakland 's budget deficit now approaching $ 50 million to $ 70 million , the council believes the city cannot pay for the new programs , but the panel is split 4 - 4 on whether to send the measure back to voters .
Dellums has had at least five chances to break 4 - 4 council votes .
He 's never weighed in .
Oakland can no longer afford a mayor who spends more time trying to avoid hard decisions instead of making them .
Dellums ' lack of focus and attention to details and his inability to adequately address a crisis has left everyone with the impression that our mayor is more of a liability than an asset .
From this point forward , there is no reason to keep the mayor in the loop because it does n't matter what the issue , he 's simply no longer able to respond in a manner that suggests he understands the gravity of events swirling around him or their consequences .
One mayoral aide went so far as to suggest Dellums ' office do something to rein in the Police Department for its act of defiance .
" I just walked away , " said the city official who heard the suggestion .
JOHANNESBURG  Corruption charges against Jacob Zuma  the man almost certain to become South Africa ’s president after elections later this month  were dropped Monday by prosecutors who said the case had been tainted by a tawdry , secret manipulation of the legal process from within their own ranks .
The case has deeply divided the country and struck at one of its core political questions : how to uphold the rule of law , a particular point of pride in this nascent democracy , when the nation is dominated by a single party and the party ’s most influential figures vie for power .
South Africa has the continent ’s largest economy , and while the decision to halt the prosecution may spare the country the discomfort of being led by a defendant in a corruption case , it did not resolve the underlying allegations that Mr. Zuma , the leader of the governing African National Congress , thrived off 783 payments over a decade ’s time from a convicted briber .
“ It ’s very sad to see Africa ’s major country now going down the same route by which corruption is easily excused by political authorities in other African countries , ” said Laurence Cockcroft , a board member of the British chapter of Transparency International , an anticorruption group .
Senior police officers face serious questions over the " unacceptable " trend of officers disguising their identity during clashes with protesters , the chair of the independent police watchdog warned yesterday , as it began formally investigating a third alleged assault on a G20 protester .
Nick Hardwick , chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , called for a national debate over how police maintain public order and demanded much tougher political accountability , warning that police should remember they were " the servants not the masters " of the people .
He is also seeking the necessary resources for the watchdog to conduct more investigations independently from police - as it is doing over the death of Ian Tomlinson , the news vendor who died after being caught up in the G20 protests - and expanding its remit in cases where there is evidence of wider systematic problems .
The latest investigation concerns a 23 - year - old man who claims to have been assaulted by a Metropolitan police officer in the early evening of 1 April at a police cordon on Cornhill in the City of London , adding to two existing investigations into the death of Tomlinson and claims by a woman activist that she was attacked .
Hardwick told the Observer the latest case would " not necessarily " be the last taken up by the IPCC , which is still sifting almost 90 complaints about the use of force and examining CCTV footage .
He made clear his concerns about incidences of officers disguising their identifying numbers , which should always be displayed on the shoulders of their uniforms , arguing that colleagues should have reported such wrongdoing .
" I think that raises serious concerns about the frontline supervision , " Hardwick said .
" Why was that happening , why did the supervisor not stop them ?
What does that say about what your state of mind is ?
You were expecting trouble ?
" I think that is unacceptable .
It is about being servants , not masters : the police are there as public servants . "
He said such infringements were within the IPCC 's remit " and we will deal with it " .
Hardwick also revealed that the widespread use of mobile phones by protesters to take photographs and video footage of the clashes was providing invaluable evidence .
He suggested that had such footage been available during a violent confrontation between police and Countryside Alliance activists protesting over the hunting ban five years ago the outcome might have been different .
" What 's been important with all these pictures is we have got such a wide picture of what happened , " he said .
" I think that is challenging the police : they have to respond to the fact that they are going to be watched , there is going to be this evidence of what they have done . "
Hardwick said that while the IPCC had attempted a number of prosecutions over the Countryside Alliance demonstration these had failed : " We had to go with what the court said but we were very very surprised at some of the verdicts .
I do n't think this would happen now because there would be all this evidence . "
He welcomed an inquiry announced last week by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary into police tactics during the G20 protests but said a broader debate was needed , particularly about the rights of peaceful protesters in marches liable to be disrupted by a small criminal element .
" It 's got to be a democratic political question about how do we want to be policed ?
I think that needs a proper parliamentary discussion .
The choices we make as a society about that are n't consequence - free .
There are tricky balances to be struck . "
The IPCC has been widely criticised for its initial handling of the G20 complaints , but Hardwick said its remit was restricted to the conduct of individual officers and some of the criticism reflected misunderstandings of its role .
He is now pushing for extra manpower to conduct more investigations - a third of the IPCC 's investigators are working on the G20 cases - and a shake - up of police accountability whether through elected police boards , commissioners or mayors to look at what he said were " perfectly legitimate , proper questions " outside the IPCC 's remit .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said his party was given a guarantee by senior officers after clashes with climate change protesters at Kingsnorth power station in Kent - where there were also complaints of police disguising their identity - that there would be no repeat of such tactics at the G20 protests .
Some officers now appeared prepared to flout recent orders from senior commanders to display their numbers , Huhne said , with another officer photographed at the protest staged by Tamils in Parliament Square with his numbers disguised .
" What we appear to have is repeated cases of police officers ignoring the direct orders of their police supervisors and this is very worrying .
" There 's only one motive for a police officer disguising his identity and that 's because he thinks he 's going to be doing something reprehensible . "
Senior Metropolitan police officers held a series of crisis meetings throughout last week and sources said Sir Paul Stephenson , the new commissioner , was determined to get a grip .
One
Met source said he was ready to " kick some ass " among senior officers .
The IPCC has received more than 185 complaints about the G20 protests , of which 44 are not eligible for consideration , including complaints from people who saw footage on TV .
Around 90 complaints about use of force included witness accounts as well as those from alleged victims .
This question is asked repeatedly in Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged until Galt himself introduces himself to a world in crisis .
In light of this new phenomenon of “ Going Galt ” being encouraged by Michelle Malkin , Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , and many others ( particularly on the Right ) , this question deserves a serious answer .
How else would it be possible for individuals to “ Go Galt ” without answering the question : Who is John Galt ?
I would begin answering the question by explain who Galt is not .
John
Galt is not someone who merely caps the limits on his productivity to avoid being pushed into a higher tax bracket .
What Galt does in Atlas Shrugged is much more radical : going on strike by refusing to produce anything for the benefit of society .
Galt seeks out other high achievers and convinces them to do the same and help him build a society of their own .
Are these folks who claim to be “ Going Galt ” prepared to do this ?
Would Michelle Malkin et. al even be considered by Galt to be invited into his society ?
Hardly .
To be invited to Galt ’s Gulch one has to demonstrate that s/he has rejected the false virtues of altruism , collectivism , and mysticism ( religion ) and embrace his virtues of selfishness , reason , objective reality , and capitalism .
While Malkin and Co. pay lip service to capitalism ( especially when their people are not in control of the levers of power ) , their remaining values run counter to that of Galt’s .
Is it not these very people who wish to erect religious monuments on government property , demand that Intelligent Design ( Creationism ) be taught alongside evolution in government schools , encourage individual sacrifice for the “ greater good , ” and wish to ratchet up the War on ( Some ) Drugs despite the evidence that the policy is completely counterproductive ?
Now that I have pointed out what John Galt is not , perhaps I should allow the man to speak for himself in this modern dramatization * from the novel :
How many of those who say they are “ Going Galt ” prepared to embrace this philosophy by taking the following pledge :
“ I swear , by my life and my love of it , that I will never live for the sake of another man , nor ask another man to live for mine . ”
While I am pleased that the Galt trend is bringing some much needed attention to Atlas Shrugged , it ’s my hope that more individuals will actually read the book and learn exactly what Going Galt is all about .
That way when someone says “ I am John Galt , ” those who have been educated can respond by saying : “ I know John Galt and you sir are no John Galt ! ”
UPDATE : XCowboy2 has released a newer version called “ This is John Galt Speaking 2.0 . ”
Enjoy !

It is a non -so - hidden agenda of this site , Less Wrong , that there are many causes which benefit from the spread of rationality — because it takes a little more rationality than usual to see their case , as a supporter , or even just a supportive bystander .
Not just the obvious causes like atheism , but things like marijuana legalization — where you could wish that people were a bit more self - aware about their motives and the nature of signaling , and a bit more moved by inconvenient cold facts .
The Institute Which May Not Be Named was merely an unusually extreme case of this , wherein it got to the point that after years of bogging down I threw up my hands and explicitly recursed on the job of creating rationalists .
But of course , not all the rationalists I create will be interested in my own project — and that 's fine .
You can't capture all the value you create , and trying can have poor side effects .
If the supporters of other causes are enlightened enough to think similarly ...
Then all the causes which benefit from spreading rationality , can , perhaps , have something in the way of standardized material to which to point their supporters — a common task , centralized to save effort — and think of themselves as spreading a little rationality on the side .
They wo n't capture all the value they create .
And that 's fine .
They 'll capture some of the value others create .
Atheism has very little to do directly with marijuana legalization , but if both atheists and anti-Prohibitionists are willing to step back a bit and say a bit about the general , abstract principle of confronting a discomforting truth that interferes with a fine righteous tirade , then both atheism and marijuana legalization pick up some of the benefit from both efforts .
But this requires — I know I 'm repeating myself here , but it 's important — that you be willing not to capture all the value you create .
It requires that , in the course of talking about rationality , you maintain an ability to temporarily shut up about your own cause even though it is the best cause ever .
It requires that you do n't regard those other causes , and they do not regard you , as competing for a limited supply of rationalists with a limited capacity for support ; but , rather , creating more rationalists and increasing their capacity for support .
You only reap some of your own efforts , but you reap some of others ' efforts as well .
If you and they do n't agree on everything — especially priorities — you have to be willing to agree to shut up about the disagreement .
( Except possibly in specialized venues , out of the way of the mainstream discourse , where such disagreements are explicitly prosecuted . )
A certain person who was taking over as the president of a certain organization once pointed out that the organization had not enjoyed much luck with its message of " This is the best thing you can do " , as compared to e.g. the X - Prize Foundation 's tremendous success conveying to rich individuals of " Here is a cool thing you can do . "
This is one of those insights where you blink incredulously and then grasp how much sense it makes .
The human brain can't grasp large stakes and people are not anything remotely like expected utility maximizers , and we are generally altruistic akrasics .
Saying , " This is the best thing " does n't add much motivation beyond " This is a cool thing " .
It just establishes a much higher burden of proof .
And invites invidious motivation - sapping comparison to all other good things you know ( perhaps threatening to diminish moral satisfaction already purchased ) .
If we 're operating under the assumption that everyone by default is an altruistic akrasic ( someone who wishes they could choose to do more ) — or at least , that most potential supporters of interest fit this description — then fighting it out over which cause is the best to support , may have the effect of decreasing the overall supply of altruism .
" But , " you say , " dollars are fungible ; a dollar you use for one thing indeed cannot be used for anything else ! "
To which I reply :
But human beings really are n't expected utility maximizers , as cognitive systems .
Dollars come out of different mental accounts , cost different amounts of willpower ( the true limiting resource ) under different circumstances , people want to spread their donations around as an act of mental accounting to minimize the regret if a single cause fails , and telling someone about an additional cause may increase the total amount they 're willing to help .
There are , of course , limits to this principle of benign tolerance .
If someone has a project to help stray puppies get warm homes , then it 's probably best to regard them as trying to exploit bugs in human psychology for their personal gain , rather than a worthy sub -task of the great common Neo-Enlightenment project of human progress .
But to the extent that something really is a task you would wish to see done on behalf of humanity ... then invidious comparisons of that project to Your - Favorite - Project , may not help your own project as much as you might think .
We may need to learn to say , by habit and in nearly all forums , " Here is a cool rationalist project " , not , " Mine alone is the highest - return in expected utilons per marginal dollar project . "
If someone cold - blooded enough to maximize expected utility of fungible money without regard to emotional side effects explicitly asks , we could perhaps steer them to a specialized subforum where anyone willing to make the claim of top priority fights it out .
Though if all goes well , those projects that have a strong claim to this kind of underserved - ness will get more investment and their marginal returns will go down , and the winner of the competing claims will no longer be clear .
If there are many rationalist projects that benefit from raising the sanity waterline , then their mutual tolerance and common investment in spreading rationality could conceivably exhibit a commons problem .
But this does n't seem too hard to deal with : if there 's a group that 's not willing to share the rationalists they create or mention to them that other Neo - Enlightenment projects might exist , then any common , centralized rationalist resources could remove the mention of their project as a cool thing to do .
Though all this is an idealistic and future - facing thought , the benefits — for all of us — could be finding some important things we 're missing right now .
So many rationalist projects have few supporters and far - flung ; if we could all identify as elements of the Common Project of human progress , the Neo-Enlightenment , there would be a substantially higher probability of finding ten of us in any given city .
Right now , a lot of these projects are just a little lonely for their supporters .
Rationality may not be the most important thing in the world — that , of course , is the thing that we protect — but it is a cool thing that more of us have in common .
We might gain much from identifying ourselves also as rationalists .

The Future of Macroeconomics By Arnold Kling
Three predictions :
1 . There will be much less emphasis on monetary policy , and much more emphasis on financial institutions and financial regulatory policy .
2 . There will be much less emphasis on fiscal policy , and much more emphasis on sectoral reallocation and labor adjustment policy .
3 . The process of changing the paradigm in macroeconomics will be frustratingly long and difficult .
As physicist Max Planck once said , science advances “ one funeral at a time .
” 1. Macroeconomics has been overly monetarist over the past thirty years .
We believed in the Taylor Rule , which said that the Fed can keep unemployment and inflation close to target values by raising the Federal Funds rate when employment and inflation stray too high and lowering the Fed Funds rate when they stray too low .
What this thinking ignores is the impotence of monetary policy when inflation rates are low .
The money that the Fed creates by expanding its balance sheet is a close substitute for other short - term low - risk assets .
However , short - term , low - risk assets are not close substitutes for long - term , high - risk assets .
Changes in the market mix of short - term , low - risk assets can have little or no effect on interest rates for commercial loans , mortgage loans , and other interest rates that are important determinants of economic activity .
Only when inflation is high do we see highly imperfect substitutability between money and other short - term assets .
When inflation is high , the Fed can step on the brakes by raising short - term interest rates .
On the other hand , the economics profession has paid too little attention to financial institutions and to regulatory policy .
As I pointed out in lectures on macroeconomics , the nonfinancial sector would love to issue risky long - term liabilities to fund investments , while consumers would love to hold riskless short - term assets to maintain liquidity .
The financial sector intermediates by holding risky long - term assets and issuing riskless short - term liabilities .
The more the financial sector expands , the more long - term investment is undertaken in the economy .
In order for the financial sector to do its job properly , it needs to enjoy the right amount of confidence from the public .
With too little confidence , the economy suffers from credit scarcity and insufficient long - term investment .
With too much confidence , the economy suffers from bubbles and excess credit creation , followed by crashes .
The key policy question is what , if anything , the government can do to prevent episodes of over - confidence or under - confidence in financial institutions .
Historically , what we have seen is that after each crisis episode , new forms of guarantees and regulation are introduced .
Over time , these institutions seem to degrade and a new crisis occurs .
Can that cycle be overcome ?
2 . I believe that confidence in generic fiscal policy is also misplaced .
Superficially , it makes sense that government spending can replace private spending when the latter breaks down due to a crisis in the financial sector .
However , the fiscal - stimulus theory fails to take into account the fact that what is going on in the real economy , particularly after a financial shock , is a reallocation of resources out of dying sectors and into emerging sectors .
Instead of looking at fiscal stimulus , I think that economists should focus directly on the adjustment process , particularly in labor markets .
How do new industries emerge to absorb the resources that are released from industries that collapse during a financial crisis ?
What sorts of policies can make this transition take place more quickly and with less difficulty ?
What labor market institutions are most conducive to economic recovery ?
Should government try to create policies that mitigate the cyclical behavior of income shares , so that profits rise less during a boom and fall less during a recession ?
3 . I believe that these questions –how to achieve financial stability and how to facilitate inter-sectoral transitions –will be the main issues in macroeconomics in the future .
However , it may take many funerals before these questions make it to the top of the research agenda .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
COMMENTARY :
President Barack Obama is now halfway through the first 100 days of his presidency , and what a brief but interesting honeymoon it has been .
One of the most impressive things about Mr. Obama ’s first 50 days is how hard he is working .
And the most glaring contrast between him and former President George W. Bush is how well Mr. Obama communicates what , why and how he is trying to accomplish the Herculean tasks before him .
The chattering classes , meanwhile , spend most of their waking hours looking for fights between the president and the Democratic - controlled Congress or the Republican opposition .
They have even tried to revive Sen.
John McCain ’s campaign role as Mr. Obama ’s lead critic .
And when they tire of picking old fights , there are always the Democrats , who can be their own best enemy .
Blue dogs versus the House leadership !
Or all of the above versus the president !
Whee !
There ’s no question the president will have to spar with members of his own party from time to time .
Democrats are not monolithic .
And those inside - the - Beltway Republicans ?
They deserve Oscars at next year ’s Academy Awards ceremony for a new category invented just for them : Worst Actors in a National Recession .
Their whining , rantings and posturing have been pure theater .
Too bad their script does n’t include fresh ideas and sound alternatives .
The Republicans ’ resistance to rolling up their own sleeves and working on important issues is disheartening .
Even the loyal opposition has its own loyal opposition .
Bill , a Republican friend of mine from Missouri , recently e-mailed me : “ I ’m embarrassed by the ongoing conservative rhetoric that is designed to divide , and by all those that continue to embrace it . ”
Mr. Obama has done incredibly well in his first 50 days in office .
In addition to passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , known far and wide as the stimulus bill , the president has been working hard to help transform our economy and reverse some of the misguided policies and practices of the last eight years .
His ability to multitask , thank heaven , is amazing .
“ What might look like a distracted focus to some , ” wrote another friend , Connie , from Illinois , “ looks like a multiphased strategic attack to me .
Without it , where would we be right now ? ”
She ’s right .
Where would some states and localities be right now without the stimulus money to keep teachers at work , police on the beat , and funds flowing to millions of newly unemployed folks whose families have lost their health insurance and are in jeopardy of losing their homes ?
The administration must ignore the near - universal Republican rejection of its policies and continue to think big and bold .
Now , I ’m not drinking the entire jug of Democratic Kool - Aid .
We all know Republicans alone did not get us into this mess of spending money we did not have and going to war in Iraq when we should have finished the job in Afghanistan .
And , yes , providing generous tax cuts to those who did not need them when we knew the bill would come due did n’t help .
We all knew where that AIG , Citibank , Bank of America and other bailout money would be going from the start .
There are people pocketing our hard - earned tax dollars , and we ’re paying to cover their losses just so they can start loaning us money again .
But now it is our own money they ’ll be loaning us .
It is incredibly absurd when you think about it .
If we are to come out of this recession with any hope for a standard of living akin to what we ’ve enjoyed for the last 50 years , the president and Congress must work together to change the securities markets .
They are in need of major reform , which , I suggest modestly , should begin with the fundamental lessons on how credit should be managed .
It is n’t Mr. Obama we should fear .
We should be afraid of those who wish he had done nothing and those who hope he fails .
After all , we are in this together .
No one is immune , including me .
Over the last two months , I have seen my hours cut back , a newspaper column canceled , clients unable to renew their contracts with my firm , and others needing to renegotiate my modest fees .
Business is drying up , and despite all my frantic maneuvers to move my little retirement funds out of harm ’s way , my 401 ( k ) is disappearing faster than the snow from the recent storm .
I do n’t want to see this president fail , and I suggest that to do so is a partisan luxury none of us can afford .
Fifty days is not nearly long enough to allay the personal fears we have about our future .
We are all fearful of what ’s in store for us .
Still , I am enjoying this change in government .
The bad news is certainly tempered by Mr. Obama ’s actions .
And I ’m proud of him so far .
It ’s time we all hope for the best as well as do our best to help those suffering .
As my Republican friend from Missouri reminded , “ We all just have to wait and see how it goes from here . ”

Salt May Be An Antidepressant - Which Would Also Explain Why It 's Addictive
Most people consume far too much salt , and a University of Iowa researcher has discovered one potential reason we crave it : it might put us in a better mood .
UI psychologist Kim Johnson and colleagues found in their research that when rats are deficient in sodium chloride , common table salt , they shy away from activities they normally enjoy , like drinking a sugary substance or pressing a bar that stimulates a pleasant sensation in their brains .
" Things that normally would be pleasurable for rats did n't elicit the same degree of relish , which leads us to believe that a salt deficit and the craving associated with it can induce one of the key symptoms associated with depression , " Johnson said .
The UI researchers can't say it is full - blown depression because several criteria factor into such a diagnosis , but a loss of pleasure in normally pleasing activities is one of the most important features of psychological depression .
And , the idea that salt is a natural mood - elevating substance could help explain why we 're so tempted to over - ingest it , even though it 's known to contribute to high blood pressure , heart disease and other health problems .
Past research has shown that the worldwide average for salt intake per individual is about 10 grams per day , which is greater than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended intake by about 4 grams , and may exceed what the body actually needs by more than 8 grams .
Johnson , who holds appointments in psychology and integrative physiology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and in pharmacology in the Carver College of Medicine , published a review of these findings in the July issue of the journal Physiology & Behavior with Michael J. Morris and Elisa S. Na , UI graduate students .
In addition to reporting their own findings , the authors reviewed others ' research on the reasons behind salt appetite .
High levels of salt are contained in everything from pancakes to pasta these days , but once upon a time , it was hard to come by .
Salt consumption and its price skyrocketed around 2000 B.C. when it was discovered as a food preservative .
Roman soldiers were paid in salt ; the word salary is derived from the Latin for salt .
Even when mechanical refrigeration lessened the need for salt in the 19th century , consumption continued in excess because people liked the taste and it had become fairly inexpensive .
Today , 77 percent of our salt intake comes from processed and restaurant foods , like frozen dinners and fast food .
Evolution might have played an important part in the human hankering for salt .
Humans evolved from creatures that lived in salty ocean water .
Once on land , the body continued to need sodium and chloride because minerals play key roles in allowing fluids to pass in and out of cells , and in helping nerve cells transfer information throughout the brain and body .
But as man evolved in the hot climate of Africa , perspiration robbed the body of sodium .
Salt was scarce because our early ancestors ate a veggie - rich diet and lived far from the ocean .
" Most of our biological systems require sodium to function properly , but as a species that did n't have ready access to it , our kidneys evolved to become salt misers , " Johnson said .
Behavior also came to play a key role in making sure we have enough salt on board .
Animals like us come equipped with a taste system designed to detect salt and a brain that remembers the location of salt sources -- like salt licks in a pasture .
A pleasure mechanism in the brain is activated when salt is consumed .
So the body needs salt and knows how to find it and how to conserve it .
But today scientists are finding evidence that it's an abused , addictive substance -- almost like a drug .
One sign of addiction is using a substance even when it 's known to be harmful .
Many people are told to reduce sodium due to health concerns , but they have trouble doing so because they like the taste and find low - sodium foods bland .
Another strong aspect of addiction is the development of intense cravings when drugs are withheld .
Experiments by Johnson and colleagues indicate similar changes in brain activity whether rats are exposed to drugs or salt deficiency .
" This suggests that salt need and cravings may be linked to the same brain pathways as those related to drug addiction and abuse , " Johnson said .

Shortly before the inauguration of President Barack Obama , the manager of a Whole Foods grocery store in the San Francisco Bay Area gathered his employees in a conference room for a chat about labor organizing .
“ This is not a union - bashing thing whatsoever , ” the manager began , adding , however , that he ’d called the meeting because Whole Foods believed Obama would sign the Employee Free Choice Act , legislation intended to ease unionization that was opposed by the company ’s lobbyists .
According to a tape of the meeting obtained by Mother Jones , the manager went on to imply that joining a union would lead to reprisals : “ It ’s interesting to note that once you become represented by the union , ” he said , “ basically everything , every benefit you have , is kind of thrown out the window , and you renegotiate a contract . ”
“ I think it ’s probably fair to construe [ that comment ] as a threat , ” concluded Tim Peck , a representative of the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) in San Francisco , after Mother Jones read him quotes from the meeting , one of several anti-union trainings held by the company in recent months .
Peck pointed out that labor law bars employers from threatening to strip benefits from workers in retaliation for unionizing .
“ The ‘ flying out the window ’ [ comment ] kind of suggests that the benefits are gone , ” he noted .
Legally , “ that would n’t pass muster . ”
That Whole Foods stands accused of union busting comes at an inconvenient time for the company , which late last month unveiled the Committee for a Level Playing Field for Union Elections , a partnership with Starbucks and Costco that aims to rewrite the Employee Free Choice Act .
This year ’s top priority for organized labor , EFCA would allow employees to form a union automatically if a majority of them sign pledge cards — a plan known as “ card check ” — instead of requiring them to vote in secret elections that unions say employers can manipulate .
Whole Foods opposes card check , yet has rankled business interests by suggesting other ways to make it easier for workers to unionize , such as guaranteeing union campaigners access to workers and boosting enforcement and penalties for labor law violations .
“ This is a third way , ” says Whole Foods ’ attorney Lanny Davis , a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton and self - described “ pro-labor , liberal Democrat . ”
Unlike Costco , where 20 percent of workers are represented by the Teamsters , Whole Foods and Starbucks stores have n’t been organized by traditional unions .
And yet their cultures are steeped in the language and norms of the labor movement .
Starbucks calls its workers “ partners ” and Whole Foods dubs them “ team members . ” A “ Business Conduct Helpline ” allows Starbucks baristas to a report workplace issues anonymously , and special committees of Whole Foods workers and managers resolve disputes .
Both companies offer employees relatively generous wages and health benefits and routinely make Fortune ’s list of “ Best Companies to Work For . ”
The firms ’ granola reputations could give Democrats political cover to support a compromise on EFCA , averting a likely Republican filibuster .
Yet the stores ’ unique , do - gooder mentality paradoxically has left little space for actual unions .
In 1997 , Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote that he wanted workers “ to believe in their hearts that management trusted them and treated them with respect …
If they had faith in me and my motives , they would n’t need a union . ”
Whole Foods ’ avowedly libertarian CEO , John Mackey , has compared the prospect of having unions at his stores to “ having herpes . ”
An internal Whole Foods document listing “ six strategic goals for Whole Foods Market to achieve by 2013 , ” obtained by Mother Jones , includes a goal to remain “ 100 % union - free . ”
Meeting that goal could be especially tough for Whole Foods and Starbucks if the economic downturn begins to reverse a decades - long decline in labor organizing .
Consumers ’ move toward cheaper food and drink is pressuring the chains to cut wages and hours .
Starbucks baristas from the East Coast and Midwest have held raucous labor protests ; cuts in shifts at some Whole Foods stores have prompted employees at one Bay Area location to seriously discuss unionizing .
Mackey “ is not opposed to giving union organizers a fair shot to persuade his team members ” to unionize , Davis says .
But the reality is that both companies , neither of which would comment in detail for this story , have repeatedly resorted to tough union - busting tactics — often breaking the law along the way .
In recent years they fired union organizers or packed worker rolls with anti-union employees in efforts to prevent workers from forming unions or winning union contracts , government records show .
Starbucks ’ and Whole Foods ’ anti-union , pro-worker stance “ is the essence of benevolent paternalism , ” says Kim Fellner , whose book , Wrestling With Starbucks : Conscience , Capital , Capuccino , praises many of the company ’s other employment practices .
“ These are companies that want to do good by their workers , but want to decide what that good is , rather than letting the workers decide for themselves .
And that ’s a problem . ”
She calls the companies ’ approach to EFCA “ entirely consonant with the way that they have acted towards unions over the long haul .
It ’s the place where their social responsibility really broke down . ”
The Skinny on Starbucks
In 2004 , faced with the first serious effort in decades to unionize one of its stores , Starbucks launched what a former worker calls “ a scorched - earth campaign ” against pro-union employees .
The effort resulted in more than a dozen violations of the National Labor Relations
Act , a judge found in an 88 - page ruling last year .
“ The union busting has just been absolutely relentless , ” says the worker , Daniel Gross , who set out to organize the company ’s store on the east side of midtown Manhattan before Starbucks fired him in 2006 .
Gross and other workers , unhappy with the refusal of the Manhattan store to guarantee any full - time shifts , had planned to vote on whether to be represented by the Industrial Workers of the World .
As the election neared , Starbucks brought in a manager , Fabian Vera , whose only job was to oppose the union , Gross says .
Vera took workers on walks around the block to assess their positions and argue his case .
Three pro-union workers were discriminatorily fired at three New York stores , the labor judge later ruled , while anti-union workers were rewarded with free gym passes and Mets tickets .
In recent years Starbucks has settled five labor complaints in connection with similar practices in New York City , the Twin Cities , and Grand Rapids , Michigan .
“ This is not a few bad apples , ” Gross says .
“ This is a company really undermining the right to organize . ”
Despite the union ’s legal victories , its effort to unionize the Manhattan
store fizzled .
Starbucks challenged a 2004 ruling that had required the union election , thereby stalling the vote for the duration of the appeals process , which can drag on for up to three years .
Rather than see the appeal adjudicated by a Bush - controlled NLRB , the union canceled the vote that summer .
“ To compare this to a fair election process just defies all credibility , ” says Gross , who must wait to be compensated by Starbucks for being illegally fired until another appeal is resolved .
“ It ’s almost impossible to describe how unlevel a playing field it is . ”
Union organizers say Starbucks ’ and Whole Foods ’ behavior illustrates why card check , the cornerstone of EFCA , is so important .
Allowing employees to sign cards to authorize union representation lets them organize below the radar of employers , preventing bosses from retaliating against pro-union workers and stalling a vote .
“ The choice about whether and how to form a union is something that belongs to workers , ” says Ari Yampolsky , a campaign coordinator for the Service Employees International Union .
“ Employers should have about as much say in that as workers do about whether and how employers join the Chamber of Commerce . ”
Davis , the Whole Foods lawyer , counters that card check robs workers of the anonymity of a secret - ballot election , exposing them to coercion by union organizers .
Yampolsky discounts that claim , however , pointing out that the NLRB will probably design the cards to allow workers to check one of two boxes : either to form the union or to ask instead for a secret - ballot vote on the question .
Moreover , the corporate world ’s Fabian Veras usually know well in advance of a union election how workers will vote , Yampolsky points out .
“ Both sides essentially do the same thing , which is go to the workers , ask them if they support the union , and then engineer various ways to test their position , ” he says .
“ Except the employer has profoundly more power in asking the question as well as access to workers . ”
Still , Davis maintains that uneven balance of power is better solved by improving unions ’ access to workers , setting a firm date for union elections , and tightening penalties for serious violations of labor law such as illegal firings .
“ This is not a compromise between union bashing on one side and management bashing on the other side , ” he says of the proposal .
“ We ’ll make this into a labor reform bill that levels the playing field . ”
The group ’s ideas mirror several proposals in a recent law review article by Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , who Democrats had hoped would protect EFCA from a filibuster in the Senate before he came out against it two weeks ago .
Though Davis says 20 Senate offices have offered reactions to the plan ranging “ from encouragement to extreme happiness , ” it has met stiff opposition from EFCA sponsors George Miller , Tom Harkin , and Rob Andrews .
“ It was written by CEOs for CEOs , ” the congressmen said in a statement .
“ It is nothing more than a classic Washington lobbying campaign intended to confuse the issues and disguise the real agenda of maintaining the status quo . ”
Whole Foods vs. the Teamsters
Even after unions are certified and begin representing workers , 40 percent of them disband before negotiating their first contract .
Such was the fate of the only union ever established at a Whole Foods store , a local of the United Food and Commercial Workers in Madison , Wisconsin .
Once employees approved the union in 2002 and began negotiating a contract with Whole Foods ’ lawyer , they asked the company to award raises more equitably , establish a grievance procedure , and protect them from arbitrary firing .
The lawyer rejected the proposals but never put forth alternatives , while scheduling and rescheduling meetings that were spaced out every other month for more than a year .
“ They were just trying to stall , ” says Debbie Rasmussen , who worked at the store ’s juice bar and spearheaded the union effort .
Whole Foods meanwhile hired anti-union workers while firing her and another union sympathizer on a technicality : drinking a botched latte instead of discarding it , she says .
Whole Foods employed similar tactics in 2006 , after truck drivers working at its San Francisco - based distribution center voted to unionize with the Teamsters .
The company fired two of the drivers , altered its sick - leave policy , froze wage increases , refused to provide information to the union that was necessary to negotiate a contract , and “ harassed and disciplined employees , ” found NLRB investigators , who concluded that “ Whole Foods engaged in a variety of retaliatory measures to discourage union activity . ”
An out - of - court settlement required Whole Foods to reinstate the employees and reverse some of its policies .
Similarly , in 1999 , after workers at a coffee bean roasting plant in Kent , Washington , elected to unionize , Starbucks stalled contract negotiations for a year while systematically denying employment at the plant to any job applicants who ’d ever been in unions or were related to union members .
The NLRB eventually forced Starbucks to compensate several workers it had n’t hired and pay damages to a fired human resources employee who ’d exposed the arrangement — though not before the plant ’s stacked workforce voted out the union .
To prevent employers from stalling negotiations while intimidating and firing employees , EFCA would require deadlocked contract talks to go before a federal arbitrator — an idea that Whole Foods attorney Davis calls “ way over the top . ”
He instead proposes stricter penalties for bad - faith bargaining .
Yampolsky is skeptical of the idea , noting that proving bad - faith bargaining in court “ is incredibly difficult . ”
As it stands , a union that has n’t inked a contract with an employer after a year can be voted out by employees , as happened in Madison .
Though the UFCW claimed but never proved that Whole Foods illegally promoted the vote , Whole Foods now wants the right to require a referendum on union representation at any time ; Mackey “ wanted the right of employers to go to workers and ask for another union election if he feels the union is doing a bad job , ” Davis explains .
Employees at the Bay Area Whole Foods store grant that Mackey ’s model of “ conscious capitalism ” makes workers feel like they have a voice , but say that their rights are still subject to the whims of the men in charge .
Mackey is pushing ahead with plans to build two new stores in San Francisco even as an existing store is cutting back hours , freezing hiring , and asking employees to do the same amount of work in less time , the workers say .
“ My opinion is , you should n’t open a new store if you ca n’t take care of what ’s going on at the ones you already have , ” says a worker , who asked that his name and the exact location of his store not be used for fear of reprisals .
“ But they are going to
take the opposite approach .
If they can cut costs at our level and then open up a new store , that ’s what shareholders want . ”
The recent anti-union lecture at the Bay Area store has made some workers skeptical that Whole Foods will react with integrity and good faith to their organizing campaign — not to mention the broader efforts at labor law reform .
As the meeting dragged on , the store ’s manager falsely implied that employees in Madison who ’d organized the store ’s workers had been nothing more than plants from the labor union .
“ Union organizers got into the store [ and ] while they were employed there they started organizing the store , ” he claimed .
“ After their job was done , so to speak , they left the store , they left the company , leaving behind team members that really were n’t the driving force behind this .
“ Pretty soon thereafter , they were kind of regretful of what they had done . ”
Iran in the Crosshairs Last year , the Middle East dodged the danger of an Israeli attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities and the inevitable spread of hostilities .

Digg Email
Printer friendly Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen was sent to tell the Israelis that the United States would not support such an attack , and after the fiasco in Georgia , the Russians too sent stern warnings to Tel Aviv .
But now the specter of an Israeli strike has reappeared .
Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel ’s incoming prime minister , is far more committed to an attack on Iran than his predecessors .
Remember when Joe Biden told supporters of Barack Obama last October that Obama would be tested in his first six months in office ?
There is good reason to believe he was referring to the likelihood that Netanyahu would become prime minister after the February 2009 Israeli election , and that he would waste little time finding a pretext to attack Iran .
Netanyahu has been laying the groundwork for such an attack for years , constantly repeating that Tehran is “ preparing another Holocaust ” a la Germany in the Thirties .
He keeps hammering home the “ existential ” threat that would be posed to Israel ( with its 200 - 300 nuclear weapons ) if Iran had just one .
Netanyahu has made no bones about the fact that his preferred solution to the problem is a massive air attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and other military targets , and that he would not wait for any evidence that Iran had actually manufactured a weapon before doing so .
It would be , you see , a Bush - type " preventive " war .
Netanyahu would fully expect Iranian retaliation of some kind and knee - jerk U.S. intervention on Israel 's side .
If such adventurism were to prevail , it would be a tragedy not only for Iran and the United States but for Israel as well .
And it would bring to Israel more serious risk than at any time since its implantation in Palestine .
It is also completely unnecessary .
There has never been a shred of evidence that Iran has any intention of committing suicide by attacking Israel .
Nor is it clear that Iran has irrevocably decided to seek nuclear weapons .
The U.S. intelligence community determined unanimously in its most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , completed in November 2007 , that Iran had abandoned the nuclear weaponization part of its nuclear development program in 2003 and had not resumed such work .
Largely forgotten is the fact that this estimate also concluded that Iran would extend the halt to its nuclear weapons program if the United States were to offer " credible " opportunities for Iran to achieve its " security , prestige and goals for regional influence . "
In other words , the way to avoid an Iranian nuclear weapon is not the threat of an attack – which is very likely to have the opposite effect – but to give Iran additional reason to continue the halt in weaponization .
Unfortunately , it is far from clear that President Obama understands that he must draw a hard line against an Israeli attack .
Some of his old - think advisers believe the threat of an attack should be part of his overall strategy .
The President 's adviser on proliferation , Gary Samore , declared last September , “ We …want the Iranians to believe that if they actually try to make nuclear weapons , or if they build secret facilities that we detect , they run the risk of being attacked . ”
What needs to happen : President Obama needs to order an update of the 2007 intelligence estimate on Iran .
Then he should ask for a briefing by intelligence analysts able to think outside the box , including the ones who concluded in 2007 that Iran needs positive incentives to continue to forego work on nuclear weapons .
Obama should encourage his diplomats to pursue talks at a senior level with their Iranian counterparts , with the objective of reaching agreements that will give Iran just the kind of incentives the intelligence analysts had in mind .
And he must tell Netanyahu that the U.S. will not support an Israeli attack on Iran .
Indeed , the U.S. will not tolerate it .

If you ask me about urban legends , I would n’t talk about Candyman or about Jack the Ripper , but I would talk about the plethora of new Lego devices in the market like the new Alcatel Lego Phones .
Alcatel apparently has tied up with Lego and they may together rule the world of mobile phones and toys , if things go their way .
However , they also should have done a little market survey before jumping into the act as even kids would prefer to buy something technologically advanced .
However , the Lego gadgets are bought and appreciated not for their technical prowess , but for the artistic quality and nostalgic element which are inherent in them .
A disappointment however is that the Alcatel Lego Phones do not come with Lego building blocks , but with replaceable modular face plates , which make the Alcatel Lego Phone revel in fake glory .
There is no word about either the availability or the price , which means it could just end up as a concept like most other designs do .
If you are however looking for some real Lego designs , check out the cool Lego Pixel Art .
If art is n’t your thing , scare yourself sh*t with the Lego Jack Skellington .
Well , I just want people to know that even the zaniest things in life must remain original .
When things get fake , people wo n’t give it a second thought .

Dual catalysts may be the key to efficiently turning carbon dioxide and water vapor into methane and other hydrocarbons using titania nanotubes and solar power , according to Penn State researchers .
Burning fossil fuels like oil , gas and coal release large amounts of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , into the atmosphere .
Rather than contribute to global climate change , producers could convert carbon dioxide to a wide variety of hydrocarbons , but this makes sense to do only when using solar energy .
" Recycling of carbon dioxide via conversion into a high energy - content fuel , suitable for use in the existing hydrocarbon - based energy infrastructure , is an attractive option , however the process is energy intense and useful only if a renewable energy source can be used for the purpose , " the researchers note in a recent issue of Nano Letters .
Craig A. Grimes , professor of electrical engineering and his team used titanium dioxide nanotubes doped with nitrogen and coated with a thin layer of both copper and platinum to convert a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor to methane .
Using outdoor , visible light , they reported a 20 - times higher yield of methane than previously published attempts conducted in laboratory conditions using intense ultraviolet exposures .
The chemical conversion of water and carbon dioxide to methane is simple on paper -- one carbon dioxide molecule and two water molecules become one methane molecule and two oxygen molecules .
However , for the reaction to occur , at least eight photons are required for each molecule .
" Converting carbon dioxide and water to methane using photocatalysis is an appealing idea , but historically , attempts have had very low conversion rates , " said Grimes who is also a member of Penn State 's Materials Research Institute .
" To get significant hydrocarbon reaction yields requires an efficient photocatalyst that uses the maximum energy available in sunlight . "
The team , which also included Oomman K. Varghese and Maggie Paulose , Materials Research Institute research scientists and Thomas J. LaTempa , graduate student in electrical engineering , used natural sunlight to test their nanotubes in a chamber containing a mix of water vapor and carbon dioxide .
They exposed the co-catalyst sensitized nanotubes to sunlight for 2.5 to 3.5 hours when the sun produced between 102 and 75 milliwatts for each square centimeter exposed .
The researchers found that nanotubes annealed at 600 degrees Celsius and coated with copper yielded the highest amounts of hydrocarbons and that the same nanotubes coated with platinum actually yielded more hydrogen , while the copper coated nanotubes produced more carbon monoxide .
Both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are normal intermediate steps in the process and as the building blocks of syngas , can be used to make liquid hydrocarbon fuels .
When the team used a nanotube array with about half the surface coated in copper and the other half in platinum , they enhanced the hydrocarbon production and eliminated carbon monoxide .
The yield for these dual catalyst nanotubes was 163 parts per million hydrocarbons an hour for each square centimeter .
The yield from titania nanotubes without either copper or platinum catalysts is only about 10 parts per million .
" If we uniformly coated the surface of the nanotube arrays with copper oxide , I think we could greatly improve the yield , " said Grimes .
Grimes also found that lengthening the titanium dioxide tubes , which for other applications increases yield , does not improve results .
" We think that distribution of the sputtered catalyst nanoparticles is at the top surface of the nanotubes and not inside and that is why increased length does not improve the reaction , " says Grimes .
Although all these experiments were done with nitrogen - doped titanium dioxide nanotubes , the researchers conclude that the nitrogen did not enhance the conversion of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons .
The catalysts , however , did shift the reaction from one that used only the energy in ultraviolet light to one that used other wavelengths of visible light and therefore more of the sun 's energy .
The researchers are now working on converting their batch reactor into a continuous flow - through design that they believe will significantly increase yields .
The researchers have filed a provisional patent on this work .

As I was driving home from the latest DnD session with my fellow dorks last Sunday , I started to let my mind drift .
As per usual my body was filled with Doritos and Dr. Pepper so I was all hopped up on pure ‘ dorkatude . ’
This is when I recalled a moment during my day where a co-worker came by my office and shared his opinion of the ‘ Best Apps for iPhone . ’
The fact is everyday he comes by and tells that he has found the latest and best new app for the iPhone .
This got me thinking about iPhones and Dungeons and Dragons .
I decided that I would research what was in my opinion the best apps for iphone that were related to Dungeons and Dragons .
When I arrived at home I cracked open iTunes and started searching through the app store in search of the best iphone apps for DnD .
Below is my list of the top ( there are only 4 ! ) apps for the iPhone related to Dungeons and Dragons .
The Dicenomicon : I found a lot of dice rolling apps .
Most of them were pretty crappy looking and lacked any real aesthetic value .
If you own an iPhone it seems obvious that aesthetics are important to you .
The Dicenomicon was the most realistic looking iphone app .
The best feature was the fact that you can give your iPhone a shake to roll the dice , and if you reroll the dice you can hold a die in place and roll the rest .
There are a ton of different condition you can apply when it creates the total for you .
For example : roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 rolls .
I think the Dicenomicon is a must have iPhone app for any DnD player , especially for those sessions where you forget your dice and have to borrow your friends crap dice .
Check out the light version or the full version of The Dicenomicon .
Spellbook Master :
If you ever play any kind of spellcasting class then you know how much of a pain it is to be constantly thumbing through your book to check out a few details of a spell , or if you are a DM and you need to quickly check and see if a spell requires a saving through even though your PC ’s say “ No it does n’t require a save . ”
The Spellbook Master iphone app makes it easy to reference spells either by class , domain , school , element etc. all from your iPhone !
It is the best tool you can have if you play any kind of spellcaster .
for more details and screenshots check out the app page for the Spellbook Master
Quick Roll :
This is another dice rolling iphone app , yet it is much different than the Dicenomicon .
With this you can program specific dice roll variables into the interface and then quickly roll them .
So you can have your initiative roll modifier added in , your fortitude save and so on .
You can pretty much have every item that you need to roll added into the app so you do n’t have to slow down the game by constantly adding in all your modifiers from all over place .
I am sure we have all had a moment where another player ( never us ) rolls to strike and then begins to keep adding in the modifiers : I have power attack , I ’m using the weapon 2 handed , and on and on .
If you want to streamline your gaming then read up on the Quick Roll app
tCiMP Character in My Pocket :
This great iPhone app allows you to keep your character and all of it ’s information stored on your iPhone .
Gone are the days where you ca n’t play because you forgot your character sheet at home .
It has a built in rolling system so you can roll stats and create new characters .
With this app you will never be without a character ever again !
Check out the Character in My Pocket app
So those are as far as I can tell the best apps for iPhone that pertain to Dungeons and Dragons .
If you are browsing through the itunes app section and find another great DnD app please share it with us in the comment section below , or help spread the word to other dorks by clicking that precious Stumble Upon or Digg buttons !

Matteo Borrini , an anthropologist from the University of Florence , said the discovery on the small island of Lazzaretto Nuovo in the Venice lagoon supported the medieval belief that vampires were behind the spread of plagues like the Black Death .
“ This is the first time that archaeology has succeeded in reconstructing the ritual of exorcism of a vampire , ” Borrini told Reuters by telephone .
“ This helps ... authenticate how the myth of vampires was born . ”
The skeleton was unearthed in a mass grave from the Venetian plague of 1576 -- in which the artist Titian died -- on Lazzaretto Nuovo , which lies around three km ( 2 miles ) northeast of Venice and was used as a sanitorium for plague sufferers .
The succession of plagues which ravaged Europe between 1300 and 1700 fostered the belief in vampires , mainly because the decomposition of corpses was not well understood , Borrini said .
Gravediggers reopening mass graves would sometimes come across bodies bloated by gas , with hair still growing , and blood seeping from their mouths and believe them to be still alive .
The shrouds used to cover the faces of the dead were often decayed by bacteria in the mouth , revealing the corpse ’s teeth , and vampires became known as “ shroud - eaters . ”
According to medieval medical and religious texts , the “ undead ” were believed to spread pestilence in order to suck the remaining life from corpses until they acquired the strength to return to the streets again .
“ To kill the vampire you had to remove the shroud from its mouth , which was its food like the milk of a child , and put something uneatable in there , ” said Borrini .
“ It ’s possible that other corpses have been found with bricks in their mouths , but this is the first time the ritual has been recognized . ”
While legends about blood - drinking ghouls date back thousands of years , the modern figure of the vampire was encapsulated in the Irish author Bram Stoker ’s 1897 novel “ Dracula , ” based on 18th century eastern European folktales .

CONCORD , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - New Hampshire ’s Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that would legalize same - sex marriage after an amendment was added that allows clergy to decline to marry gay couples .

The bill , which passed in a 13 - 11 vote , needs to be signed by Governor John Lynch to make New Hampshire the fifth U.S. state where gay marriage is legal .
The Democrat has not indicated whether he will sign or veto the bill , but has expressed opposition to the measure .
The bill passed the state ’s House of Representatives on March 26 but looked set for near certain defeat in the Senate before the amendment , which appeared to mollify some critics in the Democratic - controlled chamber .
The last - minute changes to the legislation would allow clergy to decline to marry homosexual couples and give couples the freedom to either keep the words “ bride ” and “ groom ” on marriage licenses , or use the word “ spouse ” instead .
Because the Senate and House passed separate versions , they must resolve their differences before the bill can go to the governor , who in 2007 signed a law recognizing same - sex civil unions , making New Hampshire the fourth state to do so .
Lynch has said the word marriage should be reserved for a traditional heterosexual relationship .
The bill , which would take effect on January 1 , also recognizes out - of - state gay marriages and civil unions .
Couples who now have civil unions would automatically become married by January 1 , 2011 .
The extra year allows time for a formal ceremony .
Gay marriage made big inroads this month when , in a single week , Iowa and Vermont joined Massachusetts and Connecticut in allowing gay couples to legally wed .
On Tuesday , a joint judiciary committee in neighboring Maine ’s legislature approved a bill to allow same - sex marriage .
Maine ’s House and Senate could vote on the measure as early as next week .
In California , gay marriage advocates are hoping to overturn Proposition 8 , the 2008 constitutional amendment that banned gay marriage there , in the state ’s highest court .
CULTURAL SHIFT
New Hampshire in 1987 outlawed same - sex marriages .
In 2004 , after Massachusetts ’ top court allowed gay couples to marry , New Hampshire passed a law that would not recognize gay marriages from out of state .
But elections in 2006 signaled big political and cultural changes , giving Democrats majorities in both chambers of the legislature for the first time since 1874 in a state that was long a stronghold of moderate Republicans .
New Hampshire state Senator Lou D’Allesandro was the only Democrat to side with 10 Republicans against the legislation , which would redefine marriage to include same - sex couples .
He cited his “ traditional family values . ”
Democratic state Senator Deborah Reynolds , who opposed the bill at committee level , changed her vote after the amendment .
“ This is a compromise that is respectful to both sides of this debate and meets our shared goal of equality under state law for all the people of New Hampshire , ” Reynolds said .
Senate Republicans said discrimination remains in the bill , which Democrats said would ensure gay couples no longer received a “ separate but equal ” civil union distinction .
“ Marriage for centuries has the traditional meaning of one man and one woman , and we believe that term should not be co-opted to be used for other purposes , ” said Republican Peter Bragdon , the Senate minority leader .

Hot rumor on the right : members of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now will stalk next week ’s Tea Party protests , collecting intel on the people who show up .
One e-mail that ’s making the rounds , via my friend Steve Gordon :

**NO MATTER WHAT , DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING !
IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO PLAN TO ATTEND , WHO DO NOT HAVE EMAIL , GET ON THE PHONE TO WARN THEM .
TRY TO CALL OR EMAIL RADIO TALK SHOWS AND LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG . **

What do they do after reporting the “ dissention ” ?
I do n’t know .

Attac kapert " Die Zeit " : Eine " Zeit " , die ihrer Zeit voraus ist
Am Sonnabend erschien eine seltsame Ausgabe der Wochenzeitung " Die Zeit " - voll von guten Nachrichten - aber zu gut , um wahr zu sein .
Es ist eine Fälschung .
BERLIN taz Seit wann erscheint die Zeit am Samstag ?
Und wieso wird sie auf der Straße verteilt ?
Und das auch noch kostenlos ?
Aufschluss bringt erst die Lektüre : " Erinnern Sie sich noch an letztes Jahr ? " , fragt ein Artikel auf der Seite 1 dieser seltsamen und seltsam dünnen Zeit : " Die Banken gehörten noch den Aktionären , Afghanistan den Militärs und die Straßen gehörten den dicken Autos .
Die Reichen waren noch reich , die Armen arm , und niemand glaubte ernsthaft , dass sich daran etwas ändern könnte . "
Hier dämmert selbst dem naivsten Leser , dass diese Zeitung nur als trojanisches Pferd dient .
Dahinter steckt tatsächlich das globalisierungskritische Netzwerk Attac , das diesen Coup von langer Hand vorbereitet hat .
150.000 Exemplare der gekaperten Zeit werden heute in 90 deutschen Städten verteilt .
Und natürlich gibt es auch eine Onlineausgabe .
Auf der Website die - zeit . net kann man sich auch die komplette Zeitung als pdf herunterladen .
Optisch gleicht die Fälschung der Zeitung dem Original bis ins kleinste Detail , das Layout ist derart gut kopiert , dass auf den ersten Blick kein Unterschied zu einer echten Ausgabe der Zeit auffällt .
Erste Irritationen verursachen die Schlagzeilen .
" Opel in Belegschaftshand " , prangt da als frohe Botschaft , und " G 20 - Staaten einigen sich auf Vermögensabgabe " , eine " Weltwährung " wird geplant .
Auch das Datum ist falsch - dass heute nicht der 1 .
Mai 2010 ist , ist bekannt , und dass die Zeit neuerdings " weltweit 0 € " kostet , hätte man ja eigentlich auch mitbekommen müssen .
Alles sehr verdächtig also .
Erst ein Blick ins Impressum verrät schließlich Attac als Urheber dieser Zeitung aus der Zukunft .
" Wir wollen mit dieser Zeitung eine Zukunft beschreiben , die möglich ist " , sagt Fabian Scheidler von Attac : " Die Welt könnte anders aussehen .
Es gibt andere Möglichkeiten als die , die uns von der etablierten Politik immer vorgegeben werden . "
Die Welt , die in der Zeit vom " 1. Mai 2010 " skizziert wird , scheint ein sonnendurchflutetes , fröhliches Paradies mit glücklichen Menschen zu sein .
Jedenfalls bringt sie nur schöne Nachrichten hervor : Auf der Seite 2 verkündet die falsche Zeit etwa , dass auch in einer Wirtschaftskrise mit sinkendem Bruttoinlandsprodukt die Lebensqualität für die Bevölkerung durchaus ansteigen kann .
Die Regierung will eine Energiewende - Agentur gründen , um für immer von von Atom und Kohle Abschied zu nehmen .
Die Automobilindustrie wird wegen ihrer aggressiven Vermarktung umweltfeindlicher Autos für das Schmelzen eines Gletschers in Nepal verantwortlich gemacht und zu 1,5 Milliarden Dollar Schadensersatz verurteilt .
Gentechnische Manipulation von Pflanzen ist kein Thema mehr , auch die Massentierhaltung wird abgeschafft , der Afghanistankrieg ist vorbei , Lobbyismus per Gesetz beschränkt .
Und auch in Sachen journalistischer Ethik hat sich in der hell strahlenden Zukunft etwas geändert : ein gewisser Matthias Trocken stellt sich als stellvertretender Chefredakteur vor und entschuldigt sich .
Die Chefetage der Zeitung sei lange Mitglied in sogenannten Elitezirkeln gewesen , in denen sich die Spitzen aus Politik und Wirtschaft treffen , " um darüber zu diskutieren , welches Schicksal sie der Welt zugedenken wollen . "
Über diese undemokratischen Treffen sei nie berichtet worden .
Man habe sich vielmehr als Teil der Macht verstanden denn als ihr kritischer Gegenpart , schreibt Trocken , und damit den journalistischen Ethos verletzt .
" Unsere Aufgabe als Journalisten besteht nicht darin , mit am Tisch zu sitzen , sondern zu berichten und kritische Fragen zu stellen " , schreibt Trocken .
Der stellvertretende Chefredakteur der echten Zeit heißt Matthias Naß .
Die Artikel treffen den staatstragenden
Ton des bildungsbürgerlichen Wochenblattes sehr genau .
Weil die ganze Aktion durchaus auch witzig gemeint ist , ist der satirische Bestandteil in die ebenfalls getürkten Werbeanzeigen verlegt worden :
Es wirbt zum Beispiel die Initiative Neue Soziale Marxwirtschaft .
" Unsere Hoffnung ist , dass die Aktion den Horizont der Leute etwas öffnet " , erklärt Scheidler .
Attac hat die Zeit ausgewählt , weil sie repräsentativ für die deutsche Mitte stehe .
Die Idee hatte Attac schon im Herbst , als sich die Finanz - und Wirtschaftskrise ankündigte : " Das Merkwürdige ist ja , dass in dieser ganzen Krise so eine Art Schreckstarre in der deutschen Gesellschaft herrscht .
Die Zeitung soll zeigen : Eine positive Zukunft ist möglich !
Wir hoffen , dass wir einen kleinen Beitrag dazu leisten können , die gesellschaftliche Stimmung aufzuhellen .
Denn positive Veränderungen kann es nur geben , wenn sich von unten was bewegt .
Das wird einem nicht von oben geschenkt .
Von oben kommen nur autoritäre Lösungen . "
Die Idee zur Zeitung kommt nicht von Attac , sondern aus Amerika .
Wie Attac auf der Titelseite der falschen Zeit zugibt , holte man sich die Inspiration bei der amerikanischen Aktivistengruppe " The Yes Men " .
Diese veröffentlichte am 12 .
November 2008 eine gefälschte Ausgabe der New York Times .
Aus dem Times - Motto
" All the news thats fit to print " ( Alle Neuigkeiten , die es wert sind , gedruckt zu werden ) " machten die Yes Men " All the news we hope to print " ( Alle Neuigkeiten , von denen wir hoffen , dass sie gedruckt werden ) .
In dieser Wunschausgabe aus der Zukunft ( als Erscheinungsdatum wurde der 4 . Juli 2009 angegeben ) enden unter anderem die Kriege im Irak und in Afghanistan , und George Bush wird des Hochverrats angeklagt , während er privat Bin Laden jagt .
Mehr als 1.000 ehrenamtliche
Helfer verteilten die gewaltige Menge von 1,2 Millionen Exemplaren der Zeitung in den meisten größeren Städten Amerikas .
Laut den Yes Men hätten auch drei echte Redakteure der Times mitgewirkt .
Vonseiten der Zeitung gab es nur einen knappen Kommentar , dass es sich eindeutig um eine gefälschte Ausgabe der New York Times handeln würde .
Vor Gericht zog die Zeitung nicht .
Wie auch Attac wollten die Yes Men mit der Zeitung eine Diskussion über die von ihnen gesetzten Themen erreichen .
Anders als Attac sind die Yes Men allerdings keine politische Organisation , sondern eine Mischung aus Kunst- , Protest - und Satiregruppe .
Jacques Servin und Igor Samos gründeten The Yes Men 1999 .
Erste Aufmerksamkeit erregten die Aktivisten , indem sie sich die Website gatt.org sicherten und eine gefälschte Seite der Welthandelsorganisation WTO einrichteten , die der echten täuschend ähnlich sah .
Daraufhin wurden Servin und Samos , die sich nun " Andy Bichelbaum " und " Mike Bonnano " nannten , als WTO - Experten mehrfach zu internationalen Konferenzen eingeladen .
Auf einer Konferenz in Salzburg 2000 forderten die Yes Men den weltweiten Handel mit Wählerstimmen und priesen Hitlers Wirtschaftspolitik - womit sie Applaus ernteten .
Mittlerweile gibt es zwei Filme und ein Buch über die Yes Men. Die Gruppe ist zu einer Institution geworden , eine politische Agenda haben die Yes Men aber nach wie vor nicht .
Und genau das ist das Problem , sagt der Kommunikations - und Medienwissenschaftler Marcus S. Kleiner von der Universität Siegen .
Eine derartige Kommunikationsguerilla sei nur effektiv , wenn die Veranstalter ausreichend legitimiert seien .
Dafür müsse es handfeste politische Inhalte geben , die beispielsweise hinter einer gefälschten Zeitung stehen würden .
" Bei den Yes Men überwiegt der Aha - Effekt , " sagt Kleiner .
Die Aktion sei nicht mehr Mittel , sondern Zweck .
Weil die Medien nur noch über die Yes Men berichten würden , gingen die Inhalte unter .
Dazu bemängelt Kleiner , dass die Yes Men eine Stellvertreterschaft für die Gesellschaft übernehmen würden , die ihnen teilweise nicht zustände .
Für Attac sieht Kleiner dagegen gute Chancen , mit der gefälschten Zeit die gesellschaftliche Diskussion zu Attac - spezifischen Themen zu befeuern .
Denn Attac habe ein Bildungssystem innerhalb der Organisation , habe ein klar formuliertes Programm und sei langfristig orientiert .
Deshalb werde Attac ernst genommen und könne Expertise in den angesprochenen Themenbereichen aufweisen .
Der echten Zeit rät Marcus S. Kleiner , die falsche Ausgabe in Eigen - PR umzumünzen .
Durch die Auswahl der Zeitung werde diese schon geadelt .
Jede Kritik würde Attac in die Karten spielen .
Denn einige der Zukunftsvisionen , die Attac in der Zeit vom 1 .
Mai 2010 anspricht , sind in den letzten Monaten sowieso auf die Agenda gerückt .
Opel in Belegschaftshand ?
Absolut möglich .
G 20 spricht für Multipolarität .
Und für die UN denkt eine Kommission unter Nobelpreisträger Joseph Stiglitz tatsächlich über ein Weltfinanzsystem nach .
Abgerechnet wird 2010 .
Rove skips
House testimony for third time Jeremy Gantz
Published : Monday February 23 , 2009
Print This Email This Karl Rove did it again .
Or rather , he did n't do it again .
For the third time , the former Bush official  and newly crowned king of D.C. Twitterers  failed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee to testify about his alleged involvement in the firing of U.S. Attorneys and the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
Rove 's no -show Monday is not surprising  especially to Siegelman , who said Monday in an exclusive Raw Story interview that Rove will never testify under oath " because he is guilty as sin . "
Rove 's attorney has vehemently denied that his client was involved in the prosecution of Siegelman .
But the non-event marks another milestone in the increasingly complex political and legal battle between Rove and House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) .
Last week , Obama 's acting assistant attorney general quietly filed a court brief saying it was necessary to delay the effort to force Rove 's deposition in the congressional investigation .
" The president is very sympathetic to those who want to find out what happened , " Obama White House Counsel Gregory Craig said February 14th .
" But he is also mindful as president of the United States not to do anything that would undermine or weaken the institution of the presidency .
So , for that reason , he is urging both sides of this to settle . "
Conyers subpoenaed Rove in January ; Rove did not appear .
Rove has previously said he will not testify to Congress , citing Bush 's claim of executive privilege .
He 's also refused subpoenas from the Senate Judiciary Committee , which called on him to testify in 2007 .
On February 13th , Conyers subpoenaed Rove a third time , asking him to appear Monday for a deposition .
 I have said many times that I will carry this investigation forward to its conclusion , whether in Congress or in court , and todays action is an important step along the way ,  Conyers said last month .
 Change has come to Washington , and I hope Karl Rove is ready for it .
After two years of stonewalling , it s time for him to talk . 
He still has n't .
Conyers ' next move is unclear .
Late Monday , both his own website and the Judiciary Committee 's made no mention of the newly delayed deposition .
The next key date in the long - running sage appears to be March 4th , according to Talking Points Memo .
That day is when the Obama administration is due to offer its opinion on the Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten case , in which former President Bush also asserted executive privilege .
" The new administration 's stance on that case could well also determine how a judge would rule on the Rove case , should the issue go to court , " TPM Muckraker 's Zachary Roth reported .

Here ’s a paper on the internals of GHC ’s parallelism support , showing some nice improvements in parallel performance over GHC 6.10.1 : “ Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell “ .
Abstract :
Purely functional programs should run well on parallel hardware because of the absence of side effects , but it has proved hard to realise this potential in practice .
Plenty of papers describe promising ideas , but vastly fewer describe real implementations with good wall - clock performance .
We describe just such an implementation , and quantitatively explore some of the complex design tradeoffs that make such implementations hard to build .
Our measurements are necessarily detailed and specific , but
they are reproducible , and we believe that they offer some general insights .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
In a strange turn of events , American Express is trying to run off some of the customers it went out of its way to attract earlier this decade .
The credit card company was a major beneficiary of the economic boom earlier this decade .
AmEx ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) card use grew at a remarkable 15 % annually on average between 2002 and 2007 , as American Express spent heavily to attract new users and customers of all stripes purchased more .
Peers such as Discover ( DFS ) struggled to grow half as fast .
But with the global economic bust well into its second year and more borrowers slipping behind on their payments , AmEx 's rapid growth is being viewed in a less flattering light .
Shares recently hit a 14 - year low , prompting billionaire investor Warren Buffett -- whose Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) owns 13 % of the New York - based company -- to pronounce the stock " a hell of a buy at $ 10 . "
" American Express is going to be around forever , " Buffett said in an interview with CNBC Monday .
" They 've got the cream of cardholders .
Unfortunately , they have some cardholders that are n't the cream , too . "
It 's the latter group that 's getting the lion 's share of the attention lately .
AmEx last month offered to pay a small number of cardholders $ 300 each to pay off their account balances and close the accounts by the end of April .
Analysts say the company , confronting soaring default rates on its cards , is trying to limit the damage to its own finances while cutting ahead of rivals in line to be paid back .
The default rate on AmEx cards soared to 8.3 % in January from 4.7 % a year earlier , according to data from the trust that handles the company 's consumer lending receivables .
American Express " appears to be going to great length to reduce its exposure to the unfolding consumer credit downturn , " wrote Bank of America analyst Kenneth Bruce in a report last month .
He added that the company is probably targeting " cardholders with sizable outstanding balances and a higher risk of default . "
AmEx has n't revealed details of the offer and did n't respond to requests for comment .
But it is an unusual move for a company that has spent years burnishing its image as the credit card issuer of the jet set .
" A company like American Express that has built its reputation on premium service , concierges and exclusive art event invitations now appears to be penny pinching when times are tough , " said Leslie Gaines - Ross , chief reputation strategist at public relations firm Weber Shandwick in New York .
Further complicating matters is American Express ' decision to take $ 3.4 billion in federal assistance in January under the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Companies receiving TARP funding do n't have to promise to increase lending .
But with the bill for the government 's economic stimulus and financial stability plans running into the trillions of dollars , there has been talk in Washington of explicitly linking new federal aid to the flow of funds from banks to consumers and businesses .
Meanwhile , American Express was pulling back even before the bottom fell out of the economy last fall .
" As we had expected , late payments and write - offs in our charge card and lending portfolios increased throughout the year , " said AmEx CEO Ken Chenault in his 2008 letter to shareholders .
" We took steps to manage the increased risk , such as selectively reducing lines of credit . "
AmEx is n't the only credit card issuer to be reducing credit lines and closing unused accounts , analysts say .
" There is a whole new world out there , " said Linda Sherry , the director of national priorities at advocacy group Consumer Action .
" In some ways we think it 's sensible for there to be less credit available , but we can't agree with how the card companies have been doing it . "
The pullback at American Express comes after a long push to bring in new customers .
In 2007 , the company 's marketing spending surged 20 % from a year ago , as part of what Chenault has called AmEx 's " multi - year investment strategy . "
While the cardholder buyout offer may raise some eyebrows , the main question on Wall Street is whether it will work .
Bank of America 's Bruce raises the prospect of adverse selection -- the prospect that American Express could end up buying out better customers , leaving more of those less able to pay .
Still , given how sharply defaults have risen and the other dour economic trends in place , others see no harm in trying something new .
" Drastic times call for drastic measures , " said Michael Taiano , an analyst at Sandler O'Neill in New York who rates American Express stock a hold .
" This is just one of the tools they 're testing out . "
Army probes domestic use of troops in Alabama Rachel Oswald

Though the strained Samson Police Department was no doubt glad to have U.S.
Army military police on hand to direct traffic during last week 's tragic shooting spree , it appears that the troops were deployed without the proper authorization and in possible violation of federal law .
An inquiry by the U.S. Army has been opened to find out how and why 22 active duty troops from Fort Rucker , Ala . were placed on the streets of the town of Samson during the shooting spree , which took the lives of 11 people on March 10 , reported CNSNews.com on Wednesday .
Harvey Perritt , spokesman for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe , Va. , told CNSNews.com on Monday that the military police soldiers , along with the provost marshal were sent to Samson .
 The purpose for sending the military police , the authority for doing so , and what duties they performed is the subject of an ongoing commanders inquiry -- directed by the commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command , " Perritt said .
 In addition to determining the facts , this inquiry will also determine whether law , regulation and policy were followed . 
Jim Stromenger , a dispatcher at the Samson Police Depatrment , told CNSNews.com that the troops came in to help with traffic control and to secure the crime scene and that the department was glad for the help .
 They werent here to police , let me make that clear .
They were here to help with traffic and to control the crime scene -- so people wouldnt trample all over ( it ) . 
As Samson only has a five - man police department , the assistance provided by the military police was badly needed during the shooting spree .
Though calls for police assistance had gone out to surrounding areas , Stromenger said it was n't the Samson Police Department that requested the soldiers ' presence .
The Associated Press reports that state officials said the deployment of the soldiers " was requested neither by Republican Gov. Bob Riley nor the White House , which typically is required by law for soldiers to operate on U.S. soil . "
Gov. Riley 's press secretary Jeff Emerson told
The AP that the governor was n't concerned with the possibility that the military overstepped its bounds by deploying in a civilian setting without the proper legal authorization .
" From what I understand it was a few folks who came to direct traffic or help where they could , " Emerson said .
" If it had been more than what it was there might be a reason for concern , but these folks just came to see if they could help and left . "
The White House press office has not yet responded to media requests for comment on the Army inquiry .
CNSNews.com reports that the wrongful use of federal troops inside U.S. borders " is a violation of several federal laws , including one known as the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 . "
 Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both ,  the law states .

CNBC business analyst Rick Santelli's televised tirade earlier this year ago against the idea of " loser " homeowners receiving government assistance turned the cable analyst into an overnight folk hero , no small feat for this voice of oppressed bond traders everywhere .
The Fox News / Republican right has high hopes the ensuing " tea party " protests inspired by Santelli 's rhetoric will serve as a rallying cry for rousing the right - wing faithful against President Obama 's economic recovery plan .
Unfortunately for them , the public protests against " taxes and spending " turned mostly into a transparent exhibition of the Republican Party 's desperation .
Indeed , there is legitimate public unease over the President 's recovery plan .
But what are the Republicans going to do about it ?
Predictably , the " free - market " fetishists of the right remain broken records when it comes to their own recovery proposals .
Which are ?
Basically , just more of the same Bush - era version of deregulated Reaganomics .
In other words , endless sops to the financial interests of the rich and powerful while everyone else gets to breathe more stale air about better days to come .
That 's why the " Tea Party " protests amount to little more than a manipulated exercise in fake populism .
But as long as we 're shedding illusions , what about also divesting ourselves of some equally archaic liberal notions ?
Most Democrats now assume that the economy will eventually right itself if only we somewhat re-regulate the financial sector , temporarily pump more public money into troubled companies , and provide market incentives to private capital .
Accordingly , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner wants to provide low - cost loans and guarantees to private investors to buy a minimum $ 500 billion ( maybe up to $ 1 trillion ) in toxic mortgage and other bank assets .
The plan is based on the dubious proposition that the road to economic salvation winds through the same hedge - fund investors and private equity firms already responsible for speculating the economy into disaster .
Even worse , the terms of the plan guarantee that it is only the risk - not the profit - that will be minimized for private investors .
As the New York Times noted in a March 24 editorial , the Treasury plan represents " a near complete socialization of losses , with little value flowing to taxpayers . "
True to form , some on the right now decry Obama 's stimulus package as nothing less than the triumph of socialism in America .
" Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff , " former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee told a recent meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference .
Not that the huckster Huckabee has any serious ideas about how to solve the run of mortgage foreclosures or rising unemployment .
Or , for that matter , the crisis of capitalism itself .
The Decline of the Empire
Speaking of which , the real trouble with the Geithner plan is its assumption that the banking system is basically sound .
In fact , the current crisis reflects contradictions in " free market " economics decades in the making .
As Walden Bello , a senior analyst for Focus on the Global South , noted last fall , " The Wall Street meltdown is not only due to greed and to the lack of government regulation of a hyperactive sector .
The Wall Street collapse stems ultimately from the crisis of overproduction that has plagued global capitalism since the mid-seventies . "
He 's right .
The current economic crisis is a product of the long goodbye of the postwar American empire .
The prosperity that followed the end of World War II was largely driven by rebuilding war - torn Europe and Japan , along with the introduction of permanent , large - scale military spending .
But inevitably the rebuilt foreign economies came to represent not just new markets and investment opportunities , but increased global competition .
With the rise also of newly industrializing economies in such countries as Brazil , Taiwan , and South Korea , the competitiveness of the U.S. economy had by the 1970s begun to undergo serious decline .
Until this time , relatively high wages served not only to stimulate U.S. consumer spending , but also to pacify the labor movement .
The Keynesian regulatory controls put in place in the 1930s acted at least partly to temper the natural " boom or bust " cycle of the market .
But there was always a limit to how far the wondrous world of postwar productivity could go .
That 's because even the most affluent " free market " societies are characterized by social inequality and poverty , which represent serious brakes on the public 's buying power .
Hence , overproduction .

With declining profit rates , Reaganomics had by the early 1980s become the ideological clearinghouse to justify trashing " outdated " government restrictions on capital growth .
Supposedly , dismantling " burdensome " restrictions on trade and commerce would prompt the wealthy , inspired by their growing good fortune , to invest with renewed vigor in new jobs and capital growth .
A rising tide of popular affluence would thus be the result .
Of course , it did n't quite work out that way .
The " trickle - down " economics of the Reagan era instead turned into a form of economic waterboarding for the average American .
Income circulated only one - way , upward from the middle class and poor to the already well - off on their way to becoming the super well - off .
Good paying union jobs were exported overseas where wages were cheap and work standards low , while at home wages and benefits stagnated and union growth stalled .
Two decades later 40 to 50 percent of all U.S. corporate profits come from operations and sales abroad , while wages have remained mostly flat .
Tellingly , the income gap between the haves and everyone else is greater now than any time in the nation 's history .
A World on Edge
If laissez faire economics is dead , as French President Sarkozy recently declared , so also is the era of American global economic power .
Today , the financial sector constitutes about 22 percent of all U.S. economic activity , notes former Republican strategist Kevin Phillips in " Bad Money . "
As for manufacturing , it is down to about 12 percent of the economy .
These facts reflect less the dynamic character of American capitalism than its underlying instability and weakness .
Why ?
Because the financial sector creates nothing of real value .
It is , as Bello notes , " tantamount to squeezing value out of already created value . "
It should be an ABC of economics that only industry , agriculture and their accompanying trade and services introduce real value into the economy .
It should also be ABC that the current crisis is the result of bipartisan policies .
It was the Clinton Administration and Congress that engineered passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 , leading to repeal of decades - old regulations restricting banks from offering investment or insurance services .
The runway was thus cleared for an already burgeoning investor economy to soar into the speculative stratosphere .
After all , why invest in actual economic growth when the real money is to be made buying and selling other people 's mortgages ?
Unfortunately , the Obama Administration proceeds as if the crisis is a serious temporary problem that money and some regulatory tinkering to the economic engine can repair .
Meanwhile , the Republican right - wing sinks further into ludicrous irrelevancy , their jabs at Obama 's " socialist " policies appearing increasingly grotesque and out of touch .
But since they 've brought up the topic of socialism , why not talk about the real thing ?
The essence of the socialist idea is that the economy can and should be planned , both to make best use of resources and to serve not private profit but the majority 's human needs .
In other words , socialism represents the extension of democracy into the economy .
In its absence we instead witness the current havoc wreaked on our economy by a relatively small number of super - rich , who use their economic and political power to twist the levers of the economy to serve their own narrow interests .
Some liberal economists such as Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman have recently begun to sound the alarm on Obama 's recovery plan .
Expecting those who caused the crisis to solve the crisis just wo n't work , says Krugman , even if you reward them beyond their wildest dreams .
Krugman favors more extensive measures such as nationalizing the largest banks .
Still , his perspective is limited .
In the long run he'd like to keep the banks in private hands .
Bank nationalization should be just a temporary solution .
Why ?
Why , indeed , should private ownership of major economic institutions be considered sacrosanct , especially when those who've had their chance to run things have instead run things into the ground ?
In a rational society the banking system would exist as an arm of the public good , a regulated system subject to democratic management .
It might be even easier to grasp the capitalist folly in health care .
We need private health insurance companies as much we need private fire departments that serve only their own paid - up enrollees .
Is this just inflated left - wing rhetoric ?
Then ask yourself how democratic it is for the richest 1 percent of Americans to own 43 percent of all stock ?
Or for this same 1 percent to account for 33 percent of total household wealth , according to the Federal Reserve Bulletin ?
Is it far - fetched to suggest that class inequality and economic insecurity are permanent hallmarks of life under capitalism ?
If the economic crisis is the result of bipartisan policy , it 's solution now lies in mass partisan action by an organized public .
All the hopeful chatter from the Wall Street types in the Treasury Department who now command the President 's ear will only go so far .
A mobilized , grass - roots labor movement fighting for the right to organize the unorganized and for more jobs and better working conditions and economic relief for distressed homeowners would do far more to move the country forward to the better future we all deserve .
Part 1 of 3 , By David Gaider
It ’s the question I get asked most often , and whether the person asking is looking to become a writer specifically or more interested in becoming a designer in general , my answer is generally the same : “ you apply , just like with any other job ” .
The truth is a bit more complicated , of course , but if I do n’t often delve into it with enthusiasm you ’ll have to forgive me .
As I said , I get asked this a lot .
First things first : what does a writer do ?
Well , I can tell you honestly that there is n’t a lot of call for dedicated writers in the game industry .
There are only a handful of companies that actually have such a beast , and BioWare no doubt has the greatest chunk of them .
Most other companies , I would suspect , either have people who wear various hats or outsource any time they need actual writing to be done .
We do a little of both , ourselves .
There was a time when the designers wore more than one hat out of necessity , but as BioWare has gotten larger we ’ve begun to specialize within the design group .
The writers are the people who do the quest design and a great portion of the story and level concepting , as well as all of the dialogue writing ( which takes up the vast portion of our time ) .
A level designer , meanwhile , is someone whose focus is on setting up the actual layout of a given level .
This is often almost as much of an art - related task as it is design .
System designers are the people who put together the actual gameplay systems , such as spellcasting or combat .
Cinematic designers are the people who put together the cutscenes , and these days are also the people who retouch cinematic dialogue to make it have more impact .
Technical designers , meanwhile , get to be the people responsible for putting it all together and making it actually work .
They populate the levels , balance the combats , and they do all the scripting to make the plots go .
So as you can see , this can cause a bit of consternation when trying to explain what it is a designer does .
I myself have experience in scripting and system design , but these days I ’m as specialized as anyone else .
Some writers focus even more on simply writing dialogue and approach the quest design aspect only as they gain more experience .
It all varies .
I ’m sure Other companies deal with designers completely differently , which makes it a fun little dance when a recruiter calls you up out of the blue .
“ I represent a company looking to hire a new designer . ”
“ Well , what kind of designer are you looking for ? ”
“ Err … are there different kinds ? ”

Relocation of convicted criminals to a distant place

Penal transportation or transportation was the relocation of convicted criminals , or other persons regarded as undesirable , to a distant place , often a colony for a specified term ; later , specifically established penal colonies became their destination .
While the prisoners may have been released once the sentences were served , they generally did not have the resources to return home .
Origin and implementation [ edit ]
Banishment or forced exile from a polity or society has been used as a punishment since at least Ancient Roman times .
The practice reached its height in the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries . [ 1 ]
Transportation removed the offender from society , mostly permanently , but was seen as more merciful than capital punishment .
This method was used for criminals , debtors , military prisoners , and political prisoners .[ citation needed ]
Penal transportation was also used as a method of colonization .
For example , from the earliest days of English colonial schemes , new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and the poor as well as to increase the colonial labour force , [ 1 ] for the overall benefit of the realm . [ 2 ]
Great Britain and the British Empire [ edit ]
Initially based on the royal prerogative of mercy , [ 3 ] and later under English Law , transportation was an alternative sentence imposed for a felony .
It was typically imposed for offences for which death was deemed too severe .
By 1670 , as new felonies were defined , the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Forgery of a document , for example , was a capital crime until the 1820s , when the penalty was reduced to transportation .
Depending on the crime , the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years .
If imposed for a period of years , the offender was permitted to return home after serving his time , but had to make his own way back .
Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons , and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony .
England transported its convicts and political prisoners , as well as prisoners of war from Scotland and Ireland , to its overseas colonies in the Americas from the 1610s until early in the American Revolution in 1776 , when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 ( 16 Geo. 3 c. 43 ) . [ 6 ]
The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785 , but was less used there than in England .
Transportation on a large scale resumed with the departure of the First Fleet to Australia in 1787 , and continued there until 1868 .
Transportation was not used by Scotland before the Act of Union 1707 ; following union , the Transportation Act 1717 specifically excluded its use in Scotland . [ 7 ]
Under the Transportation , etc. Act 1785 ( 25 Geo. 3 c. 46 ) the Parliament of Great Britain specifically extended the usage of transportation to Scotland . [ 8 ]
It remained little used [ 9 ] under Scots Law until the early 19th century .
In Australia , a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a ticket of leave , permitting some prescribed freedoms .
This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life , to marry and raise a family , and to contribute to the development of the colony .
Historical background [ edit ]
The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing [ edit ]
In England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe , later termed the Bloody Code .
This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution ( usually by hanging ) , and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals .
With modifications to the traditional benefit of clergy , which originally exempted only clergymen from the general criminal law , it developed into a legal fiction by which many common offenders of " clergyable " offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution . [ 10 ]
Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences , but under the rule of law , it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely .
With the development of colonies , transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment , although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon , rather than a sentence in itself . [ 11 ]
Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands .
A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported .
Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king 's mercy .
It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system . [ 12 ]
There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies .
In 1615 , in the reign of James I , a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and , consequently , transportation to the colonies .
Convicts were chosen carefully : the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners " for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas " . [ 13 ]
During the Commonwealth , Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts , and initiated group transportation of military [ 14 ] and civilian prisoners . [ 15 ]
With the Restoration , the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it , started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720 , with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after branding the thumb .
Alternatively , under the second act dealing with Moss - trooper brigands on the Scottish border , offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away , or otherwise at the judge 's discretion , were to be transported to America , " there to remaine and not to returne " . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
There were various influential agents of change : judges ' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly , but the king 's and Privy Council 's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution . [ 18 ]
The system changed one step at a time : in February 1663 , after that first experiment , a bill was proposed to the House of Commons to allow the transporting of felons , and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny .
These bills failed , but it was clear that change was needed . [ 19 ]
Transportation was not a sentence in itself , but could be arranged by indirect means .
The reading test , crucial for the benefit of clergy , was a fundamental feature of the penal system , but to prevent its abuse , this pardoning process was used more strictly .
Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record .
It was arranged that they fail the reading test , but they were then reprieved and held in jail , without bail , to allow time for a royal pardon ( subject to transportation ) to be organised . [ 20 ]
Transportation as a commercial transaction [ edit ]

Transportation became a business : merchants chose from among the prisoners on the basis of the demand for labour and their likely profits .
They obtained a contract from the sheriffs , and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as indentured servants .
The payment they received also covered the jail fees , the fees for granting the pardon , the clerk 's fees , and everything necessary to authorise the transportation . [ 21 ]
These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond , but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications .
The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles : colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners : the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome .
Maryland and Virginia enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670 , and the king was persuaded to respect these . [ 21 ]
The penal system was also influenced by economics : the profits obtained from convicts ' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and , consequently , of England .
Nevertheless , it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population , not diminish it ; [ 22 ] but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy .
King William's War ( 1688 –1697 ) ( part of the Nine Years ' War ) and the War of the Spanish Succession ( 1701 – 14 ) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation .
In the post - war period there was more crime [ 23 ] and hence potentially more executions , and something needed to be done .
In the reigns of Queen Anne ( 1702 – 14 ) and George I ( 1714 – 27 ) , transportation was not easily arranged , but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences , so transportation was the preferred punishment . [ 24 ]
Transportation Act 1717 [ edit ]
There were several obstacles to the use of transportation .
In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished ( 5 Anne c. 6 ) .
This allowed judges to sentence " clergyable " offenders to a workhouse or a house of correction . [ 24 ]
But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime : another solution was needed .
The Transportation Act was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the Whig government .
It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence , thus simplifying the penal process . [ 25 ]
Non-capital convicts ( clergyable felons usually destined for branding on the thumb , and petty larceny convicts usually destined for public whipping ) [ 26 ] were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years .
A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king .
Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence . [ 25 ]
The bill was introduced by William Thomson , the Solicitor General , who was " the architect of the transportation policy " . [ 27 ]
Thomson , a supporter of the Whigs , was Recorder of London and became a judge in 1729 .
He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet . [ 28 ]
One reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly .
The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved .
Initially the government rejected Thomson 's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts , but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey , his suggestion was proposed again , and the Treasury contracted Jonathan Forward , a London merchant , for the transportation to the colonies . [ 29 ]
The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718 : he was paid £ 3 ( £ 5 in 1727 ) for each prisoner transported overseas .
The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the Home Counties . [ 30 ]
The " Felons ' Act " ( as the Transportation Act was called ) was printed and distributed in 1718 , and in April twenty - seven men and women were sentenced to transportation . [ 31 ]
The Act led to significant changes : both petty and grand larceny were punished by transportation ( seven years ) , and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge 's discretion . [ 32 ]
In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners , but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation . [ 33 ]
In a few cases before 1734 , the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping , by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]
This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734 .
With the exception of those years , the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts , thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays .
Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity . [ 36 ]
Women and children [ edit ]
Penal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults .
Men , women , and children were sentenced to transportation , but its implementation varied by gender and age .
From 1660 to 1670 , highway robbery , burglary , and horse theft were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men .
In those years , five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny , an offence for which benefit of clergy was not available for women until 1692 . [ 37 ]
Also , merchants preferred young and able - bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies .
All these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail .
[ 21 ]
Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported , but this solution was considered absurd : this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women . [ 38 ]
Women were sent to the Leeward Islands , the only colony that accepted them , and the government had to pay to send them overseas . [ 39 ]
In 1696 Jamaica refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women ; Barbados similarly accepted convicts but not " women , children nor other infirm persons " . [ 40 ]
Thanks to transportation , the number of men whipped and released diminished , but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women .
The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence , but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system : one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped . [ 41 ]
Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them . [ 41 ]
The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community . [ 34 ]
The end of transportation [ edit ]
The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 –1783 ) halted transportation to America .
Parliament claimed that " the transportation of convicts to his Majesty 's colonies and plantations in America ... is found to be attended with various inconveniences , particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community , and who , by proper care and correction , might be reclaimed from their evil course " ; they then passed " An act to authorize ... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who , for certain crimes , are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty 's colonies and plantations . " [ 42 ]
For the ensuing decade , men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned .
Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy , and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 ( 18 Geo. 3 c. 62 ) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 ( 19 Geo. 3 , c. 54 ) . [ 43 ]
This resulted in a 1779 inquiry by a Parliamentary Committee on the entire subject of transportation and punishment ; initially the Penitentiary Act was passed , introducing a policy of state prisons as a measure to reform the system of overcrowded prison hulks that had developed , but no prisons were ever built as a result of the act . [ 44 ]
The Transportation , etc. Act 1784 ( 24 Geo. 3 c. 56 ) [ 45 ] and the Transportation , etc. Act 1785 ( 25 Geo. 3 c. 46 ) [ 8 ] also resulted to help alleviate overcrowding .
Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions , or outside them , as the destination for transported criminals ; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour , or where they could be utilized and accommodated .
The overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by Orders in Council on 6 December 1786 , by the decision to establish a penal colony in New South Wales , on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770 , [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] but as yet not settled by Britain or any other European power .
The British policy toward Australia , specifically for use as a penal colony , within their overall plans to populate and colonise the continent , would differentiate it from America , where the use of convicts was only a minor adjunct to its overall policy . [ 49 ]
In 1787 , when transportation resumed to the chosen Australian colonies , the far greater distance added to the terrible experience of exile , and it was considered more severe than the methods of imprisonment employed for the previous decade .
[ 50 ]
The Transportation Act 1790 ( 30 Geo. 3 c. 47 ) officially enacted the previous orders in council into law , stating " his Majesty hath declared and appointed ... that the eastern coast of New South Wales , and the islands thereunto adjacent , should be the place or places beyond the seas to which certain felons , and other offenders , should be conveyed and transported ... or other places " .
The act also gave " authority to remit or shorten the time or term " of the sentence " in cases where it shall appear that such felons , or other offenders , are proper objects of the royal mercy " [ 51 ]
At the beginning of the 19th century , transportation for life became the maximum penalty for several offences which had previously been punishable by death . [ 50 ]
With complaints starting in the 1830s , sentences of transportation became less common in 1840 since the system was perceived to be a failure : crime continued at high levels , people were not dissuaded from committing felonies , and the conditions of convicts in the colonies were inhumane .
Although a concerted program of prison building ensued , the Short Titles Act 1896 lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century . [ 52 ]
The system of criminal punishment by transportation , as it had developed over nearly 150 years , was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s , when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with penal servitude , and intended to punish .
The Penal Servitude Act 1853 ( 16 & 17 Vict. c. 99 ) , long titled " An Act to substitute , in certain Cases , other Punishment in lieu of Transportation , " [ 52 ] enacted that with judicial discretion , lesser felonies , those subject to transportation for less than 14 years , could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term .
To provide confinement facilities , the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 ( 16 & 17 Vict. c. 121 ) , long titled " An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation . " [ 52 ] The Penal Servitude Act 1857 ( 20 & 21 Vict. c. 3 ) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases , with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation . [ 53 ] [ 50 ]
While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act , the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868 .
During the 80 years of its use to Australia , the number of transported convicts totaled about 162,000 men and women . [ 54 ]
Over time the alternative terms of imprisonment would be somewhat reduced from their terms of transportation . [ 55 ]
Transportation locations [ edit ]
Transportation to North America [ edit ]
From the early 1600s until the American Revolution of 1776 , the British colonies in North America received transported British criminals .
Destinations were the island colonies of the West Indies and the mainland colonies [ failed verification ] that became the United States of America . [ 56 ]
In the 17th century transportation was carried out at the expense of the convicts or the shipowners .
The Transportation Act 1717 allowed courts to sentence convicts to seven years ' transportation to America .
In 1720 , an extension authorized payments by the Crown to merchants contracted to take the convicts to America .
The Transportation
Act made returning from transportation a capital offence . [ 50 ] [ 57 ]
The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified - John Dunmore Lang has estimated 50,000 , and Thomas Keneally has proposed 120,000 .
Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province . [ 58 ]
Many prisoners were taken in battle from Ireland or Scotland and sold into indentured servitude , usually for a number of years .[ 59 ] [ page needed ]
The American Revolution brought transportation to the North American mainland to an end .
The remaining British colonies ( in what is now Canada ) were regarded as unsuitable for various reasons , including the possibility that transportation might increase dissatisfaction with British rule among settlers and / or the possibility of annexation by the United States – as well as the ease with which prisoners could escape across the border .
After the termination of transportation to North America , British prisons became overcrowded , and dilapidated ships moored in various ports were pressed into service as floating gaols known as " hulks " . [ 60 ]
Following a 18th century disastrous [ why ? ] experiment in transporting convicted prisoners to Cape Coast Castle ( modern Ghana ) and the Gorée ( Senegal ) in West Africa , [ 61 ]
British authorities turned their attention to New South Wales ( in what would become Australia ) .
From the 1820s until the 1860s , convicts were sent to Bermuda to work on the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard and other defence works , including an area still known as " Convict Bay " , at St. George 's town .
Transportation to Australia [ edit ]
This notice on a bridge in Dorset warns that damage to the bridge can be punished by transportation .
In 1787 , the " First Fleet " of convict ships departed from England to establish the first British settlement in Australia , as a penal colony .
The fleet arrived at Botany Bay ( Sydney ) on 18 January 1788 .
Norfolk Island was a convict penal settlement from 1788 – 94 , and again from 1824 – 47 .
The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London .
The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources .
In 1803 , Van Diemen 's Land ( modern - day Tasmania ) was also settled as a penal colony , followed by the Moreton Bay Settlement ( modern Brisbane , Queensland ) in 1824 .
The other Australian colonies were " free settlements " , as non-convict colonies were known .
However , the Swan River Colony ( Western Australia ) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851 , to resolve a long - standing labour shortage .
Until the massive influx of immigrants during the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s , the free settlers had been outnumbered by English and Irish convicts and their descendants .
However , compared to America , Australia received many more English prisoners .
Transportation from Britain and Ireland officially ended in 1868 , although it had become uncommon several years earlier . [ 62 ]
Transportation from colonial India [ edit ]
In British colonial India – including the province of British Burma ( now Myanmar ) and the port of Karachi ( now part of Pakistan ) – opponents of British rule were transported to the Andaman Islands . [ 63 ]
A penal colony was established there in 1857 with prisoners from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 ( called the " Sepoy Mutiny " by the British ) . [ 64 ]
As the Indian independence movement swelled , so did the number of prisoners being transported .
The Cellular Jail , also called Kālā Pānī or Kalapani ( Hindi for black waters ) , was constructed between 1896 and 1906 as a high - security prison with 698 individual cells for solitary confinement .
Surviving prisoners were repatriated in 1937 .
The penal settlement was abolished in 1945 .
An estimated 80,000 political prisoners were transported to this " torture machine " [ 64 ] " in an ' experiment ' that involved torture , medical tests , forced labour and , for many , death . " [ 65 ]
Use by France [ edit ]
France transported convicts to Devil 's Island and New Caledonia in the 19th and early - to - mid 20th centuries .
Devil 's Island , a French penal colony in Guiana , was used for transportation from 1852 to 1953 .
New Caledonia became a French penal colony from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897 ; about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners ( most notably Communards ) were sent to New Caledonia .
The most famous transported prisoner is probably French army officer Alfred Dreyfus , wrongly convicted of treason in a trial in 1894 , held in an atmosphere of antisemitism .
He was sent to Devil 's Island .
The case became a cause célèbre known as the Dreyfus Affair , and Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906 .
Use by the Soviet Union [ edit ]
During the Second World War , the Soviet Union transported up to 1.9 million people from western republics to Siberia and the Central Asian republics of the Union .
Most were persons accused of treasonous collaboration with Nazi Germany , or of Anti-Soviet rebellion . [ 66 ]
Populations targeted included Volga Germans , Chechens , and Caucasian Turkic populations .
The transportations had a twofold objective - to remove potential liabilities from the warfront , and to provide human capital for the settlement and industrialization of the largely underpopulated eastern regions .
The policy continued until February 1956 , when Nikita Khrushchev in his speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences condemned the transportation as a violation of Leninist principles .
Whilst the policy itself was rescinded , the transported populations did not begin to return to their original metropoles until after the collapse of the Soviet Union , in 1991 . [ 67 ]
In popular culture [ edit ]
Performing arts [ edit ]
Penal transportation is a feature of many broadsides , a new type of folk song that developed in eighteenth - century England . [ 68 ]
A number of these transportation ballads have been collected from traditional singers .
Examples include " Van Diemen 's Land , " " The Black Velvet Band , " and " The Fields of Athenry . "
Timberlake Wertenbaker 's play Our Country 's Good is set in 1780s in the first Australian penal colony .
In the 1988 play , convicts and Royal Marines arrive aboard a First Fleet ship and settle New South Wales .
Convicts and guards interact as they rehearse a theatre production , which the governor had suggested as an alternate form of entertainment instead of watching public hangings . [ 69 ]

Literature [ edit ]
One of the key characters in Charles Dickens 's novel Great Expectations is an escaped convict , Abel Magwitch .
Pip helps him in the opening pages of the novel , and he later turns out to be Pip 's secret benefactor – the source of his " great expectations " .
Magwitch , who had been apprehended shortly after the young Pip had helped him , was thereafter sentenced to transportation for life to New South Wales in Australia .
While so exiled , he earned the fortune that he later would use to help Pip .
Further , it was Magwitch 's desire to see the " gentleman " that Pip had become that motivated him to illegally return to England , which ultimately led to his arrest and death .
Great Expectations was published in serial form in 1860 – 1861 .
My Transportation for Life , Indian freedom fighter Veer Savarkar 's memoir of his imprisonment , is set in the British Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands .
Savarkar was imprisoned there from 1911 to 1921 .
Franz Kafka 's story " In der Strafkolonie " ( " In the Penal Colony " ) , published in 1919 , was set in an unidentified penal settlement where condemned prisoners were executed by a brutal machine .
The work was later adapted for several other media , including an opera by Philip Glass .
The novel Papillon tells the story of Henri Charrière , a French man convicted of murder in 1931 and exiled to the French Guinea penal colony on Devil 's Island .
A film adaptation of the book was made in 1973 , starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman .
The British author W. Somerset Maugham set several stories in the French Caribbean penal colonies .
In 1935 he had stayed at Saint - Laurent - du - Maroni in French Guiana .
His 1939 novel Christmas Holiday and two short stories in 1940's The Mixture as Before were set there , although he " ignored the brutal punishments and painted a pleasant picture of the infamous colony . " [ 70 ]
Penal transportation , typically to other planets , sometimes appears in works of science fiction .
A classic example is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein ( 1966 ) , in which convicts and political dissidents are transported to lunar colonies in order to grow food for Earth . [ 71 ]
In Heinlein 's book , a sentence of lunar transportation is necessarily permanent , as the long - term physiological effects of the moon 's weak surface gravity ( about one - sixth that of Earth ) leave " loonies " unable to return safely to Earth . [ 72 ]

It 's a faint , it 's sputtering , but there may be the flame of some hope for Texas .
Some .
First , there are bills going through the process of creation ( haha ) in the Lone Star State that could strip the State Board of Education of its powers to warp the minds of children with creationism .
Incredibly , too , the effort is bipartisan !
Also , I 'm hearing rumors that the extremely awful BoE chair , avowed creationist Don McLeroy , is having some trouble at his confirmation hearing to be re-upped as the Board 's top Denier of Reality .
Gee , that 's too bad .
PZ comments on this , and the Texas Freedom Network has this priceless quote from the dentist - cum - evangelist :
My purpose has never been religious indoctrination .
Wow .
Now we can add " liar " to his list of adjectives .
I am loathe to use that word unless there is strong evidence , but that 's the biggest whopper I 've heard in a long , long time .
He has done nothing but try to wedge creationism into the state standards while weakening real science .
So , in fact , religious indoctrination is precisely what his purpose is .
Texans : you may wish to contact call your legislators .
In reality there 's probably little chance McLeroy will be tossed out --
Texas politics generally have little enough to do with the voters -- but this is as good a chance as you 're likely to get .

init( Config ) -> {ok , Config} .
to :
init( Config ) -> {{trace , " / tmp " } , Config} .
Recompile and reload the module , then issue an HTTP request to it .
You should see a file show up in / tmp with the extension . wmtrace .
Now open the Erlang shell for your webmachine application and type :
wmtrace_resource:add_dispatch_rule(" wmtrace " , " /tmp " ) .
Tab over to your browser and hit / wmtrace / .
You should see the list of .wmtrace files in your /tmp directory .
Click on one of them , and you ’ll be in the trace inspection utility .
For any pre-webmachine - 1.0 users , getting access to this utility requires converting your resources to the new webmachine with referential transparency , but I can tell you from experience that that process is largely mechanical , and not that time consuming .
I translated BeerRiot ’s ~ 7000loc in about 2 hours ( including testing ) .
I ’d love to hear feedback about the trace tool .
It ’s the product of about three days of hacking ( one proof - of - concept , one nearly - complete - rewrite , one actual - improvement ) , so I ’m not hard - set on much of anything .

The Moby Scheme Compiler for Smartphones
Q : Get out of the way and just let me at the compiler !
Where is it ?
A : Here you go !
Q : What is “ Whalesong ” ?
A : That 's the new name for the project formerly known as Moby .
Q : What is “ Racket ” ?
A : That 's the new name for the Scheme system supported by Moby .
In March 2009 I gave a keynote talk at the International Lisp Conference .
The talk was ostensibly about Moby , a Scheme compiler for smartphones ( the talk 's sub - title was Is That a Parenthesis in Your Pocket ? ) , but I was trying to talk about a much larger set of topics , including Bootstrap , a curricular program , and World , the PLT Scheme system for reactive functional programming .
Here are the slides ( PPT , 3.5 Mb ) .
For those without PowerPoint , I 've uploaded the slides to slideshare .
This version misses the animations in the slides , but will still give you the essential content .
Here is the accompanying audio ( MP3 , 21.8 Mb ) , which you 'll need to follow the talk .
Warning : the audio is a bit loud because I had the microphone pretty close to me ( and was speaking without a room mic to a fairly large room ) .
Start with the volume low !
Near the end of the talk , I refer to a demo .
That movie ( QuickTime , 1.8 Mb ) is also on - line .
For more light entertainment , see our handbell choir .
Thanks to Danny
Yoo for converting the audio from WMA to MP3 and cleaning it up with Levelator ( suggested by Jens Axel Soegaard ) .
Cappadocia Cave Hotel , Yunak Evleri
source : here
Cappadocia Hotel literally carved into the Yunak Evleri mountain cliff .
It includes 6 cave houses , a 19th century Greek mansion and 30 rooms dating back to the 5th and 6th century .
Another reason to visit the luxurious Cappadocia Hotel is the opportunity to explore its elaborate underground cities , cavernous churches and incredible rock terrain .
So if you ’re ever in Turkey and can afford to spend some serious bucks on a memorable vacation , keep Cappadocia Hotel in mind .

April 27 , 2009 --
In the present political crisis in Thailand , it is shocking that most Thai NGOs have disgraced themselves by siding with the ``Yellow Shirt '' elites or have remained silent in the face of the general attack on democracy .
It is shocking because NGO activists started out by being on the side of the poor and the oppressed in society .
To explain this situation , we must go beyond a simple explanation that relies on personal failings of individuals or suggestions that NGOs have “ underlying bad intentions ” , or that they are “ agents of imperialism ” .
At the start of the protests against Prime Minister Thaksin , many NGOs joined the misnamed Peoples Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) demonstrators ( who wore yellow shirts as thei symbol ) .
This was understandable because the top leadership of the PAD contained people with NGO connections .
At the time it was legitimate to protest against the excesses of the government , although it was questionable whether the NGOs should have joined forces with conservative royalists like Sonti Limtongkul .
Soon , however , NGO involvement with the PAD , and then the military junta , after the coup of 2006 , went far beyond anything that can be classified as a genuine support for freedom and democracy .
At every twist and turn in the crisis , the majority of NGOs ended up on the side of the elite and the oppressors .
There is a real need to re-assess tactics and strategy .
After the 2006 coup , some Thai NGO leaders , such as Rawadee Parsertjaroensuk ( NGO - Coordinating Committee ) , Nimit Tienudom ( AIDS network ) , Banjong Nasa ( Southern Fisher Folk Network ) , Witoon Permpongsajaroen ( ecology movement ) and Sayamon Kaiyurawong ( Thai Volunteer Service ) , put themselves forward in the hope that the military would select them as appointed senators .
Earlier , NGO activists such as Rawadee Parsertjaroensuk and Nimit Tienudom attended PAD rallies .
Nimit claimed at a rally on March 23 , 2006 , that most Thaksin supporters “ did not know the truth ” about his government [ 1 ] .
This is patronising to the poor .
Many NGO leaders such as Nimit also told their members not to protest against the military junta at the closing ceremony of the Thai Social Forum in October 2006 , although the leadership of the NGO - Coordinating Committee supported this protest .
Immediately after the coup , even the Thai staff of Focus on Global South supported the coup [ 2 ] , although Walden Bello maintained a principled opposition to dictatorship .
Some NGO activists became government appointees under the military junta .
Most had illusions that the military would clean up Thai politics with their new constitution .
During the Thai Social Forum itself , large Thai NGOs like Raks Thai Foundation brought yellow - shirted royalist villagers to the forum .
This NGO receives a large amount of money from the Thai state .
This raises the issue of “ GNGOs ” i.e. , government - funded NGOs .
A large source of funds for Thai NGOs today comes from the state - funded “ Office of the Thai Health Promotion Fund ” [ 3 ] .
It is interesting to compare a number of statements made by the NGO national Coordinating Committee ( NGO - COD ) about the violent PAD protests throughout 2008 , with the statements made in April 2009 about pro-democracy ``Red Shirt '' protests .
The substance of the difference is in the emphasis .
In May , June and September 2008 , Pairot Polpet , as NGO - COD chairperson , issued statements calling for the pro-Thaksin government to respect the right of the PAD to “ peaceful protest ” .
In June 2008 , NGO - COD called on the pro-Thaksin government to resign .
Elected PAD and NGO senator Rosana Tositrakul stated that the government had no right to disperse the PAD protesters who had seized Government House .
It is important to note that the pro-Thaksin government did not use the army or live ammunition on the PAD .
Police use of tear gas may , however , have caused one death .
Later , after the Democrats had been manoeuvred into power by the army and PAD , in April 2009 , NGO - COD called on the Red Shirts to stop “ violent protests ” and later praised the voluntary ending of Red Shirt protests as a way to build peace .
They called on the government to “ only use legal means to disperse protesters ” .
One day later , the army and the government used live ammunition to disperse the Red Shirts , killing and injuring many .
An NGO - COD statement a week later did not call on the government to resign [ 4 ] .
The Consumers ’ Association , AIDS networks and slum dwellers ' group , under the leadership of Nimit Tienudom and Saree Ongsomwang , went further and denounced the Red Shirt protests on April 13 , but not the actions of the government .
Drawn into the right
How did the Thai NGOs become so reactionary , siding with the conservative elites against the poor in the suppression of democracy ?
There is an urgent need to analyse this problem because NGO activists started out as the champions of the rural poor .
Could it happen elsewhere ?
Is there a general lesson to be learnt here ?
In the 1980s Thai NGOs worked under the slogan “ the answer is in the villages ” , reflecting respect for ordinary villagers .
Despite being well meaning , the lack of politics in the NGO movement , and also a lack of democracy and accountability , has let them down and they have been increasingly drawn to reactionary right - wing politics .
After the “ collapse of Communism ” the NGO movement turned its back on “ politics ” and the primacy of mass movements and political parties .
Instead they embraced “ lobby politics ” and community anarchism .
The two go together because they reject any confrontation or competition with the state .
They reject building a big - picture political analysis .
Instead of building mass movements or political parties , the NGOs concentrated on single - issue campaigns as part of their attempt to avoid confrontation with the state .
This way of working also dove - tails with grant applications from international funding bodies and leads to a depoliticisation of the movement .
The NGOs also oppose representative democracy because they believe it only leads to dirty - money politics .
But the direct democracy in village communities , which they advocate , is powerless in the face of the all - powerful state .
It also glorifies traditional and conservative village leaders .
Initially , the NGOs loved - up to Thaksin 's Thai Rak Thai government .
They believed that it was open to NGO lobbying , which it was .
Thai Rak Thai took on board the idea of a universal healthcare system from progressive doctors and health - related NGOs .
But then , when they were wrong - footed by the government ’s raft of pro-poor policies that seemed to prove to villagers that the NGOs had only been “ playing ” at development , they rushed over to love - up the conservative royalists .
Such an about - face was only possible by ignoring politics , international lessons and any theory .
NGO leaders argue proudly that they are the “ true activists ” , not bookworms or theoreticians .
This explains why they can justify to themselves the support for the 2006 coup and why they have failed to defend democracy since .
Instead of bothering to analyse the political situation , they beat a path to lobby generals , governments of every shade , and anyone who has power .
Granted , the political situation was extremely messy and difficult .
In 2006 you had Thai Rak Thai , a big - business party with a record of human rights abuses and corruption .
On the other hand you had the army and the conservative royalists , with a history of human rights abuses and corruption .
There was not much to choose between the two .
But Thai Rak Thai had power through the electoral process .
In this situation the NGOs should have remained neutral , and with the poor and they should have opposed the coup .
But they were angry that Thai Rak Thai had won over their supporters and were distrustful of Thai Rak Thai's use of the state to build welfare programs and stimulate the economy .
This distrust came from an anarchistic distrust of the state .
For many NGOs , welfare should be organised by communities .
But this anti-state position opened the door to accepting a neoliberal concept of a small state , a view shared by the conservative royalists .
Their anarchistic rejection of representative politics also allowed them to see “ no difference ” between a parliament controlled by Thai Rak Thai and a military coup .
Since the poor voted on mass for Thai Rak Thai , the NGOs have become viciously patronising towards villagers , claiming that they “ lack the right information ” to make political decisions .
In fact , there was always a patronising element to their work .
Many Thai NGO leaders are self - appointed middle - class activists who shun elections and believe that NGOs should “ nanny ” [ 5 ] peasants and workers .
They are now fearful and contemptuous of the Red Shirt movement , which is starting a process of self - empowerment of the poor .
Of course , the Red Shirts are not angels , but in today ’s crisis , they represent the poor and their thirst for freedom and democracy .
The NGO movement 's relationship with NGO and trade union leaders in the PAD was also a factor .
The top PAD leadership was made up of a coalition between Sondhi Limtongkul -- conservative royalist media tycoon and owner of the Manager Group ; Chamlong Simuang -- leading light in the reactionary and anti-abortion Buddhist Santi Asoke movement ; Somsak Kosaisuk -- retired leader of the railway workers ' union ; Pipop Tongchai -- advisor to the Campaign for Popular Democracy and “ NGO elder ” ; Somkiat Pongpaiboon -- an activist working with teachers ’ groups and farmers ; and Suriyasai Takasila , ex-student movement bureaucrat .
What the NGO , student and trade union activists in the PAD leadership had in common was a lack of any genuine mass base .
People like Pipop did not lead NGO - COD .
Somsak never managed to get a strike going on the railways to protect working conditions or oppose privatisation .
They were people who had become bureaucratised and distant from ordinary activists .
Instead they looked to other forces who could mobilise people and resources , including the conservative royalists .
Nevertheless , they were able to call on personal support from many NGO networks and state enterprise unions “ for old times ' sake ” .
In general terms , what we can say about the Thai experience is that the NGO movement is now lined up with the elite against the mass of the population [ 6 ] .
It is no longer possible for progressive people to work with them [ 7 ] .
Unless serious splits and changes occur , they cannot be regarded as part of any civil society movement for Thai democracy .
International lessons ?
What are the international lessons for NGO activists ?
What we can generalise from Thailand is that NGOs run the risk of taking the wrong side in any serious social conflict .
Actually , everyone can make mistakes , including left - wing parties !
But for NGOs , there are three major reasons which might cause mistakes .
1. Funding pressures .
NGOs increasingly receive money from local governments and imperialist organisations like the World Bank .
They are “ GNGOs ” and can become reluctant to oppose the elites .
2 . Lobby politics mean there is always a tendency to be opportunistic , being prepared to work with authoritarian governments .
3 . Rejection of politics , especially class politics .
This lack of politics means that in difficult and messy situations NGOs do not have the necessary theory to be able to choose the side of the poor or democracy .
What is needed is more political theorising and more open debate .
NGOs also need to be committed to building mass movements , rather than relying only on lobby politics .

A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum was a hit on the summer of 1967
Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade of Pale is the most played song in public places in the past 75 years , according to a chart compiled for BBC Radio 2 .
The song , with its distinctive organ riff , stayed at number one for six weeks in the UK in the summer of 1967 .
Queen 's Bohemian Rhapsody was at number two followed by All I Have To Do Is Dream by the Everly Brothers .
There was no place in the top 10 for The Beatles .

Swarthick Salin faces deportation after living in Scotland for nine years A tribunal ruling which has left an Indian man and his family facing deportation has been criticised by Stagecoach millionaire Ann Gloag .
Swarthick Salins has lived in Scotland for nine years and studied for a PhD at St Andrews University with backing from a charity set up by Ms Gloag .
The father - of - three had his application rejected after his savings fell £ 78 below the UK Border Agency 's level .
Ms Gloag described the judgement as " perverse and ludicrous " .
" This judgement consigns a hard - working , law - abiding family who have known no other life to dreadful uncertainty , " she said .
" I have never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life .
And this is all over £ 80 . "
Mr Salins , whose three children were born in the UK , had applied to stay in the country to enable him to apply for work with aid agencies .
However , his application was refused by a judge at a tribunal in Glasgow because his bank balance fell to £ 721.23 last September .
Decision appeal Mr Salins , from Perth , told the Daily Record newspaper : " My wife is distraught and we are hoping against hope that all will be well in the end .
" We do n't claim a penny from the state .
At the end of the day , it was down to an oversight . "
A UK Border Agency spokesman said : " It is important that migrants are able to support themselves and their dependants when they are here .
" Allowing the entry of those unable to support themselves would have negative social consequences for the individual and for the UK . "
Mr Salins said he was planning to lodge an appeal against the decision with the Court of Session in Edinburgh .
Perth and North Perthshire MP , Pete Wishart , said he would pursue the case with the Home Office .
The SNP MP said : " This case is bizarre and ridiculous and only serves the purpose of undermining confidence in our immigration system . "

Writing that Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein ’s tough questioning of President Obama was a healthy “ confrontational question , ” Steve Benen of the Washington Monthly ‘s Political Animal blog thinks that ( 2/10/09 ) “ more importantly , as Ezra [ Klein at the American Prospect ] noted , it was ‘ confrontational from the left rather than from the center . ' ”
Benen then looks at stimulus bill broker Senator Ben Nelson ’s recent press experiences :
Last week , during the Senate debate , Nelson made four appearances in four days on Fox News and Fox Business .
The questions were predictable , and presupposed that Republican talking points were right .
Nelson clearly struggled in the [ MSNBC Rachel ]
Maddow interview , though , in part because he faced substantive questions from a progressive perspective , and in part because he ’s not used to substantive questions from a progressive perspective .
Consider the kind of questions Maddow threw his way :
Would n’t the legislation be more effective with a higher ratio of spending to tax cuts ?
Why cut $ 15 billion in school construction money ?
( When Nelson emphasized the importance of local control of education , Maddow reminded him that school construction crews would n’t affect the curriculum . )
Why take out $ 40 billion in aid to states ?
Why is there less money going to food stamps , when food stamps offer the best stimulative bang for the buck of anything in the economic arsenal ?
( That last point has been lost on almost everyone else in broadcast media . )
Nelson being reduced to admitting that such concessions were more in consideration of appeasing Republicans than in actually helping the U.S. economy is “ one of the reasons ” Benen finds “ shows like Maddow ’s ( and press conference questions like Sam Stein ’s ) so important .
The political discourse is dominated by a certain conventional wisdom , which looks at the news through a prism of Republican creation . ”
The New York Yankees might have a serious problem on their hands : Beautiful new Yankee Stadium appears to be a veritable wind tunnel that is rocketing balls over the fences .
The Indians ' Shin-Soo Choo blasts one of Cleveland 's six home runs at new Yankee Stadium on Saturday .
Nick Laham / Getty Images
This was in evidence again on Saturday , when the Indians posted six homers , including 14 runs in the second inning .
Cleveland eventually won 22 - 4 -- and the Yankees and Indians have combined for 14 homers in the last two days .
" With the way the wind has been the last couple of days , right field is a joke , " one official said .
" I would say at least three or four home runs in this series would be routine outs in nearly every park . "
There have been five games played in new Yankee Stadium , including two exhibitions against the Chicago Cubs , and so far there have been 25 homers -- including 17 in the first three games in the Yankees ' first home series against the Indians .
That 's an average of five home runs per game and , at this pace , there would be about 400 homers hit in the park this year -- or an increase of about 250 percent .
In the last year of old Yankee Stadium , in 2008 , there were a total of 160 homers .
The Yankees ' traditionally have fostered pitching in their home park .
Old Yankee Stadium had a short porch in right field , designed originally to take advantage of Babe Ruth 's power , but the rest of the park played large .
Through the years , this has allowed pitchers to thrive in Yankee Stadium , and been a nice lure for the team in pursuing free agents .
The new Yankee Stadium is just across the street from the old park , but it 's not aligned quite the same way as the old Yankee Stadium .
In the late - afternoon shadows in the old park , the sun was in the eyes of the left fielder .
Now the sun sets into the eyes of the center field and right fielder .
Whether or not that 's a factor is not known , and it's also possible that the number of home runs hit is directly related to the poor pitching of the likes of Chien - Ming Wang .
But already there have been a number of fly balls that seemed to be routine outs , before almost leaping out of the park .
Mark Teixeira lifted a pop to right field off the end of his bat in the first inning Saturday , and players on both teams appeared to be completely surprised when it carried over the wall .
Even if the Yankees wanted to make an adjustment , there is nothing they could do structurally to alter the park this season .
They would have to petition for a change going into the next offseason , before doing any reconstruction .

This Judge allegedly offered leniency for sex in at least one instance
A District Court Judge from El Paso , Texas , is free on bail after an arrest following a lengthy FBI investigation into alleged corruption in his courtroom .
Sunday , Jaime Esparza , the county 's District Attorney , said roughly 100 drug cases dismissed by District Judge Manuel Barraza will be reviewed , with the possibility that some charges will be refiled , reported the Associated Press .
Barraza , 53 , was arrested Thursday afternoon after a federal grand jury indicted him on " three charges of wire fraud and deprivation of honest services , " reported the El Paso Times .
" He faces an additional charge of making a false statement to the FBI , whose agents arrested him at his house Thursday morning . "
The judge took office Jan. 1 , 2009 .
" Everything is pretty much going crazy over here because of Judge Barrazas arrest , " El Paso District Clerk Gilbert Sanchez told El Paso Magazine .
" Were having to determine who will be signing documents on his behalf and what to do if he decides to return to the bench after he bonds out . "
" Gilbert said he and others hope Barraza will not continue hearing cases until the charges against him are disposed of , " the magazine continued .
Photo credit : Ruben R. Ramirez , El Paso Times
" ' He is innocent until proven guilty , of course , but were all hopeful that he will respect the bench and the oath that he took , ' Sanchez said .
Hes obligated by judicial ethics and the rules of conduct , and for that matter , the decency of a person . "
The state intervened and suspended Barraza from his $ 140,000 a year job .
He is free on a $ 10,000 bond .
" The four - count indictment against Barraza charges that he ' accepted bribes in the form of cash money and solicited sex and agreed to accept a bribe of engaging in sexual activity with women , including an individual why was , unbeknownst to the defendant , a Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent acting in an undercover capacity , in exchange for his influence and exercise of discretion in his capacity as an elected judge , ' " the magazine noted in a Sunday morning update to the story .
" Barrazas illegal solicitations allegedly began immediately after he was elected in November 2008 , two months before he took office , and continued until February of this year . "

Hi , and welcome to the homepage for " Tear Down This Myth : How The Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future , " published in February 2009 by Free Press , an imprint of Simon And Schuster .
The book is the first attempt to look at the toxic effect that a mythologized Ronald Ronald -- pushed for more than a decade by neoconservatives to revive their failing political movement -- has had on American politics , and the link between the near canonization of the 40th president and disastrous policies that are drowning America in red ink even as militarism runs rampant and Wall Street runs amok .
It seeks to correct the many distortions about Reagan -- to show that his trickle - down economics of tax cuts for the wealthy did n't save the American economy , that he did n't " win the Cold War , " and that he was a divisive president whose approval ratings were only average .
Booklist says that " [ a ] nyone interested inAmerica 's immediate future should read this book . "
The crisis in Mexico is escalating with each passing day and more and more media outlets are picking up on the startling news coming from south of the border .
Anderson Cooper recently produced a special report for 60 Minutes addressing the current circumstances in Mexico , the causes and possible solutions .
In the report , he touched on many topics we 've reported on here at Latina.com , including the arms bazaar that US border towns have become for the drug cartels , the violence and threats the cartels have been using to intimidate civilians and police alike and how much responsibility the United States has to help our neighbor to the south .
Check out the video below , and tell us :
What do you think should be done about the increasing violence in Mexico ?
Do you think the United States should get more involved ?
I promised to offer two partial solutions to the gap between " Stable at all costs " Perl and " Please join us in the 20th century " Perl in The Two Worlds of Perl Deployment .
The first solution already exists , technically .
I have n't see anyone take advantage of it yet .
First , please read Jess Robinson 's
The two aspects of Perl for a different explanation of the same problem .
( I should have linked this from the first article , because it helped me crystallize my thoughts . )
Localizing Change
One of the most persistent lessons of language design I 've learned from Perl 5 is to avoid change - at - a - distance .
Magical global variables are troublesome in Perl 5 -- not primarily because they can be difficult to read and remember unless you use them all the time , but because they 're global to your process .
One of my favorite features of Perl 6 that people will notice only in the absence of problems is that many of the lovely and useful features of Perl 5 are still present but now have proper lexical scoping .
Autoflush is now a property of output filehandles .
So is the input record separator .
The principle of localizing change applies also to Perl installations .
The Mac OS X Perl upgrade problem comes from two different packaging systems trying to manage the same files .
Similar problems come from upgrading other core modules , such as Scalar : : Util .
Localizing Libraries
While the right long - term solution is Hanging the Core out to DRY and removing everything from the core , a simpler short - term solution exists and works today .
Perl 5 allows you to specify alternate installation paths for Perl libraries -- including core libraries .
This is useful for installing CPAN modules locally when you do n't have root permissions on a box .
You can specify additional directories on the command line with the - I flag , add directories to the PERL5LIB environment variable , add code to the sitecustomize .pl flag ( see the sitelib member of the Config module , or add use lib ' foo ' ; lines to a program .
OS vendors who package and distribute Perl and use it for core utilities should install their core libraries in a specific directory accessible only by their core utilities and they should configure Perl to install modules from the CPAN in another directory where their utilities do not look .
That is , if you distribute Perl as part of an OS or distribution , and you distribute Perl utilities which the system needs to function , you must pay attention to specific library versions and ensure that the proper library versions are available , even if users install newer versions from the CPAN .
Allowing users to install new versions which overwrite old version which an OS version might downgrade or sidegrade invites the type of trouble Apple users have seen lately .
This is merely a configuration problem , though the Perl 5 Porters should provide a simple guide for packagers which explains the solutions .
( Note that pumpking Nicholas Clark has worked on reordering Perl 5 's library search order to ameliorate some problems here . )
Similarly , admins and other Perl users who wish to enforce stability should consider segregating library paths for individual applications as necessary .
A little bit of disk space is a cheap way to reduce unintentional collisions .
Many foreigners are into Russian brides .
They come to Russia in search for a wife or just in search of fun .
But those are mainly foreighn man .
Now there is something that foreighn girls might like too .
Meet the Prince , from Russian dating site .
That ’s what he says about himself : “ My kingdom is growing , but there is no decent cinderella ( without bad habbits ) to be turned into princess by me .
That should be a girl 16 - 20 y.o. ” .
The news about the prince spreaded fast across Russian blogs and now it goes to to the west .
So Russian Prince , anyone ?
The film is not due to be released in the UK until 29 April
A US columnist is out of a job after posting an online review of an illegally downloaded copy of X - Men Origins : Wolverine .
Roger Friedman , who wrote the piece on his regular column , had worked at the Fox news website for 10 years .
Fox News said that the company 's representatives and Friedman " mutually agreed to part ways immediately " .
It said that Friedman 's behaviour was " reprehensible " and that it " condemned this act categorically " .
The journalist wrote in his column on Thursday that downloading the 20th Century Fox film was " so much easier than going out in the rain " .
' Exceeds expectations '
He added : " I doubt anyone else has seen this film .
But everyone can relax .
I am , in fact , amazed about how great Wolverine turned out .
It exceeds expectations at every turn . "
He also joked he might decide to catch up on some other recent films via illegal downloads .
The review of the film , which 20th Century Fox described as a " stolen , incomplete and early version , " was later removed from the site on Friday .
The leaked copy of the film was downloaded an estimated 100,000 times in the 24 hours since it was first posted on file sharing websites , a month before its cinema release .
Fox promised that the source of the film would be prosecuted and said the FBI and Motion Picture Association of America were investigating the leak .
The film is due to be released in UK cinemas on 29 April .

[ For those who came in late : Paula Murray : certified depth and text - only archive of her article , which earned her front - page headline from her editor Derek Lambie in the Scottish Sunday Express on March 8 , 2009 ]
How do you like my headline ?
Please keep in mind that it ’s only a draft , and based in part on the following photo from Paula Murray ’s Facebook profile :
OK , readers , I can hear the cruel laughter and the shocking personal abuse from here and I want it to stop right now .
No , seriously , I want you to stop it right now before we proceed beyond the fold .
I can wait all day , people ….
[ — —— – fold — — — –]
OK , let ’s set a few things straight : -
Though there are no photos of Paula with a man / life - partner of her own that I can find , the description of ‘ spinster aunt ’ is borderline , and ‘ old maid ’ should be withheld until the moment she reaches 51 ( or when her ovaries dry up , whichever comes first ) .-
Though it is not apparent in this photo , Paula does actually have a chin .
A picture of it appears below . -
This second photo should also show that Paula does n’t always wear itty - bitty pigtails in the fashion of mutton dressing as lamb , and is in fact a vibrant and youthful woman .
Who has a chin .
All right then , now that we ’ve set the record straight on a few things and reigned in the personal and really quite shocking abuse of this poor defenceless woman , let ’s get back to the subject of Paula Murray ’s cavalier attitude toward underage drinking …
It would be wrong of me to take a single photo and present it out of context in a way that suggests that Paula Murray is in the habit of providing young children with alcohol , especially when studies have shown that in all but eleventy percent of cases of ‘ drink dealing ’ , the dealers themselves have drinking problems ( though I may have nicked that statistic from somewhere or just made it up , I cant remembers ) .
So let me absolutely clear on this point ; I do not want to suggest that Paula Murray has a drinking problem .
Instead , I ’d much prefer that she did it for me :
–
–
In her attack on Dunblane survivors , Paula Murray castigated and demonised survivors of that tragedy who “ boasted about alcoholic binges ” , which is EXACTLY what she ’s doing here .
Obviously , this is just cherry - picked text , and making a judgement based on these statements alone would be a wrong .
So to back them up , here ’s a series of photos of Paula getting pished with her mates :
Of course , these are all photos from social events , and unless she hangs out with some serious binge - drinkers and enablers , this in itself is no cause for concern .
However , when anyone starts drinking alone as a matter of routine , alarm bells start to ring :
Well , this is clearly unacceptable behaviour for any public defender of moral rectitude .
One can only hope that this behaviour was not conducted while laughing in the faces of the dearly departed ( though , obviously , my assuming / suggesting that it definitely was would be very wrong indeed ) :
Now , let ’s pretend that this is what Elizabeth Smith MSP had to say about it all :
MSP Elizabeth Smith , Scottish
Tory spokeswoman for children , schools and skills , said : “ I have to say personally I ’m not happy .
Some of the things that go up on these websites are very unfortunate and I do n’t think they give a very good picture about the youngsters .
Some of them are in great bad taste and I am quite worried about that .
I feel embarrassed about it and I ’m sure other people do too .
In some cases the people are still really young and you can’t really expect them to have a sense of responsibility .
I ’m sure that when they look back at what they have done in 10 years time they will be cringing with embarrassment . ” ( archive of source )
And to close , let ’s take a look at one last screen capture from Paula Murray ’s Facebook account that appears to show the moment just before she realised that she did n’t even need to log out of Facebook to get her big scoop published on March 8th :
It was after this that she went digging for dirt on Dunblane survivors , perhaps becoming their ‘ friend ’ just long enough to get her hands on what she needed .
What a class act .
I salute you , Paula Murray , and the alcohol - fuelled hydra of hypocrisy you work for .

- UPDATE – Guardian – PCC targets Sunday Express over Dunblane allegations :
The Press Complaints Commission has launched an investigation after the Scottish edition of the Sunday Express ran a front page story alleging survivors of the Dunblane massacre “ shamed ” the memory of their dead friends by boasting about drunken nights out on social networking websites .
A spokesman for the PCC told MediaGuardian .co.uk that the press watchdog had received more than 30 complaints , two of which were from people mentioned in the article , and had launched an investigation under sections one and three of the editors code – a voluntary set of principles newspaper editors have agreed to – which cover breaches of privacy and accuracy .

— What Would You Do? Your Misconceptions Could Cause Further Injury !
Emergencies do not come with warning bells .
They strike at unexpected moments and your response or lack thereof could be the determinant in how things come out in the end .
How much do you think you know about first aid and proper emergency response ?
If you feel unprepared you can take programs associated with a health information technology degree to educate yourself .
Most people think they know quite a lot , but most of what they have learned consists of myths that could actually do more harm than good .
Put yourself to the test and seriously ask yourself : what would you do in these situations ?
1 . A child pulls a pot of boiling water off the stove or sticks their hand on a hot burner
Do you put butter or mayonnaise on the burn ?
Hurriedly remove the child ’s clothing because it is stuck to the burn ?
Get out the ice ?
Those are the common reactions in the case of a burn , but all of them are myths .
Butter , mayo or other types of grease may cause even more damage to tender skin and pulling clothing or other materials stuck to the burn could damage the tissue or pull the skin off completely .
The correct action is to rinse gently with cool water and coat the burn with antibiotic ointment .
If the burn is on a sensitive area of the body such as the face or if there are a lot of blisters , then go to the ER and do not pop the blisters .
You also want to seek medical assistance if a burn completely circles a limb or is larger than your hand .
2. Someone is having a seizure
Do you move them ?
Do you hold them still ?
Do you force open their mouth with your finger or another object , or put something between their teeth ?
Do you simply watch them carefully and time the seizure ?
Again , most of these answers are common first aid mistakes that could lead to injury of the person seizing .
Prying the mouth open or moving them could lead to injuries , such as muscle tears .
The only reason they should be moved is if they are in an unsafe place and will likely fall off something and hurt themselves .
Try to put them on their side and call 911 .
You may want to unbutton the top of their shirt or their belt to help them breathe and try to time the seizure activity .
If the person is a known epileptic , emergency services only need to be called if it lasts for longer than five minutes .
Never hold someone having a seizure unless you are preventing them from injury !
3 . You step in a hole in the yard and sprain your ankle
Is it ice or heat you use ?
Do you prop it up ?
Rush to the ER ?
This is a very common injury that many people blow off without seeking medical attention .
In most cases that is okay , but you do need to know how to treat it and when to seek help .
The biggest problem is remembering when to use ice and when to apply heat .
For an ankle sprain you want to apply ice .
Heat will actually increase the swelling and could slow down the healing process .
If it is painful to put any weight down on the foot then it may be a fracture and you should see a doctor .
4 . You are taking a walk through the woods and someone is bitten by a snake
Do you rip off your shirt and wrap the wound ?
Suck out the poison and spit it on the ground ?
Get out your pocket knife and carefully cut the wound open so the poison can drain ?
You guessed it !
These are all myths that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to more injury than is actually necessary .
If you cut the wound even slightly you may slice tendons or nerves that cause more damage .
Tourniquets often lead to the blood circulation being cut off and could lead to the loss of a limb .
The safest response is to immediately splint the wound or wrap it in something clean and get to the ER right away .
5 . Your nose suddenly starts bleeding
Should you lean forward and pinch your nose ?
Or tip your head all the way back so the blood cannot run out ?
More importantly , how do you know when it is serious enough to seek medical intervention ?
Nose bleeds are not always emergency situations , but they are the source of a major first aid myth .
If you answered that you would lean forward and pinch the nose closed , you were actually correct .
The myth is to tip your head all the way back so the blood cannot flow out , but this could be dangerous with a heavy nose bleed that does n’t stop quickly .
For a nose bleed , lean forward and pinch just underneath the bone .
If the bleeding does not stop within five minutes seek medical attention .
6 . Your three - year - old gets a hold of the Flintstones vitamins and eats the whole bottle
Do you assume children ’s vitamins are safe and they will just be really healthy for a few weeks ?
Do you grab the ipecac from the bathroom and force vomiting ?
Do you simply run to the ER ?
In the case of vitamins , it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible .
Children die every year from an overdose of iron and children ’s vitamins are a main source of iron .
For poisons in general , you want to keep the product that was swallowed and call poison control immediately .
Depending on what was swallowed different actions will need to be taken , so you must remain calm enough to speak clearly and hear what you are instructed to do for the child .
It is now advised that all ipecac be thrown out completely .
It is no longer considered a safe medical intervention , as some poisons can actually be made worse by vomiting .
Also , a patient vomiting can seriously interfere with treatment once they are at the hospital .
7. Someone starts to choke across the dinner table
Do you jump behind them and do the Heimlich maneuver ?
Hand them their glass and encourage them to drink ?
Pat them lightly on the back ?
Your response to someone choking will depend on whether they are able to talk a little bit or if they cannot make any sound .
If they are coughing violently and can speak a little , then it is a partial blockage .
If they can only nod their head and / or are turning blue , then it is a full blockage that does require you to jump up and start thrusting upward around their stomach .
The Heimlich maneuver will force air up through the body and help dislodge whatever is choking the person , but only in the case of a full blockage .
If some air is getting through , then encourage them to continue coughing and stay close by , but you do not need to take action unless they start to have breathing trouble or turn blue .
Do not give them anything to drink , as the fluid will take up what little space is left for air to pass through .
In most cases a partial blockage can be coughed out , but if it becomes a full blockage then once again the Heimlich maneuver will be necessary .
Do not perform the Heimlich on a child less than a year old .
8 . Your child suddenly has an extremely high fever
Do you give them Tylenol and wrap them in a warm blanket to sweat it out ?
Rub them down with rubbing alcohol ?
Put them in a tub full of cold water ?
While there are traces of good advice in two of these options , none of them are the best route to take with a fever .
The biggest myth is that rubbing a child ’s chest or forehead with rubbing alcohol will break a fever .
The child will actually breathe in the alcohol , and their young systems are extremely sensitive to this substance .
It is not healthy for them .
While there may be some truth to the old wife ’s tale of sweating out a fever , it is not a good thing to try with a child .
Sudden high fevers can lead to febrile seizures , so putting them in a cool bath ( not cold ! ) and giving them something like children ’s Tylenol to break the fever ( if they are old enough for medication ) is a better course of action .
If you can not get the fever down or if it goes above 104 Fahrenheit , you should seek medical attention .
How many of these myths did you think were just standard first aid procedure ?
How many missteps might you have made if these things occurred in your home ?
Any of these things could happen and cause minor injuries that do not rise to the occasion of a true emergency , but you never know when something seriously tragic may happen .
The ability to think on your feet and take the safest and most effective course of action is essential , especially in situations where you may be the only person around to help someone in need .
Central bank governor Glenn Stevens has cut rates from 7.25 % last August
The Australian central bank has cut interest rates to a 49 - year low .
The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 3 % .
Most economists had been predicting no change to rates .
" The contraction in the global economy continued during the first few months of this year , " the central bank said .
Australia 's government announced a 42bn Australian dollar ( $ 26.5 bn ; £ 19 bn ) stimulus plan last month as the country faces its first recession since 1991 .
Separately , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) kept its rates at 0.1 % , as expected .
But the Japanese central bank expanded the collateral it will accept in return for loans to commercial banks , now accepting loans on deeds to municipal governments .
The BOJ already buys corporate bonds and short - term debt to help boost the balance sheet of its banks .

Brain plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease Scientists in Scotland say they may have found what causes some Alzheimer 's patients to develop epilepsy .
The amyloid protein , which forms in clumps in patients ' brains , makes nerve cells too sensitive and prone to seizures , tests in mice suggest .
The cells short - circuit and fire too many electrical signals , the Journal of Neuroscience reports .
If true in humans too , which the experts say is likely , it may mean some patients will need different drugs .
A mainstay of treatment for Alzheimer 's is a class of drugs called the cholinesterase inhibitors .
They work by stopping the breakdown of acetylcholine , an important neurotransmitter associated with memory .
Our findings could lead to a rethink of the type of drugs that are given to patients with Alzheimer 's disease
Researcher Professor Tibor Harkany
But an unwanted effect is that this can also increase a person 's susceptibility to seizures .
However , medication to control seizures can also make Alzheimer 's symptoms worse .
A third of Alzheimer 's patients have some degree of epilepsy , posing a treatment dilemma for doctors .
New understanding Researcher Professor Tibor Harkany , of the University of Aberdeen , said he hoped his findings would lead to the discovery of new drugs to treat both problems with fewer side - effects .
He said : " We have shown for the first time the actual cellular process that links epilepsy and Alzheimer 's disease .
" This provides us with a new wave of understanding in Alzheimer 's disease .
" Our findings could lead to a rethink of the type of drugs that are given to patients with Alzheimer 's disease .
" It should be possible to design drugs to tackle the two problems of seizures and cognition at the cellular level because both share common mechanisms . "
Rebecca
Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " One third of Alzheimer 's patients have some degree of epilepsy , and some people who live with the disease are 80 times more likely to suffer seizures than the general population .
" This research builds greatly on our understanding of the connection between the two conditions . "
Neil Hunt , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " These seizures can be extremely distressing for people with dementia and their families .
" This research enhances our understanding of the relationship between epilepsy and dementia . "

The CIA used an arsenal of severe interrogation techniques on imprisoned Al Qaeda suspects for nearly seven years without seeking a rigorous assessment of whether the methods were effective or necessary , according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter .
The failure to conduct a comprehensive examination occurred despite calls to do so as early as 2003 .
That year , the agency ’s inspector general circulated drafts of a report that raised deep concerns about waterboarding and other methods , and recommended a study by outside experts on whether they worked .
That inspector general report described in broad terms the volume of intelligence that the interrogation program was producing , a point echoed in smaller studies later commissioned by then - CIA Director Porter J. Goss .
But neither the inspector general ’s report nor the other audits examined the effectiveness of interrogation techniques in detail or sought to scrutinize the assertions of CIA counter - terrorism officials that so - called enhanced methods were essential to the program ’s results .
One report by a former government official -- not an interrogation expert -- was about 10 pages long and amounted to a glowing review of interrogation efforts .
Advertisement
“ Nobody with expertise or experience in interrogation ever took a rigorous , systematic review of the various techniques -- enhanced or otherwise -- to see what resulted in the best information , ” said a senior U.S. intelligence official involved in overseeing the interrogation program .
As a result , there was never a determination of “ what you could do without the use of enhanced techniques , ” said the official , who like others described internal discussions on condition of anonymity .
Former Bush administration officials said the failure to conduct such an examination was part of a broader reluctance to reassess decisions made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The Defense Department , Justice Department and CIA “ all insisted on sticking with their original policies and were not open to revisiting them , even as the damage of these policies became apparent , ” said John B. Bellinger III , who was legal advisor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , referring to burgeoning international outrage .
Advertisement
“ We had gridlock , ” Bellinger said , calling the failure to consider other approaches “ the greatest tragedy of the Bush administration ’s handling of detainee matters . ”
The limited resources spent examining whether the interrogation measures worked were in stark contrast to the energy the CIA devoted to collecting memos declaring the program legal .
Justice Department memos released this month show that the CIA repeatedly sought new opinions on the legality of depriving prisoners of sleep for up to seven days , throwing them against walls , forcing them into tiny boxes and subjecting them to the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding .
Whether those methods worked is facing independent scrutiny for the first time only now , three months after President Obama banned the CIA from using them .
Advertisement
As part of an executive order shutting down the CIA ’s secret prisons , the White House has set up a task force to examine the effectiveness of various interrogation approaches .
The Senate Intelligence Committee launched a similar review , and began combing through classified CIA cables that describe daily developments in the agency ’s interrogations of prisoners suspected of ties to Al Qaeda .
“ To the best of our knowledge , such a review has not been done before , ” said a Senate aide involved in the investigation .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano declined to comment on the reviews , saying their contents remained classified .
Advertisement
A U.S. intelligence official who defended CIA interrogation practices said that “ productivity was an obvious and important measure of the program ’s effectiveness .
The techniques themselves were not designed to elicit specific pieces of information , but to condition hardened terrorists to answer questions about Al Qaeda ’s plans and intentions .
“ By that yardstick -- the generation of reporting that was true and useful , that led even to other captures -- it worked , ” the official said .
Obama has described the agency ’s activities as “ a dark and painful chapter in our history , ” and senior members of his administration , including Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. , have called the techniques torture .
Defenders of the program , including former Vice President Dick Cheney , have accused Obama of dismantling a capability that was crucial to keeping the country safe .
Cheney also has called for the release of classified documents that he said would show how effective the program was .
Advertisement
Officials said that Cheney was probably referring to memos drafted by leaders of the CIA ’s counter - terrorism center to serve as talking points on the program to use in briefings for members of Congress and White House officials .
Many of those talking points have been cited publicly in recent years by senior government officials , starting with President Bush when he disclosed the CIA ’s secret prison system in September 2006 .
At the time , Bush said that “ alternative ” interrogation methods had been crucial to getting Al Qaeda operatives , including Abu Zubaydah and self - professed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , to talk .
“ I cannot describe the specific methods used , ” Bush said .
“ But I can say the procedures were tough , and they were safe , and lawful , and necessary . ”

By then , Bush administration officials had become concerned with a shifting legal landscape .
Congress had passed new laws on the treatment of detainees , and the Supreme Court issued a ruling that undercut the administration ’s claim that detained terrorism suspects were not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Convention .
But officials said that the first high - level concern about the direction of the CIA ’s interrogation program had come in 2003 , when then - CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson began distributing draft copies of his report on the program across the executive branch .
The document triggered alarms about waterboarding , documenting that it had been employed far more frequently -- including 263 times against two Al Qaeda suspects -- than had been widely believed .
The report also faulted how agency operatives applied the method , dumping large quantities of water on prisoners ’ faces , apparently violating the agency manual and its agreements with the Justice Department .
Nervous about the report ’s implications , then - CIA Director George J. Tenet suspended the use of waterboarding in 2003 .
Advertisement
The document also was critical of other approaches , including sleep deprivation .
But for all of its criticism of the program , the 200 - plus - page document also included passages that have been cited by some as evidence that the interrogation operation was effective .
A May 2005 Justice Department memo noted that the inspector general ’s report described an “ increase in intelligence reports attributable to the use of enhanced techniques . ”
A U.S. intelligence official familiar with its contents confirmed that the inspector general ’s report contains language that is consistent with the assertions by former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden and others that the interrogation program accounted for more than half of the intelligence community ’s reports on Al Qaeda .
But officials said the document did not assess the quality of those reports .
It also did not attempt to determine which methods were yielding the best information , or explore whether the agency ’s understanding of Al Qaeda would have suffered significantly without the use of coercive techniques .
Advertisement
“ Certainly you got additional considerable volume of reporting when you started up with anything enhanced , ” the U.S. intelligence official said .
“ But nobody went back to say exactly what were the conditions under which we learned that which was the most useful . ”
In fact , Helgerson ’s team had steered away from that question by design , the official said , hoping that agency leaders would turn to interrogation experts for a thorough study on which methods were working and which should be discarded .
White House National Security Council officials who saw the inspector general ’s report became concerned with its conclusions , current and former officials said .
Stephen Hadley , then the deputy national security advisor , was particularly persistent on pushing the CIA director to follow up on the inspector general ’s recommendation .
Goss , who had taken the helm at the CIA four months after the inspector general ’s report was filed , eventually complied .
But Helgerson had envisioned a group of experts , perhaps including specialists from the FBI ; Goss turned instead to two former government officials with little background in interrogation .

Gardner Peckham , a national security advisor to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , produced the approximately 10 - page document that praised the program .
It concluded that the program was “ very structured and very disciplined , ” said a former official familiar with its contents , but did not assess the effectiveness of various methods .
A separate report , submitted by John Hamre , a former deputy Defense secretary , was similar in scope and led to no significant alterations of the program .
Hamre and Peckham both declined to comment .
Despite the high - level attention , former Bush administration officials said they never saw the results of the audits that Goss had commissioned .
“ They never came and presented anything to the White House that said in response to the I.G. report they have commissioned a review , ” said one such official .
“ They essentially came back with the recommendations that this was the program and it could n’t be changed . ”

Obama Echoes Bush on Education Ideas
President Barack Obama campaigned on a message of change , but when it comes to K - 12 education , he appears to be walking in the policy footsteps of his recent predecessors , including George W. Bush .
Mr. Obama is sounding themes of accountability based on standards and assessments .
He ’s delivering tough talk on teacher quality , including a call for performance - based pay .
And he ’s promoting an expanded charter school sector .
To be sure , his economic - stimulus package shows he is ready to pump far more money into education than Mr. Bush did .
And Mr. Obama says he opposes private school vouchers , a consistent Bush agenda item .
Still , some observers see little difference between the two so far — and are n’t happy at the similarities .
“ He is operating almost in a straight line from President Bush , ” said Diane Ravitch , an education historian at New York University , who co-writes a blog for edweek.org .
She has criticized core elements of Mr. Obama ’s K - 12 agenda , such as his enthusiasm for the charter sector and what she worries is an overreliance on standardized testing to judge schools and teachers .
Sound Familiar ?
The four most recent occupants of the White House have sounded similar themes on education .

" Accountability , flexibility , tougher standards , a results - oriented system — all of these have got to be out there on the table . "

" All successful schools have followed the same formula : higher standards , more accountability , so all children can reach those standards . "
President Bill Clinton
( State of the Union Address , Jan. 27 , 2000 )

" We will insist on high standards and accountability because we believe that every schools should teach and every child can learn . "
President George W. Bush
( Presidential radio address , Jan. 3 , 2004 )

... [ W ]e will cultivate a new culture of accountability in schools . "
President Barack Obama
( Address to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce , in Washington , March 10 , 2009 )
“ Obama is , in effect , giving George W. Bush a third term in education , ” said Ms. Ravitch , who served as an assistant secretary of education under the first President Bush .
Alfie Kohn , an education author and longtime critic of standardized testing , echoes that assessment .
“ This is what passes for quote - unquote ‘ reform ’ : an intensification of the status quo that reflects the sensibility of politicians and corporate executives rather than educators , ” Mr. Kohn said .
He warns that if Mr. Obama holds to that pattern , his agenda may pose a challenge for some of his natural constituencies .
“ A lot of liberals and those on the left desperately want to believe that Obama represents a qualitative change , not just in education , but in all kinds of domestic and foreign - policy issues , ” Mr. Kohn said .
“ And even as many of them become slowly disenchanted , the political issue becomes : How hard do we push ? ”
But Andrew J. Rotherham , a co-director of the Washington - based think tank Education Sector , argues that the president is sending the right signals , from promoting charter schools to pushing on teacher quality and “ improving accountability , not jettisoning it . ”
He said that even while he believes Mr. Obama ’s critics are wrong to suggest there is little difference between him and Mr. Bush on education , those hoping for a “ radical departure ” will be disappointed .
“ There was a lot of overlap between Bush I and Clinton , and between Clinton and Bush II , ” said Mr. Rotherham , a former aide to President Bill Clinton .
“ Not surprisingly , there ’s going to be a lot of overlap between Bush II and Obama .
“ That says less about any of them per se than the direction education reform has been going for well over a decade . ”
Charting a Course
Analysts caution that it ’s still too soon to know exactly where President Obama will come down on education .
The key , they say , is how the Obama administration translates its rhetoric into action and detailed policy prescriptions .
For instance , how serious will the administration be in enforcing the education accountability demands in the recently enacted stimulus plan ?
How will it seek to define performance pay ?
And what specific changes does Mr. Obama have in mind for the upcoming reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act ?
Leading teachers ’ union officials , at least publicly , sound receptive to most of the president ’s ideas .
Randi Weingarten , the president of the 1.4 million - member American Federation of Teachers , said Mr. Obama has laid out a “ very broad , comprehensive , and thoughtful agenda . ”
The president is wading into touchy territory for the unions with his advocacy of expanding charter schools and promoting performance - based pay , themes he sounded on the campaign trail .
“ I know that these conversations sometimes are uncomfortable for us to have , but we ’re willing to have them , ” Ms. Weingarten said when asked about Mr. Obama ’s discussion of performance pay .
She and other union officials say that Mr. Obama ’s election brought about a critical change that is n’t about policy or money .
It ’s a belief — reinforced by the president ’s public statements — that teachers and their unions will have a seat at the table in policy discussions .
“ He ’s going to listen , ” said Anne T. Wass , the president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association , an affiliate of the 3.2 million - member National Education Association .
“ There was n’t very much trust in President Bush as far as our issues , and very little access . ”
‘ The Same Old Debate ’
The considerable attention President Obama has paid to education since taking office has surprised many observers , especially given the relatively minor role the issue played in the 2008 campaign and the focus on the economic crisis .
The president and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan have made clear that they view the economic - stimulus law , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — with some $ 115 billion in aid for precollegiate and higher education — as a means to launch education plans from improvements in standards and data - collection systems to performance pay .
The unprecedented , one - time infusion of federal aid is being touted not only as a lifeline for schools but also a bargain of more money in exchange for substantive changes .
( " Stimulus Scale Seen as Issue , " Feb. 11 , 2009 , and " First Education Stimulus Aid Flows to States , " April 8 , 2009 . )
Last month , Mr. Obama outlined his education agenda in broad strokes during an address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce , setting the stage with a fairly stark portrait .
“ [ W ] e ’ve let our grades slip , our schools crumble , our teacher quality fall short , and other nations outpace us , ” he said .
Some critics say Mr. Obama was unfairly negative and used flawed information to make his case .
For instance , he said that U.S. 8th graders have “ fallen to ninth place ” in math .
Although the 2007 results for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study , or TIMMS , do confirm that ranking , it was an improvement from the 2003 U.S. ranking of 15th place .
In 1999 , the United States ranked 19th out of 38 nations .
The president appeared to be on solid statistical ground in some other areas , however .
He said that “ just a third of our 13 - and 14 - year - olds can read as well as they should , ” which seems to refer to the 31 percent of 8th graders rated “ proficient ” in the 2007 results for the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
He also lamented the “ stubborn ” — and widely recognized — achievement gap between African - American and Hispanic students and their white peers .
Mr. Obama has been generally consistent in his stated education agenda since taking office , reiterating much that he said during the campaign .
That includes improvement proposals touching on every aspect of the U.S. education system , from early childhood to college and the workplace .
He has trumpeted his goals repeatedly , from his address to Congress in February to a virtual town - hall meeting on March 26 .
But he articulated his vision most extensively in his March 10 speech in the nation ’s capital to Hispanic business leaders .
“ [ W ] hat we get here in Washington is the same old debate ... more money versus more reform , vouchers versus the status quo , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ What ’s required is not simply new investments , but new reforms .
It ’s time to expect more from our students .
It ’s time to start rewarding good teachers , stop making excuses for bad ones .
It ’s time to demand results from government at every level . ”
On the K - 12 front , Mr. Obama called on states to develop stronger academic standards and better student assessments , and urged a move toward common standards across states — a point he did not make on the campaign trail .
He talked of extending the school day and year , and increasing assistance for dropouts .
He promoted efforts to recruit , prepare , and reward teachers .
In addition , Mr. Obama called for more innovation in schools , and pointed to some charter schools as exemplars .
Going beyond his campaign plan to increase federal aid for charters , he also urged states with charter caps to lift them , provided those states ensure “ greater accountability ” and have plans to “ close charters that are not working . ”
The president carefully couched his rhetoric in ways that make it akin to a Rorschach test , with something for almost everyone .
He said he wants “ tougher , clearer ” standards , but also assessments that “ do n’t simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble . ”
He wants more “ effective ” charters , but also tougher action to close those that fall short .
He wants not only to hold teachers accountable , he said , but also to treat them like professionals .
Political Balancing Act
“ Obama has been very artful with this from the very beginning , ” Christopher T. Cross , a veteran education expert who was an assistant education secretary under the first President Bush , said of his ability to deliver multiple messages .
“ There ’s enough in there that , depending on where you sit , you can see something you stand for . ”
As a result , his education vision has managed to appeal to a wide range of education policymakers and analysts .
“ He is saying a lot of things that sound all too familiar to me , ” said former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings , pointing to Mr. Obama ’s backing of teacher incentive pay , charter schools , and high standards to help close achievement gaps .
“ I want to sing right along . ”
John P. Bailey , a former aide to President George W. Bush on education and labor issues , said that while he has been encouraged , it should n’t be surprising to hear familiar themes coming from the new president .
“ What it shows , to me , is there is an emerging consensus around some real bipartisan , center - oriented reforms , ” Mr. Bailey said .
Indeed , leading congressional Democrats on education , including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. George Miller of California , were partners with the Bush administration in drafting the bipartisan No Child Left Behind
Act eight years ago , though they later complained bitterly that Mr. Bush was not willing to fund it adequately .
President Clinton — the previous Democrat to hold the office — was also a champion of standards and accountability , and signed into law major changes to federal policy that helped pave the way for NCLB .
In addition , he was an early and vocal proponent of charter schools , and pushed for new demands on states and districts to improve teacher quality .
For his part , President George H.W. Bush offered an agenda that included advocating national goals and standards across states and providing seed money for “ break the mold ” schools .
Still , the ideas Mr. Obama is embracing do n’t sit well with everyone .
Alex Molnar , an education professor at Arizona State University , said that while he finds merit in some of Mr. Obama ’s plans for early - childhood and higher education , he sees little to like in the current administration ’s K - 12 agenda , whether it ’s the “ fascination with standards and assessments ” or the embrace of charter schools .
“ He ’s just served up a plate of leftovers : leftover ideas , leftover ideology , and I must say , he ’s serving leftovers of food that was n’t very good to begin with , ” Mr. Molnar said .
Ms. Wass of the Massachusetts Teachers Association , said that while she supports many of Mr. Obama ’s plans , she is “ less enthusiastic ” about performance pay .
“ If it means paying individual teachers based on student test scores , ... we would have a hard time ever compromising on that , ” she said .
Secretary Duncan has said test data would be one component of performance - pay plans .
Bruce Reed , the president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and formerly President Clinton ’s chief domestic - policy adviser , argues that the vast sums President Obama has secured for education through the stimulus package will help build the political leverage he needs with unions and others to achieve his agenda .
The administration estimates that the stimulus money will help avert hundreds of thousands of teacher layoffs .
( " As Stimulus Tap Turns On , Districts Can't Escape Cuts , " April 8 , 2009 . )
“ Do n’t underestimate the value of money , especially in these hard times , ” Mr. Reed said .
“ A leader ’s job is to push the envelope and bring everybody along , and that ’s what Obama ’s trying to do . ”
But Frederick M. Hess , the director of education policy studies at the conservative - leaning American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think tank , is n’t so sure what the president will get for all the money being committed .
“ What I see is lots of new money , ” he said , “ and I see a whole lot of ambiguity when it comes to which of these changes are actually going to be anything meaningful . ”

By the time this column appears , Pope Benedict XVI will have left Cameroon for Angola , beginning the second leg of his March 17 - 23 maiden voyage to Africa .
I 've filed close to a dozen stories from Cameroon ( see links at the bottom of this page ) , so here I 'll just offer my dominant after - the - fact impression : I do n't think I 've ever covered a papal trip where the gap between internal and external perceptions has been as vast as over these three days .
It 's almost as if the pope has made two separate visits to Cameroon : the one reported internationally and the one Africans actually experienced .
In the U.S. and many other parts of the world , coverage has been " all condoms , all the time , " triggered by comments from Benedict aboard the papal plane to the effect that condoms are n't the right way to fight AIDS .
In Africa , meanwhile , the trip has been a hit , beginning with Benedict 's dramatic insistence that Christians must never be silent in the face of " corruption and abuses of power , " and extending through a remarkable meeting with African Muslims in which the pope said more clearly and succinctly what he wanted to say three years ago in his infamous Regensburg address , and without the gratuitous quotation from a Byzantine emperor .
Vast and pumped - up crowds flocked to see the pope , and Benedict seemed swept up in the enthusiasm .
Twice he referred to Africa as the " continent of hope , " and at one point , this consummate theologian even mused aloud about a new burst of intellectual energy in Africa that might generate a 21st century version of the famed school of Alexandria , which gave the early church such luminaries as Clement and Origen .
As counter - intuitive as it may seem to Westerners , it was difficult to find anyone in Cameroon -- at least anyone who was n't a foreign journalist or missionary , or an employee of an overseas NGO -- for whom the condoms issue loomed especially large .
The locals had different opinions on whether condoms are the right way to tackle AIDS , of course , but it did n't seem to dominate their impressions of the event .
Bottom line :
Seen from abroad , the trip has been about condoms ; on the ground , it 's felt like a celebration of African Catholicism .
Here 's a surreal experience that underscores the disjunction .
On Tuesday , I prepared a piece on the pope 's indirect , but unmistakable , rebuke of Cameroon 's President Paul Biya -- a former Catholic seminarian who has tried repeatedly to wrap himself in the papal flag while Benedict is in town .
Billboards around Yaoundè assert a " perfect communion " between the two , and colorful African - style shirts and dresses distributed for the trip are festooned with pictures of Biya and Benedict .
Biya is also , however , a classic African strongman , who has ruled Cameroon since 1982 through a blend of occasional repression and constant corruption .
Benedict did n't want to embarrass his host , but he also did n't want the photo - op to imply a papal seal of approval .
Thus , without mentioning Biya directly , Benedict said pointedly that Christians must speak out against " corruption and abuses of power . "
That was enough to set off shockwaves in Cameroon , and it seemed to invigorate local church leaders .
The next morning , Cardinal Christian Tumi , Cameroon 's lone cardinal , publicly asked Biya to withdraw as a candidate in elections set for 2011 , something that previously almost no one would have dared to do .
I was outlining all this in my article when I had to break off to do an interview with CNN International about day one of the trip … which was entirely devoted to the condoms controversy .
To be honest , I had to wonder if we were even talking about the same event .
That said , let me be clear :
This perception gap is not exclusively , or even primarily , the media 's fault .
The reporter from French TV who asked Benedict the condom question aboard the papal plane was well within bounds ; AIDS is serious business , and it's fair game to ask the pope about it on his first visit to the continent that 's been hardest hit by the disease .
Once the question was popped , the ball was in Benedict 's court .
Much of the blame for what happened next , therefore , has to lie at his feet .

By that , I 'm not taking any position on the substance of the pope 's answer , though in fairness he did no more than repeat church teaching on contraception , as well as the nearly unanimous view of every African bishop I 've ever interviewed : that condoms give their people a false sense of invulnerability , thereby encouraging risky sexual behavior .
That may be debatable , but one can hardly fault the pope for taking his cues from the bishops on the ground .
( Ironically , popes usually get in trouble precisely for not listening to local bishops . )
Setting aside what he said , there 's still the matter of whether this was the right time and place to say it -- especially since it would inevitably overshadow the message Benedict was flying to Africa to deliver .
( It 's worth recalling that the pope has been down this road before .
En route to Brazil in 2007 , he took a question about excommunicating politicians who support abortion rights , thereby blotting day one of his first trip to Latin America out of the sky . )
Anybody who 's ever spent time in front of cameras knows how to dance around a question that 's not going to lead anywhere good .
Benedict could have said something like : " Of course the church is deeply concerned about AIDS , which is why a quarter of all AIDS patients in the world are cared for by Catholic hospitals and other facilities .
As far as condoms are concerned , our teaching is well - known , but today is n't the right time for discussing it .
Instead , I want to focus on my message of hope to the African people , " etc. , etc .
The story that probably would have resulted -- " Benedict shrugs off condoms query " -- would hardly have generated a global uproar .
Someone hungry for a silver lining might be tempted to say that the sideshow on condoms made the world pay attention to the Africa trip -- except , of course , it did n't .
Instead , Africa became a backdrop to another round in the Western culture wars .
Yet however one assigns the blame , the fact remains that international discussion of Benedict in Cameroon has left a badly distorted impression of the trip 's aims and content .
If the first rule for assessing an event is to understand what actually happened , then drawing conclusions about Benedict 's African journey is going to require more than simply following the bouncing ball on the great condom debate .

While in Cameroon , I had the opportunity to reconnect with an old friend : Archbishop John Onaiyekan of Abuja , Nigeria , former president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar , and one of the most articulate and forceful leaders of the African church .
Among other things , Onaiyekan was a principal force behind the working paper for the upcoming Synod for Africa presented by the pope on Thursday .
We spoke of many things , but here I 'll pass along the most striking element of our conversation .
Repeatedly , I pressed Onaiyekan to get concrete about what the West ought to do for Africa .
Should we lower trade barriers , for example , or restructure the International Monetary Fund , or perhaps stop signing deals to exploit natural resources with authoritarian governments ?
It was obvious Onaiyekan was reluctant to be drawn onto that ground , though I knew from previous conversations that he favors all of the above .
Finally , I simply asked : " What 's the problem ? "
" The problem is the way you phrased the question , " he said .
" You asked how the West can ‘ help ' Africa .
We 're not interested in ‘ help ' in that sense , meaning that we are exclusively the receivers of your generosity .
We 're interested in a new kind of relationship , in which all of us , as equals , work out the right way forward . "
The most important thing the West can do , Onaiyekan stressed , is not giving increased development aid or more trade , but what he called a " change of mentality " -- including , he said , a change of mentality within the church .
" Let me give you an example , " he said .
" I arrive in Cologne as the Archbishop of Abuja , and I want to meet the Archbishop of Cologne .
The question I ask myself is , ‘ Am I going to meet a brother archbishop ? '
Theoretically , theologically , of course I am .
We are both successors of the apostles , we are both in charge of a whole group of Christ 's faithful .
But when I arrive in Cologne , I have to pass through the whole bureaucracy of the archdiocese before I can get an appointment to see the archbishop , if you are lucky enough to get one .
That already confuses the whole situation .
Even if the archbishop of Cologne wanted to relate to me as a brother , he has to make an extra effort . "
Too often , Onaiyekan argued , church leaders in the West tend to look at developing countries as problems to be solved , rather than as partners in a search for solutions .
He was also clear that the mentality he 's describing is a two - way street ; one can find it , he said , among some African prelates .
" Some of my colleagues go all over the place talking in a very subdued tone , painting a picture of a poor Africa that is totally helpless , " Onaiyekan said .
" They tell long stories of woe and the need to help us , and sometimes they may even exaggerate how bad things are in order to squeeze out a bit of water from the stony hearts of those to whom they are talking . "
" I have never believed in that , never , " he said , emphasizing and drawing out the word " never . "
He said his refusal to come hat in hand " has caused me a bit of problems here and there , but I believe it 's also won me respect . "
Onaiyekan 's vision of how church leaders in the United States and in Europe should think about Africa is this : " It would be natural for the bishops of the Western world to be concerned about what 's happening in the poorer countries , and to listen to the link between their affluence and our poverty .
There is a link , and it is the job of the church all over the world to see how we can do something about this anomaly .
But we must do this as brothers and sisters in one church , not as patrons in the West confronting objects of charity . "

Now for some local color from Cameroon .
1.tAfrican liturgy
Without any doubt , Africans know how to stage a Mass .
Quite aside from its spiritual significance , the liturgy at Amadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaoundè on Thursday was a blast .
It featured some of the most infectious singing , dancing , and music I 've ever witnessed , along with the sensation of being among 40,000 people who were genuinely happy just to be in one another 's company .
The depth of faith felt in that stadium was remarkable .
I was reminded of a similar experience I had in Mexico City , during the canonization Mass of Juan Diego , which also featured exuberant local music and dance .
One hard - bitten agnostic from network TV who was hanging out with me in the press area whispered : " If they did it this way every Sunday , even I would show up ! "
To be sure , African rhythms of worship can take a little getting used to .
Organizers positioned the press corps adjacent to some of those lucky enough to draw seats close by the papal altar .
One minute , they were chiding us for talking too loud and telling us to put out our smokes ; the next , they were gyrating and singing so loudly we could n't hear ourselves think .
Before long , however , we got the hang of it .
Here 's a rave review :
The first bus back to the hotel for the press corps during a papal Mass leaves right after the homily , since that 's usually the " newsy " part of the event .
Generally people get antsy to leave because they have stories to file , but in Yaoundè , the Mass was so entertaining that a few of us lost track of time and almost missed our ride .
2.tDiscovering Cameroon
After a few days in Cameroon , one can begin to understand why many people grudgingly tolerate Biya 's regime , despite its flaws .
Especially by the standards of West Africa , Cameroon is peaceful , tolerant , orderly , and relatively developed .
( One example :
At the papal Mass , I was surprised to discover that my laptop picked up a strong wireless signal , which is more than I can say for some papal events in Europe I 've covered over the years . )
When I say " relatively " developed , however , I mean it .
A case in point came Wednesday , when I bounded downstairs early in the morning , invigorated by a steaming hot shower , to meet my fixer .
( In the business , short - term local hires are called " fixers " ; they do translation , set up interviews , deal with the bureaucracy , and help you get around .
In my experience , when a reporter does not know the language or the culture , the quality of his or her reporting is directly dependent on the quality of the fixer . )
In Cameroon , I was lucky enough to find an outstanding local aide in Serge Massock , an articulate young English teacher and a parishioner at the cathedral in Yaoundè .
That morning , Serge informed me that water service had broken down throughout the city , so most people did n't even have water to drink , let alone bask in the kind of long shower I had in the Hilton .
( That 's the hotel where the Vatican press corps was lodged , and where the press center was located . )
In a similar vein , that night a loud alarm sounded in the hotel .
My wife and I initially thought it might signal a fire , but it quickly went away .
I later learned it meant the hotel 's generator was kicking in , because the power grid in our part of town had gone black .
Looking off our balcony , it was eerie to see an entire city of 1.2 million plunged into near - total darkness , something locals told us is a regular feature of life .
For the record , I did my part to prime the local pump .
When my wife , Shannon , and I arrived at the Hilton after flying 26 hours , we discovered that while I had packed my suit jackets , I had neglected to include the accompanying pants .
The next morning , therefore , I went down to the clothes shop in the hotel lobby and bought a suit .
( As with White House correspondents , journalists on the Vatican beat are expected to dress the part . )
No doubt I paid too much , one sign of which is that the guy who runs the shop seemed to take the next couple of days off .
Nonetheless , as I tried to persuade Shannon : " I 'm not just buying a suit … I 'm buying a story . "
Unfortunately for me , she was n't sold .
3.tA note on language
Pope Benedict called Cameroon " Africa in miniature , " a reference to its sprawling ethnic , geographic , and cultural diversity , and it's also true linguistically .
Aside from more than 200 tribal languages , the country also includes Francophones and Anglophones , speakers of the two principal languages of politics , commerce , and education in Africa .
Both French and English are considered official national languages in Cameroon .
In an attempt to honor that , Benedict XVI typically began his speeches in French , then switched to English before coming back to French .
( As a footnote , this was the first time Benedict pronounced part of a homily in English during a papal trip since Yankee Stadium last April . )
While a noble gesture , the pope 's convention actually misread the social reality .
Linguistically , Cameroon is Canada in reverse .
Canada , too , is composed of Francophones and Anglophones , but there the Anglophones are the majority and many never bother to learn French .
Here Francophones are the majority , and many can't speak English .
Yaoundè is in the Francophone zone , meaning that when Benedict switched to English , many people in his audience had no idea what he was saying .
Alas , the neglect of English also seems to infect the church .
One African bishop jokingly described the way things work in Cameroon 's bishops ' conference : " The Francophones always say that this is Cameroon , and we are a bilingual country … therefore , let 's speak French ! "

Ask around and you 'll find lots of agreement that the Dollar has to collapse , and that gold ( GLD ) will eventually be worth a lot more as people revert to a traditional store of value .
But in the meantime , for all its shiny yellowness , its performance is n't all that impressive .
It was down once again today , and is now 13 % off its recent highs .
But one day , surely gold will reign supreme , right ?
David Goldman thinks not , and argues that it neither serves as an effective inflation hedge nor as a political hedge :
Inflation adjusted , gold still trades around half its 1979 peak .
The 1979 peak was registered , of course , over Christmas of that year , as the Soviet Union marched into Afghanistan , and therein lies a story .
There are lots of ways to hedge against inflation without taking the time and trouble to buy physical gold , which has a number of deficiencies as an asset ( it costs money to store rather than paying interest , it is subject to odd supply and demand shocks such as central bank sales ) .
But there is no way to hedge against a collapse of a superpower such as the United States .
In 1979 most of the world had taken the measure of then President Jimmy Carter and concluded that Russia would win the Cold War .
When Russia marched into Afghanistan , it capped an aggressive campaign by the Soviet Union to assert its influence .
Just as important if less dramatic was the so - called Ostpolitik of Germany ’s Social - Democratic government and the construction of a Russian natural gas pipeline to Western Europe .
...
Everyone should have a bit of gold in his or her portfolio — I own a smidgen of a gold - tracking stock — but there is no reason to dive into the metal .
As long as the world wants to be cash rich , dollar cash will have a bid .
What about inflation hedging ?
Gold and CPI do n’t track particularly well , as the graph below of 12 - month change in CPI and gold respectively makes clear :
Statistical analysis shows that CPI changes predict changes in the gold price , not vice versa .
In other words , you are just as well off using TIPS .
In some respects , gold is the financial equivalent of Pascal 's Wager .
Pascal argued that it made mathematical sense to believe in god , because even if there 's just the slight chance that believing in god will get you into the heaven it 's worth it , since heaven since would be infinitely better than hell .
The problem with this logic is that there are lots of ways to apply this logic .
Which god do you believe in ?
What if they path to heaven is believing in trees , rather than deities ?
Gold may be the same .
It seems like a good thing to to assure that you will prosper in the post - apocalyptic Mad Max world that could one day ensue .
But who knows ?
What if people just want to trade cigarrettes ?
Should you keep some of your portfolio in that , too ?
If you are a smart shopper , it is not that easy to persuade you to actually buy something .
There is the science behind how the products are organized , labels are written and sections are ordered to guide you through to making a purchase .
That ’s a wealth of tricks based on psychological theories and practices that in the end “ convert ” you from a regular visitor into the buyer .
One of the most powerful methods to appeal to a potential buyer is applying color theory to ( e ) commerce .
Has it ever occurred to you why you feel safer in one store and more energetic in another one ?
Have you ever noticed that landing on some web page you feel like clicking some button / link and keep browsing the site ?
While other pages prompt you to stay and keep reading ?
To some extent , this might be the choice of colors for the page elements .
Color is believed to be one of the most powerful elements of design for web sites , direct mail , ads , and other marketing materials .
It carries meaning through associations and / or your body physical response .
Color associates can vary from country to country but in Western culture they are basically the same .
So do n’t let ( online ) sellers affect your decision by showing you what you want to see .
Let ’s see how color choice may affect your shopping behavior and habits – for you to be able to buy with a cool head .
Color Prompts
You to Buy
A regular shopper in North America is likely to respond to color choice the following way :
GROUP COLOR HOW IT MAKES YOU FEEL WHY IT INFLUENCES YOU WHERE YOU ARE LIKELY TO SEE IT warm ( exciting ) Red Energetic , hungry
It activates your pituitary gland and increases your heart rate Logos and calls to action Orange Enthusiastic , cheerful
It is a combination of aggressive red and cheerful yellow Calls to action ( subscribe , buy , etc ) cool ( calming ) Blue Secure and trustworthy
It is associated with sky ( therefore universally liked )
Money and business related websites ( banks , loans , etc ) Green Stable , wealthy ( deep green )
It is the easiest color for the eyes Testimonials , founder ’s story , etc .
Finance related websites ( e.g. Forex related ) Calm ( light green )
It is associated with spring and nature Entertainment and leisure related websites
( based on my other table on color branding )
As can seen from the above table , red and orange colors are most often used to encourage your action , i.e. to prompt you to buy something or subscribe to the newsletter ( and become the customer later on ) .
Green and blue , on the other hand , are “ supporting colors ” that make you feel secure and safe thus entrust the seller with your money .
See how much Amazon.com wants to talk you into buying something using dark and light orange color :
Color Affects Your Shopping Habits
It is also believed that color affects shopping habits .
Look how different shoppers may respond to various colors :
COLOR WHO RESPONDS BEST Red Impulse shoppers Orange Black Blure Budget shoppers Pink Sky blue Traditionalists Rose
Color Depends on the Season
Another way to appeal to your eye is to choose colors on occasion .
Many e-shops change design from season to season to make you feel more at home .
You ’ll see more red / orange designs in autumn , blue / white – in winter and green websites in spring .
Besides , it is a frequently - used trick to change colors depending on the approaching holidays : green and red combination is associated with Christmas ( as they symbolize Christmas tree and Santa Clause ) ; red is often used on St Valentine ’s day ( as that ’s the color of heart and love ) , orange is associated with Halloween because pumpkins are a big part of that holiday ( of course , all the aforementioned associations may vary from country to country ) .
So on visiting a website or store on a holiday and seeing familiar colors , you are more likely to stay as you feel comfortable .

In the dying days of the Bush administration , and a week before Israel launched an aerial bombing campaign , followed by a land invasion of the Gaza Strip , the U.S. military shipped 989 containers of munitions to Israel .
Each container was 20 - feet long with a total estimated net weight of 14,000 tonnes .
The shipment reportedly reached Israel last month at Ashod , 40 kiometres north of Gaza .
The huge arsenal of munitions will replenish those expended in the Gaza War .
According to Amnesty International in the UK , the shipment included white phosphorous .
The international organization says 300 of the containers had been unloaded at Ashod in March by a German cargo ship , Wehr Elb .
" We are sure that the consignment contained arms and munitions . "
We have a strong suspicion that it contained white phosphorous which has been used against civilians in Gaza , " Brian Wood , head of Arms Control Campaign at Amnesty International in London said late this week .
" The cargo ship had been chartered and controlled by US Military Sealift Command .
It left the USA for Israel on December 20 , one week before the start of Israeli attacks on Gaza .
The vessel was carrying 989 containers of munitions , each of them 20 - feet long with a total estimated net weight of 14,000 tonnes , " he said .
" The world community including the Palestinians should be able to know where the remaining 680 containers on board the Wehr Elbe have gone and why the US is not transparent about the final destination of the dangerous cargo .
" A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed to Amnesty International that " the unloading of the entire US munitions shipment was successfully completed at Ashdod on March 22 , " Wood pointed out .
The spokesperson had said the shipment was destined for a US pre-positioned munitions stockpile in Israel , he said .
Under a US - Israel agreement , munitions from this stockpile may be transferred for Israeli use if necessary .
" There is a great risk that the new munitions may be used by the Israeli military to commit further violations of international law , like the ones committed during the war in Gaza , " Wood said .
" Legally and morally , this US arms shipment should have been halted by the Obama administration given the extent of the evidence showing how military equipment and munitions of this kind were recently used by the Israeli forces for war crimes .
Arms supplies in these circumstances are contrary to provisions in US law , " he said .
An independent inquiry into possible abuses of international law by both sides in the Gaza conflict has been launched by the United Nations .
The panel is being headed by Justice Richard J Goldstone of South Africa .
" The victims of this brutal conflict have a right to justice and reparation .
The perpetrators on both sides must be held accountable if there is to be an end to the cycles of violence and impunity that have persisted for so long .
There must be no excuse for either Israel or the Palestinians not to fully cooperate with the inquiry , ' Amnesty 's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director Malcolm Smart said this week .
BAGHDAD 
Vice is making a comeback in this city once famous for 1,001 varieties of it .
Gone , for the most part , are nighttime curfews , religious extremists and prowling kidnappers .
So , inevitably , some people are turning to illicit pleasures , or at least slightly dubious ones .
Nightclubs have reopened , and in many of them , prostitutes troll for clients .
Liquor stores , once shut down by fundamentalist militiamen , have proliferated ; on one block of busy Saddoun Street , there are more than 10 of them .
Abu Nawas Park , previously deserted for fear of suicide bombers seeking vulnerable crowds , has now become a place for assignations between young people so inclined .
It is not that there are hiding places in the park , where trees are pretty sparse ; the couples just pretend they cannot be seen , and passers - by go along with the pretense .
It is a long way from Sodom and Gomorrah , but perhaps part way back to the old Baghdad .
The Baathists who ruled here from the 1960s until the American invasion in 2003 were secular , and more than a little sinful .
Baghdad under Saddam Hussein was a pretty lively place , with street cafes open until 2 or 3 a.m. , and prostitutes plying their trade even in the bowling alley of Al Rashid Hotel .
TIRANA / ZAGREB ( Reuters ) - A giant clock on Tirana ’s highest building is counting down the minutes until the former Stalinist country joins the once - hated NATO alliance this week .
Albania , one of the poorest countries in Europe , is brimming with pride and the prospect of joining the alliance , together with fellow Adriatic state Croatia , at a NATO summit hosted jointly by France and Germany on Friday and Saturday .
Government and parliament buildings have been decorated with the flags of NATO members and street concerts are scheduled .
Every evening , a projector outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha ’s office flashes NATO symbols across the main street , on to what once was the office of communist dictator Enver Hoxha .
“ NATO is a very positive thing .
It will protect our national security and foreigners wishing to invest will know it is safe here , ” said Ilir , 30 , a waiter in the Albanian mining town of Prrenjas .
There is none of this hoopla in Croatia , where joining NATO is almost taken for granted and the real prize remains the more elusive membership in the European Union .
Since Albania applied to join NATO in 1992 , support for membership has steadily risen to 96 percent after NATO ’s U.S. - led campaign halted the Serbian police and army offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999 .
Half a million Kosovo Albanians who fled to Albania were able to return home under NATO ’s protection and NATO troops remained in Kosovo for years to maintain security and the province ’s U.N. administration .
By contrast , NATO stayed on the sidelines during fighting between Croatia and Serbia in the 1990s as Yugoslavia collapsed .
CROATS IGNORE NATO
Analysts said Berisha ’s ruling Democrats were trumpeting NATO to promote the party before the June 28 general election , which the EU will be closely watching for signs of progress .
Observers say Albania has never run a truly free and fair election , and such elections are important for progress toward the EU .
“ The problem with this propaganda pomp is that it tries to represent NATO membership as the antechamber for entering the European Union , almost as good as getting into the EU , ” said columnist and former dissident Fatos Lubonja .
“ This is not the case , as the Europeans insist on making clear to us , but our politicians feign ignorance . ”
Albania has an association agreement with the EU and has yet to apply for membership .
Croatia is ahead and hopes to join in 2011 if it settles a border dispute with Slovenia blocking entry talks .
Both countries already have troops on NATO - led missions abroad , including Afghanistan and Iraq .
Zoran Kusovac , a Balkans strategic analyst , said the expansion had little practical effect for the new members or the alliance , although it was a welcome safety shield for the region still feeling consequences of ethnic wars fought in the 1990s .
“ Neither Croatia nor Albania have geostrategic importance for NATO , they are not seen as part of Russia ’s sphere of interest .
NATO is expanding by inertia to the territory it sees as its own , ” he said .
The lack of any celebrations or even formal events in Croatia was therefore hardly surprising .
Even anti-globalists and NATO opponents were nowhere in sight last week , when parliament approved NATO accession , Croatia ’s biggest international success since becoming independent in 1991 .
“ NATO has a much more symbolic than practical value .
But the important work has already been done , membership is a sign that a country has met certain standards , ” Kusovac said .
Recently helped my colleague to add the missing mysqli_ping ( ) function to PDO object in PHP .
If anyone missed it , here it is :
class NPDO { private $ pdo ; private $ params ; public function __construct ( ) { $ this -> params = func_get_args ( ) ; $ this -> init ( ) ; } public function __call ( $ name , array $ args ) { return call_user_func_array ( array ( $ this -> pdo , $ name ) , $ args ) ; } // The ping ( ) will try to reconnect once if connection lost .
public function ping ( ) { try { $ this -> pdo -> query ( ' SELECT 1 ' ) ; } catch ( PDOException $ e ) { $ this -> init ( ) ; //
Do n't catch exception here , so that re-connect fail will throw exception } return true ; } private function init ( ) { $ class = new ReflectionClass ( ' PDO ' ) ; $ this -> pdo = $ class->newInstanceArgs ( $ this -> params ) ; } }
Recent talk of using nuclear energy to power the oil shale industry on Colorado ’s Western Slope has elicited a wide range of reactions from government officials at what would be the epicenter of such a move — from serious doubt to matter - of - fact support .
In a recent interview , Garfield County Commissioner John Martin said everything should be on the table when it comes to America ’s energy future .
“ Unfortunately , we ’re going to have to have it all or else we ’re going to have to stop consuming energy with such an insatiable appetite , ” Martin told the Colorado Independent , adding that people fear both nuclear power and the impacts of oil - shale production because they ’re focused on less efficient and less safe technologies from the 1970s and ’ 80s .
He also said Rifle - area residents have an unreasonable fear of nuclear power because of an underground nuclear bomb test in nearby Rulison in 1969 .
The possibility of radioactive contamination sparked a lawsuit to stop natural - gas drilling that could dredge up nasty remnants of the Cold War-era contamination .
“ Look at the Rulison blast and all the excitement it ’s caused there and that was in 1969 , when it ’s actually safe and has been monitored since 1969 , but you just mention it and Three Mile Island comes to their vision , as well as Chernobyl , ” Martin said , referring to the past emergencies involving those now - infamous nuclear power plants .
“ What are we talking about ?
Old technology . ”
Martin argues that U.S. nuclear facilities are now state of the art and providing huge amounts of power in Europe , but are being kept off American soil by over - regulation .
“ What we have to do is show that it does work and we have to select the right spots to put it , and it ’s going to have to be close to the grid , ” Martin said .
“ We ’re going to have to make some tough choices and those tough choices are going to be the location of a new atomic power plant . ”
Several recent studies have shown upwards of 10 new coal - fired power plants would be needed to power the still - dormant oil shale energy , which uses extreme heat to extract oil from shale rock and sand .
It ’s estimated nearly a trillion barrels of oil are trapped in the shale of northwestern Colorado , eastern Utah and southwestern Wyoming .
Martin said those estimates of power consumption are based on the oil - shale technology in use when the industry went bust on the Western Slope in the early 1980s , and while he also disputes how much water the industry would consume at peak production , he agrees that ’s really the key issue in any oil shale discussion .
“ There are enough water rights because those water rights were secured [ by oil and gas companies ] and are senior to the water rights that are being used now and are junior , ” Martin said .
“ If they start using that water , that ’s where the issue is .
Everyone that ’s been using that water as junior will lose out . ”
Water , or the lack of it , is one possible glitch in the nuclear solution .
A study by Friends of the Earth Australia indicates nuclear is one of the thirstiest forms of power , requiring 2.3 liters of water per kilowatt - hour of electricity compared to 1.9 for coal , 1.6 for oil , .95 for natural gas , .11 for solar and .004 for wind .
Rifle Mayor Keith Lambert says it ’s really too early to debate how best to power the oil - shale industry , especially since it remains in the testing stages and companies have not fully answered the water question .
“ All of the issues have to be answered before oil shale becomes a viable consumer product in the United States , ” Lambert said .
“ It ’s premature probably to take a position on one particular type of technology or another so far as oil shale .
None of the companies that are in the process of working with oil shale have come to grips with how to make it work economically . ”
The oil extracted from shale would mostly be refined into gasoline to power cars and trucks , a big source of green house gas emissions believed by most scientists to be a major contributing factor to global warming .
Lambert wonders if the push to revive the oil shale industry in the waning days of the Bush administration missed a bigger point .
“ Quite frankly , and this is a throwback to the Bush administration , but if we ’re going to spend all of this money on this technology for extraction of these natural resources , why do n’t we put an equal amount into renewables and an equal amount into new technology for transportation that would allow us to get away from this natural resource or at least augment this natural resource to the point where we ’re not so dependent on it ? ” Lambert said .
Lambert points out that , ultimately , all extractive energy sources will run out , whether in 50 years or 300 .
Rifle , at the heart of a natural gas drilling boom that is off by about 50 percent since last year due to plummeting gas prices , has tried to even out the boom - and - bust nature of the energy industry by investing in renewables .
It boasts the largest municipal solar power plant on the Western Slope and has set aside 200 acres of city land to attract other renewable - energy projects .
“ In Rifle we want to marry the two together , ” Lambert said .
“ We think under the circumstances there ’s room for extractive but there ’s also room for renewables , which is why we ’ve taken the position we have and continue to expand our renewable portfolio . ”
In the old telephone game each person would pass on a phrase to the next person in the chain ; the final phrase might little resemble the first .
An interesting variation appeared in the Phil . Trans .
Royal Society last November :
Here each row is a chain of people passing along a function relating X to Y .
Each person first guesses and is corrected on 50 ( X , Y ) cases , then just guesses on 100 more cases .
The final guesses of the last person become data for the next person .
The final relations are all basically lines , 7/8 with a positive slope , 1/8 with a negative slope .
The lesson ?
When we are mainly rewarded for predicting what others will say on a topic , rather than predicting a more basic reality , our answers become dominated by typical prior expectations ; reality has little influence .
HT to Jef Allbright .
More from that paper :
In situations in which each person ’s response is used to determine the data seen by the next person , people converge on concepts consistent with their inductive biases irrespective of the information seen by the first member of the chain . …
In this experiment , each generation of par ticipants received 50 trials of training on a single function .
On each trial , the value of the stimulus was presented as a visual magnitude , being the width of a horizontal bar on a computer screen .
Participants responded by adjusting the height of a vertical bar and then received corrective feedback .
…
After training , participants responded to 100 stimuli that covered the entire possible range of magnitudes without receiving feedback .
…
Participants were arranged into eight families of nine generations , for each of four conditions .
The conditions differed with respect to the function used to generate the training data seen by the ﬁrst generation of participants : those initial values were drawn either from a positive linear , negative linear or quadratic function , or entirely at random . …
The responses of each participant on 50 of the test trials were taken as the data used to train the participant in the next generation of that family .
…
Across generations all of the initial functions gradually disappeared and transited into only one of two stable functions : positive linear ( 28 out of 32 families ) and negative linear ( 4 out of 32 ) , both with approximately unit slope .

Warren Kimbro , who turned around his life after a murder conviction to become a nationally recognized leader in helping other people do the same , died Tuesday night .
He was 74 .
A relative took him from his home to Yale - New Haven Hospital after Warren complained of chest pains , according to his son Germano .
Warren breathed his last breath at 9:09 p.m. in Yale - New Haven ’s emergency room .
Meanwhile , lawmakers at City Hall were voting in favor a proposal he promoted to help ex-cons have a better shot at landing government - funded jobs .
Perhaps more than anyone else in New Haven , Warren ’s life traced the passionate and sometimes tragic path of a city that conducted the country ’s most intensive antipoverty experiment in the 1950s and 1960s , then regained its idealism as the century turned .
The emergency room where Warren died is up a hill from what was once Spruce Street , where Warren grew up .
Urban renewal bulldozers leveled that one - block road as part of the nation ’s most expensive per-capita effort to turn down slums ( as well as solid working - class streets like Spruce ) and test programs to “ end poverty . ”
On Spruce Street Warren began forming a network of trusted relationships that eventually reached into every ethnic , religious , political and economic corner of the city .
He was predeceased by his beloved wife Beverly .
He is survived by his son Germano and daughter , Veronica ; a brother , Joseph Kimbro ; five grandchildren , and four great - grandchildren .
A lifelong community activist who worked with young people in trouble , Warren briefly joined the Black Panther Party in 1969 out of disgust with the limitations of liberal antipoverty programs for which he worked .
His home on Orchard Street became the local headquarters for the revolution - promoting party .
During that time , under orders from a party superior , he shot and killed Alex Rackley , a Panther wrongly suspected of being a government informant .
The case trial became a national sensation because the government unsuccessfully tried to convict and execute two party leaders , Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins , in connection with the murder .
It became a symbolic forum as well for a debate on whether a black revolutionary could receive a fair trial in America .
It also drew thousands of protesters to New Haven determined to “ burn down Yale ” and the city on Mayday 1970 .
( They did n’t . )
A less noticed aspect of the trial was Warren ’s own role .
A reformer rather than revolutionary by nature , Kimbro confessed to the murder , then spent the rest of his life seeking redemption .
“ Make Time Count ”
In prison he became a model inmate .
He edited an award - winning jailhouse newspaper .
He started a counseling program for fellow prisoners .
A high - school drop - out , he studied at Eastern Connecticut State University through an experimental program for prisoners .
Then he ran a drug - treatment program in Willimantic , Perception House , returning to his cell at night .
“ Do n’t count time , ” began Warren ’s jailhouse motto , printed at the top of his newspaper .
“ Make time count . ”
He did .
His jailers noticed .
For the criminal justice system , it was a brief moment of heady experimentation .
Top government officials sought to expand programs to rehabilitate rather than simply warehouse prisoners .
State corrections commissioner Ellis MacDougall used Warren as a success story , picked up by national media outlets like the David Susskind show , The New York Times and People .
After just four and a half years Warren received a state pardon .
It was the shortest incarceration for murder in Connecticut history .
Kimbro left jail to earn a graduate degree in education at Harvard .
The most remarkable part of his journey was yet to come .
He returned to ECSU as a student dean .
Then in 1983 , back in New Haven , he became the head of a small , struggling program called Project MORE .
Based at the time in the Hill neighborhood , it worked with mostly young men coming out of jail .
The goal was to reduce recidivism by helping ex-cons kick drug habits , train for jobs , find work .
With his vision , his contacts with government leaders , and his gift for inspiring people , Warren built Project MORE into one of the northeast ’s leading “ AICs ” — community - based alternative to incarceration centers .
The very agency that once jailed Warren , Connecticut ’s Department of Correction , would eventually send him millions of dollars a year to work with the state ’s most troubled adult population .
Overall , though , a backlash to the experimentation of the 1960s and 1970s led to a withering of public support for rehabilitation - oriented corrections .
“ If I were arrested today , ” Warren lamented often in later years , I would never get the chances I had back then . ”
That realization doubled his determination to prove that rehabilitation can work , that people who commit crimes deserve second chances like the one he received .
Up until his death , he continued to run and expand Project MORE .
Click here to read about some of his most recent work at Project MORE , which included starting a New Haven shelter for women emerging from prison and launching an AIC in Poughkeepsie , N.Y .
Most recently he helped New Haven ’s DeStefano administration craft a strategy for incorporating into the community waves of ex-offenders being released from jail .
On Dec. 15 he stood alongside the mayor at a City Hall press conference promoting a “ ban the box ” proposal to give ex-cons a better shot a government - funded jobs .
Warren also visited jails and other forums where he inspired young black men with his story , seeking to counter the notion that he was in any way a hero for his actions as a Panther .
He sought to make internal peace with the ghost of Alex Rackley ; he never completely succeeded .
Much of his hometown embraced him as a leader who helped countless young people go straight .
Still , Kimbro continued to encounter unresolved episodes from the Panther period .

Click on the play arrow at right to watch the exchange .
As the years wore on Warren was determined to tell the whole truth of the Rackley case .
He sought to avoid sugar - coating his own actions or those of law - enforcement agencies which regularly broke their own laws to infiltrate and promote violence within dissident groups like the Panthers in order to dismantle them .
Warren eagerly revealed his entire story , warts most of all , in a 2006 book entitled Murder in the Model City : The Black Panthers , Yale , And the Redemption of a Killer ( Basic ) .
A Yiddish Lullaby
I co-authored that book , with Douglas Rae .
In the process I spent more time alone with Warren than with anyone else outside my family .
He opened his soul to me , as well as the compromising files of his past .
He wanted me to know every mistake he ’d made , way back to his unruly behavior at St. John ’s elementary school .
People should n’t see him as a hero , he insisted .
“ Truth be told , ” he said again and again , “ there were no heroes . ”
But there were so many people , from powerbrokers to powerless , broken , convicted drug dealers , who considered Warren an unforgettable part of their lives .
A confidante .
A guide .
A friend .
Someone they could trust , turn to for help , share secrets or laughs with .
I struggled to discover the secrets of that Warren Kimbro .
They did n’t show up in his FBI file or his criminal files .
They did n’t appear in his old love letters or his memories of regret .
They did n’t even emerge from interviews with people whose lives he turned around .
The book failed to capture that Warren .
Only after the book came out did I glimpse those secrets , when we traveled the state to promote the book .
I saw him hush a hall full of tough felons with his story at Webster Correctional Facility in Cheshire .
More than a hundred African - American men drank up his story with wide eyes .
They were in a portion of the jail reserved for inmates about to be released .
After Warren spoke , some shared their fears about returning to “ the life ” back on the street .
They asked his advice for staying straight .
And they showered him with applause .
I saw him melt a library full of bubbes at B’nai Jacob synagogue in Woodbridge .
He sang the Yiddish lullaby his mother used to help him get to sleep as a child in the 1930s .
The women remembered Spruce Street .
They remembered the lullaby , too .
At other libraries , in Litchfield County and in Niantic , I saw Warren convince middle - aged and older small town audiences that people who go wrong can then go right , if given the chance .
In a Channel 30 studio , I watched him transport an interviewer back to a time , and a frame of mind , in which people believed they could make the world better .
( Click on the play arrow for a snippet from that program . )
I watched him impart the same realism - tempered optimism to my students in a Yale political science class as well as high - school students in a class at Hillhouse .
And in stops around New Haven , I ’d inevitably see a beat cop or a teacher or an employee light up just seeing Warren , recalling a door he opened .
In each instance I saw a man who loved people , all kinds of people .
He saw their innate goodness , no matter their failings .
He believed in them , and he got a charge out of helping them .
He understood , deeply , what it means to be human .
Those were his secrets .
Final Gifts
At 74 , Warren continued to run Project MORE at full tilt .
He was in a gift - giving mood in his final weeks .
You had to wonder whether he may have known at an unconscious level that his time was approaching for joining his beloved Beverly .
He delivered expensive presents to Project MORE board members .
Last Friday he emceed a ceremony on the second floor of Project MORE ’s current home on Grand Avenue .
The event honored ex-offenders who completed a series of Project MORE programs focused on anger management , substance abuse , and job training .
They all received certificates and tribute speeches from staffers .
Warren ( pictured at the top of this story at the event ) ordered up another set of plaques for every staff member working at Project MORE .
He and his top staffers gave each one of them a speech , too .
The event ’s keynote speaker was William Carbone , executive director of the state Judicial Branch ’s Court Support Services Division .
In that role , he lobbies the legislature for the money for AICs , then oversees them .
He ended up delivering the final of countless personal tributes Warren would hear in his lifetime .
Given Warren ’s sudden death four days later , it would serve as the substitute for the retirement dinner that would have drawn hundreds upon hundreds of people whose lives he touched in unforgettable ways .
Carbone spoke of the importance of second chances through “ community corrections . ”
Programs at centers like Project MORE cost taxpayers a fifth of the $ 30,000 they otherwise spend every year to lock somebody up , he said .
And the centers have a good track record of reducing recidivism — both lessening crime in the community and helping ex-offenders become productive citizens .
“ Not everybody who gets in the criminal justice system is a bad person , ” Carbone ( pictured at the event ) said .
“ Some bad things have happened to them along the way . ”
That does n’t excuse criminal behavior , he said .
It does mean that often if you “ connect them to the right people … they can change . ”
One of those “ right people , ” in Carbone ’s telling , was Warren Kimbro .
Carbone spoke of spending three decades working to advance community corrections .
At every step Warren walked alongside him , or in front .
He proved in New Haven , at the grassroots , that second chances work .
He proved it well enough that dollars , and other centers , followed .
Warren Kimbro was right .
He was in no way a hero for killing Alex Rackley .
Nothing he did afterwards could restore the life he stole .
But Warren was a hero nonetheless , for how he made amends .
CHEYENNE —
In one month , a Cheyenne teenager sent 10,000 text messages and received about the same — all while her family ’s plan did not include texting .
That means the family ’s provider — Verizon — charged them for each incoming and outgoing text message .
The girl ’s parents , Gregg and Jaylene Christoffersen , thought texting had been disabled , so one can imagine their surprise when they got the monthly phone bill and it asked for $ 4,756.25 .
“ It just hit us like a rock , like you ’re stepping into a bus , ” Gregg Christoffersen said .
The bill was legit .
Dena Christoffersen , 13 , had apparently been sending most of these messages at school .
That ’s more than 300 texts within an eight - hour period every day for the whole month .
Needless to say , it drew attention away from what she should have been doing : paying attention in class .
“ She went from A ’s and B ’s one semester to F ’s in two months , ” Dena ’s dad said .
Hours after the enormous bill arrived , Gregg Christoffersen took a hammer to his daughter ’s phone .
He and Jaylene also grounded Dena until the end of school .
“ I felt really bad , and I have learned my lesson , ” Dena said , with her head down .
Since she lost her phone , Dena ’s grades have gone up , and the texting is down to zero .
As for the phone bill , the family says Verizon has been willing to knock it down to a reasonable level .
The Christoffersens are asking school administrators at Johnson Junior High School to crack down on cellphone use during school .

One patient was able to go for four years without insulin injections
An experimental stem cell treatment has enabled patients with type 1 diabetes to go for as long as four years without insulin injections , researchers say .
A US - Brazilian project with 23 patients found most were able to produce their own insulin after a transplant of stem cells from their own bone marrow .
Even those who relapsed needed less insulin than before .
But writing in the journal JAMA , the team warned the treatment may only work in those very recently diagnosed .
The treatment is designed to stop the immune systems of those with type 1 diabetes , a condition which usually develops in childhood , from mistakenly destroying the cells which create insulin .
To measure its effectiveness , team from Northwestern University in the US and the Regional Blood Centre in Brazil , looked at levels of C - peptides , which show how well the body is producing insulin .
Twenty of the 23 patients who received the treatment became insulin - free - one for as long as four years .
Eight had to return to insulin injections , but at reduced levels .
The treatment did not work in three of the patients , and it was also unlikely to work in patients more than three months after diagnosis of diabetes , said Dr Richard Burt of Northwestern .
This was because by this stage , the immune system had destroyed the body 's islet cells .
It was also unlikely to be have any therapeutic benefits for those with type 2 diabetes , mainly associated with obesity , as these patients still make insulin .
Dr Iain Frame , director of research at Diabetes UK , said : " although this remains an interesting area of research , the importance of a limited extension to this study should not be overstated - this is not a cure for Type 1 diabetes . "
He added : " we would like to see this experiment carried out with a control group for comparison of results and a longer - term follow up in a greater number of people .
" It is important that the researchers look at the causes of the apparent improvement in insulin production and C - peptide levels in some participants .
In particular , it is crucial to find out whether this is associated with the timing of the treatment or possible side effects of it rather than the stem cell transplant itself .
" It would be wrong to unnecessarily raise the hopes of people living with diabetes about a new treatment for the condition on the back of the evidence provided in this study . "

Keyword research is not ( or should n’t be ) just about creating a list of keyword phrases a surfer uses when performing a search .
Using just a few SEO tools to create a keyword list , you wo n’t research much .
The deeper you understand the topic , the richer your content becomes and the more “ occasional ” search referrals ( those you did n’t optimize for ) you are likely to get .
Let ’s take a look at what you should / could pay attention to when analyzing your site core terms :
1 . The core term derived words :
What words of the same root are there ?
How are they used ?
Online dictionaries are the best sources for this information :
Merriam Webster online dictionary lists any word derivations along with most often used word combinations ;
The free dictionary offers a comprehensive list of derived words and definitions for each of them .
2 . Your core term word combinations :
What phrases usually contain the keyword ?
Conventional keyword research tools ( Wordtracker , Google Adwords ) do exactly this : they list word combinations containing your term and rank them by popularity among search engine users .
L3xicon.com is another tool to add to your arsenal : it lists popular word combinations as well related terms and definitions for each word entered .
Keyword Map also lists some generally used keyword phrases as well represents them on a “ map ” .
3 . The core term lexical environment :
What words often accompany your core term in the context ?
How do the contexts differ ?
I did a guest post on researching keyword context last week .
The two most useful tools to do that are :
Search Cloudlet ( reviewed by me previously ) : it generates a tag cloud of words found in SERP for your core term search .
The tag cloud is generated based on words in titles and text snippets .
The search snippet is created based on the search term closest environment ; so by extracting words used in snippets , you get the list of word that are often used in the same context with your core term .
If you set Google to show 100 results per page to give the tool more data to analyze , you ’ll get more accurate results .
Twitter Search : it ’s value is about searching the live conversations and thus seeing your core term as used by your readers and listeners .

4 . The core term synonyms
What words are there of similar meaning ?
How do they differ ?
Synonyms make our writing richer and more varied .
Besides , by using synonyms you cover a broader scope of possible search queries .
Just a few tools to research synonyms include :
When your mission is serving the needy , tough times can be doubly difficult :
More people need help , but you have fewer resources .
Nonprofit organizations -- facing cuts in government aid , investment losses and a decline in donations -- have been experimenting with new ways to stay afloat .
Besides cutting costs and eliminating waste , they 're thinking more creatively about how to use volunteers , garner new donations , strengthen ties with existing donors and create projects that generate additional income .

Make no mistake : Marijuana is an addictive gateway drug .
It imperils Minnesota 's children and threatens public safety in every community .
Marijuana use contributes to assaults , homicides , suicide , child abuse , domestic abuse , motor - vehicle crashes and drowning .
The connection between marijuana and violent crime should not be underestimated .
The violence related to marijuana is n't a result of the effects on the user but rather stems from the money people can make selling and growing the drug .
Violence is part of the trade .
By legalizing marijuana - growing operations and drug traffic , we would invite violence into our communities .
California has permitted medical marijuana for more than a decade .
The president of the California Police Chief 's Association , Jerry Dyer , stated last year , " ... it is our observation that it has been destructive to lives and communities .
Passage of any form of medical marijuana anywhere in our nation is bad public policy and will cause crime and public safety problems . "
In 2006 and 2007 , drug and gang task forces in Hennepin County linked marijuana to assaults and homicides .
In the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center , 45 percent of males arrested for violent crime test positive for marijuana .
Approximately 40 percent of those arrested for property crimes , and 86 percent of those arrested for drug distribution , test positive for marijuana .
We should never lose focus on the immediate connection between guns , gangs , kids and drugs -- and marijuana is frequently the connection .
I have been in law enforcement for 25 years and have seen this firsthand .
When I was captain of the Criminal Investigations Division with the Minneapolis Police Department , we investigated a case involving a man from out - of - state who tried to buy marijuana for personal use .
He unwittingly approached a gang - connected dealer .
The man was shot and killed so gang members could keep his money and the marijuana .

Who Really Rules ?
Who Really Rules ? , by G. William Domhoff , is one of my very favorite books .
But explaining why will take some background .
In the 1950s and 60s researchers were looking at what they called the “ power structure ” in American cities — the people who really pulled the strings and called the shots .
Foremost among them was Floyd Hunter , whose study of Atlanta practically invented the field .
Naturally the whole notion that anyone was pulling the shots behind the scenes in America offended the deans of mainstream liberal political science and so their leader , Robert A . Dahl , set out to defend democracy ’s good name .
He argued that one could only figure out who was in charge by doing careful case studies — looking at controversial decisions and seeing who was involved in making them — that and only that could tell you where true power lay .
And , in his most famous work , Who Governs ? : Democracy and Power in an American City he aimed to do just such a case study in his hometown of New Haven , where his employer , Yale University , resides .
Dahl proposed a theory called pluralism in which no small elect is in charge but power is instead shared across conflicting groups , each marshaling its own resources on the issues it feels strongly about .
Democracy , although perhaps in a more sophisticated form , is vindicated , and the ridiculous notions of a shadowy elite disproven .
As Dahl writes :
It is all the more improbable , then , that a secret cabal of Notables dominates the public life of New Haven through means so clandestine that not one of the fifty prominent citizens interviewed in the courts of this study — citizens who had participated extensively in various decisions — hinted at the existence of such a cabal ; so clandestine , indeed , that no clues turned up in several years of investigation led to the door of such a group .
( 185 )
Of course that was n’t quite true .
Domhoff was skeptical of Dahl ’s results and decided to request access to his source material and reresearch the matter for himself .
In going through Dahl ’s interview notes , Domhoff found these choice comments :
First Informant said that [ contacting the First National Bank ] was essential , that they had to deal with what he called the “ power structure ” if they wanted to accomplish anything .
First Informant kept emphasizing the “ power structure . ”
According to Second Informant , nothing gets done without the First National Bank saying so .
According to him , it is “ at the top of the power structure . ” …
I asked him why … [ and he ] said , “ Just look at who ’s on its board of directors . ” …
He said , “ The bank ’s support is necessary for anything that is done in this town including redevelopment . ”
( Sounds like a quote from Hunter . )
But , of course , Dahl wanted to disprove Hunter , not sound like him , so he never followed up on these leads .
But Domhoff does .
In the intellectual battle over which version of how cities work is more accurate , he scores a decisive victory over Dahl .
He not only takes Dahl ’s method , he also takes Dahl ’s town and indeed his specific case study and shows how the decisions were made by a sinister cabal after all .
And his results are much more convincing .
Dahl , after all , was trying to prove a negative : that there was n’t anyone pulling the strings .
Whereas Domhoff can simply point out who was .
Dahl ’s central case study is the question of New Haven urban renewal .
A bold Democratic mayor , he claims , came into office and proposed a plan , dragging local businessmen and Federal officials along with him to get it done .
Nonsense , says Domhoff .
The plan for urban renewal was drafted by the local chamber of commerce years before .
And when the new mayor got elected , the Chamber of Commerce invited him to lunch and explained the whole thing .
They even told the mayor who to hire to carry the plan out and , in the end , got exactly what they ’d wanted all along .
But Domhoff does n’t simply prove Dahl wrong .
He gives an engrossing case study of how powerful businessmen get things like this done , based on extensive archival research and contemporaneous notes .
And he tells an entire alternative history of American urban renewal , showing how big business turned a plan to build housing for the poor into an excuse to expel them to make room for upscale businesses .
The result is a tour de force : a complete demolition of one of the most influential books of political science , an engrossing case study of how power really operates , and an example of how to do research into the people who , after all , really rule .

KOSMIX , a well - financed Silicon Valley start - up , is often described on blogs and news sites as a search engine that may someday rival Google .
As flattering as that notion may sound , it rankles Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman , the co-founders of Kosmix .
And that ’s not because other start - ups making similar assertions have fallen laughably short of the mark .
It ’s because Kosmix is trying to do something that is quite different from traditional Web search .
“ Search does what it does well , very well , ” Mr. Harinarayan said .
“ I do n’t think we can ever compete with that . ”
Kosmix , he said , is not about finding the best set of documents for a specific keyword or phrase .
Instead , its goal is to “ tell me more about something , ” he said .
For a key word or topic that a user enters , Kosmix gathers content from across the Web to build a sort of multimedia encyclopedia entry on the fly .
For many queries , the results are pretty satisfying and look as if they have been compiled by a human editor , not a computer .
This is the best thing I 've seen in a long while .
Robyn Miller sez : " This is a photo from a Chinese PDF manual .
The manual explains , via text and a lot of fun photos , how to cram as much food as possible on one of those tiny Pizza Hut bowls at the salad bar .
They 're only allowed one trip .
My cousin lives in Beijing .
When he goes to Pizza Hut , he says this is what most people are busy building . "
( Click image for enlargement )
UPDATE : Kurt Groetsch sez : " Two more photos of salad bowl extensions here and here .
They made the rounds of the office when I was working in Beijing . "
Gregory Lam sez : I have a friend of mine who currently lives and works in China , described the same phenomenon here .
" I quote : ' For one price ( I think it 's approximately 20 RMB ) , you get a single trip to the salad bar .
You get a medium - sized soup bowl to put your salad in .
Of course , this is a challenge any structural engineer would love to take upon : putting the most salad you can in this small bowl .
I saw people at the salad bar for 5 - 7 minutes just trying to force more and more salad into their bowl .
The highest salad I saw must have rose 9 inches off the top of the bowl . '
" The reason is , Western food is quite expensive in China .
Pizza
Hut is actually considered to be upscale dining ! "
… the default fate of any politician who publicly considers the legalization of marijuana is to be cast into the outer darkness .
Such a person is assumed to be stoned all the time , unworthy of being taken seriously .
Such a person would be lacerated by the assorted boozehounds and pill poppers of talk radio .
Over and over again , you hear that same justification , " Well , politicians can't publicly support legalizing marijuana or they 'll get voted out of office . "
It 's the first thing casual observers point out to me when I tell them I work on this issue .
Everyone 's gotten so used to saying it and yet no effort is ever made to support the argument .
The idea that " marijuana reform is political suicide " survives on little more than its own presumed legitimacy .
Thus I was disappointed , but not at all surprised , to find Joe Klein at Time magazine saying this same stuff in an otherwise positive piece on marijuana reform :
It sounds so familiar and yet it makes no sense .
Talk radio does n’t rule our politics .
If it did , the top questions in Obama 's online forums would be about his citizenship , not about legalizing marijuana .
Heck , Obama would n’t even be president .
Where is Joe Klein getting this stuff from ?
Obama openly supported several reforms to our drug policy on the campaign trail and no one , not even Rush Limbaugh , said a harsh word about it .
Obama was " caught " on video advocating marijuana decriminalization in 2004 and he got elected president .
Once in office , Obama ordered the DEA to respect state medical marijuana laws and it's easily one of the least controversial things he 's done .
I challenge Joe Klein or anyone else to prove that supporting marijuana policy reform is politically risky .
I can only think of two instances that even approach validating any of this :
1 ) Michael Dukakis 's failed presidential bid in 1988 in which he was successfully portrayed as " soft on crime , " and 2 ) The controversy that arose following Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders ' statement about considering drug legalization .
That was 15 years ago .
It 's 2009 and reforming marijuana policy is the most popular idea on the president 's own website .
Voters are passing state marijuana reform initiatives by incredible margins .
Polls show that a majority of both democrats and republicans agree that the drug war is a failure Either show me one good example of a modern politician paying a price for supporting marijuana reform , or stop claiming that this issue is politically risky .
Maddow annoyed by Dems , flattered by groupies

Rachel Maddow was unknown outside of progressive circles when she began her nightly cable show on MSNBC in September .
Not anymore .
Catching the wave of interest in political news and commentary , the Rhodes Scholar 's mix of smarts and snark and girl - next - door approachability caught ratings fire .
Almost immediately , the Castro Valley native was frequently beating CNN's Larry King in the nightly ratings ( although King had more overall viewers in February ) .
Not bad for somebody who did n't own a television until last week .
It still has n't been turned on , said Maddow , who fears once she starts , she wo n't be able to stop watching .
That has n't prevented her from appearing on late - night TV shows over the past month ( Stewart , Letterman , Fallon ) .
The Stanford University graduate and former activist is back in San Francisco tonight to headline a fundraiser for Mother Jones magazine that is expected to raise $ 100,000 .
We caught up with Maddow , 35 , to talk about everything from what Democrats are doing wrong to how she deals with groupies .
Here are excerpts from the conversation .
Q: You are a proud progressive , yet you regularly take on the left .
What has the Obama administration done wrong so far ?
A : Oh , tons of stuff .
State secrets ?
That was in a San Francisco courtroom , was n't it ?
The judge was so incredulous that the Obama Justice Department folks were going to continue with the Bush administration 's argument that one of these horrible terrorism rendition cases should be dismissed on the basis that the whole idea of it was secret .
Not that a specific piece of evidence was secret , but that the whole idea of the case was about a secret thing .
( And the administration ) dropped the enemy combatant designation , but kept all of the meaningful things about making somebody an enemy combatant .
So there 's been a bunch of important national security / constitutional things where the outcome is confusing at best and a continuation of the Bush administration policy at worst .
Q: How does the president sell his budget , not only to Republicans , but to people in his own party ?
A : The thing that is sort of pathetic and funny is that the people he has most to sell it to is these conservatives who have decided to assert their own power by siding with the Republicans against the president .
If progressives and Democrats want to gnash their teeth about anything right now , do n't waste it on the Republicans , save it for ( Sen . )
Evan Bayh , D - Ind .
Conservative Democrats decided to wait until there was a Democratic president to say that we insist there be fiscal responsibility and no additional deficit spending .
They waited through the entire Bush administration and did n't say anything like that .
Meanwhile , Bush turned a hundreds - of - billions surplus into a trillion - dollar deficit and Evan Bayh did n't say beep .
He had to wait until there was a Democrat in there so he can feel that he can get in opposition .
Q: Why is that ?
Is that a lack of political courage ?
Is it opportunism ?
A : I think it 's a defect in the Democratic Party .
The Democratic Party does n't feel pressured enough by its base .
They feel like the way to show cojones , the way to really to show that they are tough guys , is to take on their party from the right .
So that 's how Evan Bayh is trying to make people remember how to spell his name - is by seeking to be the opposition to Obama in the Senate .
Which would be great for him if he were a Republican .
But the fact that people elected him to go be part of the Democratic majority in Washington and now he 's using that opportunity to essentially empower the Republicans and obstruct the president 's agenda is sort of pitiful .
I think that wo n't happen if the liberal base and if the people who voted in the giant Democratic majority in Washington let him hear about it .
Q: Now that you 're a nightly presence on television , you have developed quite the cult following - from your female fans , mostly .
You 've been in a long - term relationship ( for 10 years next month ) .
How do you feel about your groupies ?
A : It is a delicate balance between being very flattered by it and pretending it 's not happening .
( Laughs . )
I do n't think it 's helpful to dwell on that , because I do n't think it can do anything good to my mind .
So I try not to dwell on it , while also appreciating that people are kind .

Ghlaghghee ( and Me ) in the New York Times
Because it was apparently a slow news week , with nothing else of note to write about , the New York Times asked itself the following question : “ are we at a place in history where a straight single man is allowed to own a cat and not have his sexuality questioned ? ”
Because if decades of Hollywood films have taught us anything , it ’s that the only men allowed to have cats are the token gay male friends of spunky female protagonists .
And Hollywood never lies or stereotypes — it ’s a hotbed of liberal thought , after all — so for a straight single male to own a cat , well , see .
That ’s just weird .
So naturally I had to be contacted for the story , because I am famous on Teh Intarnets for owning a cat ( and for taping bacon to it ) .
And , while not actually famous for the following , I ’m also known to have at least the outward trappings of heterosexuality , which is good enough for the Times ( I was not asked to actively verify my straightness , which probably would have been difficult during a phone interview in any event ) .
Since it was ostensibly a story on single men , I did feel obliged to note that I was in fact married , but since I confirmed to the reporter that I did own a cat before I got married ( the late , lamented Rex ) , she let that one slide .
So here ’s a rather silly article on straight , single men and cats , in which I am quoted and Ghlaghghee is mentioned .
I ’ll note to you that the New York Times actually sent a photographer out to the house , who took pictures of me and Ghlaghghee ( and also of me and Zeus ) , but apparently we did not make the photographic cut , at least for the online version of the article .
Maybe we ’re in the print version .
I ca n’t say .
Now , to be fair to Abby Ellin , the New York Times reporter who contacted me about the story , she was aware this story was , well , fluffy , which prompted the following exchange :
Abby Ellin :
You know , this is n’t Watergate or anything .
Me : Nonsense .
You ’re about to blow this whole “ straight single men with cats ” thing wide open .
I smell Pulitzer .
Abby Ellin :
That ’s not a Pulitzer you smell , it ’s a cat box .
Ms. Ellin was a lot of fun to talk to .
We talked for about twenty minutes about cats and men , which got boiled down to a couple of quotes because that ’s the nature of a feature article with several sources .
So the readers of the article miss me talking at length about the phenomenon of symbolism as it applies to repressed groups , and how these symbols lose their power the more members of a group are allowed to participate in the mainstream public social discourse , and so on and blah blah blah ; I suppose the fact I just went “ blah blah blah ” may be why it ’s not in the actual article .
But , look : these days , the way you know a man is gay is not that he owns a cat , it ’s that he introduces the man standing next to him as his husband .
When you have that option available , prognosticating sexuality via choice of pet seems a bit silly .
Straight men have always owned cats because cat owning is not indicative of sexuality ; it ’s indicative of liking cats .
Straight men have always owned small dogs , too , while we ’re at it .
My grandfather owned a pug .
If you were to have questioned his sexuality , he probably would have popped you in the nose .
Hey , he was an Italian man of a certain age at a certain time .
What are you going to do .
As I went in knowing the subject of the article was silly , I ca n’t complain about the inherent fluffiness of the piece , and I think it ’s a fun piece as these things go .
The only thing I would note is I think the way my section of the article is put together could suggest that I inherently equate heterosexuality with “ strong men ” and homosexuality with shrieking ninnies .
Since I know at least one gay man who is an ex-Navy SEAL , and several others who could kick my flabby ass up and down the street all the merry day long , allow me to suggest this is not a stereotype I go in for personally , merely one I know is out there and am commenting on therein .
Thank you in advance for accepting this clarification , gay men of my acquaintance .
Please do n’t kick my ass .

Sexual violence is unwanted sexual behavior exhibited as a means of gaining power and control over another person .
Sexual violence includes nonverbal , verbal and physical sexual harassment ; sexual assault ; rape ; sexual battery ; and forced sodomy .
Sexual violence occurs most frequently between those who are or have been in an intimate relationship as well as between new or former acquaintances , but it can also occur between strangers in both opposite and same sex encounters .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention divides sexual violence into five categories : a completed sex act without the victim ’s consent , an attempted sex act without the victim ’s consent , abusive sexual conduct , non-contact sexual abuse and unspecified sexual violence .
To satiate their desire for dominance , offenders often seek out victims they perceive to be the most accessible , vulnerable and isolated .
According to the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault , members of the disabled community may be at greater risk of sexual violence than the general population .
A disability is characterized by the CDC as ” limitations in mental or physical function , caused by one or more health conditions , in carrying out socially defined tasks and roles that individuals are expected to be able to do . ”
Disabilities vary from difficulties with mobility to cognitive , visual , hearing or speech impairments .
Perpetrators that prey upon the disabled are typically male , with 88 - 98 percent being known to the victim .
According to the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault , victimization of disabled persons often occurs within the home by health care providers , family members , acquaintances or others with disabilities .
The dynamics involved with having a disability make the already devastating offense of sexual violence even more difficult to bear .
In most cases , the disability in itself creates barriers which prevent the victim from advocating on his or her own behalf .
The perpetrator may have a financial hold or social control over the victim .
There may also be little access to victim support services due to lack of transportation or knowledge , especially in cases that involve the perpetrator being the primary caregiver which would enhance isolation of the victim .
Disabled victims may also have difficulty holding credibility as they may be perceived as less competent when disclosing abuse .
Sexuality also plays a role in that some may view members of the disabled community as asexual beings that are incapable of being sexually abused .
A number of statistics regarding sexual violence within the disabled community are outlined below :
Among developmentally disabled adults , approximately 83 percent of females and 32 percent of males are victims of sexual assault .
Johnson , I. , Sigler , R. 2000 .
” Forced Sexual Intercourse Among Intimates , ” Journal of Interpersonal Violence . 15 ( 1 ) .
15,000 to 19,000 persons with developmental disabilities are raped each year in the United States .
Sobsey , D. 1994 .
” Violence and Abuse in the Lives of People with Disabilities : The End of Silent Acceptance ? ”
Of the developmentally disabled victims , 49 percent will experience 10 or more abusive incidents in their lifetime .
Valenti-Heim , D. , Schwartz , L. 1995 .
The Sexual Abuse Interview for Those with Developmental Disabilities .
One study reported that 40 percent of women with physical disabilities reported being sexually assaulted .
Young , M.E. , Nosek , M.A. , Howland , C.A. , Chanpong , G. Rintala , D.H. 1997 .
” Prevalence of Abuse of Women with Physical Disabilities . ” Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Special Issue . Vol. 78 ( 12 Suppl .
5 ) S34-s3
Among persons with psychiatric disabilities , the rate of violent criminal victimization including sexual assault was two times greater than the general population ( 8.2 percent vs. 3.1 percent ) Hidday , V.A. , Swartz , M. , Swanson , J. , Borum , R. , Wagner , H.R. 1999 .
” Criminal Victimization of Persons with Severe Mental Illness . ” Psychiatric Services 50 : 62-68 .
Only 3 percent of sexual abuse cases involving people with developmental disabilities are ever reported .
Valenti-Heim & Schwartz , 1995 .
The Sexual Abuse Interview for Those with Developmental Disabilities .
Up to 99 percent of women with disabilities who are assaulted know the perpetrator .
Network of Victim and Assistance & Berkeley Planning Associates , 1997 .
It is vital to remember that it can be extremely difficult for any survivor of sexual violence to report the incident or seek assistance .
Victims may carry a stigma believing that they will be blamed for the assault or that they will not be taken seriously .
Members of the disabled community have the additional barriers affiliated with their disability that enhance reluctance of reporting .
Sexual violence is a crime of power and control , not lust or sexual desire .
The Chautauqua County Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault has scheduled a variety of awareness activities throughout National Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April .
For more information , contact Project Crossroads at 483-7718 or the Chautauqua County Domestic Violence / Rape Crisis Hotline at 661-3897 or 800-252-8748 .

Green Lithium Batteries Powered by Genetically Engineered Virus
April 2nd , 2009 by Amiel Blajchman
Researchers at MIT have managed to genetically engineer viruses so that they can build rechargeable lithium - ion batteries in the form of a plastic film .
These new batteries could then be used in anything from cellphones to iPods to the rechargeable batteries in plug - in electric hybrid cars .
As an added bonus , the batteries can be constructed in an environmentally - friendly manner , avoiding toxic solvents and energy - intensive procedures :
“ Because the viruses are living organisms , we had to use only water - based solvents , no high pressures and no high temperatures , ” says Angela Belcher , a materials scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a study coauthor .
Previously , the MIT research team developed a virus that could self - assemble into the negative end of a battery ( the anode ) by coating itself with cobalt oxide and gold .
In a very similar manner , the new virus coats itself with iron phosphate and silver , creating the positive end of a battery ( the cathode ) .
By engineering viruses to self - assemble into the anode and cathode ends of a battery , these new lithium batteries will also be able to be shaped into non-traditional forms using micro-contact printing .
The viruses used in this process are known as bacteriophages ( a type of virus that infects species of bacteria ) , ensuring that the genetic engineering affects a type of virus benign to humans .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States gathered China , India and the world ’s other top greenhouse gas polluters in Washington on Monday to “ make up for lost time ” and lay the groundwork for a U.N. deal to fight climate change .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ( R ) and Singapore 's Minister of Foreign Affairs George Yeo Yong Boon walk out to pose at the U.S. State Department in Washington , April 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
The meeting , which U.S. President Barack Obama called last month , groups countries that produce about 75 percent of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions to find ways to help seal a global warming pact this year .
“ The United States is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , ” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told delegates from 16 major economies as well as the European Union and the United Nations .
“ Climate change is a clear and present danger to our world that demands immediate attention . ”
The meeting , held mostly behind closed doors , was meant to foster political partnership on the climate issue and was not expected to yield specific agreements .
But delegates did discuss technology during the first part of the two - day meeting , including carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , said Dinesh Patnaik , a member of the Indian delegation .
“ It ’s a long term solution .
It ’s not a short term solution , ” he said of CCS technology , which is largely unproven .
Participants said the meeting also confirmed a new U.S. commitment to international climate change diplomacy .
The two - day meeting is meant to pave the way for international talks in Copenhagen in December to forge a follow - up agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , which limits climate - warming greenhouse emissions and expires in 2012 .
Obama ’s goal is to cut U.S. emissions by about 15 percent by 2020 , back to 1990 levels .
The European Union and many environmentalists want the United States to go further .
The major economies forum relaunches a process that began under Obama ’s predecessor George W. Bush , whose initiative drew skepticism from participants out of fear that it would circumvent the U.N. process .
Bush opposed the Kyoto Protocol , saying it would hurt the U.S. economy and unfairly exempted fast - growing economies such as China and India .
Obama , who took over in January , said on Monday : “ Our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . ”
POSITIVE START
Obama , who aims to cut U.S. carbon emissions by more than 80 percent by 2050 , announced a new scientific program called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy , modeled on the U.S. push to succeed in the 1950s space race .
Clinton touched on one sticking point in international talks -- the role that big developing countries should play -- by admitting U.S. mistakes .
“ As I have told my counterparts from China and India , we want your economies to grow ...
We just hope we can work together in a way to avoid the mistakes that we made that have created a large part of the problem , ” she said .
Italian Environment Minister Stefania Prestigiacomo said Clinton ’s words “ erased all doubts ” about the willingness of the Obama administration to support the climate fight .
She told reporters that China , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
“ Usually the attitude of China was more the attitude of a country asking for something , ” she said .
“ This time ( there ) was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . ”
Environmentalists see a U.S. commitment to cut emissions as essential to a global pact and welcome Obama ’s desire to lead after what they view as eight years of lost time under Bush .
But much of Obama ’s ability to move forward in international talks rests with the U.S. Congress , where getting support for a domestic climate bill in the Senate -- which needs 60 votes out 100 to pass a bill -- may be difficult .
“ By working with China and India toward common goals on climate change , President Obama is sending a clear signal to Congress that his administration is committed to addressing global warming , ” Kevin Curtis , deputy director of the Pew Environment Group , said in a statement .
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee said they will postpone this week ’s planned hearings to modify existing energy and climate change legislation so panel members can continue their “ productive discussions . ”
The major economies represented at the meeting include Australia , Brazil , Britain , Canada , China , the European Union , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Korea , Mexico , Russia , South Africa and the United States .
In his 1942 book , Capitalism , Socialism and Democracy , Joseph Schumpeter asked the essential question : “ Can capitalism survive ? ”
His unsettling answer was , “ No . I do not think it can . ”
Schumpeter ’s words were in no way meant to denigrate capitalism , instead he felt “ its very success undermines the social institutions which protect it . ”
History in many ways proved his views prophetic .
The success of capitalism means that many are allowed to do things that have nothing to do with productivity .
And from government and academic elites that frequently seek to undermine the very system that enabled their cushy jobs , to foundations created by capitalist profits that often dismiss same , the commercial success wrought by the pursuit of profit has created an unproductive elite that lives off the very business profits that it regularly casts a skeptical eye on .
Schumpeter was of course talking about a United States that he envisioned post World War II , but his fears then do n’t stray too far from the concerns of many today .
Indeed , he worried that as wars usually accrue to the power of the state , that heavy government spending “ would likely evolve into total government control over investment . ”
So far we ’ve got the stratospheric spending to the tune of a $ 3.6 trillion budget , and from planned investment in everything from green energy to mortgage securities to autos , it seems that the alleged good that comes with government largesse will morph into the bad of government - directed investment .
On the business front , Schumpeter envisioned what would essentially be a two - tier system in which the government would largely stay out of the doings of retailers , laborers and clerks , all the while nationalizing what some call the “ big business ” parts of the economy .
So while the hapless Fed Chairman Bernanke not long ago suggested that bank nationalization would not materialize , a few days later the federal government took an 80 percent ownership stake in Citigroup , the largest bank in the United States .
Federal investment in Citi and other supposed beneficiaries of TARP money was supposed to be passive , but as the New York Times reported last week , the financial institutions that took TARP funds are now being told by their federal minders to among other things “ put off evictions and modify mortgages for distressed homeowners ” , slash dividends , and cancel job offers made to individuals lacking a U.S. birth certificate .
Before Citigroup ’s nationalization the U.S. economy had already been whacked by the nationalization of AIG , once the largest insurer in the world .
And as is well known now , the federal government ’s supposed compassion toward AIG had little to do with saving it , and a lot to do with aiding the banks whose risk was insured by AIG .
So while Goldman Sachs protested that it did n’t need TARP funds , it ’s increasingly apparent that GS and others were the beneficiaries of an AIG bailout that insures greater control from the Commanding Heights over bank and investment bank activities .
Schumpeter saw the investment banker as “ the capitalist par excellence ” for providing capital to entrepreneurs , but in our new economy the investment banker will have to please the political class first , and in ways that likely mean the disruptive entrepreneur will find it difficult to access capital .
If war is the health of the state , then economic crises are its oxygen , and Washington has used what should have been a minor financial hiccup and turned it into an opportunity to greatly expand its footprint .
Schumpeter correctly saw Washington as usually the place for lesser minds .
Along those lines , the previous administration “ blessed ” us with our current Fed Chairman , which means that the man who blinked with regard to Bear Stearns , and as such , helped author our financial problems , will now oversee “ tougher capital requirements for big banks , limits on investments by money - market funds , and the introduction of some mechanism that would allow the U.S. to wind down big financial institutions ” and “ possibly run them temporarily . ”
The irony of a government that fostered our financial destruction overseeing its resuscitation has seemingly never troubled Bernanke , so now the very regulations that failed so impressively when it came to rooting out previous financial mistakes will be expanded .
What ’s rarely asked is how the very people who achieve stature through something called “ pay grades ” could ever successfully regulate those who make millions by gaming those same regulations and regulators .
Once this is considered , it has to be remembered that a bigger regulatory state simply insures that there will be more big failures , and more Bernie Madoffs to contend with .
Regulations , rather than a deterrent when it comes to nefarious activity , actually encourage it for the existence of rules that sharper minds in the private sector will always work around .
Regulations merely tell those eager to cheat or take excessive risks what they ’ll have to comply with while cheating and taking excessive risks .
Better it would be if Bernanke et al were to acknowledge how tragically unequal they are to the task of outsmarting private sector minds .
If so , if the regulatory state shows an appealing modesty with regard to its shortcomings , it can be assured that private individuals , with money on the line , will do for themselves what Washington has never been able to do .
Future Madoffs will be caught long before they can grow big enough to cause international scandals .
And while he was talking about the New Deal , Schumpeter was very troubled by a widespread prejudice against business , one in which private wealth was under a “ moral ban ” alongside public antagonism that would “ make it impossible to accumulate venture capital . ”
Today we have politicians scrutinizing bonuses up and down Wall Street , all the while talking up increased taxes on work and investment engaged in by the “ rich . ”
Simplified , politicians will seek to redistribute wealth away from the vital few , and into the hands of what some deem the “ working classes . ”
Marx and Engels observed in the Communist Manifesto that “ A heavy progressive or graduated income tax ” was a certain way for the proletariat to seize power , and its apparent Washington will try to make taxes even more progressive .
All of the above should be remembered the next time overly sanguine economists talk about economic recovery that ’s either here , or just around the corner .
Indeed , unless the laws of economics have significantly changed , any supposed recovery will be a certain shadow of previous ones seared in our memory .
The federal government has greatly expanded its role in the economy , and as such , future activity will have a flaccid quality if history is any kind of indicator .
Schumpeter may have been early in his suggestion that socialism would win out over capitalism , but this in no way detracts from his visionary predictions .
In much the way that he foresaw , we ’re on a slow march toward socialism ; one that insures a more austere future for rich and poor alike .

Å introdusere unike produkter i en begrenset periode er en av de sikreste måtene å hente inn salg på WooCommerce Store .
Til tross for at den er den mest populære e-handelsplattformen for nettsteder over hele verden , har WooCommerce ikke en innebygd innstilling for denne funksjonaliteten .
Å overvinne denne mangelen er WooCommerce Scheduler - plugin , som lar deg legge til og selge produkter i nettbutikken din i en begrenset periode .
Plugin - en kan brukes til å legge til salgstidsgrenser for eksisterende så vel som nye produkter , ved ganske enkelt å velge datoene mens du redigerer produktet .
Når datoene og tidspunktene er angitt , vises en nedtellingstimer i nærheten av produktet som genererer en opplevd knapphet i kundenes sinn .
Dette stimulerer til at det haster med å kjøpe og dermed eie produktet tidligst , noe som fører til kjøp 7 ganger av 10 !
Å lage produkter med begrenset utgave er også en fin måte å vise frem nyhetsprodukter som er forskjellige fra vanlig pris på WooCommerce Store .
Ikke bare spiller dette på forbrukerens psyke om å ha et unikt produkt som er tilgjengelig i en kort varighet , det puster også kjøpere på gjerdet mot å gjøre et kjøp , ettersom de er overbevist om at disse produktene ikke lenger vil være tilgjengelige etter et gitt beløp av tiden .

Print This Email This " An unregulated state of nuclear anarchy . "
That 's the grim future seen in a recent UK security report ; a future unavoidable unless countries start now in preparing safeguards to protect nuclear materials and knowledge reserves from potential enemies .
" Governments and multilateral organisations must come up with a strategy to deal the impact of the new nuclear age , which will produce enough plutonium to make 1 m nuclear weapons by 2075 , argues Frank Barnaby from the Oxford Research Group thinktank in a paper for the Institute for Public Policy Research , " reported Monday 's Guardian .
" We are at a crossroads .
Unless governments work together to safeguard nuclear energy supplies , the rise in unsecured nuclear technology will put us all in danger , " said Barnaby .
" Without this , we are hurtling towards a state of nuclear anarchy where terrorists or rogue states have the ways and means of making nuclear weapons or ' dirty bombs ' , the consequences of which are unimaginable . "
Barnaby is a nuclear physicist who 's published numerous books on nuclear weapons and non-proliferation .
Because of growing pressure for countries to become " green " and move away from carbon - spewing sources of energy , nuclear power is fast becoming the first choice of many nations , argued Barnaby .
A prior report by Barnaby , " Consequences of a Nuclear Renaissance , " is available online ( PDF link ) .
" Currently , about 42 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent are emitted annually .
If emissions are capped at this level then atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will reach 550 parts per million by 2050  up from todays approximately 370 parts per million , " he wrote .
" According to the scientific consensus , to keep climate change within manageable limits , and prevent the risk of runaway changes , it is essential that global average temperatures rise by less than about 2 degrees centigrade .
This means keeping the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases to no more than 550 parts per million .
" This threshold may be reached by about 2035 unless urgent action is taken .
If nuclear power is to play a significant role in reaching this target it does not have long to do so .
Furthermore , if nuclear power is to play more than a marginal role in combating global warming . "
He warned of this " nuclear renaissance " would spread across developing nations , resulting in greater stockpiles of fuel that could potentially be converted into weapon forms .
" Dr. Ian Kearns , deputy commissioner of the Institute for Public Policy Research 's commission on national security said that an offshoot of combating climate change should not worsen the international security environment , " reported UK's In The News .
" A global nuclear renaissance , if badly managed , could bring enormous complications in terms of nuclear non-proliferation and terrorism , " he said .
" Barnaby says that a shortage of uranium ... could encourage [ countries ] to reprocess fuel and produce more plutonium , " reported the Guardian .
" But he is equally convinced that a nuclear renaissance will lead to fast breeder reactors which produce more nuclear fuel than they use and which could be useful to terrorists . "

With Exxon Mobil Corp.'s ( XOM ) new oil discovery off the coast of Brazil – the latest in a series of such offshore finds and potentially the largest Western Hemisphere discovery in three decades – the South American nation has taken another giant step in its quest to become a global energy superpower .
Exxon 's Azulao - 1 well tapped a reservoir that reportedly contains as much as 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil , says Luiz Lemos , a partner at TozziniFreire Advogados , a Brazilian law firm that represents foreign energy companies .
" This is very huge , ” Lemos told Bloomberg News .
So is the potential benefit for Brazil .
If Lemos ' estimate is accurate , this new Azulao find will rival the nearby Tupi oil field as the largest discovery on this side of the planet since Mexico 's Cantarell field was discovered in 1976 .
Lemos ' estimate is unconfirmed , but Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson described the find in January as " a huge potential resource . ”
Exxon first notified Brazilian regulatory agency National Petroleum Agency that it discovered hydrocarbons in the reservoir , identified as BM - S - 22 , on Jan. 16 .
The world 's largest oil company operates the block with a 40 % stake .
Hess Corp. ( HES ) also holds a 40 % interest and Brazilian state energy company Petroleo Brasileiro SA ( ADR : PBR ) , known as Petrobras , holds the remaining 20 % .
It was Petrobras that first triggered the rush on Brazil 's energy sector when , in November 2007 , the company announced the Tupi discovery – an underwater field that could contain as much as 80 billion barrels of oil equivalent .
Petrobas actually downplayed the findings of the Tupi oil field before announcing last November that the reserve contained between 5 billion and 8 billion barrels of light oil and gas .
Petrobras will begin extract its first crude oil from Tupi on May 1 .
Initial output from the Tupi field is expected to be around 15,000 barrels per day , then rising to 30,000 barrels a day during a later stage of testing , and eventually reaching about 100,000 barrels per day by 2010 , Reuters reported .
If Tupi lives up to analysts ' expectations , it will be very encouraging not just for development of Azulao , but also the Carioca reserve , another massive field expected to hold a large bounty of petroleum .
Last year , Haroldo Lima , the head of Brazil 's National Petroleum Agency , said Carioca could hold 33 billion barrels of oil and gas .
Upon hearing the news , brokers and analysts rushed to tell their clients that Brazil , as one minister put it just months ago , was about to become the " new Saudi Arabia . "
Experts say that even 10 billion recoverable barrels of oil – whether they come from Tupi , Carioca , Azulao , or a combination of all three – would be a remarkable find and enough to catapult Brazil into the world 's oil - producing elite .
Brazil currently has about 12 billion barrels of proven reserves , and could soon find itself nestled between Nigeria ( with 36 billion barrels ) and Venezuela ( 80 billion ) .
Foreign Oil Majors Flock to Brazil
As rich and expansive as Brazil 's oil reserves may be , they are also very difficult to access .
The Carioca field , for instance , is 170 miles offshore , more than 6,000 feet below the surface of the water , and trapped beneath a shelf of salt 500 miles long and 125 miles wide .
There is no question that extraction will be costly , but even at today 's energy prices there 's no shortage of domestic and foreign companies ready to invest big money Brazil 's energy sector .
In fact , Manuel Ferreira de Oliveira , chief executive officer of Portugal 's Galp Energia SGPS SA , said March 4 that production at the Tupi sub - salt oil field in Brazil is viable — despite the slide in international oil prices .
" Production at Tupi is competitive , even at the actual level of oil prices , " Oliveira told the Estado news agency , on the same day that his company released its fourth - quarter earnings .
" The projects in Brazil are going to gain strength this year and the next . "
Exxon said Thursday that it would continue investing in exploration and production at " record levels , ” despite the economic downturn and plunging oil and gas prices that have reduced spending by some competitors .
Exxon will invest $ 29 billion this year , and reiterated plans to invest between $ 25 billion and $ 30 billion annually over the next five years .
The company is currently spending $ 79 million a day to search for oil fields , construct platforms and renovate refineries Bloomberg reported .
China is also looking to become a long - term partner in Brazil .
China Development
Bank last month agreed to lend Petrobras $ 10 billion to help finance deepwater oil exploration off the coast of Brazil .
Oil exploration will be carried out with the participation of Sinopec ( ADR : SHI ) , the Chinese state oil company .
The contract will be finalized within the next two months so it can be signed when Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visits China in May , according to Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Sergio Gabrielli .
In addition to the exploration partnership , the deal signed between Petrobras and Sinopec includes the supply of 60,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the current year .
Petrobras also signed a memorandum of understanding with state company China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000 barrels per day .
Last month , Petrobras announced plans to invest $ 174.4 billion in exploration and production .
Energy demand in Brazil is " already starting to recover , " Petrobras CEO Gabrielli told Reuters during an interview at a Brazilian investment conference .
" Even the fall in demand during the last quarter of 2008 was within a range we could expect for that season . "
In addition to Exxon and Petrobras , the companies that stand to profit the most from Brazil 's energy renaissance are offshore drilling companies such as Transocean Ltd. ( RIG ) and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. ( DO ) , which was recently recommended by Contributing Editor Horacio Marquez in his weekly " Buy , Sell or Hold ” feature .
Devon Energy Corp. ( DVN ) also made headlines last week when it notified regulators that it found traces of natural gas in the Barreirinhas Basin .
Larry Nichols , chief executive officer of Devon Energy , said Monday that prices for natural gas are close to recovering from their recent drubbing .
" When the recession ends and the economy starts booming , we 're going to have less natural gas than we do today and prices are going to spike back up , ” Nichols said .

All day long yesterday , the contrast between the two protests taking place in the City of London could not have been greater .
Around the Bank of England where protesters were kettled by police the atmosphere was febrile , silent except for the clatter of the helicopters and the occasional rising chant : " Whose street ?
Our street ! "
A few hundred feet down the road in Bishopsgate , however , it was a different story altogether , with music , drumming , dancing and face - painting .
Climate Camp , having taken possession of this stretch of London road , proceeded to turn it into a mini-Glastonbury , complete with queues for the toilet and tent cities .
Which made it all the more shocking when , at 7.10 pm , with no warning whatsoever , helmeted riot police suddenly marched towards the crowd and closed off the street .
Clamping together both ends of the protest simultaneously , they trapped several thousand people in the area , and used their batons in several places .
" Why are they doing this ? " said one of the Climate Camp legal observers who , like me , had ended up by chance on the outside of the kettle .
" It 's been completely peaceful all day long , there 's no need for this at all . "
In the scuffles that followed the police action at the Bank of England end where we stood , one policewoman was felled and had to be taken off for medical attention , while we witnessed several protesters being hit and kicked by police holding the line together .
The police slowly moved those outside the line back – using the same technique they had used by the Bank of England of kettling the central group and building up a large gap between them and any other protesters nearby .
Around 8 o'clock one protester , Dave from South Africa , stumbled towards the group : he 'd attempted to sneak round police lines and had , he said , been forced face down into the ground , and had his wrists bent as far forwards as they would go .
In a clear state of shock he said : " The police told me that I was lucky they were n't breaking my wrists , that I would feel this for three days . "
On the left side of his face was a bleeding gash from contact with the road .
The police had initially indicated that they would start to let people out after a couple of hours , but as the night wore on there was no sign of that beginning , and no information from the police .
Observers were increasingly worried about protesters with small children , and the growing cold .
But inside the kettle the mood was , apparently , not too bad .
The Bicycology group carried on playing music , there was a bit of performance poetry , and more dancing .
" About 11 pm , " said one protester , Jenny Hill .
" I started making a sandwich for a friend after the central kitchen had closed , and then discovered stashes of bread and peanut butter and jam , and ended up making about two hundred . "
When the police finally began letting people out , at about 11.30 pm , she was relieved to go home , but like other protesters could not understand the way police dealt with them .
Another protester recounts the way that police at the end forced them out without giving them time to get their tents or belongings , after holding them there for five hours .
" It was all done in a mood of violence , " she said .
" It had been really peaceful all day , so I do n't understand why it had to end like that . "
So it was a long day with a fairly miserable ending .
The legality of the kettle is under scrutiny , and Climate Camp are still going through the process of finding out if there were arrests .
It was never going to be a beautiful sunset , but most people believe it could have ended very , very differently .

Building a new package manager
Ok , so out of frustration with several other package managers out there , I have decided to build a new package manager ( a new distribution as well , but that 's a long time off I think ... i just now got it booting ) .
I 'm writing it in java ( mainly so that it 's more cross platform to all * nix systems that have make support ) .
I am writing in support for makefile based sources , as well as binary packages .
For binary packages you just write a shell script , name it binary.sh and it will be run after the package is untarred .
Binary.sh , and deps.
list are the only files that need to be added to make it compat .
Binary.sh was initially something I started adding to my test packages to give a post make install instructions ( for example with X11 you may want to set up some default configs , instructions for that would be in binary.sh ) .
The key advantage to this system , is that even if there is not a binary available for you system , if there is source you can easily add it , and manage it with this new pm .
Atm , I am calling it jCompile , and I plan to implement it on my own distro whenever I get my distro close to its first alpha .
There was a mini conference on a new bill of rights at Westminster on Wednesday hosted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights .
It was pretty uninspiring , so I ’ve been putting off writing about it .
Henry Porter ’s description is about right : “ a room full of about 40 decent , experienced , intelligent people – academics , lawyers , campaigners and politicians – treating each other with the utmost courtesy while they traded points about a new bill of rights and responsibilities .
It could not have been more removed from the reality of Britain today or the attack on rights and liberties that our society has suffered under this morally and financially bankrupt regime . ”
The government have said they ’re not going to be introducing any legislation on the bill of rights this Parliament so the consultation they launched with the green paper last month will no doubt be a huge waste of time given the near certainty of a Tory victory at the next election .
[ whoops - see below ! * ]
It ’s an unfortunate situation because however you dress it up there ’s something deeply sinister about the state disciplining the population by means of a constitutional list of responsibilities .
Nearly everyone who spoke on responsibilities at the conference explained why they are undesirable , superfluous and legally confused .
The best intervention on the issue of responsibilities , however , was by Keith Ewing who drew our attention to the Soviet Union Constitution of 1977 and the responsibilities it contains , including the responsibility to combat “ anti- social behaviour ” at all times .
I hope Grieve was listening .
It ’s a point I ’d heard Ewing make before at a lecture in March last year .
We ’ve since had the government ’s green paper but a lot of the questions Ewing posed then still have n’t been answered .
In particular , how are we supposed to believe the government that the responsibilities will simply act as a “ reminder ” and that the courts will pay no regard to them even though they are written into an act of Parliament ?
The reason I keep banging on about these resonsibilities is that I 'm concerned that with both the Labour and Tory proposals we 're about to enter the historically unheard of territory of a bill of rights being enacted in a democracy with the aim of giving more and not less power to the state .
Anyway , here is the relevant passage from Ewing ’s lecture which is well worth reading .
What is clear , however , is that when the government is talking about responsibilities it is proposing to make a qualitative leap in terms of the protection of rights and duties .
For what seems to be contemplated is that the citizen will have duties to the State - or Society or the community as a whole - in the words of ministers , terms which in this context are synonymous with the State - and perhaps to each other .
What these duties will be is not yet clear .
Will they include : a duty to work ( if you are on invalidity benefit or if you are a young single parent ) ; a duty not to behave in an anti-social way ( particularly if you live on an estate ) ; and a duty to be a responsible parent and to ensure that your children go to school ?
What about the duty of drug companies to behave ethically ; the duty of utility companies not to rip off the poor ; and the duty of all companies not to exploit agency workers ?
How these duties will be enforced is also unclear .
Are they duties that will be directly enforceable against those who owe the duty , and if so by whom ?
Will they be only indirectly enforceable in the sense that they are to be taken into account by the courts in adjudication under the Human Rights
Act , in which case will they be seen to dilute existing rights ?
Or will they have no legal status whatsoever , beyond being a showcase of existing rights and duties , as the British government tried to negotiate at Nice in 2000 in relation to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ( which was to have the same legal status as the Beano , according to the then Minister for Europe ) ?
But just as it has been impossible to deny the EU Charter of 2000 any legal status ( even before Lisbon ) , so it seems implausible that an Act of Parliament will contain measures to which the courts will be prohibited from having regard .
Responsibilities of this kind are not something we normally associate with liberal democracies , one possible explanation being that it may involve a measure of re-ification of the State .
If we scratch around for long enough , however , it is possible to find a few examples of duties owed by citizens to the State , though they are typically limited in scope , to matters such as the duty to provide military service .
Thus , the Charter of Rights and Responsibilities introduced in Victoria in 2006 states in the preamble that ‘ human rights come with responsibilities and must be exercised in a way that respects the human rights of others ’ , but does not appear otherwise to include anything of substance .
In Spain – however – there are constitutional duties on citizens to pay their taxes , to provide military service , and to work .
Similarly , in Italy there is a duty to pay taxes , a duty to provide military service , and a duty of loyalty to the State .
In France there is a duty to work in the preamble to the Constitution of the Fourth Republic .
But the most famous example of a Constitution dealing with the ‘ Basic Rights , Freedoms , and Duties of Citizens ’ is the 1977 Constitution of the USSR .
Articles 39 – 69 dealt with matters such as the duty to work conscientiously , the duty to preserve and protect public property , the duty to respect the rights and lawful interests of other persons , and to be uncompromising towards anti-social behaviour , the duty to be concerned with the upbringing of children and to train them for socially useful work , and a duty of children to provide for the welfare of their parents .
The Constitution also famously dealt with social and economic rights , as well as less famously with freedom of conscience and religion , freedom of association ( albeit in accordance with the aims of building communism ) , and freedom of assembly and expression ( albeit in accordance with the interests of the people and in order to strengthen and develop the socialist system ) .
* It has been brought to my attention that the meeting was under Chatham House rules , which I was n't aware of having arrived late .
I should n't have tried to quote the minister Michael Wills and so I 've removed the paragraphs in which I did .

What if we 're not looking into the portal of another Great Depression , but we 're looking into the abyss of another Dark Age instead ?
No living person can answer that question .
The answer will not be known for several generations , if there is anyone left who can ask by then .
Roman citizens who posed themselves a similar question began leaving their center of civilization between the first and third centuries A.D. Roman villas are still being discovered as far away as Portugal and Britain .
These were small and self - sufficient homes for two dozen or more people who evidently had a cosmopolitan variety of skills , including farming and husbandry , building , ceramics , stone cutting , plumbing , baking , and brewing .
They built their own civil infrastructure far from official tax collectors and the bread and circuses of urban centers .
It appears that these remote enclaves were successfully inhabited for several centuries after Rome itself was reduced to rubble , and turned into the villages scattered around the countryside today .
We commonly regard our civil infrastructure as solid and durable , but when a natural disaster like a blizzard knocks out our electricity and water supply for a week , we are suddenly confronted with survival conditions .
We have become accustomed to rapid repair and recovery , so we assume the emergency will be temporary , but what if the cause is not natural ?
What if our infrastructure fails due to political disaster ?
All political governments fail .
History shows no exceptions .
Political governments are always founded by force and fraud , rule by force and fraud , and inevitably fail by force and fraud .
Worldwide , political governments are no different , and this time they are all failing at once :
Their 100 % fraudulent monetary system has caught up to them .
The long and sordid history of government central banking is well documented .
Rulers routinely clipped coins and diluted coins with base metals to finance their wars and cheat their creditors in Roman times .
Independent and underground money lenders used honest coin and gained a good reputation , often at risk of theft and murder , and became the first bankers during the Renaissance .
The temptation to rule the people with money was always there , however , best exemplified by the deals struck between the House of Rothschild and European states during the 17th and 18th centuries .
I 've often wondered what was the Bank of England 's stake in the US Constitution .
I suspect the money coining clause has their fingerprints on it .
But their real coup was the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , which turned America 's money supply over to a private banking cartel that included them .
Our reward ?
The purchasing power of the 1913 dollar is now five cents .
Even Roman Emperors could not clip coins that fast .
The Federal Reserve in collusion with the US Treasury has been trying to save the banks that own the Federal Reserve for the last two years .
They can't do it without a massive injection of money from outside the US , but no other country has the money to lend .
So here it ends : Congress authorizes debt , Treasury prints the debt bonds , and the Federal Reserve buys them , with money created out of thin air .
When we have a fixed amount of goods and services and we have a rapidly increasing number of dollars , prices go up and up and up , until the goods are gone and nobody is able to replace them .
Hyperinflation is a common feature of dying states .
Political governments control all of our urban infrastructures , like water , electricity , natural gas , sewage , roads and highways , and communications .
Now imagine that all of these systems begin to break down , one by one , and that there are no parts available to fix them .
What will a condo dweller do when the power goes out , not for five days , but permanently ?
What will happen when sewage runs in the streets because the pumps stopped running ?
What will we eat after the trucks quit delivering food ?
Why should any of that happen ?
Because what we are forced to use as money will no longer buy anything .
None of this is lost on our rulers , of course .
Much as they glow in the warmth of supplication , they will not allow a slave rebellion .
When the existence of the political state is at risk , which it is financially , we can expect all manner of lies and threats , and the use of force wherever they can get away with it .
The government has a large body of trained and blooded killers to enforce obedience for a while , but their dollars will have the same value as our dollars , so their deployment in the cities will only hasten the destruction of infrastructure , strand them there , and leave them to their fate .
Rome had that problem too .
As the Greater Depression unfolds over the next decade or century , what would a prudent survivor require ?
A water supply , sewage disposal , durable hand tools , a wood stove , a dwelling , and a vegetable garden .
A carefully selected library would matter to future generations as well .
What if it 's time to think like a Roman ?

Last week 's damp squib G20 protests have finally thrust an issue into the spotlight - just not the one the organizers or the state might have expected .
Videos of the moments preceding the death of 47 - year - old Ian Tomlinson on his way home from work emerged in quick succession this week .
The Guardian was the first to publish video from an American fund manager which appeared to show a police officer shoving Tomlinson to the ground .
Moments later , Tomlinson had a heart attack and died .
ITN followed up last night with another view of the incident , which appeared to show the same officer striking Tomlinson with his baton before Tomlinson hit the ground .
This morning , further pictures emerged in The Sun of Tomlinson being shoved out of the way by riot police 85 minutes before his collapse .
The emergence of the The Guardian and ITN vids has prompted a ramping up of the investigation into Tomlinson 's death .
Originally , this was being carried out by City of London police , but it has now been taken over by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Last night the commission issued a statement saying it had the details of the Metropolitan Police officer " who we believe appears in the footage we recovered last night , and who appears to make contact with Ian Tomlinson . "
The statement quoted IPCC Commissioner and deputy Chair Deborah Glass saying , " We are pleased that we now have what appears to be valuable information relating to this incident .
Several police officers , including the officer himself have come forward .
It is our intention to interview this officer as soon as possible . "
The Sun 's pictures were accompanied by claims that Tomlinson was drunk , had been pushed aside after refusing to move out of the path of a police van , and did not seem to be intent on heading home .
Police forces have regularly been slammed for intrusive filming of protesters , and even just unwitting citizens going about their everyday business .
At the same time , the Reg has highlighted growing concern about Police and Community Support Officers harassing professional and hobbyist photographers , usually on the grounds of stopping paedophiles snapping children or preventing terrorist reconnaissance .
So privacy activists will feel that the cops have been hoisted by their own petard this time , with professional and amateur snappers deploying video technology exposing allegedly heavy handed policing .
" Cops with nothing to hide will have nothing to fear , " they might argue .
For their part , the authorities will argue that they have a duty to keep tabs on suspicious characters pointing cameras at sensitive buildings , and still need CCTV and cam - toting cops to prevent public disorder and bring those responsible for justice .
That 's a perfectly fair point , and their argument will be strengthened if and when they produce their own footage of the events leading up to Tomlinson 's death .
So far they have n't .
In the meantime , no - one is laying down their cameras . ®
An engineer friend of mine recently wrote me to ask me what the " MBA Job Market " is like .
He is tired of his job and wants to get an MBA at night school so he can " make $ 100 k a year . "
Having gotten an MBA fairly recently ( May 2004 ) , I felt like I had something to say about the topic .
Here 's how I responded to him via email : " There is only an " MBA Job Market " if you deal with on campus recruiting where companies come in looking for MBA students .
Otherwise , you 're just a member of the general job market , with the additional weapon in your arsenal of having an MBA .
Every job hunt is different depending on your location , your focus , your motivation etc ....
I graduated in May and took a few weeks off at first .
I had some interviews while still in town ( notably the one that day we had our water shut off and I wasnt able to shower for it ) I was focused on getting a job in equity research at first , and surprisingly , I was able to get a solid number of good interviews .
I limited my efforts to that area .
Nobody gave me the job though .
I 'm not sure why .
I 'm passionate about the field .
Maybe it was because I did n't have an ivy league MBA and was competing against those who did .
I wasnt worried though because I was living at home for free .
I spent a lot of time remodeling the house with my contractor brother in law .
I studied for the CFA exam a bit ( later failed it in december ) .
Faced with no job , I needed income so I applied for and absolutely aced the interview for a temp job .
An MBA willing to work a temp job is like a gold nugget .
The guy at the temp firm repeatedly called me after the interview to find out exactly what I said and did so he could coach other candidates on how to interview like that .
While I was there , I made like $ 22 an hour and got a good amount of overtime .
But I was hoping to get a real job with benefits and a future .
So I applied at a few places , my current company being one of those .
The position fit really well with what I was looking for , and I had the skills to fit with what they were looking for .
I accepted the job and started in January .
So you can look at it and say that it took me 8 months to get a " real " job , but like i said it was a special case .
I worked for about 2 - 3 months at the temp firm in the meantime .
( They put me at a big investment bank ) .
I guess the way to look at it is , the MBA is no way a " free ticket . " you really have to pay attention to where you 're going and use it as something to help you get there .
It is in no way a " ticket " to a better job .
Another thing to consider : when I got my mba I was 25 years old .
The average age for an MBA graduate is more like 29 .
These people have 4 more years of experience than me , so naturally you 'd expect my salary to fall below the average .
The broad picture is I was making about $ 40 in 2002 before b-school and felt underemployed .
I was bored with what I was doing .
Now I 'm making more like $ 60 - 70 k and I 'm feeling involved , I 'm learning , and I 'm even challenged on occasion .
On the surface this makes the MBA look great , but I know plenty of people making my salary who did n't go for an MBA .
This means that in addition to being paid the same amount as me , they didnt spend $ 50 k on tuition and room and board over the 2002 - 2004 period , and they made lets call it $ 40 k in 2002 - 03 and $ 50 k in 2003 - 04 while I was in school .
So right now they are $ 140 k richer than me .
If I get the same promotions as them for the rest of my life , from a purely financial standpoint the MBA would not have been worth it .
And you know who gets promotions ?
Not the guy with the MBA .
The guy who does the most and impresses the most people , regardless of mba or not .
The guy who is a better perceived worker and leader .
So some charismatic , smart guy will easily outpace me in future earnings power .
Anyway I guess the point im trying to make in slashdot terms is that the MBA is much less " binary " than people think it is .
Its not the guaranteed path to money .
It does n't put you in a different league from other workers your competing against for jobs , in short its no guarantee either way .
Can it be a good tool ?
Sure .
The world is in a state of constant flux though .
Lets say 10 years from now the american monetary system collapses , there is nuclear holocaust , and we retreat to an agrarian society .
Your MBA is worthless .
In fact its a detriment because you dont know how to grow anything .
You spent your time on computers .
Or lets say the Middle East stops exporting oil to the USA .
We would n't be able to live in the Northeast because it would be too cold during the winter .
Your home , most people 's biggest asset , will become worthless .
Canada will move south , we will move south , and society will revert to anarchy .
Those with the most guns will control the food supply and guys like you and me will most likely be shot or trampled trying to cross the border into North Carolina or meet some other unremarkable end .
What will your MBA be worth then ?
In fact , now that I think of it , you 're better off putting your tuition dollars elsewhere .
Take some firearms training courses , some wilderness survival courses and start a subsistence farm .
Convert all of your US dollars into gold and silver .
Do it while you still have time ! "
