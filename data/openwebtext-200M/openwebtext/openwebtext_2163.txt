September 30 , 2000 , Netzarim Junction in the Gaza Strip : France 2 correspondent Charles Enderlin offers the world a front seat on the video shooting of Mohammed al - Durra and his father Jamal .
Targeted , according to Mr. Enderlin 's voice - over commentary , by " gunfire from the direction of the Israeli positions . "
A few seconds later : " Mohammed is dead , his father is critically wounded . "
The France 2 cameraman , later identified as Palestinian stringer Talal Abu Rahma , caught the child killers in the act .

So , it ’s Obama .
Did anyone doubt that , except the Hillary faithful ?
And yes , there were a lot of them , and probably still are , until the news sinks in — a process that wo n’t even begin until Senator Clinton admits that the writing is not only on the wall , but it ’s also being translated into song by a choir full of fat ladies .
The new question is this : is it Obama / Clinton ?
Will the vaunted Unity Ticket come to pass ?
The inside track on it has heretofore been doubtful , believing that the two camps were too divided to come together .
But it ’s still an attractive possibility ; healing the division of the party , possibly making two strides for equal rights at the same time , putting together two powerful personalities to help lead the nation .
So might , as the Spice Girls predicted on their 1996 debut album Spice , “ 2 become 1 ” ?
Is it possible ?
Is it even a good idea ?
Probably not .
And here are seven reasons why :
1. Hillary ca n’t bring the bigot vote to a ticket with a black man at the top .
The bigot vote will go back to listening to Rush Limbaugh , patting themselves on the back for thinking that “ Operation Chaos ” was actually more than hot air , and voting Republican .
Or maybe Libertarian .
2 . The Republicans really , really wanted to run against Hillary Clinton — and not for any reason other than that they think they have a better shot at her , and they know how to beat her .
Hillary brings with her major baggage , and a ready - set attack plan from the right wing , led by talk radio .
This is why the Republicans really wanted to run against Clinton ; they have their guns out , oiled , loaded , and ready to bring to bear .
Whitewater , Vince Foster , even the old threat to the honor of the office ( though the current administration traded what was left of that for Halliburton stock ) — all of it would come out again , and the old hatred would come into play .
That ’s a fire that ’s never gone out — it was just kept embers for the last little while , waiting for the bellows .
3. Hillary Clinton is too much a distraction .
Her profile is too big to play second fiddle .
She was the First Lady for eight years , and one of the most outwardly active ones that America has ever seen .
She did some good things , and she had her failures , but she was very much a part of the Clinton team from 1992 - 2000 , and she ’d completely overshadow Obama and his presidency if she was his VP .
It ’s possible that she ’d be reined in , of course ( and if she gets the Veep nod , count on it ) , but then there ’s the opposite problem — that she would n’t be able to be as effective an aide as the Vice President should be .
And it would never work .
If the primary race proves anything , it ’s that Hillary Clinton does n’t come geared for idle .
She stays in 5th rounding corners into cul - de-sacs .
4. Despite what some primary exit polling might have suggested , it ’s ridiculous to think that anyone who was rabidly pro-Hillary will be pissed off enough to throw their vote to McCain .
It ’s more than stupid — it ’s political suicide .
It ’s the cutting off of one ’s political nose to spite their face .
Anyone that says that they ’re doing such a thing was going to vote for McCain anyway , or else they ’re the same people who claimed that they were going to move to Europe if Bush won a second term .
And here they are , still in America , their flapping gums still writing checks they have no intent to cash .
5 . The Obama campaign has been about “ Change ” from the beginning .
That ’s what the whole “ Yes , We Can ” thing has been about .
Yes , we can change the course of the nation .
Yes , we can change it for the better .
Yes , we can and should change .
But can you have real “ change ” with a Clinton on the ticket ?
Hello , the 90s are calling — they want their leadership back .
6 . Hillary wo n’t be able to serve .
She was barely able to do it even when her position was largely symbolic — when Bill was President , she at one time claimed that “ we are the President ” .
That was when she held no office whatsoever .
Granted , that one quote might have been a slip of the tongue , and at the same time , she was as close to an effective co-leader as we ’ve had since Eleanor Roosevelt .
So maybe she was due .
Whatever the case , supporting the winner of the Democratic Primaries in the interests of the party and ultimately the leadership of the nation is one thing — serving at the pleasure of the President you did n’t get to be is wholly another .
7. Depending on the Spice Girls for the vision of national leadership is almost as bad as hiring a horse - show judge to head FEMA .
Almost . -- Teague Bohlen
When Nine Inch Nails decided to give away their latest album for free , the news soon spread all over the Internet .
However , NiN was not the first , nor will they be the last .
Tens and thousands of artists share their music on Demonoid , The Pirate Bay , Mininova and other BitTorrent sites .
We got in touch with one of them to find out why .
Xihilisk is one of the many artist who use BitTorrent as one of their main distribution platforms , and for a good reason .
BitTorrent makes it possible to reach millions of people at once , at zero cost .
Being a dedicated user of Demonoid , Xihilisk is used to sharing his ( and probably others ) music .
His previous 10 albums are all available for free on BitTorrent .
However , he decided to release his latest album “ EPTwo Special Edition ” , exclusively on the popular BitTorrent tracker Demonoid .
This move seems to be counterintuitive , since an exclusive release on Demonoid will limit the audience .
On the other hand , the album wont be exclusive for a long time .
In fact , it ’s the nature of p2 p and BitTorrent that such releases soon spread to other sites .
We got in touch with Xihilisk to find out what motivates artists like himself to share their music on BitTorrent .
TF : Why did you decide to exclusively release your new album on Demonoid ?
Xihilisk : I ’ve been with Demonoid for a few years , and its always been the first place I go to look for something .
I ’ve been a member of quite a few other private trackers , and still am , but Demonoid has lots of obscure stuff I have n’t found anywhere else .
In terms of it suitability for this release , it has a large user base , and a decent community that seem genuinely interested in listening to music they ’ve never heard of .
TF : What are the benefits of sharing your music on BitTorrent for artist like yourself ?
I ’ve always given away my music for free .
I used to burn off a load of CDRs and hand them out to random people and leave them lying around places , then came myspace , and then the explosion of BitTorrent use .
It seemed like the next logical step .
I was using torrents for a long time before I realized that if people can share major artists via the medium , then why ca n’t I share my own music .
Of course , I knew that quite a few people were already doing this , but its still the most exciting and effective way for me to get my music to people who never would have found it otherwise .
TF : What do you think of the RIAA , and the big music labels , for going after their own customers ?
Xihilisk : Fuck the RIAA .
It sickens me when I hear about somebody getting fined a tonne of cash for downloading a couple of songs off LimeWire ( and sharing them probably without even knowing they were ) .
I understand that copyright infringement exists , but destroying someone ’s life just for getting a few songs off the internet is disgraceful .
What I find most ironic is that you can share thousands of death metal albums online and you ’ll almost certainly never find trouble , but share one Lionel Richie track and they ’ll nail you to a wall .
TF : Do you think the music industry will change in let ’s say the next 5 years ?
How do you want it to be ?
Xihilisk : 5 years ?
What music industry ?
Hopefully , there will only be music .
The Internet is rapidly leveling the playing field for all musicians .
I ’d like to see it where all money hungry labels go out of business , and a true DIY ethic takes over .
You want to get your band noticed ?
Make really good music and the internet will do the rest .
You want to make money ?
Play a load of gigs or forget it .
Trying to get signed these days is a lost cause .
Yes iTunes is doing well , and who knows what tricks the record companies have up their sleeves to stop people getting music illegally , but the fact is that now you ’re very lucky if you can make a living from being an artist .
I ’m more than happy with that fact that many thousands of people have downloaded my albums legally , for free .
And maybe even listen to them !
TF : Thanks , we wish you all the best .
For those who want to check it out , the album can be downloaded at Demonoid .
Xihilisk describes his as experimental indie / electronica , with a hint of chiptune , post rock , metal and several other genres .
On a sidenote , it appears that Demonoid has been inaccessible to Dutch users for a few days .
The block happened after the site did some server maintenance , there is no official explanation yet , but we will post an unpdate as soon as we have more info .
BAGHDAD  Negotiations on a long - term security agreement with the United States are at a stalemate because of American demands that compromise Iraq ’s sovereignty , the Iraqi prime minister said Friday .
“ The Iraqi demands are unacceptable to the Americans , and the American demands are unacceptable to the Iraqis , and the result is that we have reached an impasse , ” the prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , said during a meeting with journalists in Jordan .
“ The Iraqis will not consent to an agreement that infringes their sovereignty . ”
It was the first time that Mr. Maliki had spoken publicly at any length about the agreement , which has been the subject recently of acrimonious and increasingly public debate .
But President Bush , appearing with President Nicholas Sarkozy of France in Paris on Saturday , expressed confidence that the United States would be able to reach a security agreement with Iraq before the current United Nations mandate expires this year .
He said the United States respected the sovereignty of Iraq , adding that his administration would “ accommodate their desires ” and would negotiate “ in a way the elected government is comfortable . ”

When Vaclav Klaus , who has just won reelection as President of the Czech Republic , states that he has comparative advantage over other speakers on the issue of Climate Change , he is trenchantly correct .
Klaus lived under the last large central planning scheme — communism .
He rejects the offer to live under the even more draconian central plan of our time — climate alarmism and environmentalism .
Klaus explained his déjà vu vantage point to over five hundred participants at the 2008 International Conference on Climate Change assembled at Times Square New York City on March 2 – 4 .
Stressing his personally acquired wisdom , Klaus said , " Future dangers will not come from the same source [ communism ] .
The ideology will be different .
Its essence [ environmentalism and climate alarmism ] will , nevertheless , be identical — the attractive , pathetic , at first sight noble idea that transcends the individual in the name of common good , and the enormous self - confidence on the side of its proponents about their right to sacrifice the man and his freedom in order to make this idea a reality . "
" What I see in Europe and the U.S. , " Klaus cautioned , " is a powerful combination of irresponsibility , of wishful thinking , of implicit believing in some form of Malthusianism , of a cynical approach of those who are themselves sufficiently well - off , together with the strong belief in the possibility of changing the economic nature of things through a radical political project . "
Klaus focused on facts that showed that decreases in CO2 emissions in the EU have come about because manufacturing radically disappeared when the communist economy collapsed .
Future decreases appear to rely on miracles or the deliberate pushing of the EU countries back into the Dark Ages .
Carbon dioxide decreases are not normal for growing and prospering civilizations , given current technology .
Most of those assembled would not consider such decreases to be either needed or desirable .
Klaus brought to our attention that the thinking of the climate alarmist is the same as Hayek 's portrayal of central planners in The Fatal Conceit .
He boldly challenged the large assembly , " We have to restart the discussion about the very nature of government and about the relationship between the individual and society .
[ Freedom ] should be the main message of our conference . "
The aim and objective of this stimulating gathering was to collapse the fake " consensus " on human - induced catastrophic global warming .
Achieving this is a necessary step toward turning climate alarmism into climate realism .
The step was taken .
" Consensus " collapsed .
Over one hundred scientists were provocative proof of the absence of " consensus " that has been touted by alarmists .
These scientists presented , exchanged and debated research showing global warming to be mostly natural , definitely moderate and realistically unstoppable .
They held no consensus in their approaches or their results .
Enter the dawn of climate realism .
The New York Times on Tuesday , March 4 , ran an article by Andrew C. Revkin titled " Cool View of Science at Meeting on Warming . "
Written as a criticism , Revkin wrote that " the group … displayed a dizzying range of ideas on what was , or was not , influencing climate . "
That was the very point of the conference .
No " consensus " can be touted when , in fact , so many scientists do indeed dispute what data are meaningful and causative of the highly complex dynamics of climate change .
Several , like Dr. Willie Soon , astrophysicist and geoscientist , displayed data showing the sun to be the more likely driver of temperature variations , as compared to carbon dioxide radiative forcings .
Howard Hayden , physics professor , concluded that astronomical phenomena cause about seventy - five percent of the fluctuations in Earth 's temperature .
The combined effects of all greenhouse gases , changes in surface reflectivity of the sun 's radiation , and other Earthly changes account for no more than about three degrees Celsius of the changes during transitions between ice ages and interglacials .
Hayden provided a repeatable sound bite when asked about computer models that are the basis for alarmist views .
He simply said , " Garbage in ; gospel out . "
Dr. William M. Gray , meteorological researcher for more than forty years , contributed that the deep oceans , not carbon dioxide , are driving climate .
Rather than global warming , Gray believes a recent up - tick in strong hurricanes is part of a multi- decade trend of alternating busy and slow periods related to ocean circulation patterns .
Contrary to mainstream thinking , Gray believes ocean temperatures are going to drop in the next five to 10 years .
Dr. Vincent Gray , knows water vapor to be the principle greenhouse gas as others do .
However , Gray emphasizes that climate models fail to reflect the fact that water vapor is extremely variable .
Gray 's work finds that the global warming claim fails on two fundamental facts : 1 . ) No average temperature of any part of the earth ’s surface , over any period , has ever been made .
2 . ) The sample is grossly unrepresentative of the earth ’s surface , mostly near to towns .
No statistician could accept an “ average ” based on such a poor sample .
It can not possibly be “ corrected . ” Dr. Vincent Gray , a member of the UN IPCC Expert Reviewers Panel since its inception , has written to Professor David Henderson , to support the latter 's call for a review of the IPCC and its procedures .
Gray 's call for such a review ends with these harsh words , " The disappearance of the IPCC in disgrace is not only desirable but inevitable .
The reason is that the world will slowly realize that the " predictions " emanating from the IPCC will not happen .
The absence of any " global warming " for the past eight years is just the beginning .
Sooner or later all of us will come to realize that this organization and the thinking behind it is phony .
Unfortunately severe economic damage is likely to be done by its influence before that happens . "
Dr Roy Spencer , NASA senior scientist , produced recent evidence for reduced climate sensitivity .
Background “ noise ” in climate systems creates temperature variations that are not random .
This " noise " exceeds all of the warming that has been thought to have been made by humans .
Climate models do n't handle clouds and convection in the tropics well .
Precipitation systems interactively regulate the climate system .
Computer models predicting climate change are necessarily flawed .
Spencer releases his new book March 27 , 2008 : Climate Confusion — How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science , Pandering Politicians , and Misguided Policies That Hurt the Poor .
Dr. Robert Balling , professor of climatology , questioned what the increase in global temperature does and does not tell us .
Water vapor and non-solar control seem dominant .
The theory , measurements , and understanding of the greenhouse effect are advancing rapidly , and drastically changing the original predictions from only a few decades ago .
Measured warming has been nowhere near the earlier predictions , and the mathematical models are being constantly revised .
Both Balling and Dr. Ross McKitrick highlighted failings in data collection .
Many temperature stations have been discontinued .
Technology for recording temperatures has changed .
Urban heat - island effects continue .
Data adjustments made by alarmists appear biased .
Dennis T. Avery , and co-author S. Fred Singer , wrote Unstoppable Global Warming — Every 1,500 Years
They presented their findings and stressed , " Most of our modern warming occurred before 1940 , before much human - emitted CO2 .
The net warming since 1940 is a minuscule 0.2 degree C  with no warming at all in the last nine years .
The Greenhouse Theory can't explain these realities , but the 1,500 - year cycle does . "
The cycle is solar induced .
Ice cores show sun , not humans , controlling Earth 's climate .
So , no consensuses surfaced .
None need exist when the subjects are scientific .
Hypotheses and theories should continue to be tested .
By different skeptical approaches each scientist at this gathering proved he was courageous .
Why courageous ?
Because , to be a climate change skeptic is political - funding suicide .
Few feel they can step forward before they retire .
Many , even when gathered together and taking courage from the presence of so many others , felt they had to step away from being in group pictures .
Those are choices .
They are respected .
Debunking the false " consensus " position of climate alarmists did n't end with the mere conclusion of the conference .
Several synchronous efforts include : A Manhattan Declaration on Climate Change .
It was endorsed by scientists and researchers .
The document stated clearly that " Global warming " is not a global crisis .
This tangible product with many signatories declared among other points :
That attempts by governments to inflict taxes and costly regulations on industry and individual citizens with the aim of reducing emissions of CO2 will pointlessly curtail the prosperity of the West and progress of developing nations without affecting climate ; the furtherance of the nascent International Climate Science Coalition ( ICSC ) publication of a current and future Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change report ( NIPCC ) a new journal on climate science ; making video presentations from the conference online ; making audio CDs of either a session or the complete conference available ; enlistment of interested parties into a speakers bureau ; and a 2009 London conference being planned .
This agenda is aggressive , necessary , and appreciated .
Hopefully there will be many others who step up , especially in response to Vaclav Klaus ' plea that we recognize that the issue has never been global climate cooling or global climate warming .
It has always and ever been about political power and control of earth 's population .
For over seventeen years I have witnessed at United Nations international gatherings so much ego , money and meeting time being poured into this global central plan to ration energy — to control carbon dioxide by controlling people .
To control people by controlling carbon dioxide .
To brand the stuff of life — carbon — a deadly pollutant .
Political , activist and business careers , especially legal careers , now depend upon creating this new bureaucratic global layer of rules and regulations .
The new - age rulers want the wealth and power that will accrue to them as they impose their centralized , consummate plans upon us .
The Czech Republic 's President stands firm , honoring the lives and liberties of his citizenry against this particular brand of fresh oppression .
Would that these United States had such a courageous leader .

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) today announced its financial aid program for 2008 - 2009 .
Increases in financial aid will make it possible for a larger fraction of MIT students to have their tuition and fees completely covered .
Under the new plan , which will take effect in the 2008 - 2009 academic year :
â€¢ Families earning less than $ 75,000 a year will have all tuition covered .
For parents with total annual income below $ 75,000 and typical assets , MIT will ensure that all tuition charges are covered with an MIT scholarship , federal and state grants , and / or outside scholarship funds .
Nearly 30 percent of MIT students fall into this tuition - free category .
â€ ¢
For families earning less than $ 75,000 a year , MIT will eliminate the student loan expectation .
MIT will no longer expect students from families with total annual income below $ 75,000 and typical assets to take out loans to cover expenses beyond tuition .
Under this provision , for example , students in this income group who participate in MIT 's paid Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program ( UROP ) each semester would be able to graduate debt - free .
â€ ¢
For families earning less than $ 100,000 , MIT will eliminate home equity in determining their need .
In determining the ability to pay for college , MIT will no longer consider home equity for families with total annual income below $ 100,000 and typical assets .
On average , this will reduce parental contributions by $ 1,600 .
For families who rent , rather than own a home , MIT will provide a comparable reduction in the expected parental contribution .
â€¢ MIT will reduce student work - study requirements for all financial aid recipients .
During the past decade , MIT has steadily lowered the amount it expects students to provide through term - time work .
MIT will take a further step in this direction by reducing the work - study expectation for all financial aid recipients by an additional 10 percent .
The Institute has a long tradition of opening its doors to talented students from a full range of economic backgrounds .
For more than four decades , MIT has made its undergraduate financial aid decisions by following a three - part financial aid philosophy .
" First , we are need - blind in admissions , meaning that we admit all undergraduates on the basis of academic merit alone , without considering their ability to pay , " said Dean for Undergraduate Education Daniel Hastings .
" Second , MIT meets the full demonstrated financial need of all students we admit .
Third , we award all our aid based on need alone ; MIT does not award any academic , athletic or other forms of merit scholarships . "
Total financial aid budget is one of the highest per enrolled student in the nation .
Building on this commitment , MIT will increase its financial aid budget to $ 74 million .
MIT 's total financial aid budget is one of the highest per enrolled student in the nation .
Sixty percent of MIT undergraduates receive scholarship aid from the Institute 's internal resources .
Fully 90 percent of MIT undergraduates receive financial aid of some kind , from a range of sources .
While MIT focuses assistance on those with fewer resources , it also provides aid to families with incomes well above $ 100,000 who demonstrate need -- for example , because they have more than one child in college at a time .
In fact , approximately 38 percent of our current MIT scholarship recipients come from families earning more than $ 100,000 .
Tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year will increase 4 percent to $ 36,390 ; however , this figure represents less than half of what it costs MIT to educate an undergraduate .
As Hastings noted , " In a pattern MIT has followed for many years , we are increasing funds available for financial aid this year at a far greater rate than the rise in tuition . "
During the past decade , the net tuition for undergraduates -- what students and families pay after financial aid -- has , on average , dropped by more than 15 percent when adjusted for inflation .
" For those receiving an MIT scholarship , which is six out of every 10 MIT undergraduates , net tuition is $ 8,100 - - an amount that approximates the in - state cost of many public universities , " Hastings added .
Tradition of ensuring access and affordability for those who need it most .
MIT has long taken an aggressive position on aid because its students demonstrate a much higher level of need than students at peer institutions .
More than 22 percent of MIT undergraduates come from families with annual incomes less than $ 60,000 a year ; 17 percent come from families with incomes under $ 45,000 .
Two years ago , the Institute took a leadership role in the national debate on financial aid when it became the first private university to match Federal Pell Grants , dollar for dollar , effectively doubling this federal grant for the neediest students .
Approximately 14 percent of MIT undergraduates receive a Pell Grant , the largest federal grant program for undergraduate education .
" We will continue our longstanding financial commitment to students and their families in the years ahead , " Hastings stated .
" That we can welcome to our campus such extraordinary students , regardless of their economic background , is due to our historic dedication to need - based financial aid . "

By John Veit – HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE | A hundred years from now , Avram Noam Chomsky is going to figure in the history books as the prime voice of conscience , dissent and reason in the wars and social catastrophes of the late 20th century .
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s , he began an intellectual revolution in the understanding of linguistics which very efficiently challenged and subverted the old knee - jerk behavioristic worldview that nourished the Cold War .
His seamless critical essays on American foreign and domestic policies since then have unerringly diagnosed their fallacies , relentlessly dissecting the propaganda of the power establishment .
We thought it was time he addressed the Drug War .
HIGH TIMES : You ’ve defined the War on Drugs as an instrument of population control .
How does it accomplish that ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Population control is actually a term I borrowed from the counterinsurgency literature of the Kennedy years .
The main targets at the time were Southeast Asia and Latin America , where there was an awful lot popular ferment .
They recognized that the population was supporting popular forces that were calling for all kinds of social change that the United States simply could not tolerate .
And you could control people in a number of ways .
One way was just by terror and violence , napalm bombing and so on , but they also worked on developing other kinds of population - control measures to keep people subjugated , ranging from propaganda to concentration camps .
Propaganda is much more effective when it is combined with terror .
You have the same problem domestically , where the public is constantly getting out of control .
You have to carry out measures to insure that they remain passive and apathetic and obedient , and do n’t interfere with privilege and power .
It ’s a major theme of modern democracy .
As the mechanisms of democracy expand , like enfranchisement and growth , the need to control people by other means increases .
So the growth of corporate propaganda in the United States more or less parallels the growth of democracy , for quite straightforward reasons .
It ’s not any kind of secret .
It is discussed very frankly and openly in business literature and academic social - science journals .
You have to “ fight the everlasting battle for the minds of men , ” in their standard phraseology , to indoctrinate and regiment them in the way that armies regiment their bodies .
Those are population - control measures .
This engineering or manufacture of consent is the essence of democracy , because you have to insure that ignorant and meddlesome outsiders – meaning , we , the people – do n’t interfere with the work of the serious people who run public affairs in the interests of the privileged .
HIGH TIMES : How does the War on Drugs fit into this ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , one of the traditional and obvious ways of controlling people in every society , whether it ’s a military dictatorship or a democracy , is to frighten them .
If people are frightened , they ’ll be willing to cede authority to their superiors who will protect them : “ OK , I ’ll let you run my life in order to protect me , ” that sort of reasoning .
So the fear of drugs and fear of crime is very much stimulated by state and business propaganda .
The National Justice Commission repeatedly points out that crime in the United States , while sort of high , is not off the spectrum for industrial societies .
On the other hand , fear of crime is far beyond other societies , and mostly stimulated by various forms of propaganda .
The Drug War is an effort to stimulate fear of dangerous people from whom we have to protect ourselves .
It is also a direct form of control of what are called the “ dangerous classes , ” those superfluous people who do n’t really have a function contributing to profit - making and wealth .
They have to be somehow taken care of .
HIGH TIMES :
In some other countries you just hang the rabble .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yes , but in the U.S. you do n’t kill them , you put them in jail .
The economic policies of the 1980s sharply increased inequality , concentrating such economic growth as there was , which was not enormous , in very few hands .
The top few percent of the population got extremely wealthy as profits went through the roof , and meanwhile median - income wages were stagnating or declining .
People have to work harder , and public support systems for poor and hungry people have been declining sharply ever since the ’70s .
You ’re getting a large mass of people who are insecure , suffering from difficulty or misery , or something in between .
A lot of them basically are going to be arrested , because you have to control them .
The Drug War is used for that purpose .
It very explicitly targets young black males .
When the War on Drugs was re-declared in the late ’ 80s , Senator Patrick Moynihan ( D - NY ) pointed out that if you just look at social statistics , you can see that we are calling for a war against poor minorities , black males basically .
HIGH TIMES :
It ’s obviously true , but how do you prove it ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Just by looking at the trend lines for marijuana .
Marijuana use was peaking in the late ’ 70s , but there was not much criminalization .
You did n’t go to jail for life for having marijuana then because the people using it were nice folks like us , the children of the rich .
You do n’t throw them into jail any more than you throw corporate executives in jail – even though corporate crime is far more costly and dangerous than street crime .
But then in the ’ 80s the use of various “ unhealthy ” substances started to decline among more educated sectors : marijuana and tobacco smoking , alcohol , red meat , coffee , this whole category of stuff .
On the other hand , usage remained steady among poorer sectors of the population .
In the United States , poor and black correlate – they ’re not identical , but there ’s a correlation – and in poor , black and Hispanic sectors of the population the use of such substances remained pretty steady .
So take a look at those trend lines .
When you call for a War on Drugs , you know exactly who you are going to pick up : poor black people .
You ’re not going to pick up rich white people ; you do n’t go after them anyway .
In the upper - middle - class suburb where I live , if somebody goes home and sniffs some cocaine the police do n’t break into their house .
So there are many factors making the Drug War a war against the poor , largely poor people of color .
And those are the people they have to get rid of .
During the period these economic policies were being instituted , the incarceration rate was shooting up , but crime was n’t , it was steady or declining .
But imprisonment went way up .
By the late ’ 80s , in terms of imprisoning our population , we were way ahead of the rest of the world , way ahead of any other industrial society .
HIGH TIMES : Who benefits from incarcerating young black males ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : A lot of people .
Poor people are basically superfluous for wealth production , and therefore the wealthy want to get rid of them .
The rich also frighten everyone else , because if you ’re afraid of these people , then you submit to state authority .
But beyond that , it ’s a state industry .
Since the 1930s , every businessman has understood that a private capitalist economy must have massive state subsidies ; the only question is what form that state subsidy will take .
In the United States the main form has been through the military system .
The most dynamic aspects of the economy – computers , the Internet , the aeronautical industry , pharmaceuticals – have fed off the military system .
But the crime - control industry , as it ’s called by criminologists , is becoming the fastest - growing industry in America .
And it ’s a state industry , publicly funded .
It ’s the construction industry , the real - estate industry , and also high - tech firms .
It ’s gotten to a scale sufficient that high - technology and military contractors are looking to it as a market for techniques of high - tech control and surveillance , so you can monitor what people do in their private activities with complicated electronic devices and supercomputers : monitoring their telephone calls and urinalyses and so forth .
In fact , the time will probably come when this superfluous population can be locked up in private apartments , not jails , and just monitored to track when they do the wrong thing , say the wrong thing , go the wrong direction .
HIGH TIMES : House arrest for the masses .
It ’s enough of an industry so that the major defense - industry firms are interested ; you can read about it in The Wall Street Journal .
The big law firms and investment houses are interested : Merrill Lynch is floating big loans for prison construction .
If you take the whole system , it ’s probably approaching the scale of the Pentagon .
Also , this is a terrific workforce .
We hear a fuss about prison labor in China , but prison labor is standard here .
It ’s very cheap , it does n’t organize , the workers do n’t ask for rights , you do n’t have to worry about health benefits because the public is paying for everything .
It ’s what ’s called a “ flexible ” workforce , the kind of thing economists like ; you have the workers when you want them , and you throw them out when you do n’t want them .
And what ’s more , it ’s an old American tradition .
There was a big industrial revolution in parts of the South in the early part of this century , in northern Georgia and Kentucky and Alabama , and it was based mostly around prison labor .
The slaves had been technically freed , but after a few years they were basically slaves again .
One way of controlling them was to throw them in jail , where they became a controlled labor force .
That ’s the core of the modern industrial revolution in the South , which continued in Georgia to the 1920s and to the Second World War in places like Mississippi .
( It should be noted that when “ involuntary servitude ” was abolished , the only exception was criminals convicted of crimes .

Now it ’s being revived .
In Oregon and California there ’s a fairly substantial textile industry in the prisons , with exports to Asia .
At the very time people were complaining about prison labor in China , California and Oregon are exporting prison - made textiles to China .
They even have a line called , “ Prison Blues . ”
And it goes all the way up to advanced technology like data processing .
In the state of Washington , Boeing workers are protesting the export of jobs to China , but they ’re probably unaware that their jobs are being exported to nearby prisons , where machinists are doing work for Boeing under circumstances that the management is delighted over , for obvious reasons .
HIGH TIMES :
And most of these prisoners are now nonviolent drug offenders .
NOAM CHOMSKY :
The enormous rate of growth of the prison population has been mostly drug-related .
The last figures I saw showed that over half the federal prison population , and maybe a quarter in state prisons , are drug offenders .
In New York State , for example , a twenty - dollar street sale or possession of an ounce of cocaine will get you the same sentence as arson with intent to murder .
The three - strikes legislation is going to blow it right through the sky .
The third arrest can be for some minor drug offense , and you ’ll go to jail forever .
( Another side effect of the three - strikes laws has been a dramatic increase in the number of high - speed police car chases , and car - chase - related car accidents .
Knowing that they are up against a life sentence , even petty criminals try to escape now , instead of surrendering .

HIGH TIMES : The Drug Czar ’s office estimates that Americans spend $ 57 billion annually on illegal drugs .
What effect does this have on the global economy ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , the United Nations tries to monitor the international drug trade , and their estimates are on the order of $ 400 to $ 500 billion – half a trillion dollars a year – in trade alone , which makes it higher than oil , something like 10 percent of world trade .
Where this money goes to is mostly unknown , but general estimates are that maybe 60 % of it passes through U.S. banks .
After that , a lot goes to offshore tax havens .
It ’s so obscure that nobody monitors it , and nobody wants to .
But the Commerce Department every year publishes figures on foreign direct investment , where U.S. investment is going , and through the ’90s the big excitement has been the “ new emerging markets ” like Latin America .
And it turns out that a quarter of U.S. foreign direct investment is going to Bermuda , another 15 % to the Bahamas and Cayman Islands , another 10 % to Panama , and so on .
Now , they ’re not building steel factories .
The most benign interpretation is that it ’s just tax havens .
And the less benign interpretation is that it ’s one way of passing illegal money into places where it will not be monitored .
We really do n’t know , because it is not investigated .
This is not the task of the Justice Department , which is to go after a black kid in the ghetto who has a joint in his pocket .
HIGH TIMES :
What do you think of the U.S. policy of offering trade and aid favors to countries who promulgate so - called anti-drug initiatives ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Actually , U.S. programs radically increase the use of drugs .
Look at the big growth in cocaine production that has exploded in the Andes over the last few years , in Colombia and Peru and Bolivia .
Why are Bolivian peasants , for instance , producing coca ?
The neo-liberal structural adjustment policies of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , which are run by the U.S. , try to drive peasants into agro-export , producing not for local consumption but for sale abroad .
They want to reduce social programs , like spending for health and education , cutting government deficits by increasing exports .
And they cut back tariffs so that we can then pour our own highly subsidized food exports into their countries , which of course , undercuts peasant production .
Put all that together and what do you get ?
You get a huge increase in Bolivian coca production , as their only comparative advantage .
The same is true in Colombia , where U.S. “ food for peace ” aid , as it is called , was used to undercut or destroy wheat production by essentially giving food – at what amounts to U.S. taxpayer expense – through U.S. agro-exporters to undercut wheat production there , which later cut coffee production and their ability to set prices in any reasonable fashion .
And the end result is they turn to something else , and one of the things they turn to is coca production .
In fact , if you look at the total effect of U.S. policies , it has been to increase drugs .
HIGH TIMES : Well , anybody who looks into the history of American drug policies in this century …
NOAM CHOMSKY : I ’m putting aside another factor altogether , namely clandestine warfare .
If you look into the history of what is called the CIA , which means the U.S. White House , its secret wars , clandestine warfare , the trail of drug production just follows .
It started in France after the Second World War when the United States was essentially trying to re-institute the traditional social order , to rehabilitate Fascist collaborators , wipe out the Resistance and destroy the unions and so on .
The first thing they did was re-constitute the Mafia , as strikebreakers or for other such useful services .
And the Mafia does n’t do it for fun , so there was a tradeoff : Essentially , they allowed them to re-institute the heroin - production system , which had been destroyed by the Fascists .
The Fascists tended to run a pretty tight ship :
They did n’t want any competition , so they wiped out the Mafia .
But the U.S. re-constituted it , first in southern Italy , and then in southern France with the Corsican Mafia .
That ’s where the famous French Connection comes from .
That was the main heroin center for many years .
Then U.S. terrorist activities shifted over to Southeast Asia .
If you want to carry out terrorist activities , you need local people to do it for you , and you also need secret money to pay for it , clandestine hidden money .
Well , if you need to hire thugs and murderers with secret money , there are n’t many options .
One of them is the drug connection .
The so - called Golden Triangle around Burma , Laos and Thailand became a big drug - producing area with the help of the United States , as part of the secret wars against those populations .
In Central America , it was partly exposed in the Contra hearings , though it was mostly suppressed .
But there ’s no question that the Reagan administration ’s terrorist operations in Central America were closely connected with drug trafficking .
Afghanistan became one of the biggest centers of drug trafficking in the world in the 1980s , because that was the payoff for the forces to which the U.S. was contributing millions of dollars : the same extreme Islamic fundamentalists who are now tearing the country to shreds .
It ’s been true throughout the world .
It ’s not that the U.S. is trying to increase the use of drugs , it ’s just the natural thing to do .
If you were in a position where you had to hire thugs and gangsters to kill peasants and break strikes , and you had to do it with untraceable money , what would come to your mind ?
HIGH TIMES :
Where do you stand on drug legalization ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Nobody knows what the effect would be .
Anyone who tells you they know is just stupid or lying , because nobody knows .
These are things that have to be tried , you have to experiment to see what the effects are .
Most soft drugs are already legal , mainly alcohol and tobacco .
Tobacco is by far the biggest killer among all the psychoactives .
Alcohol deaths are a little hard to estimate , because an awful lot of violent deaths are associated with alcohol .
Way down below come “ hard ” drugs , a tiny fraction of the deaths from alcohol or tobacco , maybe ten or twenty thousand deaths per year .
The fastest - growing hard drugs are the APS , amphetamine - type substances , produced mostly in the U.S .
As far as the rest of the drugs are concerned , marijuana is not known to be very harmful .
I mean , it ’s generally assumed it ’s not good for you , but coffee is n’t good for you , tea is n’t good for you , chocolate cake is n’t good for you either .
It would be crazy to criminalize coffee , even though it ’s harmful .
The United States is one of very few countries where this is considered a moral issue .
In most countries you do n’t have politicians getting up screaming about how tough they ’re going to be on drugs .
So the first thing we ’ve got to do is move it out of the phase of population control , and into the sphere of social issues .
The Rand Corporation estimates that if you compare the effect of criminal programs versus educational programs at reducing drug use , educational programs are way ahead , by about a factor of seven .
HIGH TIMES : But alarmist drug - propaganda programs like DARE and the Partnership for a Drug - Free America ’s TV ads have been found to increase experimentation among teenagers .
NOAM CHOMSKY : The question is , what kind of education are you doing ?
Educational programs are n’t the only category .
Education also has to do with the social circumstances in which drugs are used .
The answer to that is not throwing people in jail .
The answer is to try and figure what ’s going on in their lives , their family ; do they need medical care and so on ?
This very striking decline in substance abuse among educated sectors , as I said , goes across the spectrum – red meat , coffee , tobacco , everything .
That ’s education .
It was n’t that there was an educational program that said to stop drinking coffee , it ’s just that attitudes toward oneself and towards health , how we live and so on , changed among the more educated sectors of the population , and these things went down .
And none of it had to do with criminalization .
It just had to do with a rise in the culture and educational level , which led to more care for oneself .

McAuliffe : Obama has Latino " problem "
Ken Vogel reports that the Clinton campaign is using the results to openly argue that Barack Obama has a problem with Hispanic voters — an idea Clinton backers have previously mentioned only behind the scenes .
“ It was a 100 percent Hispanic primary and it shows that he has a problem with the Latino community , ” Terry McAuliffe , campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton , told a handful of reporters after polls closed Sunday .
“ He cannot close in this key core constituency , ” McAuliffe added .
Voters in Puerto Rico are in some ways different from Hispanics living stateside , both because there ’s a long tradition of racial mixing and because elections here tend to center around the debate over whether the island should remain a commonwealth or become a state or an independent nation .
They also do n't vote in November .
Clinton has fared better than Obama with Hispanic voters in previous primaries .
And her campaign has argued to superdelegates that she ’d do better than Obama against presumptive GOP nominee in key states with large Hispanic populations .
CNN exit polls in Puerto Rico found a surprisingly high 31 percent of voters admitted the race of the candidates was important in their decision .
Of those , 63 percent voted for Clinton and 37 percent for Obama .
“ It helps make the case that we would not have to expend resources to win a natural Democratic constituency , ” said Puerto Rico Senate president Kenneth D. McClintock , a Clinton co-chair and superdelegate .
If Obama is the nominee , McClintock asserted that in order to win the Hispanic vote , Democrats “ would have to divert resources that we would otherwise spend on other campaigns . ”
But McAuliffe ’s assertion Sunday that Obama has a Hispanic “ problem ” was more direct than any the campaign has made publicly to date .
In a conference call with Clinton campaign donors last month , the campaign ’s liaison to superdelegates , Harold Ickes , asserted McCain has “ very favorable standing with Hispanics because of his position on the immigration bill . ”
Ickes said “ So if Obama is against McCain in states where Hispanics are important , I ’ll just tell you : he ’s not going to be able to cut the mustard on that , and Hillary will .
And she ’s shown that in Texas and other states , ” said Ickes .
That will be key , Ickes said , “ if we need to bring in some of the Southwestern states or even Florida , where there is a growing population of Puerto Ricans in addition to the Cubans in South Florida as well as older people . ”
UPDATE : Obama does somewhat worse than Clinton among Hispanics in matchups against McCain , but he still leads McCain among Hispanic voters by a wide margin in , for example , this recent Gallup survey .
In that survey , he does a bit better among that group than Kerry ( 53 % of Hispanics ) did against Bush .
Clinton , though not Obama , does better than Gore ( 62 % ) did against Bush .

Men who look into the rapidly growing G0YS movement find there is a place for men who love masculinity , but do n't feel comfortable with contemporary " GAY - Male " culture due to the entrenched stigmas & appalling health statistics surrounding it ( I.E : a rate of sexually transmitted diseases that is [ according to the American Red Cross ] +4,000.00 % higher than the general population ) !
G0YS represent the majority ( say " majority " ) of men ( +60 % ) , - who experience affection for masculinity & choose to express it in an atmosphere of pure respect - without the least hint of moral compromise - NOR a compulsion to promote unhealthy , emasculating stereotypes .
G0YS : A sane , sober , approach to masculine intimacy ; - with comprehensive theological apologetics for those men who have serious concerns about the religious & moral aspects of M/M affections .
G0YS : Unapologetically rational -&- politically liberty - centric !
Most of the men who discover the g0ys ( spelled w. a zer0 ) men 's movement are looking for answers to some serious questions about themselves .
Most are shocked when they learn that +60 % of all men have similar feelings ( Yes , +60 % - a majority ) !
Most ( but not all ) of these men have feelings for women , but grapple with questions arising from the fact that they also deeply appreciate masculine aesthetics & experience affections for other men !
But , such men do n't identify as " GAY " because that term has been welded with odd , x- gender behavior & AnalSex [ ] ;
- Activities that most men consider odd , unhealthy , disgusting , & emasculating .
Because of these core differences - g0ys do NOT fit into the ( GLIBTQ ETC ... ) alphabet - soup culture & find much of it to be antagonistic to our masculine ethos .
" G0YS " know instinctively that loving other men has nothing whatsoever to do with AnalSex , gender - bending , x- dressing or otherwise playing the female role !
G0YS , - by our very nature , find the entire notion of AnalSex [ ] in any form to be dirty , dangerous , degrading & damn - un - masculine .
And , by shunning casual sexual encounters & completely rejecting AnalSex , G0YS avoid the very perils that spread +98 % of ALL STI 's / STD 's among men !
Among g0ys , STDs / STIs are virtually nonexistent compared to the STD / STI figures for the G A Y - male community - which are ( according to the Red Cross ) +4000 % higher than the general population !
So , while " GAY " - men are plagued with STDs / STIs ; - G0YS are NOT !
These massive differences are why the g0ys movement matters !
If this was merely some superficial argument about petty subjective matter , - then our position would be no different than the likes of meaningless arguments about trivia & personal biases .
But , the g0ys movement does center around germane issues of human behavior : Specifically - why men of good conscience need to loudly reject the extremely perilous & injurious actions of a flood of old , dead , callous fools who killed themselves by their very actions & a vestige of shallow cultural progeny who wish to perpetuate their deadly mantras into the future in the name of " diversity " & " tolerance " .
Many men who discover the g0ys movement have been abused by religion & told that Same - Gender - Affections ( SGA ) are " sin " .
G0YS know that this abuse by religion is so severe that an in - depth section of the main g0ys website has been developed to give substantial , exonerating , in - depth theological answers from several sources ( including a Rabbinic PhD who has thoughtfully written on the subject matter ) .
What we have proven in the theological section is how relying on the actual Scriptures represents the real strength of our position ( instead of trying to water - down or deride Biblical texts as so many " pro-gay " churches do ) .
G0YS also go into great depth to explain the rationale behind what was & was n't prohibited in the Torah & more importantly : WHY .
G0YS also expose serious , intentional mistranslations in the Bible and how a gigantic LIE arose over time due to those very mistranslations !
The theological section is absolutely liberating & very essential for men who demand solid , in - depth , in - context answers to reconcile their faith & feelings without compromising truth , safety or morality .
In this regard , G0YS claim to be one of the most comprehensive resources for answers on the planet !
Also within the g0ys main site are many essays that give analytical insight into 3000 + years of history ; - proving that it always has been completely normal for men to seek a deep bond with other men - even on the physical level ( a/k/a " Bromance + " ) .
And we show how the modern , so - called " gay movement " has shamed M2 M affection for decades as it was hijacked by pornographers , perverts , & sociopathic - personalities -- all with agendas that attempt to link their emasculating & disease - spreading fetishes with all Same Gender Affections ( by suggesting that it 's all part of the same " movement " [ GLIBTQ ETC ... ] ) .
It 's essential to understand how a socialization movement can be perverted by special interests , & how important it is to reject that movement after it has been irreparably perverted by unhealthy agendas .
G0YS show how natural male affection has been discredited & contaminated by a gender - bending , pro- AnalSex [ ] , disease - spreading set of fetishes ; -- And how the term " GAY " has morphed into a word used to push every perilous sex act & bizarre behavior under the guise of " tolerance " .
G0YS understand that when a social movement results in actions that indiscriminately harm others -- then it 's time to STOP TOLERATING IT .
So : Even though you are a guy who loves men / too - does n't mean that you need to embrace the culture that is called " GAY " .
Men loving men is NORMAL ; -- NOT gender dimorphic , nor part of some minority with bizarre & unhealthy fetishes !
G0YS reject the entire " Gay Paradigm " & choose an older , healthier & far nobler path !
Within the g0ys main site you will also find links to other g0y - centric groups that are growing at a rate almost too fast to keep up with .
We 've listed many of them with space to add yours if you decide to become pro-active as a g0y , too .
We have over a decade of commentary in some of the core groups & encourage your participation after you 've taken some time to look over the main site .
Doing so will get many of your initial questions out of the way - so that your appearance in the groups wo n't leave you too " green " as to the general posturing of the members & movement overall .
The g0ys groups also contain a collection of astonishing images of handsome men .
You 'll discover that g0ys are n't prudes at all & we have no qualms against nudity .
We do insist that images be tasteful , & never showcase disrespect of a model .
We believe that love is totally awesome & we have no qualms with images that display it between men .
We do not believe that " genderfuck " , abuse , pain or forms of domination constitute acceptable content ( unless such images are used to deride abusive principles themselves ) .
G0YS are all about respect .
Our use of imagery tries to relay the clear message that men can totally love other men without anyone losing his respect nor making any sacrifice of masculinity .

Mary Doria Russell 's first novel , The Sparrow , tells the story of Emilio Sandoz , a Puerto Rican Jesuit priest , and his circle of friends .
On the surface , hardly a novel which could be classified as science fiction .
However , there is a long tradition of religion in science fiction , including the Jesuit Ramon Ruiz - Sanchez in James Blish 's A Case of Conscience .
Russell 's novel is told in two time frames .
The first begins in the year 2059 , when a physically mutilated and spiritually devalued Emilio Sandoz is recovering from his trip to the planet Rakhat in a Jesuit mission .
Although Sandoz has the knowledge of his actually trip and his keepers , Father General Giuliani , and Brother Ed Behr and Father John Candotti , have knowledge of the time passed on Earth , Russell only reveals all this information to the reader slowly , leaving the reader to draw their own conclusions from partial knowledge as the novel progresses .
The other time frame begins in 2019 , when Jimmy Quinn , a friend of Sandoz 's who works at Arecibo , discovers the first intelligent extraterrestrial radio signals emanating from a planet in the Alpha Centauri system .
Eventually this story line , which follows Quinn and Sandoz as they put together a secret mission for the Jesuits which leaves to explore Rakhat , catches up to the hearing on Emilio Sandoz in the 2060s .
Because Russell uses a variety of characters and time frames , she is able to use foreshadowing extremely effectively throughout the book .
Dropping hints here and there which the reader notices , but the characters , due to their knowledge or lack thereof , do not always comment on .
Eventually , Russell manages to tie everything together and provides answers to the various plot questions she raises .
Russell 's questions of plot , however , are secondary in The Sparrow .
This novel is an examination of faith and what it means to question , or even lose , one 's faith .
Although the majority of the crew which travels to Rakhat is Jesuit , the mission includes a variety of aethiests , a Jew , and a non-Jesuit Catholic .
Many of these characters begin to question their beliefs , or , in some cases , grab hold more firmly .
While D.W. Yarborough , the Jesuit in charge of the mission , sees Sandoz as a saint , Sandoz himself is continually wondering whether his faith is strong , or real , enough .
As the mission progresses , Sandoz 's physical injuries become a visible sign of his own crumbling belief in a caring deity .
The Sparrow is more philosophical than many science fiction novels and makes the reader think about the questions of religion it raises .
On other levels , the novel does not work as well .
Despite the backing of the Society of Jesus , the mission ot Rakhat retains the flavor of a 1950s sf novel in which the characters decide to build a spaceship in their backyard .
Although Russell includes many of the trappings of an hard science fiction novel , her hardest science is linguistics ( although Emilio 's discussions with Sofia Mendes about Rakhat vocabulary and grammar are inspired ) .
The Sparrow is a novel of ideas and characters .
Not the sort of ideas which make the reader gasp and say " Wow , " but the type of ideas which make the reader continue to think about them long after the book has been set aside .
Russell presents her ideas through characters who are extremely likable , although they also harken back to the Heinleinian superman of the 1950s and 60s .
Russell has recently received the John W. Campbell Award on the merits of The Sparrow and its sequel , Children of God .
The Sparrow is one of the strongest debut novels I 've read in a long time and is certainly deserving of the award .
If the action occasionally slows to allow more philosophical and religious discussion , it does so in order to make The Sparrow a stronger novel .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 8  The White House budget director warned on Saturday that President Bush was prepared to veto a $ 500 billion spending package being assembled in Congress if Democrats pushed for too much additional money for domestic programs .
Jim Nussle , the director of the Office of Management and Budget , accused Democrats of trying to tie money for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to what the president considers excessive spending for federal agencies and home - state projects .
“ Instead of trying to leverage troop - funding for more pork - barrel spending , Congress ought to pass responsible appropriations bills and the funding for the troops our commanders say they need to build on their battlefield success , ” Mr. Nussle said .
Democratic leaders accused the White House of responding hastily to news accounts of the proposal , which is being developed behind closed doors .
They said Democrats were determined to devote more resources to national needs like homeland security and law enforcement .

I spent most of this past Father 's Day weekend and all of Monday watching Tiger Woods drag himself to victory at the U.S.
Open on a busted leg .
Monday 's webcast was , in particular , a joy to watch .
The long , interstitial shots of the coast during the TV breaks were oddly soothing .
I noticed during the coverage that Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller went to great pains to let the audience know just how big of an underdog Rocco Mediate was .
He was old !
He was ranked really low !
He had a bad back !
He was abused by lesbian nuns as a child !
Advertisement
They also took great pains to let the audience know that Mediate was really enjoying himself out on the course .
It was damn near Farvian praise .
Look at him smiling like a little kid !
And talking !
And having fun !
And not acting like a total prick !
Indeed , it was a rare sight in golf .
Especially in contrast to Woods , who spent most of the tournament ( 17 and 18 on Saturday excepted ) looking like he had an acorn up his ass .
I 'd blame it on the leg , if he did n't look like that during pretty much every tournament .
And yet , for all of those attributes .
for every likable , underdog quality Mediate possessed , I had zero interest in seeing him actually win the tournament .
I wanted Woods to win .
And when he did , I was pleased .
I rooted for the big man to crush the little guy .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Rooting for Woods , as pretty much all casual golf fans do , runs counter to our instincts as sports fans .
You 'd never root for a 1 seed to pull of the win against a 16 seed in the NCAA tournament unless it was your own school or you had a boatload of cash riding on it .
You 'd never root for the Yankees to win the World Series , unless you live in the Bronx and enjoy smacking your girlfriend around .
It 's an American thing to root for the underdog .
Rooting for the best team is a total dick move .
It 's why Boston fans are such assbags .
So why is Tiger an anomaly ?
Well , for one thing , it 's golf .
Random assholes populate the leaderboards of events all the time .
Rocco Mediate may have been an enormous underdog .
But really , he 's no more surprising a contender than Rich Beem was when he beat out Tiger at the 2002 PGA Championship .
Or Ben Curtis when he won the British Open a few years back .
It 's not exactly earth - shattering when a golfer you 've never heard of pulls a great week out of his ass and wins a Major , even with Tiger around .
It happens all the time .
Just because Rocco's a particularly affable guy does n't mean he's that much different from the rest of the Michael Campbells out there .
Advertisement
As a result , a Tiger win feels more significant in the long run than a Tiger upset .
This sort of evaluation cuts across all sports .
We as fans are constantly weighing the potential magnitude of the unexpected versus the dominant .
A lot of people wanted to see the Patriots go 19 - 0 this year , because it was unprecedented .
A lot of people wanted to see the Patriots go 18 - 1 this year , because it was unprecedented .
More often than not , when confronted with a neutral rooting interest , we make our decision on who to cheer for based on which outcome we feel will be more historic .
The average casual golf fan does n't tune into Tiger on TV just to watch him lose .
They 're there to see him do shit well beyond the standards for excellence in his field of work .
They 're there to watch him make history .
More important , they 're there to feel as if they are a living part of that history .

It 's funny desire to have , yet it 's something that possesses many of us .
I know it affects me .
I wanted to watch the US Open not only for its sheer entertainment value ( and to avoid the very small amount of daily work I regularly do ) , but to be in on the moment when something significant happened .
To feel like I was there .
And to say that I was there when I saw it .
This is n't terribly rational on my part .
In fact , it 's pretty goddamn narcissistic .
After all , I did n't do jack shit .
All I did was watch some other guy do something .
And it 's not as if watching it happen was something only I got to do .
Millions of people saw it .
After Tiger retires , multiple generations of people out there will be able to say they watched him play golf .
Given that being able to watch him play is simply a matter of age and circumstance , and that any of your peers or mine could make a similar boast , why is it so important to be in on that history ?

When Tim Russert died on Friday , I learned about it when I was at the gym .
They cut out from the US Open coverage and went to a big NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT graphic .
Then Tom Brokaw showed up on screen , at which point I knew some serious shit was going down .
Clearly , Brokaw was there to deliver some sort of tragic news .
And , in that moment , I felt an emotion I really should not have felt : a very , very morbid sense of excitement .
It was an absolutely shameful emotion to feel .
The guy fucking died .
Yet , when something sudden and tragic happens in the world – 9/11 , Katrina , the bombings in London , etc. – it 's sometimes impossible to suppress the adrenaline flow and NOT feel a bit energized by the fact that something is HAPPENING – a sordid thrill that you are there live to witness to something of an almost impossible magnitude .
You 'll find no shortage of people who will talk to you enthusiastically about where they were when Kennedy was shot , or when 9/11 happened .
There 's a sadness to all of those tales , but there 's also a kind of odd pride that emanates , that comes from the storyteller having lived through it .
I hate that I sometimes have that feeling deep in the recesses of my mind when tragedy strikes .
It 's inappropriate , pathetic , and useless .
So why is it there ?

I 'm voting for Barack Obama this fall .
Now , I have lots of reasons to do it , all of them blatantly self - serving .
Do n't like Obama ?
Feel like voting for McCain ?
Fine by me .
I 'm not interested in starting any sort of political flame war .
But the main reason that I 'm voting for Obama is because he offers something that McCain does not : an opportunity for me to " be a part " of a historic moment .
It 's an inescapable fact for both candidates that a black man winning the White House would be a far a greater milestone in American History than if another oldass white guy were to keep the streak alive .
The reason Obama can talk about change all the time without getting too specific is because he does n't have to get specific .
He IS the change .
The act of him winning , by itself , has a huge impact .
Advertisement
So there 's something immensely appealing to me about the prospect of living through that sort of moment .
I was born in 1976 .
I have lived through exactly one seminal moment in American history , and that was 9/11 .
I would very much like something to counterbalance it .
I 'd like to bear witness to history and not feel ashamed for the odd kind of thrill it provides .
I 'm voting for the moment as much as I 'm voting for the man .
I wish I could tell you I like Barack Obama because he has detailed plans laid out to end the war , solve the economy , save the planet , cure cancer , invent the flying car , and get Erin Andrews to pose for High Society .
And he may very well have those plans tucked away somewhere on his website , along with a fully padded resume .
But I 've never bothered to look , because I do n't particularly give a shit about any of that ( except the Erin Andrews part ) .
No , I 'm voting for him because , history - wise , it 's just more interesting .
It makes for a more entertaining and significant part of MY personal history .

Is this a superficial reason to vote for someone ?
Even somewhat racist ?
Oh , yes .
Superficiality and racism are two of my strongest suits .
But I can't resist the primal urge , deep in my core , to watch something notable occur .
You hear Baby Boomers brag all the time about the 60's and Woodstock and all that shit .
" What a time to be alive , maaaaan . "
It 's almost as if generations are competitive with one another about who gets to be around for the most shit going down , good or bad .
Because if we 're around for something important , then there 's a feeling , by osmosis , that we 're important as well .
Even more , there 's a feeling that , the more history we get to live through , the more we have in common as a population .
Even though we do it in separate rooms and houses , we watch massive sporting events like the U.S. Open together .
We watch presidential elections together .
We watch horrible news like 9/11 together .
And we get to share with each other where we were when it happened , and how we felt .
Those moments galvanize us .
We call each other when the moment happens .
We email .
We leave a comment .
We give each other our own little , tiny , insignificant view of that history .

It 's a natural byproduct of our ambition , our selfishness , our insecurity , and our curiosity .
It 's a way of amplifying our own lives , of placing our lives into a greater context .
Alone , we do n't matter .
The only way we can feel like we 've made an impact on the world is if we 're part of a moment that 's woven into the greater social fabric .
Because those moments cannot achieve transcendence if no one is there to witness them .
It 's a selfish , arrogant feeling , to want to be a part of history in the making .
But it 's a feeling that all of us , at one time or another , share .
And that 's what makes it so oddly beautiful .

Canada has apologised for forcing about 150,000 aboriginal children to attend state - funded Christian boarding schools aimed at assimilating them .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper made the apology in parliament in Ottawa , in front of hundreds of ex-schoolchildren .
The schools operated from the late 19th Century until the 1990s , although most of them shut in the 1970s .
Accounts of physical and sexual abuse at the institutions , known as residential schools , have also emerged .
Most of the churches that ran the schools apologised in the 1980s and 1990s .
Australia apologised for a similar policy in February .
' We are sorry '
Mr Harper said aboriginal Canadians had been waiting " a very long time " for an apology .
" I stand before you today to offer an apology to former students of Indian residential schools .
The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history . "
He said the system had been based on the assumption that " aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal " .
Schools ' legacy of suffering ' They wanted to brainwash us '
He went on : " We now recognise that , far too often , these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled , and we apologise for failing to protect you .
" The government of Canada sincerely apologises and asks the forgiveness of the aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly .
We are sorry . "
The apology was quickly welcomed by Assembly of First Nations head Phil Fontaine , present with other aboriginal leaders in the chamber as Mr Harper spoke .
" We heard the government of Canada take full responsibility for this dreadful chapter in our shared history , " Mr Fontaine said .
" Finally , we heard Canada say it is sorry , " said Mr Fontaine , one of the first former schoolchildren to go public with his experiences of physical and sexual abuse at residential school .
Settlement deal
The federal government acknowledged 10 years ago that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant .
CANADA'S ABORIGINALS
Made up of Indians , known as First Nations people , Metis and Inuit Population 1.2 million out of total 33 million Canadians 48 % of aboriginals are under 25 years old ( 31 % for non-aboriginals )
Unemployment rate for 25 - 64 year olds almost three times the national rate 34 % do not complete secondary school ( 15 % for non-aboriginals )
Suicide rate among young aboriginals almost twice the national average Sources : StatsCan , Aboriginal Health Organisation Many schoolchildren recall being beaten for speaking their languages , and losing touch with their parents and culture .
The legacy of the system has been cited by aboriginals as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction among their people .
The apology is part of a C$ 2bn ( $ 1.9bn ; £ 990 m ) deal between the government , churches and the surviving former schoolchildren .
Under the agreement , they have begun receiving financial compensation for their suffering .
A truth and reconciliation commission has also been set up , which will be granted access to government and church records .

Six employees at a Manhattan S&M club were arrested this week and arraigned on misdemeanor prostitution charges yesterday .
The women were busted for offering more than the standard whips , chains , and ropes that other dungeons offer .
The six women , ranging in age from 19 to 39 , allegedly offered to extend their services to full sexual intercourse for an additional $ 220 .
That 's when undercover cops had to say the safety word , " Busted . "
Presumably , they were n't trussed up with ballgags in their mouths at the time .
All of the arrestees worked at Rebecca 's Hidden Chamber , which was only semi-concealed on West 31st St. in Manhattan .

Massive investment in CCTV cameras to prevent crime in the UK has failed to have a significant impact , despite billions of pounds spent on the new technology , a senior police officer piloting a new database has warned .
Only 3 % of street robberies in London were solved using CCTV images , despite the fact that Britain has more security cameras than any other country in Europe .

Use of CCTV images for court evidence has so far been very poor , according to Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville , the officer in charge of the Metropolitan police unit .
“ CCTV was originally seen as a preventative measure , ” Neville told the Security Document World Conference in London .
“ Billions of pounds has been spent on kit , but no thought has gone into how the police are going to use the images and how they will be used in court .
It ’s been an utter fiasco : only 3 % of crimes were solved by CCTV .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic lawmakers seeking to bolster Food and Drug Administration oversight of imported products took aim at medical devices and cosmetics on Wednesday , saying the agency lacks the money and power to properly regulate them .

The FDA is especially squeezed as the United States imports a growing number of catheters , heart devices , soaps , shampoos and other items , members of a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce panel said at a hearing .
“ While the market for these products becomes increasingly global , the FDA has no requirement to inspect foreign establishments manufacturing medical devices , ” said Rep. Frank Pallone , a New Jersey Democrat who led the panel .
The FDA inspects foreign makers of heart defibrillators and other so - called high risk devices every six years on average , while makers of hearing aids and other less risky devices are checked an average of every 27 years , according to the Government Accountability Office .
Device facilities in the United States are inspected an average of every three to five years , the GAO said .
Wednesday ’s hearing comes as lawmakers consider sweeping legislation that calls for drug and device makers , food manufacturers and cosmetic companies to register with the FDA and pay for mandatory inspections of foreign factories .
The proposed bill comes after a rash of tainted goods imported from China , including pet food , toothpaste and the blood - thinning drug heparin .
While both Democrats and Republicans generally support efforts to empower the agency , several Republicans likened industry fees to an added tax that would burden manufacturers .
Rep. Joe Barton , a Texas Republican , also said imported devices did not pose the same risks as other products .
“ We ’ve had major problems with food imports from China , we ’ve had major problems with drug imports from China , but I ’m not aware that we ’ve had major problems with medical device imports from China , ” he said .
Representatives for device makers said more oversight was unnecessary .
Greater inspections for less risky products , such as contact lenses and glucose meters , would keep products from getting to patients quickly , they said .
“ Requiring FDA to conduct pre-approval inspections ... would bring the approval process to a grinding halt , ” Steven Ubl , head of the Advanced Medical Technology Association , said in testimony to the panel .
Industry groups also questioned additional inspection fees for device companies , which already pay the FDA to review products for approval .
FDA officials told lawmakers they have taken steps to increase inspections and set up agency offices in other countries , among other efforts .
Stephen Sundlof , head of the FDA ’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , which oversees cosmetics , urged lawmakers to focus their legislation on more risky products and make greater use of private inspections .
COSMETICS UNCHECKED
Democrats said the FDA has even less power to monitor lotion , make - up and other cosmetic products that have gone largely unregulated for decades .
Roughly $ 62 billion in personal products are sold in the United States each year , Sundlof said .
The number of imported products has tripled since 2000 and is expected to grow , he added .
Yet the industry is largely overseen by rules established 70 years ago .
Since then , the FDA has looked at 11 percent of related ingredients and banned or restricted 10 types that posed safety risks .
“ I think improving oversight authority of cosmetics is long overdue , ” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky , an Illinois Democrat .
Sundlof acknowledged that just one - third of all U.S. cosmetic makers are currently registered with the agency , adding that companies are responsible for ensuring safety before marketing their products .
Unlike drugs or devices , cosmetics are not approved by the FDA before they are sold .
Pamela Bailey , head of the Personal Care Products Council industry group , said current law was strong enough , but urged lawmakers to give the FDA more money to carry out its duties .
FDA ’s Sundlof said regulating cosmetics has become a challenge as more products use sophisticated ingredients and “ straddle the line between cosmetics and drugs . ”
The last war wo n’t end , but in the Pentagon they ’re already arguing about the next one .
Let ’s start with that “ last war ” and see if we can get things straight .
Just over five years ago , American troops entered Baghdad in battle mode , felling the Sunni - dominated government of dictator Saddam Hussein and declaring Iraq “ liberated . ”
In the wake of the city ’s fall , after widespread looting , the new American administrators dismantled the remains of Saddam ’s government in its hollowed - out , trashed ministries ; disassembled the Sunni - dominated Ba’ath Party that had ruled Iraq since the 1960s , sending its members home with news that there was no coming back ; dismantled Saddam ’s 400,000 - man army ; and began to denationalize the economy .
Soon , an insurgency of outraged Sunnis was raging against the American occupation was raging .
After initially resisting democratic elections , American occupation administrators finally gave in to the will of the leading Shi’ite clergyman , Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , and agreed to sponsor them .
In January 2005 , these brought religious parties representing a long - oppressed Shi’ite majority to power , parties that had largely been in exile in neighboring Shi’ite Iran for years .
Now , skip a few years , and U.S. troops have once again entered Baghdad in battle mode .
This time , they ’ve been moving into the vast Sadr City Shi’ite slum “ suburb ” of eastern Baghdad , which houses perhaps two - and - a - half million closely packed inhabitants .
If freestanding , Sadr City would be the second largest city in Iraq after the capital .
This time , the forces facing American troops have n’t put down their weapons , packed up , and gone home .
This time , no one is talking about “ liberation , ” or “ freedom , ” or “ democracy . ”
In fact , no one is talking about much of anything .
And no longer is the U.S. attacking Sunnis .
In the wake of the president ’s 2007 surge , the U.S. military is now officially allied with 90,000 Sunnis of the so - called Awakening Movement , mainly former insurgents , many of them undoubtedly once linked to the Ba’athist government U.S. forces overthrew in 2003 .
Meanwhile , American troops are fighting the Shi’ite militia of Moqtada al - Sadr , a cleric who seems now to be living in Iran , but whose spokesman in Najaf recently bitterly denounced that country for “ seeking to share with the U.S. in influence over Iraq . ”
And they are fighting the Sadrist Mahdi Army militia in the name of an Iraqi government dominated by another Shi’ite militia , the Badr Corps of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , whose ties to Iran are even closer .
Ten thousand Badr Corps militia members were being inducted into the Iraqi army ( just as the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki was demanding that the Mahdi Army militia disarm ) .
This week , an official delegation from that government , which only recently received Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with high honors in Baghdad , took off for Tehran at American bidding to present “ evidence ” that the Iranians are arming their Sadrist enemies .
At the heart of this intra-sectarian struggle may be the fear that , in upcoming provincial elections , the Sadrists , increasingly popular for their resistance to the American occupation , might actually win .
For the last few weeks , American troops have been moving deeper into Sadr City , implanting the reluctant security forces of the Maliki government 500 - 600 meters ahead of them .
This is called “ standing them up , ” “ part of a strategy to build up the capability of the Iraqi security forces by letting them operate semi-autonomously of the American troops . ”
It ’s clear , however , that , if Maliki ’s military were behind them , many might well disappear .
( A number have already either put down their weapons , fled , or gone over to the Sadrists . )
How the Reverse Body Count Came  and Went
The fighting in the heavily populated urban slums of Sadr City has been fierce , murderous , and destructive .
It has quieted most of the talk about the “ lowering of casualties ” and of “ violence ” that was the singular hallmark of the surge year in Iraq .
Though never commented upon , that remarkable year - long emphasis on the ever lessening number of corpses actually represented the return , in perversely reverse form , of the Vietnam era “ body count . ”
In a guerrilla war situation in which there was no obvious territory to be taken and no clear way to establish what our previous Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , once called the “ metrics ” of victory or success , it was natural , as happened in Vietnam , to begin to count .
If you could n’t conquer a city or a country , then there was a certain logic to the thought that victory would come if , one by one , you could “ obliterate ”  to use a word suddenly back in the news  the enemy .
As the Vietnam conflict dragged on , however , as the counting of bodies continued and victory never materialized , that war gained the look of slaughter , and the body count ( announced every day at a military press conference in Saigon that reporters labeled “ the five o’clock follies ” ) came to be seen by increasing numbers of Americans as evidence of atrocity .
It became the symbol of the descent into madness in Indochina .
No wonder the Bush administration , imagining itself once again capturing territory , carefully organized its Iraq
War so that it would lack such official counting .
( The president later described the process this way : “ We have made a conscious effort not to be a body - count team . ” )
With the coming of the surge strategy in 2007 , frustration over the president ’s unaccomplished mission and his constant talk of victory meant that some other “ metric , ” some other “ benchmark , ” for success had to be established , and it proved to be the reverse body count .
Over the last year , in fact , just about the only measure of success regularly trumpeted in the mainstream media has been that lowering death count .
In reverse form , however , it still held some of the same dangers for the administration as its Vietnamese cousin .
As of April , bodies , in ever rising numbers , American and Iraqi , have been forcing their way back into the news as symbols not of success , but of failure .
More than 1,000 Iraqis have , by semi-official estimate , died just in the last month ( and experts know that these monstrous monthly totals of Iraqi dead are usually dramatic undercounts ) .
Four hundred Iraqis , reportedly only 10 percent militia fighters , are estimated to have died in the onslaught on Sadr City alone .
American soldiers are also dying in and around Baghdad in elevated numbers .
U.S. military spokesmen claim that none of this represents a weakening of the post - surge security situation .
As Lt. Gen. Carter Ham , Joint Staff director for operations at the Pentagon put the matter : “ While it is sad to see an increase in casualties , I do n’t think it is necessarily indicative of a major change in the operating environment .
When the level of fighting increases , then sadly the number of casualties does tend to rise . ”
This is , of course , unmitigated nonsense .
In April , of the 51 American deaths in Iraq , more than 20 evidently took place in the ongoing battle for Sadr City or greater Baghdad .
Among them were young men from Portland , Mesquite , Buchanan Dam , and Fresno ( Texas ) , Billings ( Montana ) , Fountain ( Colorado ) , Bakersfield ( California ) , Mount Airy ( North Carolina ) , and Zephyrhills ( Florida )  all thousands of miles from home .
And many of them have died under the circumstances most feared by American commanders ( and thought for a time to have been avoided ) before the invasion of Iraq  in block to block , house to house fighting in the warren of streets in one of this planet ’s many slum cities .
For the Iraqis of Sadr City , of course , this is a living hell .
( “ Sadr City right now is like a city of ghosts , ” Abu Haider al - Bahadili , a Mahdi Army fighter , told Amit R. Paley of the Washington Post .
“ It has turned from a city into a field of battle . ” )
As in all colonial wars , all wars on the peripheries , the “ natives ” always die in staggeringly higher numbers than the far better armed occupation or expeditionary forces .
This is no less true now , especially since the U.S. military has wheeled in its Abrams tanks , brought out its 200 - pound guided rockets , and called in air power in a major way .
Planes , helicopters , and Hellfire - missile - armed drones are now all regularly firing into the heavily populated urban neighborhoods of the east Baghdad slum .
As Tina Susman of the Los Angeles Times wrote recently , “ With many of Sadr City ’s main roads peppered with roadside bombs and its side streets too narrow for U.S. tanks or other heavy vehicles to navigate , U.S. forces often call in air strikes or use guided rockets to hit their targets . ”
Buried in a number of news stories from Sadr City are reports in which attacks on “ insurgents , ” “ criminals , ” or “ known criminal elements ” ( now Shi’ite , not Sunni ) destroy whole buildings , even rows of buildings , even in one case recently damaging a hospital and destroying ambulances .
Every day now , civilians die and children are pulled from the rubble .
This is brutal indeed .
And it no longer makes any particular sense , even by the standards of the Bush administration ; nor , in the post - surge atmosphere , is anybody trying to make much sense of it .
That rising body count has , after all , taken away the last metric by which to measure “ success ” in Iraq .
Even the small explanations ( and , these days , those are just about the only ones left ) seem increasingly bizarre .
Take , for instance , the convoluted explanation of who exactly is responsible for the devastation in Sadr City .
Here ’s how military spokesman Lt. Col.
Steve Stover put it recently :
“ ‘ The sole burden of responsibility lies on the shoulders of the militants who care nothing for the Iraqi people . ’
He said the militiamen purposely attack from buildings and alleyways in densely populated areas , hoping to protect themselves by hiding among civilians .
‘ What does that say about the enemy ?
He is heartless and evil . ' ”
Mind you , this comes from the representative of a military that now claims to grasp the true nature of counterinsurgency warfare ( and so of a guerrilla war ) ; and you ’re talking about a militia largely from Sadr City , fighting “ a war of survival ” for its own families , its own people , against foreign soldiers who have hopped continents to attack them .
The Sadrist militiamen are defending their homes and , of course , with Predator drones and American helicopters constantly over their neighborhoods , it ’s quite obvious what would happen to them if they “ came out and fought ” like typical good - hearted types .
They would simply be blown away .
( Out of curiosity , what descriptive adjectives would Lt. Col .
Stover use to capture the style of fighting of the Predator pilots who “ fly ” their drones from an air base outside of Las Vegas ? )
By the way , the last time such street fighting was seen , in the first six months of 2007 , the U.S. military was clearing insurgents ( “ al - Qaeda ” ) out of Sunni neighborhoods of the capital , which were then being further cleansed by Shi’ite militias ( including the Sadrists ) .
So , to sum up , let me see if I have this straight :
The Bush administration liberated Iraq in order to send U.S. troops against a ragtag militia that has nothing whatsoever to do with Saddam Hussein ’s former government ( and many of whose members were , in fact , oppressed by it , as were its leaders ) in the name of another group of Iraqis , who have long been backed by Iran , and uh
Hmmm , let ’s try that again or , like the Bush administration , let ’s not and pretend we did .
In the meantime , the U.S. military has tried to partially “ seal off ” Sadr City and , in the neighborhoods that they have partially occupied with their attendant Iraqi troops , they are building the usual vast , concrete walls , cordoning off the area .
This is being done , so American spokespeople say , to keep the Sadrist militia fighters out and to clear the way for government hearts - and - minds “ reconstruction ” projects that everyone knows are unlikely to happen .
Soon enough , if the previous pattern in Sunni neighborhoods is applied , they and / or their Iraqi cohorts will start going door to door doing weapons searches .
As a result , the American and Iraqi prisons now supposedly being substantially emptied  part of a program of “ national reconciliation ”  of many of the tens of thousands of Sunni prisoners swept up in raids in Sunni neighborhoods , are likely to be refilled with Shi’ite prisoners swept up in a similar way .
Call it grim irony  or call it a meaningless nightmare from which no one can awaken .
Just do n’t claim it makes much sense .
As in Vietnam , so four decades later , we are observing a full - scale descent into madness and , undoubtedly , into atrocity .
At least in 2003 , American troops were heading for Baghdad .
They thought they had a goal , a city to take .
Now , they are heading for nowhere , for the heart of a slum city which they cannot hold in a guerrilla war where the taking of territory and the occupying of neighborhoods is essentially beside the point .
They are heading for oblivion , while trying to win hearts and minds by shooting missiles into homes and enclosing people in giant walls which break families and communities apart , while destroying livelihoods .
Oh , and while we ’re at it , welcome to “ the next war , ” the war in the slum cities of the planet .
“ There Are No Exit Strategies ”
Remember when the globe ’s imperial policeman , its New Rome , was going to wield its unsurpassed military power by moving from country to country , using lightning strikes and shock - and - awe tactics ?
We ’re talking about the now - unimaginably distant past of perhaps 2002 - 2003 .
Afghanistan had been “ liberated ” in a matter of weeks ; “ regime change ” in Iraq was going to be a “ cakewalk , ” and it would be followed by the reordering of what the neoconservatives liked to refer to as “ the Greater Middle East . ”
No one who mattered was talking about protracted guerrilla warfare ; nor was there anything being said about counterinsurgency ( nor , as in the Powell Doctrine , about exits either ) .
The U.S. military was going to go into Iraq fast and hard , be victorious in short order , and then , of course , we would stay .
We would , in fact , be welcomed with open arms by natives so eternally grateful that they would practically beg us to garrison their countries .
Every one of those assumptions about the new American way of war was absurd , even then .
At the very least , the problem should have been obvious once American generals reached Baghdad and sat down at a marble table in one of Saddam Hussein ’s overwrought palaces , grinning for a victory snapshot  without any evidence of a defeated enemy on the other side of the table to sign a set of surrender documents .
If this were a normal campaign and an obvious imperial triumph , then where was the other side ?
Where were those we had defeated ?
The next thing you knew , the Americans were printing up packs of cards with the faces of most of Saddam ’s missing cronies on them .
Well , that was then .
By now , fierce versions of guerrilla war have migrated to the narrow streets of the poorest districts of Baghdad and , in Afghanistan , are moving ever closer to the Afghan capital , Kabul .
And even though the “ last war ” in Iraq wo n’t end ( so that troops can be transferred to the even older war in Afghanistan that is , now , spiraling out of control ) , inside the Pentagon some are thinking not about how to get out , but about how to get in .
They are pondering “ the next war . ”
With that in mind , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently gave two sharp - edged speeches , one at Maxwell - Gunter Air Force Base , the other at West Point , each expressing his frustration with the slowness of the armed services to adapt to a counterinsurgency planet and to plan for the next war .
Now , there ’s obviously nothing illogical about a country ’s military preparing for future wars .
That ’s what it ’s there for , and every country has the right to defend itself .
But it ’s a different matter when you ’re preparing for future “ wars of choice ” ( which used to be called wars of aggression )  for the next war(s ) on what our secretary of defense now calls the “ the 21st century ’s global commons . ”
By that , he means not just planet Earth in its entirety , but “ space and cyberspace ” as well .
For the American military , it turns out , planning for a future “ defense ” of the United States means planning for planet - wide , over - the - horizon counterinsurgency .
It will , of course , be done better , with a military that , as Gates put it , will no longer be “ a smaller version of the Fulda Gap force . ”
( It was at the Fulda Gap , a German plain , that the U.S. military once expected to meet Soviet forces invading Europe in full - scale battle . )
So the secretary of defense is calling for more foreign - language training , a better “ expeditionary culture , ” and more nation - building  you know , all that “ hearts and minds ” stuff .
In essence , he accepts that the future of American war will , indeed , be in the Sadr Cities and Afghan backlands of the planet ; or , as he says , that “ the asymmetric battlefields of the 21st century ” will be “ the dominant combat environment in the decades to come . ”
And the American response will be high - tech indeed  all those unmanned aerial vehicles that he can’t stop talking about .
Gates describes our war - fighting future in this way : “ What has been called the ‘ Long War ’ [ i.e. , Bush ’s War on Terror , including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ] is likely to be many years of persistent , engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity .
This generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable .
There are no exit strategies . ”
“ There are no exit strategies . ”
That ’s a line to roll around on your tongue for a while .
It ’s a fancy way of saying that the U.S. military is likely to be in one , two , many Sadr Cities for a long time to come .
This is Gates ’ ultimate insight as secretary of defense , and his response is to urge the military to plan for more and better of the same .
For this we give the Pentagon almost a trillion dollars a year .
The irony is that , in both speeches , Gates praises outside - the - box thinking in the military and calls upon the armed services to “ think unconventionally . ”
Yet his own thoughts could n’t be more conventional , imperial , or potentially disastrous .
Put in a nutshell :
If the mission is heading into madness , then double the mission .
Bring in yet more of those drones whose missiles are already so popular in Sadr City .
This is brilliantly prosaic thinking , based on the assumption that the “ global commons ” should be ours and that the “ next war ” will be ours , and the one after that , and so on .
But I would n’t bet on it .
John McCain got a lot of flak for saying that , as far as he was concerned , American troops could stay in Iraq for “ 100 years as long as Americans are not being injured , harmed or killed . ”
Our present secretary of defense , a “ realist ” in an administration of bizarre dreamers and inept gamblers , has just cast his vote for more and better Sadr Cities .
In a Pentagon version of an old Maoist slogan : Let a hundred slum guerrilla struggles bloom !
It ’s a recipe for being bogged down in such wars for 100 years  with the piles of dead rising ever higher .
No wonder some of the top military brass , whom he criticizes for their bureaucratic inertia , have been unenthusiastic .
They do n’t want to spend the rest of their careers fighting hopeless wars in Sadr City or its equivalent .
Who would ?
The rest of us should feel the same way .
Every time you hear the phrase “ the next war ”  and journalists already love it  you should wince .
It means endless war , eternal war , and it ’s the path to madness .
Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan
Do n’t we already have enough examples of American counterinsurgency operations under our belt ?
The American people evidently think so .
For some time now , significant majorities have wanted out of Baghdad , out of Iraq .
All the way out .
In a major survey just released by the influential journal Foreign Affairs , similar majorities have , in essence , “ voted ” for demilitarizing U.S. foreign policy .
In their responses , they offer quite a different approach to how the United States should operate in the world .
According to journalist Jim Lobe , 69 percentof respondents believe “ the U.S. government should put more emphasis on diplomatic and economic foreign policy tools in fighting terrorism , ” not “ military efforts . ”
( Sixty - five percent believe the U.S. should withdraw all its troops from Iraq either “ immediately ” or “ over the next 12 months . ” )
But , of course , no one who matters listens to them .
And yet , the path to Sadr City is one that even an imperialist should want to turn back from .
It ’s the road to Hell , and it ’s paved with the worst of intentions .

Our discussion was cut short as I personally oversaw the transfer of the Great Copper Motherlode to the secure area of our facility ( and 15 minutes after they left , onto a truck bound for cashout ) .
The next time I met him , a year after that , he was backing into my loading dock with a truck half full ( they are n't very big you know ) of thin clients .
" This thin client thing was a disaster .
It was okay for the first 3 / 4 of the rollout , but we kept having to add more servers and more staff to support the servers .
The staff we could let go because we did n't have to do desktop hardware support was all cheap interns — we had to bring in a nearly equal number of highly paid and trained professionals to handle the new duties , nevermind the increased infrastructure costs .
And to make things even worse , the energy consumption was shifted from the general office floor to the datacenter , where it became a ' concern ' and now they want to charge our budget for our datacenter power consumption , because in comparison the rest of the organization is getting so much ' greener . ' "
I 'm meeting him again in a few weeks .
He says he 's bringing me a truckload of servers and network gear that they do n't need in the datacenters anymore .
I t was always so with him .
Now , sadly , it seems so with her .
With Bill and Hillary , it 's all about the Clintons .
On the most historic of nights , when the world watched in amazement as America provided stunning proof of its promise of endless possibilities , she could not bring herself to concede the contest , or the spotlight , to Barack Obama .
If she could not win the Democratic presidential nomination , she would not let him have it cleanly either .
Shocked at trailing and then losing to Obama , the Clintons have behaved incredibly badly .
They ran a dirty campaign , in the George W. Bush mould : playing the race card , the religion card , the fear card and the patriotism card .
They defined Obama in the same terms as the Republicans : he 's exotic , he is n't quite American , he can't be trusted , especially on security .
This was summed up by Bill Clinton : " It 'd be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interests of this country " ( Obama does n't love the country and he does n't have the American interest at heart ) .
The race is being prolonged even after it's over , at the risk of undermining Obama 's candidacy against John McCain .
Has she been hobbled by sexism ?
Sure .
But Obama has been hobbled by racism .
Arguably , his hill to climb was steeper than hers .
Yet he has reached the peak .
He has done so without playing identity politics .
While she claimed to be the torchbearer of " white Americans , " he never claimed to be of blacks ( " There 's no black America and white America , only the United States of America " ) .
While she invoked sisterhood , he did n't invoke black brotherhood .
In fact , blacks came to him long after the young and the educated and the independents had flocked to his banner .
Some voters would n't vote for him because he is black or " a Muslim . "
Many would n't vote for her because of her gender or because she is a Clinton .
But he is more likely to cut into her constituency than she ever could into his .
Hours before her speech Tuesday night in New York , it was clear that he had won enough superdelegates to sew up the nomination .
Yet she was n't going to let go .
That became clear the moment warm - up speaker Terry McAuliffe , her campaign chair , uttered his first words : she was the only candidate who could beat McCain ( Obama could n't ) and be ready on Day 1 at the White House ( Obama would n't be ) .
McAuliffe then introduced her as " the next president of the United States . "
That this was more than mere partisan enthusiasm was made clear by Clinton herself : " Who'll be the strongest candidate and the strongest president ?
Who 'll be ready to take back the White House and take charge as commander - in - chief and lead our country to better tomorrows ? " ( Not Obama . )
Clinton pressed on : she ( not he ) had won " the swing states necessary to get to 270 electoral votes " ( which Obama won't ) .
Having dissed the newly minted Democratic nominee , Clinton started the brush fire of a rebellion :
" I want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be respected , to be heard and no longer to be invisible .
I want to hear from you .
I hope you 'll go to my website ... and share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can . "
That was code language for creating the pressure for Obama to name her his vice - presidential nominee , or give her whatever else she might demand .
Failing that , she could try and withhold her backers from supporting him .
This is more than hardball American politics ; this is blackmail .
She is making a virtue of staying on , saying she is no quitter .
Not being a quitter is a great quality until the time comes to quit .
She has to quit , not because she is a woman but because she has lost .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Research misconduct at U.S. institutions may be more common than previously suspected , with 9 percent of scientists saying in a new survey that they personally had seen fabrication , falsification or plagiarism .
The survey of 2,212 mainly biomedical scientists at 605 universities and other research institutions , published in the journal Nature on Wednesday , also showed that researchers are very reluctant to report bad conduct .
Thirty - seven percent of cases of suspected misconduct were never reported to the institution involved for investigation , perhaps due to fear of reprisals for turning in a colleague or a desire to protect the flow of research money .
“ There ’s more misconduct , or potential for misconduct , out there than probably anyone has appreciated before .
And a good part of that goes unreported , ” James Wells , director of the Office of Research Policy at the University of Wisconsin who helped conduct the survey , said in a telephone interview .
“ Usually what happens is that somebody very close to the research has to observe this going on .
And they have to step forward and report it to their institution in order for something to happen .
And they can very often be jeopardizing themselves , ” added Wells .
Wells did the survey with two experts from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department ’s Office of Research Integrity .
The findings come at a time of concern among U.S. lawmakers and others about research integrity in the United States and abroad , financial conflicts of interest by scientists who get paid by drug companies , and study results being warped by the influence of pharmaceutical industry research funding .
For example , U.S. Sen.
Charles Grassley accuses prominent Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman and others of failing to fully disclose payments from drug companies .
Wells said the new survey , conducted in 2006 , did not look specifically at such financial conflicts of interest .
Instead , it asked scientists to state whether they had seen acts that would meet the government ’s definition of research misconduct -- fabrication , falsification or plagiarism in conducting research , reporting findings or seeking grants .
MISCONDUCT SEEN
In all , 192 scientists -- 8.7 percent -- said they observed or had direct evidence of researchers in their own departments committing suspected research misconduct over the past three academic years .
They described 265 incidents of bad conduct .
Wells and colleagues then evaluated the allegations , and found that some did not meet the threshold of the federal definition of misconduct , leaving 201 cases of misconduct stated by 164 scientists , or 7.4 percent of the respondents .
The findings indicate that more than 2,300 cases of misconduct may be occurring each year at U.S. research sites .
Examples of misconduct reported by the survey respondents include changing data to “ improve ” findings , submitting false data to win a grant and misrepresenting findings .
Wells and his colleagues wrote that the HHS research integrity office receives only about two dozen reports of research misconduct a year , a mere “ tip of the iceberg . ”
Merrill Goozner , who heads the Integrity in Science Project at the activist group Center for Science in the Public Interest , said , “ It ’s really the universities ’ responsibility to police this .
And as we ’ve seen in the ( financial ) conflict - of - interest field , they do a very poor job . ”
Wells noted that there have been no previous comparable national surveys into U.S. research integrity , meaning it is hard to say whether the problem is getting worse , or whether it is any worse in the United States than elsewhere .
One of the most prominent examples of research fraud in recent years involved South Korean researcher Hwang Woo-suk , who admitted in 2006 to fabricating stem cell data .
And the Lord came to Dr. Daniel Low and told him : " Praise the iPhone , for it can make your calls , get your mail , play your music , browse the web , and now help kids go to surgery without having to use sedatives to calm them down ! "
And the Lord — who looked remarkably like this guy — gave him one , and then he took it to the kids at the Seattle Children 's Hospital , where he raised it up on high , saying : " first , shalt thou watch the videos .
Then shalt thou calm the hell down , no more , no less . "
And the children calmed down , and he saw it was good .
So good , in fact , that he has used it for six months with 450 children , reducing the use of drugs by 85 % .
But how does it work ?
Advertisement
Getting children to the operating room is extremely scary for them ( and us too ) , so they usually have to be sedated to calm them down .
Dr. Low observed that by watching some videos on the iPhone , his kids got completely disconnected from the outside world .
He thought that this effect could help children in the hospital get distracted — especially when they leave the room where they wait with their parents — so he gave it a try .
It worked .
And for six months , he has used this method with 450 children , reducing the use of sedatives by 85 % .
The benefit not only makes the children a little bit less nervous : without sedatives , kids wake up smoother and are less drowsy after the operation , so they can get back home more quickly .
Advertisement
Of course , this can be done with any video playing device , but Dr. Low seems to believe that the iPhone is perfect for the job , arguing that it does n't interfere with the equipment and can be easily sanitized .
We are sure that the same can be said about other personal media players , but whatever helps kids is fine with us .

Pulling Digits out of Pi
Posted December 2007 .
In this article , we will investigate how , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , may be computed to an astonishing degree of accuracy ...

Introduction
Nature gives us many important numbers , such as and e , that are not easily represented by human number systems .
For instance , the first fifty digits of
= 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 ...
provide only an approximation of this important number , and we feel compelled to understand numbers like this more deeply .
We might also ask if there is any relationship between important numbers .
For instance , at first glance , and e seem to arise from different areas of mathematics so it would be remarkable to discover that their numerical values are related in some simple way .
In this article , we will investigate how , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , may be computed to an astonishing degree of accuracy .
In fact , we 'll see how to reach deeply inside the hexadecimal representation of to compute any digit that we wish .
We 'll also describe a related new algorithm that allows us to investigate whether simple relationships exist between various numerical constants .
Of course , we would never need to know with 50 - digit accuracy for any " real world " application .
The history of computing , however , is rich so these ideas continue a venerable current of mathematical investigation motivated mainly by our own curiosity .
For computational scientists , computing presents technical challenges , such as how to multiply numbers efficiently , whose solutions are broadly useful .
Earlier computations of pi
The Greek mathematician Archimedes was one of the first to undertake a careful study of .
His technique begins with the unit circle , whose circumference is , and approximates its circumference by the perimeters of inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons .
For instance , the perimeters of the two hexagons shown below will lead to lower and upper bounds on the value of .
We obtain better bounds by increasing the number of sides of the polygons .
If a n denotes the circumference of the circumscribed n - gon ( shown in red ) and b n the circumference of the inscribed n - gon ( shown in blue ) , we have
In the case that n = 6 , the circumferences are easily found to be
Essentially using half - angle identities from trigonometry , Archimedes determined how the perimeter changes when the number of sides doubles to obtain the recurrence relations
In this way , he found the bounds
Ludolph van Ceulen , a German mathematician working in the Netherlands around 1600 , used Archimedes ' technique to compute the first 35 digits of and had the lower and upper approximations inscribed on his tombstone .

Not long after , the development of calculus gave new means of computing , one of which we 'll see now .
Remember that a geometric series has the form :
That is , each term in the sum is formed by multiplying its predecessor by a fixed number r.
If the absolute value of r is less than one , the series converges and may be easily evaluated .
To see this , call the sum S and multiply by r as below :
Now substract the second row from the first to obtain ( 1 - r ) S = 1 so that
If we let r = - u2 , we obtain
and then
If we set x = 1 , we then obtain an expression for that is often attributed to Leibniz :
In practice , this is not a particularly useful way to compute since it converges so slowly .
Here are the approximations given by the first few terms :
n Sum of first n terms 1 4.0000 2 2.6667 3 3.4667 4 2.8952 5 3.3397 6 2.9760 ... ... 1000 3.1406 1001 3.1426
As you can see , after adding a thousand terms , we have only found three digits of .
Euler found a more useful formula ,
,
which may be simply explained using complex multiplication .
Remember that the argument of the complex product ab is the sum of the arguments of a and b.
Euler 's formula then results from the fact that ( 2 + i ) ( 3 + i ) = 5 + 5 i .
Using our series for the arctangent function , we are led to
Adding together the first ten terms of both series gives the approximation 3.1415925796 , accurate in the first seven digits .
This , and other similar formulas involving the arctangent , eventually produced the first few hundreds of digits of .
Of course , all of this was accomplished before the advent of mechanical calculation machines .
Recently , Yasumasa Kanada has computed over one trillion digits of using a similar arctangent formula and about 600 hours of processing time on a supercomputer .
The BBP formula
If we would like to compute a particular digit of , the techniques outlined above require us to compute all the digits that come before using high - precision arithmetic .
In the mid 1990 's , a remarkable new formula for was discovered by David Bailey , Peter Borwein , and Simon Plouffe ( BBP ) :
We 'll describe the discovery of this formula a bit later .
First , we 'll see how this allows us to compute a hexadecimal digit directly without computing all the digits that come before it and without using high - precision arithmetic .
To understand how this works , let 's consider a similar type of formula for ln( 2) =0.69314718056 ....
Remember that
so that
Let 's now look at the binary digits of ln( 2 ) :
If we want to compute the ( n+1 ) th digit d n+1 , we multiply by 2n :
Notice that the digit we wish to find , d n+1 , is the first digit behind the decimal point .
Therefore , d n+1 = 0 if the fractional part of 2n ln( 2 ) is smaller than 0.5 .
Otherwise , d n+1 = 1 .
Therefore , we simply need to compute the fractional part of 2n ln( 2 ) , denoted { 2n ln( 2 ) } , which we do as follows :
The terms in the first sum may be computed efficiently using the well - known binary exponentiation algorithm .
The second term is smaller than 1 /( n+1 ) so if n is large , the second term makes only a small contribution .
Remembering that we only need to determine whether this fractional part is smaller or larger than 0.5 , we simply compute enough terms in the second sum to settle the question .
Turning back to the BBP formula
we see that the presence of 16 k in each of the terms allows us to compute , in a similar fashion , chosen hexadecimal digits of without computing the intermediate digits .
The hexadecimal digits , beginning at the trillion and first , are in fact B4466E8D215388C4E014 .
Recent work has succeeded in computing the quadrillionth ( 1015 ) hexadecimal digit of .
The PSLQ Algorithm
One way to prove the BBP formula is by considering the integral
On one hand , the technique of partial fractions , familiar to most students who have taken a year - long calculus course , shows that this integral equals .
On the other , the geometric series shows that
a fact that enables us to write the integrand as a series that may be integrated term by term .
Putting these two facts together gives the BBP formula .
But how was the BBP formula discovered ?
Certainly not through the integral just described .
Rather , the BBP formula results from the so - called PSLQ algorithm , an algorithm designed to detect integer relations between sets of real numbers .
For instance , if we are given a set of real numbers x 1 , x 2 , ... x n , we may ask if there are integers a 1 , a 2 , ... a n , at least one of which is not zero , such that
a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + ... a n x n = 0 .
For a given set of real numbers , there may be no set of integers a 1 , a 2 , ... a n giving a relation as above .
If there is , however , the PSLQ algorithm will find one such set .
Detecting integer relations has a long history .
For example , Euclid considered this problem in Book X of The Elements for the case when n =
2 .
To explain Euclid 's algorithm , we will call the real numbers A and B .
The requirement that there be integers a 1 and a 2 such that a 1 A + a 2 B = 0 is the same as asking if there is a real number C and integers n and m such that A = nC and B = mC .
( In this case , Euclid said that A and B are commensurable . )
Euclid 's well - known algorithm works in the following way for positive A and B .
If A = B , then there is an integer relation between A and B and the algorithm terminates with C = A = B .
Call B the smaller of the two real numbers and let A = A - B .
Repeat .
If the algorithm terminates , then we have found C so that A = nC and B = mC .
If we let
thus demonstrating an integer relation .
Two illustrations , in which the lengths of the bars represent A and B , of the algorithm are shown below .
In the first case , we find that A and B are commensurable and the value of C is indicated .
In the next case , A = and B = e .
After several steps , the algorithm has not terminated .
Of course , this does not mean that it wo n't if we let it run a while longer ; in practice , we cannot determine that the algorithm will run indefinitely .
We can , however , note that if the algorithm has not terminated , then we can guarantee that C is smaller than the current value of A .
This in turn gives us lower bounds on the integers a 1 and a 2 .
Since Euclid 's time , the problem of generalizing Euclid 's algorithm to sets of more than two real numbers was considered by Euler , Jacobi , and Poincare , among others .
In 1979 , an algorithm was found by Helaman Ferguson and Rodney Forcade and subsequently refined to the PSLQ algorithm by Ferguson , Bailey and Steve Arno .
The PSLQ algorithm is similar to the Euclidean algorithm , which it generalizes :
If there is an integer relation , the algorithm will terminate when it is found .
If the algorithm does not terminate , there is no integer relation .
Of course , we can never know in practice that the algorithm does not terminate ; however , if the algorithm has not terminated after running for a while , we can determine lower bounds on the size of the integers in a relation .
Implementing the PSLQ algorithm presents its own challenges since computers can only work with finite precision arithmetic .
For instance , the real numbers for whom we seek an integer relation can only be approximated by finitely many digits in computer memory .
In addition , the real arithmetic needed in the algorithm will be subject to round - off error .
Because of this , implementations of the PSLQ algorithm are not able to produce definite integer relations .
Instead , the algorithm suggests likely relations , the proofs of which need to be provided independent of the algorithm .
The BBP formula was discovered using the PSLQ algorithm , along with what the authors call " inspired guesswork and extensive searching , " to find an integer relation between and the constants
where j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , 8 .
The formula was then proven using the integral argument given above .
The BBP formula enables us to compute the nth hexadecimal digit of without computing the first n - 1 digits .
At this time , it is not known if a similar formula exists that would allow us to compute arbitrary decimal digits in the same way .
Besides the discovery of the BBP formula for , the PSLQ algorithm has found other uses .
For instance , the algorithm may be used to investigate whether a given real number is an algebraic number ( that is , a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients ) .
In addition , PSLQ has found identities involving constants that arise in quantum field theory from the evaluation of certain Feynman diagrams .
Incidentally , Helaman Ferguson , whose mathematical work has been fundamental in developing integer relation detecting algorithms , is also a sculptor whose art expresses both beauty and mathematical understanding .

Life is so busy these days .
Consequently , we all face stress .
Even me .
Yes , I ’m a busy celebrity whose days are filled with glamour , but I find it ’s important to take a little “ me ” time each day to do a little activity that anybody , even you , can afford .
Daydreaming .
Daydreaming is like a little vacation in your brain , or “ Braincation . ”
Bored at work ?
Take a five minute Braincation to the sandy beaches of Mexico ’s Cozumel .
Follow that up with a couple of real bottles of icy cold beer , and soon work wo n’t feel so boring .
Or maybe you ’re a parent dealing with a couple excitable toddlers .
Do yourself a favor : put the kids in front of the TV for a few minutes and take a Braincation to the top of a snowy mountain .
Schuss down the slopes , taking the time to enjoy the view as you descend to the lodge below .
Then open your eyes and chase down that Braincation with a steaming cup of Irish coffee or two .
The kids will be a lot more manageable after that , believe me .
Here ’s something I do when I ’m feeling stressed by autograph seekers and hangers - on .
I excuse myself to my hotel suite , sit cross-legged on the floor , and imagine myself floating in a hot air balloon over an African savannah .
“ Look down there , a pride of lions ! ” “ And over there , a funny hippopotamus wallowing in the mud . ”
To augment this braincation , I like a bottle of very good champagne .
The whole bottle .
When I emerge from my hotel suite a few minutes later , I feel refreshed and ready to face the world .
It ’s so important to take time for yourself throughout the day .
If you find yourself short on time , you can skip the mental imagery and just go straight for the booze .
If I ’m being honest , that ’s what I usually do .
Who wants to see a fucking hippo , anyway ?
Among the states , only the New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , has publicly signaled his intention to review the matter .
Other states have declined to take action .
When the attorney general of California , Jerry Brown , rejected A.M.D. ’s complaint this year , he said in The San Francisco Chronicle that he was “ not barking at every truck that comes down the street . ”
A.M.D. has accused Intel of systematically giving its customers  the world ’s leading personal computer makers  large discounts , at times below Intel ’s own manufacturing costs , in exchange for commitments not to do business with competitors .
Intel has responded that its discounts were legitimate incentives , not offered below cost , and benefiting customers who can buy computers at lower prices .
Intel has also maintained that A.M.D. tried to make up in the courts for its failures in the marketplace .
While Intel has denied the allegations , A.M.D. executives are hoping the case will present an easy opportunity for the next administration to take a noticeably more aggressive approach to competition issues .
Technically independent of the White House , the trade commission is led by appointees of the president .
D. Bruce Sewell , Intel ’s senior vice president and general counsel , said that because American and foreign antitrust law are fundamentally different , the company is confident of vindication , regardless of the leadership of the Federal Trade Commission next year , when the new president can fill the vacant seat and name its own chairman .
Still , Intel has been planning to increase the size of its Washington operations , a move that could be helpful both for the antitrust case and a variety of other issues before Congress and the regulators that are important to the company .
The official signs of the heightened scrutiny by the commission came in recent days when Intel , Advanced Micro Devices , and several of the world ’s largest personal computer makers that buy semiconductors from the two companies began to receive subpoenas from the agency .
Admittedly , I did n’t follow the Reiser murder case as it unfolded , though I probably should have .
I get the distinct sense looking through all the reporting and media post - conviction , that it ’s highly possible it touched a circle of mine , some way or another .
What drew my attention to the case this weekend was n’t that Hans Reiser had been found guilty of first - degree murder of his wife — and that Reiser has been a notoriously controversial figure in the open source and Linux communities for a long time .
And I was n’t totally surprised to read that a wealthy and notably eccentric figure in our Bay Area ’s rich tapestry of nutty tech entrepreneurs was practically diagnosed with Asperger ’s on the stand .
It was the way Ars Technica drew attention last week to the BDSM and local geek connections that hooked me :
Hans Reiser , the software developer credited with the creating the ReiserFS filesystem , has been found guilty of first - degree murder .
Jurors concluded that Reiser killed his estranged wife , who vanished suddenly in 2006 .
A well - known figure in the open - source software community , Reiser was working on the next - generation version of his filesystem with funding from DARPA and Linspire prior to his arrest .
(…)
When police officers located Hans Reiser ’s vehicle , it was missing one passenger seat , had an inch of standing water in the bottom , and contained two books about police murder investigations , as well as a sleeping bag cover stained with Nina ’s blood .
Reiser himself was found with a fanny pack containing his passport and $ 9,000 when he was interrogated by police during an early stage of the investigation .
Although the prosecution could not locate a body and could provide only circumstantial evidence , Reiser ’s bizarre courtroom behavior and convoluted arguments largely undermined his attempts to defend himself during the trial .
(…)
Although the case against Reiser was strengthened by his inability to provide believable explanations for the various incriminating details presented by the prosecution , there was one piece of evidence in his favor that was barred from being presented during the case .
Sean Sturgeon , a former friend of Hans Reiser and one of Nina ’s lovers during her separation from Hans , confessed to eight unrelated murders .
Nina ended her relationship with Sturgeon in 2006 , partly because she was disturbed by his fetish for sadomasochism .
( … read more )
As Ars put it so eloquently , Reiser is fucked .
And the thing I did n’t see mentioned were the footnotes about Sturgeon , who was extremely important to the whole story .
He was allegedly Hans Reiser ’s best friend at one point , and had cross - dressed as his “ best woman ” for Hans ’ wedding to Nina ( while Sturgeon ’s gf was the “ best man ” ) and according to ABC7 , “ acted as his financial agent from 1999 through 2002 and had access to and control over deposits , withdrawals and funds at the Patelco Credit Union . ”
In that same article , “ In addition , Reiser alleged that Sturgeon wrote into a contract that Reiser must participate in ‘ Death Yoga , ’ which he said has the purpose of ‘ slowing down one ’s heart to the point of death . ’ (…) Reiser said Sturgeon ‘ worked with my wife Nina Reiser and eventually drugged her with ecstasy and seduced her . ’
Reiser alleged , ‘ He then engaged in Bondage , Domination , Sadism and Masochism techniques and continued to redrug her repeatedly over time . ' ”
The courtroom antics of Reiser ’s crazy dad did not help .
Ramon Reiser , a former Army sergeant first class and mathematician , did one - handed push - ups in the courtroom (! ) , then stated testified “ (… ) that he warned his son that he might be surveilled by people associated with the former KGB , ‘ Russian mafia groups in California ’ or ‘ the techno - geek S&M crowd . ' ”
As Ryan Paul put it in his Ars piece , you can find out more grisly details in David Kravets ’ detailed , gavel - to - gavel reports and article about the verdict over at Wired ’s Threat Level .
As for me , I hereby stand up for the reputation of our actual , local techno - geek BDSM crowd .
I hate to see it used in this context , like a weapon .
There ’s a * huge * connection between the kink and tech crowds here , not just personally , but it ’s steeped in many aspects of our geek culture : geekery and sex-positivity , and kinkiness are quite married in the Bay Area .
I think it ’s no coincidence that the heart of technology in this country is also at the national heart of kinkiness , LGBT values and sex-positivity — the Bay Area , especially near to San Francisco .
I ’m working on a column about exactly that this week .
Barack Obama , at a Memorial Day event in Las Cruces , N.M. , credited his great - uncle , Charlie Payne , as being among the U.S. troops who liberated the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz .
The trouble with that bit of history -- as the Republican National Committee pointed out today -- is that the Soviet Red Army was the military force that liberated the World War II death camp .
The RNC seized the opportunity to fire off a news release , saying that “ unless his uncle was serving in the Red Army , there ’s no way Obama ’s statement yesterday can be true .
Obama ’s frequent exaggerations and outright distortions raise questions about his judgment and his readiness to lead as commander in chief . ”
The Obama campaign soon acknowledged that the Democratic candidate made a mistake .
It explained that Obama ’s great - uncle was in the 89th Infantry Division that helped liberate another notorious death camp , Buchenwald .
Obama , the campaign said , “ is proud of the service of his grandfather and uncles in World War II -- especially the fact that his great - uncle was part of liberating of one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald . ”
All of which raises the question :
What 's worse , Obama 's apparent gaffe or the RNC pouncing on a Holocaust - related historical mistake for political advantage ?

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A network of lenders , brokers and opaque financing vehicles outside traditional banking that ballooned during the bull market now is under siege as regulators threaten a crackdown on the so - called shadow banking system .
Big brokerage firms like Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % , Lehman Brothers LEH , , Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % and Merrill Lynch MER , +27.69 % , which some say are the biggest players in this non -bank financial network , may have the most to lose from stricter regulation .
The shadow banking system grew rapidly during the past decade , accumulating more than $ 10 trillion in assets by early 2007 .
That made it roughly the same size as the traditional banking system , according to the Federal Reserve .
While this system became a huge and vital source of money to fuel the U.S. economy , the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch exposed a major flaw .
Unlike regulated banks , which can borrow directly from the government and have federally insured customer deposits , the shadow system did n't have reliable access to short - term borrowing during times of stress .
“ Unless radical changes are made to bring this shadow network under an updated regulatory umbrella , the current crisis may be just a gust compared to the storm that would follow a collapse of the global financial system , experts warn . ”
Such vulnerability helped transform what may have been an uncomfortable correction in credit markets into the worst global credit crunch in more than a decade as monetary policymakers and regulators struggled to contain the damage .
Unless radical changes are made to bring this shadow network under an updated regulatory umbrella , the current crisis may be just a gust compared to the storm that would follow a collapse of the global financial system , experts warn .
" The shadow banking system model as practiced in recent years has been discredited , " Ramin Toloui , executive vice president at bond investment giant Pimco , said .
Toloui expects greater regulation of big brokerage firms which may face stricter capital requirements and requirements to hold more liquid , or easily sellable , assets .
' Clarion call '
" The bright new financial system -- for all its talented participants , for all its rich rewards -- has failed the test of the market place , " Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve , said during a speech in April .
" It all adds up to a clarion call for an effective response . "
Two months later , Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , and others have begun to answer that call .
" The structure of the financial system changed fundamentally during the boom , with dramatic growth in the share of assets outside the traditional banking system , " he warned in a speech last week .
That " made the crisis more difficult to manage . "
On Thursday , Treasury Secretary and former Goldman Chief Executive Henry Paulson said the Fed should be given the authority to collect information from large complex financial institutions and intervene if necessary to stabilize future crises .
Regulators should also have a clear way of taking over and closing a failed brokerage firm , he added .
See full story .
Banking bedrock
The bedrock of traditional banking is borrowing money over the short term from customers who deposit savings in accounts and then lending it back out as mortgages and other higher - yielding loans over longer periods .
The owners of banks are required by regulators to invest some of their own money and reinvest some of the profit to keep an extra level of money in reserve in case the business suffers losses on some of its loans .
That ensures that there 's still enough money to repay all depositors after such losses .
In recent decades , lots of new businesses and investment vehicles have evolved that do the same thing , but outside the purview of traditional banking regulation .
Instead of getting money from depositors , these financial intermediaries often borrow by selling commercial paper , which is a type of short - term loan that has to be re-financed over and over again .
And rather than offering home loans , these entities buy mortgage - backed securities and other more complex securities .
A $ 10 trillion shadow
By early 2007 , conduits , structured investment vehicles and similar entities that borrowed in the commercial paper market and bought longer - term asset - backed securities , held roughly $ 2.2 trillion in assets , according to the Fed 's Geithner .
Another $ 2.5 trillion in assets were financed overnight in the so - called repo market , Geithner said .
Geithner also highlighted big brokerage firms , saying that their combined balance sheets held $ 4 trillion in assets in early 2007 .
Hedge funds held another $ 1.8 trillion , bringing the total value of asset in the " non-bank " financial system to $ 10.5 trillion , he added .
That dwarfed the total assets of the five largest banks in the U.S. , which held just over $ 6 trillion at the time , Geithner noted .
The traditional banking system as a whole held about $ 10 trillion , he said .
“ " These things act like banks , but they 're not . " ” — James Hamilton , Economics professor
While acting like banks , these shadow banking entities were n't subject to the same supervision , so they did n't hold as much capital to cushion against potential losses .
When subprime mortgage losses started last year , their sources of short - term financing dried up .
" These things act like banks , but they 're not , " James Hamilton , professor of economics at the University of California , San Diego , said .
" The fundamental inadequacy of their own capital caused these problems . "
Big brokers targeted
Geithner said the most fundamental reform that 's needed is to regulate big brokerage firms and global banks under a unified system with stronger supervision and " appropriate " requirements for capital and liquidity .
Financial institutions should be persuaded to keep strong capital cushions and more liquid assets during periods of calm in the market , he explained , noting that 's the best way to limit the damage during a crisis .
At a minimum , major investment banks and brokerage firms should adhere to similar rules on capital , liquidity and risk management as commercial banks , Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said on Wednesday .
" It makes sense to extend some form of greater prudential regulation to investment banks , " she said .
Separation dwindled
After the stock market crash of 1929 , the U.S. Congress passed laws that separated commercial banks from investment banks .
The Fed , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and state regulators oversaw commercial banks , which took in customer deposits and lent that money out .
The Securities and Exchange Commission regulated brokerage firms , which underwrote offerings of stocks and corporate bonds .
This separation dwindled during the 1980s and 1990s as commercial banks tried to push into investment banking -- following their large corporate clients which were selling more bonds , rather than borrowing directly from banks .
By 1999 , the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act rolled back Depression - era restrictions , allowing banks , brokerage firms and insurers to merge into financial holding companies that would be regulated by the Fed .
Commercial banks like Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % signed up and developed large investment banking businesses .
However , big brokerage firms like Goldman , Morgan Stanley and Lehman did n't become financial holding companies and stayed out of commercial banking partly to avoid increased regulation by the Fed .
Run on a shadow bank
The Fed 's bailout of Bear Stearns in March will probably change all that , experts said this week .
Bear , a leading underwriter of mortgage securities , almost collapsed after customers and counterparties deserted the firm .
It was like a run on a bank .
But Bear was n't a bank .
It financed a lot of its activity by borrowing short term in repo and commercial paper markets and could n't borrow from the Fed if things got really bad .
Bear 's low capital levels left it with highly leveraged exposures to risky mortgage - related securities , which triggered initial doubts among customers and trading partners .
The Fed quickly helped J.P. Morgan Chase , one of the largest commercial banks , acquire Bear .
To prevent further damage to the financial system , the Fed also started lending directly to brokerage firms for the first time since the Depression .
" They stepped in because Bear was facing a traditional bank run -- customers were pulling short - term assets and the firm could n't sell its long - term assets quickly enough , " Hamilton said .
" Rules should apply here :
You should have enough of your own capital available to pay back customers to avoid a run like that . "
Bear necessity
A more worrying question from the Bear Stearns debacle is why customers and investors were willing to lend money to the firm in the absence of an adequate capital cushion , Hamilton said .
" The creditors thought that Bear was too big to fail and that the government would step in to prevent creditors losing their money , " he explained .
" They were right because that 's exactly what happened . "
" This is a system in which institutions like Bear Stearns are taking far too much risk and a lot of that risk is being borne by the government , not these firms or the market , " he added .
The Fed has lent between $ 8 billion and more than $ 30 billion each week directly to brokerage firms since it set up its new program in March .
Most experts say this source of emergency funding is unlikely to disappear , even though it 's scheduled to end in September .
" It 's almost impossible to go back , " FDIC 's Bair said on Wednesday .
With taxpayer money permanently on the line to save big brokers , these firms should now be more strictly regulated to keep future bailouts to a minimum , Bair and others said .
" By definition , if they 're going to give the investment banks access to the window , I for one do believe they have the right for oversight , " Richard Fuld , chief executive of Lehman , told analysts during a conference call this week .
" What that means , though , particularly as far as capital levels or asset requirements , it 's way too early to tell . "
Super Fed
Next year , Congress likely will pass legislation forcing big brokerage firms to be regulated fully by the Fed as financial holding companies , Brad Hintz , a securities analyst at Bernstein Research and former chief financial officer of Lehman , said .
Legislators will probably also call for tighter limits on the leverage and trading risk taken on by large brokers , while demanding more conservative funding and liquidity policies , he added .
Restrictions on these firms ' forays into venture capital , private equity , real estate , commodities and potentially hedge funds may also follow too , Hintz warned .
This may undermine the source of much of the surging profit generated by big brokerage firms in recent years .
A newly empowered " super Fed " will likely encourage these firms to arrange longer - term , more secure sources of borrowing and even promote the development of deposit bases , just like commercial and retail banks , the analyst explained .
This will make borrowing more expensive for brokerage firms , undermining the profitability of businesses that require a lot of capital , such as fixed income , institutional equities , commodities and prime brokerage , Hintz said .
Such regulatory changes will cut big brokers ' return on equity -- a closely watched measure of profitability -- to roughly 15.5 % from 19 % , Hintz estimated in a note to investors this week .
Lehman and Goldman will be most affected by this -- seeing return on equity drop by about four percentage points over the business cycle -- because they have larger trading books and greater exposure to revenue from sales and trading .
Goldman also has a major merchant banking business that may also be constrained , Hintz added .
Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch MER , +27.69 % will see declines of 3.2 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points in their return on equity , the analyst forecast .
If you can't beat them ...
Facing lower returns and more stringent bank - like regulation , some big brokerage firms may decide they 're better off as part of a large commercial bank , some experts said .
" If you 're being regulated like a bank and your leverage ratio looks something like a bank 's , can you really earn the returns you were making as a broker dealer ?
Probably not , " Margaret Cannella , global head of credit research at J.P. Morgan , said .
Regulatory changes will be unpopular with some brokerage CEOs and could result in a shakeup of the industry and more consolidation , she added .
Hintz said the business models of some brokerage firms may evolve into something similar to Bankers Trust and the old J.P. Morgan .
In the mid 1990s , Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan relied more on deposits and less on the repo market to finance their assets .
They also operated with leverage ratios of roughly 20 times capital .
That 's lower than today 's brokerage firms , which were levered roughly 30 times during the peak of the credit bubble last year , according to Hintz .
That ’s a good preview of how Republicans will attack Michelle , suggesting that she does not share American values , mining a subtext of race .

She ’s a devoted daughter , wife and mother who has lived the American dream , from the humble South Side of Chicago to Harvard Law School .
Hey , is n’t it totally unAmerican to complain that being a black woman in the ’ 80s at a class - conscious , white - bread college , Princeton , was somewhat uncomfortable ?
Just as Bill and Hillary did the “ Pssst !
He ’s black ! ” thing on Barry , now the Republicans will use the same tactic on the strong and opinionated Michelle .
Unlike her husband , who wrote in his memoir that he had learned at a young age to smile and charm and disarm whites of the notion that he might be a bristly black militant , Michelle has not always hidden her jangly opinions so well .
She has spent more time dwelling on the ways in which society can pull down the less privileged and refers a lot to a callous but unnamed “ They . ”
“ Michelle , ” as one political observer puts it , “ is a target - rich environment . ”
Team Obama is hoping for the best .
When she ’s on her game , after all , Michelle is a knockout .
And as one Obama booster enthuses : “ Michelle ’s story is a lot more mainstream American than Cindy McCain inheriting a brewery . ”
But the campaign is preparing for the worst , planning to shore up Michelle with her own slick and quick war room staffed by top operatives from previous campaigns .
David Axelrod thinks “ there ’s a real recoil potential ” if the Republicans go after Michelle .
“ I do n’t think she ’s projecting herself into the fray in a way that would justify that , ” he said , adding that her charming and polite daughters , Malia and Sasha , are walking testimony to Michelle ’s “ loving parenting . ”
Online casinos allows us to play poker , slots games , card games , and many other through internet without having to visit the land based Casinos .
Some of them are free and played for points but there are some that allows us to bet real money and we can cash out our winnings too .
People may wonder if it 's legal to bet on such casinos .
Well , it 's legal in European countries but the law regarding online betting varies according to state or country .
As far as I have known , it 's legal as long as you are over 18 or 21 ( age limit varies according to the website ) .
Betting online has various advantages , like you can bet from anywhere , anytime ; you do n't have to wait for your turn or you do n't have to leave …
Barack Obama has unveiled his plan for saving Social Security and it consists , unsurprisingly , of a massive tax increase .
In addition to his plans for raising tax rates on capital gains and dividend income and repealing the Bush tax cuts , Obama now proposes to increase the amount of income subject to Social Security payroll ( FICA ) taxes .
Under current law , Social Security taxes ( 6.2 % for both employers and employees ) are imposed on income up to $ 102,000 , which is indexed for inflation in future years .
Obama claims that it is “ unfair ” for middle - class earners to pay the Social Security tax " on every dime they make , " while millionaires and billionaires pay it on only " a very small percentage of their income . "
For some time , Obama ’s website
This would have the effect of raising taxes on millions of upper middle class voters ; thus , last week
If Obama has his way , therefore , Social Security payroll taxes would resemble a “ donut hole ” – i.e. , only incomes up to $ 102,000 and above $ 250,000 would be subject to FICA taxation , while incomes between $ 102,000 and $ 250,000 would be spared .
Obama claims that the tax would hit only 3 % of the wealthiest taxpayers .
However , there is one problem with this : he does not indicate whether the $ 250,000 threshold will be indexed for inflation .
If the higher threshold is not indexed , then the donut hole will grow smaller and smaller in the years to come and eventually disappear .
This is because the lower figure is subject to indexing and increases each year .
In 2006 , the FICA taxation threshold was $ 94,200 ; in 2007 , it grew to $ 97,500 , and this year it is $ 102,000 .
If the higher threshold remains static , more and more middle class taxpayers will be subject to FICA .
A tax designed to punish the wealthy will end up ensnaring middle income earners .
Moreover , under current rules , Social Security caps both benefits and earnings .
Thus , unless Obama also favors paying more Social Security benefits to the wealthier earners -- highly unlikely -- then his plan undermines Social Security ’s historic role as a basic social safety net rather than a program that redistributes income .
This realization has triggered criticism
The revenue boost that Obama seeks , of course , assumes that the most productive sector of the economy will supinely pay this tax .
That ’s unlikely too .
Even before the plan was officially announced , financial planners were urging
• For those with discretionary income , take a bonus or exercise stock options this year before a new administration takes office
• For the self - employed ( who have to pay both the employer and employee portions of the tax ) , consider reducing the amount of salary they pay themselves
• Consider putting more money in a deferred compensation arrangement .
I learned this lesson intellectually some time ago , but it was driven home to me over the last week : philosophers with different paradigms will find no central question , no decisive claim , that will provide an objective ruling in favor of one paradigm or the other .
The lesson was taught most famously by Thomas Kuhn in his Theory of Scientific Revolutions .
Kuhn focused on the debate between Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomers , and argued that the Copernican revolution in fact was not triggered by any objective observation or test .
The Ptolemaic astronomers could account for everything Copernicus could – indeed , with greater accuracy – and once the Copernican system was revved up to match Ptolemy ’s , in predictive accuracy , it was every bit as complicated as the Ptolemaic system .
( With one exception : Copernicus needed epicycles and eccentrics , he did n’t need equants ; still , small shavings from Occam ’s razor . )
Why then did the revolution occur ?
According to Kuhn , the young astronomers were excited by the radicalness of Copernicus ’s view , the old astronomers died , and the young ones took their jobs .
Hardly a rational way of doing science .
It should be no surprise that the same is true in philosophy .
My friend and I were arguing about the biomechanics of life , and whether materialism had all the answers , or whether something Aristotelian is needed ( an immaterial form ) .
I kept insisting that “ livingness ” is a matter of complexity : arrange the parts in the right way and it ’s alive , nothing immaterial needed .
My friend kept insisting that “ the right arrangement ” is in fact what Aristotle means by “ form , ” and so it is required , and obviously an “ arrangement ” is immaterial .
I responded that he was turning an adverb into a noun : a “ way ” into a “ thing . ”
And we kept going round and round , until we were left just giving one another incredulous stares , wondering how any intelligent and informed person could not agree with what each of us was saying .
“ Incommensurable ” means “ no common measure . ”
And that ’s the situation we were in , and the situation the Copernican and Ptolemaic astronomers were in : there was no question that could be formulated , no decisive test proposed , that would clearly say , “ This one is right and that one is wrong . ”
Each paradigm had its own way of answering each question or interpreting each test or observation .
So , if someone does switch sides , it ’s not for any genuinely compelling argument : it ’s a vague matter of “ what fits best ” given that individual ’s experiences , preferences , and values .
Now not every dispute is incommensurable in this way .
Once two people share a paradigm , there ’s lots of stuff that can be settled through experiments and arguments .
And some paradigms might be subject to practical refutation , if not theoretically pure refutation .
( Meaning , the theory gets so cumbersome and wonky that it just appears silly to defend it . )
But it seems that on many big , very big questions , incommensurability stops us from getting any clear sight of the truth .
The same rules of physics that govern molecules as they condense from gas to liquid , or freeze from liquid to solid , also apply to the activity patterns of neurons in the human brain .
University of Chicago mathematician Jack Cowan will offer this and related insights on the physics of brain activity this week in Boston during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
“ Structures built from a very large number of units can exhibit sharp transitions from one state to another state , which physicists call phase transitions , ” said Cowan , a Professor in Mathematics and Neurology at Chicago .
“ Strange and interesting things happen in the neighborhood of a phase transition . ”
When liquids undergo phase transitions , they evaporate into gas or freeze into ice .
When the brain undergoes a phase transition , it moves from random to patterned activity .
“ The brain at rest produces random activity , ” Cowan said , or what physicists call “ Brownian motion . ”
Although the bulk of his work involves deriving equations , Cowan ’s findings mesh well with laboratory data generated on the cerebral cortex and electroencephalograms .
His latest findings show that the same mathematical tools physicists use to describe the behavior of subatomic particles and the dynamics of liquids and solids can now be applied to understanding how the brain generates its various rhythms .
These include the delta waves generated during sleep , the alpha waves of the visual brain , and the gamma waves , discovered during the last decade , which seem related to information processing .
“ The resting state of brain activity seems to have a statistical structure that ’s characteristic of a certain kind of phase transition , ” Cowan said .
“ The brain likes to sit there because that ’s the place where information processing is optimized . ”
Cowan organized a session for AAAS on Mathematics and the Brain , which will take place from 8:30 to 10 a.m. EST Saturday , Feb. 16 .
He also will participate in a news briefing on the topic at 3 p.m. EST Friday , Feb. 15 .
Joining him at both events will be mathematician Nancy Kopell of Boston University and computational neuroscientist Tomaso Poggio of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
At this stage of his research , Cowan said it would be premature and speculative for him to try to relate how phase transitions in the brain might relate to neurological conditions or states of human consciousness .
“ That ’s for the future , ” he said .
Another component of his latest research is the close relationship between spontaneous pattern formation in brain circuits and in chemical reaction networks .
In this research , he shows how mathematics can help explain visual hallucinations and how the visual cortex obtained its stripes , which are visible to the naked eye when removed from cadavers .
“ This line of research on pattern formation can be traced back to Alan Turing , who also founded the modern science of computation , ” said Terrence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , Calif. , who is a leading specialist in computational neurobiology .
Cowan ’s quest to understand the brain ’s workings using numerical methods spans more than four decades .
Along the way he has collaborated with a series of Ph.D. students and colleagues in physics , mathematics , biology and neuroscience .
In 1972 , he and postdoctoral fellow Hugh Wilson , now of Canada ’s York University , formulated a set of equations that could describe the dynamics of neural networks .
Now called “ Wilson - Cowan equations , ” they became a mainstay of neural network research .
“ But I always knew that those equations were inadequate , so I kept thinking about them , ” Cowan said .
Then in 1985 , he ran across an article in a Japanese journal that described a statistical physics approach to chemical reaction networks .
“ It took me years to understand how to use these tools for biological networks , ” he said .
“ It so happens that there is an analogy between the behavior of chemical reaction networks and neural networks . ”
His research career began in 1962 , when as a graduate student in electrical engineering , he worked with the founders of neural network theory .
These included Norbert Wiener , who died in 1964 , before they could work jointly on the problem that Cowan continues to address .
“ I did n’t really understand what he was saying to me until I worked it out myself .
He was one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century , ” Cowan said .

It ’s a jungle out there — and a desert , an ocean and a savanna , too .
So it helps to know your enemies .
While many animals can tell friend from foe , relatively few have been shown to be able to distinguish among predator species based on the type of threat they represent .
A potentially even more useful ability would be to be able to tell which of several groups of a single predator species are the ones to worry about .
African elephants , it turns out , have this ability .
Lucy A. Bates and Richard W. Byrne of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and colleagues have demonstrated that using odor and visual cues elephants are able to classify subgroups within a predator species .
The species in question ?
Homo sapiens .

In a report in Current Biology , the researchers describe their experiments in Amboseli National Park in Kenya .
Elephants in the region encounter different ethnic groups , including the Maasai , whose young men spear elephants , and the Kamba , agricultural villagers who pose no threat at all .

“ Carole Smith describes claims that neuroscientists are developing brain scans that can read people ’s intentions in the absence of serious discussions about the ethical issues this raises , despite the fact that the research has been backed by government in the UK and US . ”
HACKING THE MIND
“ We need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society .
The purpose is physical control of the mind .
Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated .
The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence , but this is only his personal point of view .
This lacks historical perspective .
Man does not have the right to develop his own mind .
This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal .
We must electronically control the brain .
Someday armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain .
Dr José Delgado .
Director of Neuropsychiatry , Yale University Medical School Congressional Record , No. 26 , Vol. 118 February 24 , 1974 .
The Guardian newspaper , that defender of truth in the United Kingdom , published an article by the Science Correspondent , Ian Sample , on 9 February 2007 entitled :
‘ The Brain Scan that can read people ’s intentions ’ , with the sub - heading : ‘ Call for ethical debate over possible use of new technology in interrogation ” .
“ Using the scanner , we could look around the brain for this information and read out something that from the outside there 's no way you could possibly tell is in there .
It 's like shining a torch around , looking for writing on a wall ” , the scientists were reported as saying .
At the same time , London ’s Science Museum was holding an exhibition entitled ‘ Neurobotics : The Future of Thinking ’ .
This venue had been chosen for the launch in October 2006 of the news that human thoughts could be read using a scanner .
Dr Geraint Rees ’ smiling face could be seen in a photograph at the Neurobotics website [ 1 ] , under the heading “ The Mind Reader ” .
Dr Rees is one of the scientists who have apparently cracked the problem which has preoccupied philosophers and scientists since before Plato : they had made entry into the conscious mind .
Such a reversal of human historical evolution , announced in such a pedestrian fashion , makes one wonder what factors have been in play , and what omissions made , in getting together this show , at once banal and extraordinary .
The announcement arrives as if out of a vacuum .
The neuroscientist - modern - style hunter - gatherer of information and darling of the “ Need to Know ” policies of modern government - does little to explain how he achieved this goal of entering the conscious mind , nor does he put his work into any historical context .
Instead , we are asked in the Science Museum ’s programme notes :
How would you feel if someone could read your innermost thoughts ?
Geraint Rees of UCL says he can .
By using brain - imaging technology he 's beginning to decode thought and explore the difference between the conscious and unconscious mind .
But how far will it go ?
And should n’t your thoughts remain your personal business ?
If Dr Rees has decoded the mind sufficiently for such an announcement to be made in an exhibition devoted to it , presumably somewhere is the mind which has been , and is continuing to be , decoded .
He is not merely continuing his experiments using functional magnetic resolution scanning ( fMRI ) in the way neuroscientists have been observing their subjects under scanning devices for years , asking them to explain what they feel or think while the scientists watch to see which area lights up , and what the cerebral flow in the brain indicates for various brain areas .
Dr Rees is decoding the mind in terms of conscious and unconscious processes .
For that , one must have accessed consciousness itself .
Whose consciousness ?
Where is the owner of that consciousness – and unconsciousness ?
How did he / she feel ?
Why not ask them to tell us how it feels , instead of asking us .
The Neurobotics Exhibition was clearly set up to make these exciting new discoveries an occasion for family fun , and there were lots of games for visitors to play .
One gets the distinct impression that we are being softened up for the introduction of radical new technology which will , perhaps , make the mind a communal pool rather than an individual possession .
Information technology seeks to connect us all to each other in as many ways as possible , but also , presumably , to those vast data banks which allow government control not only to access all information about our lives , but now also to our thoughts , even to our unconscious processing .
Does anyone care ?
One of the most popular exhibits was the ‘ Mindball ’ game , which required two players to go literally head - to - head in a battle for brainpower , and used ‘ brainpower ’ alone .
Strapped up with headbands which pick up brain waves , the game uses neurofeedback , but the person who is calm and relaxed wins the game .
One received the impression that this calmness was the spirit that the organisers wished to reinforce , to deflect any undue public panic that might arise from the news that private thoughts could now be read with a scanner .
[ 2 ]
The ingress into the mind as a private place was primarily an event to be enjoyed with the family on an afternoon out :
Imagine being able to control a computer with only the power of your mind .
Or read people ’s thoughts and know if they ’re lying .
And what if a magnetic shock to the brain could make you more creative … but should we be able to engineer our minds ?
Think your thoughts are private ?
Ever told a lie and been caught red-handed ?
Using brain - scanning technology , scientists are beginning to probe our minds and tell if we ’re lying .
Other scientists are decoding our desires and exploring the difference between our conscious and unconscious mind .
But can you really trust the technology ?
Other searching questions are raised in the program notes , and more games :
Find out if you ’ve got what it takes to be a modern - day spy in this new interactive family exhibition .
After being recruited as a trainee spy , explore the skills and abilities required by real agents and use some of the latest technologies that help spies gather and analyse information .
Later go on and discover what it ’s like to be spied upon .
Uncover a secret store of prototype gadgets that give you a glimpse into the future of spy technologies and finally use everything you ’ve learnt to escape before qualifying as a fully - fledged agent !
There were also demonstrations of grateful paraplegics and quadriplegics showing how the gods of science have so unselfishly liberated them from their prisons : this was the serious Nobel Prize side of the show .
But there was no - one representing Her Majesty ’s government to demonstrate how these very same devices [ 3 ] can be used quite freely , and with relative ease , in our wireless age [ 4 ] , to conduct experiments on free - ranging civilians tracked anywhere in the world , and using an infinitely extendable form of electrode which does n’t require visible contact with the scalp at all .
Electrodes , like electricity , can also take an invisible form – an electrode is a terminal of an electric source through which electrical energy or current may flow in or out .
The brain itself is an electrical circuit .
Every brain has its own unique resonating frequency .
The brain is an infinitely more sensitive receiver and transmitter than the computer , and even in the wireless age , the comprehension of how wireless networks operate appears not to extend to the workings of the brain .
The monotonous demonstration of scalps with electrodes attached to them , in order to demonstrate the contained conduction of electrical charges , is a scientific fatuity , in so far as it is intended to demonstrate comprehensively the capability of conveying charges to the brain , or for that matter , to any nerve in the body , as a form of invisible torture .
As Neurobotics claims : ‘ Your brain is amazing ’ , but the power and control over brains and nervous systems achieved by targeting brain frequencies with radiowaves must have been secretly amazing government scientists for many years .
The problem that now arises , at the point of readiness when so much has been achieved , is how to put the technology into action in such a way , as it will be acceptable in the public domain .
This requires getting it through wider government and legal bodies , and for that , it must be seen to spring from the unbiased scientific investigations into the workings of the brain , in the best tradition of the leading universities .
It is given over to Dr Rees and his colleague , Professor Haynes , endowed with the disclosure for weightier Guardian readers , to carry the torch for the government .
Those involved may also have noted the need to show the neuroscientist in a more responsible light , following US neuroengineer for government sponsored Lockheed Martin , John Norseen ’s , ingenuous comment , in 2000 , about his belief about the consequences of his work in fMRI :
‘ If this research pans out ’ , said Norseen , ‘ you can begin to manipulate what someone is thinking even before they know it . ’
And added : “ The ethics do n’t concern me , but they should concern someone else . ”
While the neuroscientists report their discovery ( without even so much as the specific frequency of the light employed by this scanner / torch ) , issuing ethical warnings while incongruously continuing with their mind - blowing work , the government which sponsors them , remains absolutely mute .
The present probing of people ’s intentions , minds , background thoughts , hopes and emotions [ 5 ] is being expanded into the more complex and subtle aspects of thinking and feeling .
We have , however , next to no technical information about their methods .
The description of ‘ shining a torch around the brain ’ is as absurd a report as one could read of a scientific endeavour , especially one that carries such enormous implications for the future of mankind .
What is this announcement , with its technical obfuscation , preparing us for ?
Writing in Wired [ 6 ] contributing editor Steve Silberman points out that the lie-detection capability of fMRI is ‘ poised to transform the security system , the judicial system , and our fundamental notions of privacy ’ .
He quotes Cephos founder , Steven Laken , whose company plans to market the new technology for lie detection .
Laken cites detainees held without charge at Guantanamo Bay as a potential example .
‘ If these detainees have information we have n’t been able to extract that could prevent another 9/11 , I think most Americans would agree that we should be doing whatever it takes to extract it ’.
Silberman also quotes Paul Root Wolpe , a senior fellow at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania , who describes the accelerated advances in fMRI as ‘ a textbook example of how something can be pushed forward by the convergence of basic science , the government directing research through funding , and special interests who desire a particular technology ’ .
Are we to believe that with the implied capability to scan jurors ’ brains , the judiciary , the accused and the defendant alike , influencing [ 7 ] one at the expense of the other , that the legal implications alone of mind - accessing scanners on university campuses , would not rouse the Minister for Justice from his bench to say a few words about these potential mind weapons ?
So what of the ethical debate called for by the busy scientists and the Guardian ’s science reporter ? [ 8 ]
Can this technology - more powerful in subverting thought itself than anything in prior history – really be confined to deciding whether the ubiquitously invoked terrorist has had the serious intention of blowing up the train , or whether it was perhaps a foolish prank to make a bomb out of chapatti flour ?
We can assume that the government would certainly not give the go - ahead to the Science Museum Exhibition , linked to Imperial College , a major government - sponsored institution in laser - physics , if it was detrimental to surveillance programs .
It is salutary to bear in mind that government intelligence research is at least ten years ahead of any public disclosure .
It is implicit from history that whatever affords the undetectable entry by the gatekeepers of society into the brain and mind , will not only be sanctioned , but funded and employed by the State , more specifically by trained operatives in the security forces , given powers over defenceless citizens , and unaccountable to them . [ 9 ]
The actual technology which is now said to be honing the technique ‘ to distinguish between passing thoughts and genuine intentions ’ is described by Professor John - Dylan Haynes in the Guardian in the most disarmingly untechnical language which must surely not have been intended to enlighten .
The Guardian piece ran as follows :
A team of world - leading neuroscientists has developed a powerful technique that allows them to look deep inside a person ’s brain and read their intentions before they act .
The research breaks controversial new ground in scientists ’ ability to probe people ’s minds and eavesdrop on their thoughts , and raises serious ethical issues over how brain - reading technology may be used in the future .
‘ Using the scanner , we could look around the brain for this information and read out something that from the outside there 's no way you could possibly tell is in there .
It 's like shining a torch around , looking for writing on a wall , ’ said John - Dylan Haynes at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany , who led the study with colleagues at University College London and Oxford University .
We know therefore that they are using light , but fMRI has been used for many years to attempt the unravelling of neuronal activity , and while there have been many efforts to record conscious and unconscious processes , with particular emphasis on the visual cortex , there has been no progress into consciousness itself .
We can be sure that we are not being told the real story .
Just as rats and chimpanzees have been used to demonstrate findings from remote experiments on humans , electrode implants used on cockroaches to remotely control them , lasers used to steer fruit - flies [ 10 ] [ 11 ] , and worms engineered so that their nerves and muscles can be controlled with pinpricks of light [ 12 ] , the information and techniques that have been ruthlessly forged using opportunistic onslaughts on defenceless humans as guinea pigs - used for myriad purposes from creating 3D haptic gloves in computer games to creating artificial intelligence to send visual processing into outer space - require appropriate replication for peer group approval and to meet ethical demands for scientific and public probity .
The use of light to peer into the brain is almost certainly that of terahertz , which occurs in the wavelengths which lie between 30 mm and 1 mm of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Terahertz has the ability to penetrate deep into organic materials , without ( it is said ) the damage associated with ionising radiation such as x-rays .
It can distinguish between materials with varying water content – for example fat versus lean meat .
These properties lend themselves to applications in process and quality control as well as biomedical imaging .
Terahertz can penetrate bricks , and also human skulls .
Other applications can be learnt from the major developer of terahertz in the UK , Teraview , which is in Cambridge , and partially owned by Toshiba .
Efforts to alert human rights ’ groups about the loss of the mind as a place to call your own , have met with little discernible reaction , in spite of reports about over decades of the dangers of remote manipulation using technology to access the mind [ 13 ] , Dr Nick Begich ’s book , Controlling the human mind [ 14 ] , being an important recent contribution .
A different approach did in fact , elicit a response .
When informed of the use of terahertz at Heathrow and Luton airports in the UK to scan passengers , the news that passengers would be revealed naked by a machine which looked directly through their clothes produced a small , but highly indignant , article in the spring 2007 edition of the leading human rights organisation , Liberty . [ 15 ]
If the reading of the mind met with no protest , seeing through one ’s clothes certainly did .
It seems humans ’ assumption of the mind as a private place has been so secured by evolution that it will take a sustained battle to convince the public that , through events of which we are not yet fully informed , such former innocence has been lost .
Trained light , targeted atomic spectroscopy , the use of powerful magnets to absorb moisture from human tissues , the transfer of radiative energy – these have replaced the microwave harassment which was used to transmit auditory messages directly into the hearing . [ 16 ]
With the discovery of light to disentangle thousands of neurons and encode signals from the complex circuitry of the brain , present programs will not even present the symptoms which simulated schizoid states .
Medically , even if terahertz does not ionise , we do not yet know how the sustained application of intense light will affect the delicate workings of the brain and how cells might be damaged , dehydrated , stretched , obliterated .
This year , 2007 , has also brought the news that terahertz lasers small enough to incorporate into portable devices had been developed . [ 17 ]
Sandia National Laboratories in the US in collaboration with MIT have produced a transmitter - receiver ( transceiver ) that enables a number of applications .
In addition to scanning for explosives , we may also assume their integration into hand - held communication systems .
‘ These semiconductor devices have output powers which previously could only be obtained by molecular gas lasers occupying cubic meters and weighing more than 100kg , or free electron lasers weighing tons and occupying buildings . ’
As far back as 1996 the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board predicted that the development of electromagnetic energy sources would ‘ open the door for the development of some novel capabilities that can be used in armed conflict , in terrorist / hostage situations , and in training ’ and ‘ new weapons that offer the opportunity of control of an adversary … can be developed around this concept ’ . [ 18 ]
The surveillance technology of today is the surveillance of the human mind and , through access to the brain and nervous system , the control of behaviour and the body ’s functions .
The messaging of auditory hallucinations has given way to silent techniques of influencing and implanting thoughts .
The development of the terahertz technologies has illuminated the workings of the brain , facilitated the capture of emitted photons which are derived from the visual cortex which processes picture formation in the brain , and enabled the microelectronic receiver which has , in turn , been developed by growing unique semi-conductor crystals .
In this way , the technology is now in place for the detection and reading of spectral ‘ signatures ’ of gases .
All humans emit gases .
Humans , like explosives , emit their own spectral signature in the form of a gas .
With the reading of the brain ’s electrical frequency , and of the spectral gas signature , the systems have been established for the control of populations – and with the necessary technology integrated into a cell - phone .
‘ We are very optimistic about working in the terahertz electromagnetic spectrum , ’ says the principal investigator of the Terahertz Microelectronics Transceiver at Sandia : ‘ This is an unexplored area , and a lot of science can come out of it .
We are just beginning to scratch the surface of what THz can do to improve national security ’ .

Rex Tomb , Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI responded , “ The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Osama bin Laden ’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 . ”
Tomb continued , “ Bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection to 9/11 . ”
Asked to explain the process , Tomb responded , “ The FBI gathers evidence .
Once evidence is gathered , it is turned over to the Department of Justice .
The Department of Justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury .
In the case of the 1998 United States Embassies being bombed , bin Laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury .
He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9/11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 . ”
Haas pauses to ask the question , “ If the US government does not have enough hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 , how is it possible that it had enough evidence to invade Afghanistan to ‘ smoke him out of his cave ? ’ ”
Through corporate media , the Bush administration told the American people that bin Laden was “ Public Enemy Number One , ” responsible for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people on September 11 , 2001 .
The federal government claims to have invaded Afghanistan to “ root out ” bin Laden and the Taliban , yet nearly six years later , the FBI said that it had no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 .
Though the world was to have been convinced by the December 2001 release of a bin Laden “ confession video , ” the Department of Defense issued a press release to accompany this video in which Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said , “ There was no doubt of bin Laden ’s responsibility for the 9/11 attacks even before the tape was discovered . ”
In a CNN article regarding the bin Laden tape , then New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said that “ the tape removes any doubt that the US military campaign targeting bin Laden and his associates is more than justified . ”
Senator Richard Shelby , R - Alabama , the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said , “ The tape ’s release is central to informing people in the outside world who do n’t believe bin Laden was involved in the September 11 attacks . ”
Shelby went on to say “ I do n’t know how they can be in denial after they see this tape . ”
Haas attempted to secure a reference to US government authentication of the bin Laden “ confession video , ” to no avail .
However , it is conclusive that the Bush Administration and US Congress , along with corporate media , presented the video as authentic .
So why does n’t the FBI view the “ confession video ” as hard evidence ?
After all , notes Haas , if the FBI is investigating a crime such as drug trafficking , and it discovers a video of members of a drug cartel openly talking about a successful distribution operation in the United States , that video would be presented to a federal grand jury .
The participants identified in the video would be indicted .
The video alone would serve as sufficient evidence to net a conviction in a federal court .
So why , asks Haas , is the bin Laden “ confession video ” not carrying the same weight with the FBI ?
Haas strongly suggests that we begin asking questions , “ The fact that the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Osama bin Laden to 9/11 should be headline news around the world .
The challenge to the reader is to find out why it is not .
Why has the US media blindly read the government - provided 9/11 scripts , rather than investigate without passion , prejudice , or bias , the events of September 11 , 2001 ?
Why has the US media blacklisted any guest that might speak of a government - sponsored 9/11 cover - up , rather than seeking out those people who have something to say about 9/11 that is contrary to the government ’s account ? ”
Haas continues .
“ Who is controlling the media message , and how is it that the FBI has no ‘ hard evidence ’ connecting Osama bin Laden to the events of September 11 , 2001 , while the US media has played the bin Laden - 9/11 connection story for [ six ] years now as if it has conclusive evidence that bin Laden is responsible for the collapse of the twin towers , the Pentagon attack , and the demise of United Flight 93 ? ”
UPDATE BY ED HAAS
On June 6 , 2006 the Muckraker Report ran a piece by Ed Haas titled “ FBI says , ‘ No hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11 . ’ ”
Haas is the editor and a writer for the Muckraker Report .
At the center of this article remains the authenticity and truthfulness of the videotape released by the federal government on December 13 , 2001 in which it is reported that Osama bin Laden “ confesses ” to the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
The corporate media — television , radio , and newspapers — across the United States and the world repeated , virtually non -stop for a week after the videotape ’s release , the government account of OBL “ confessing . ”
However , not one document has been released that demonstrates the authenticity of the videotape or that it even went through an authentication process .
The Muckraker Report has submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to the FBI , CIA , Department of Defense , and CENTCOM requesting documentation that would demonstrate the authenticity of the videotape and the dates / circumstances in which the videotape was discovered .
CENTCOM has yet to reply to the FOIA request .
After losing an appeal , the FBI responded that no documents could be found responsive to the request .
The Department of Defense referred the Muckraker Report to CENTCOM while also indicating that it had no documents responsive to the FOIA request either .
The CIA however claims that it can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to the request .
According to the CIA the fact of the existence or nonexistence of requested records is properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information that is protected from disclosure by section 6 of the CIA Act of 1949 , as amended .
Therefore , the Agency has denied your request pursuant to FOIA exemptions ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( b ) ( 3 ) .
Many people believe that if the videotape is authentic , it should be sufficient hard evidence for the FBI to connect bin Laden to 9/11 .
The Muckraker Report agrees .
However , for the Department of Justice to indict bin Laden for the 9/11 attacks , something the government has yet to do , the videotape would have to be entered into evidence and subjected to additional scrutiny .
This appears to be something the government wishes to avoid .
Some believe that the video is a fake .
They refer to it as the “ fat bin Laden ” video .
The Muckraker Report believes that while the videotape is indeed authentic , it was the result of an elaborate CIA sting operation .
The Muckraker Report also believes that the reason why there is no documentation that demonstrates that the videotape went through an authenticity process is because the CIA knew it was authentic , they arranged the taping .
It is highly probable that the videotape was taped on September 26 , 2001 — before the US invaded Afghanistan .

Hugo Chávez Insider : Fidel Castro Lured Venezuelan Dictator ‘ with Witchcraft and Women ’
by Frances Martel
An allegedly close former military aide to Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez leveled scandalous accusations against Chávez ’s Cuban ally Fidel Castro in a story carried by Argentine media on Wednesday , suggesting the Castro regime killed Chávez after seducing him with “ women ” and “ witchcraft . ”
The accuser , retired Lieutenant General Emiro Antonio Brito Valerio , reportedly made the allegations in audio relayed to the Argentine news outlet Infobae .
Infobae published his extensive remarks , which detail his friendship with Chávez during their military training and his longtime concern that Fidel Castro was using his friend for political gain .
The Castro regime is deeply embedded in Venezuela , dependent on it for free oil and money generated from its oil industry .
A former Maduro official once estimated that there may be nearly 100,000 Cuban government agents helping run the Maduro regime in Venezuela .
Brito ’s revelations are the latest in a series of attempts to revise the bloody legacy Chávez ’s tenure : turning the wealthiest country in Latin America into the world ’s most miserable economy ; the largest exodus in the modern history of the Western Hemisphere ; widespread hunger and disease ; hundreds of political prisoners ; and the collapse , in the country with the world ’s largest known oil reserves , of its petroleum industry .

President Bush cannot exempt the Navy from environmental laws banning sonar training that opponents argue harms whales , a federal judge ruled Monday .
Navy officials did not immediately respond to the ruling by U.S. District Judge Florence - Marie Cooper .
Mark Matsunaga , spokesman for the Navy ’s Pacific Fleet , headquartered in Hawaii , said officials needed time to review it before commenting .
The president signed a waiver Jan. 15 exempting the Navy and its anti-submarine warfare exercises from a preliminary injunction creating a 12 nautical - mile no -sonar zone off Southern California .
The Navy ’s attorneys argued in court last week that he was within his legal rights .
The Navy is not “ exempted from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and this Court ’s injunction , ” Cooper wrote in her 36 - page decision .
Environmentalists have fought the use of sonar in court , saying it harms whales and other marine mammals .
“ It ’s an excellent decision , ” said Joel Reynolds , attorney for the National Resources Defense Council , which is spearheading the legal fight .
“ It reinstates the proper balance between national security and environmental protection . ”

Ron Gunzburger at Politics1 offers this little piece of governor gossip :
McCAIN VEEPSTAKES .
Politics1 Exclusive .
How interested is Florida Governor Charlie Crist in being John McCain 's VP runningmate ?
So much so that veteran GOP dirty trickster Roger Stone -- who coordinated a few dirty stunts in support of Crist during the 2006 gubernatorial campaign -- is quietly peddling a so - called " Charlie Crist sex tape . "
That 's what Stone called it during a telephone conversation .
And no , it is not a tape of Crist having sex with a guy .
In fact , it is n't even X - rated .
The video was seemingly staged to kill the rumors that Crist is gay .
Stone claims the tape -- which he discussed recently with Politics1 , but did n't show to us ( " I 'm saving it for the national shows " ) -- " shows Charlie fooling around in a hotel elevator with his girlfriend ...
They 're making out . "
Adds Stone : " It was captured on a security camera in the elevator " last month .
And Stone just conveniently happens to have a copy of the hotel 's elevator surveillance tape , just when Crist 's name is in play for the VP spot .
Hmm .
As for Crist 's purported girlfriend -- presuming it is the same one he took as his date to the White House Correspondents Dinner in DC a few weeks ago -- she 's still married ( and not to Crist ) .
Disclaimer : Always be skeptical of anything from Stone .
Well , this could get good .
Speaking of Stone , the Pulp received a teaser from a New Yorker magazine publicist about a Jeffrey Toobin article on the dirty trickster that is just out .
Sort of interesting :
Stone takes Toobin to Miami Velvet , the leading “ swingers ’ club ” in Miami , where patrons can have sex with their dates and with new acquaintances , “ to explain the role he may have played in the fall of Eliot Spitzer . ”
Stone tells Toobin that in September , 2007 , an off - duty call girl he met there told him , “ I almost had a date with Eliot Spitzer , ” and said that her colleague ( who did meet up with Spitzer ) “ said he was nice enough , but the only odd thing was that he kept his socks on . ”
Toobin writes that Stone decided to keep the conversation to himself at first , but “ there was never any doubt that he would eventually deploy it , ” and he conveyed the story after being approached by the F.B.I. in November — months before revelations about Spitzer ’s ties to a prostitution ring led to his resignation .
Stone had worked against Spitzer since his election , both as “ a labor of love ” and as a paid consultant for the New York State Senate Republicans .
He tells Toobin , “ I thought Spitzer was punk , and I wanted to fuck with him any way I could . ”
The story is up on the web now .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - OPEC should increase oil output to meet surging demand from China and other developing countries and counter a dramatic spike in crude prices , a senior official at the U.S. Department of Energy said on Monday .
“ The more supply that OPEC can put on the market , the better it would be for all of us , ” DOE ’s acting deputy secretary , Jeff Kupfer , said at the Reuters Global Energy Summit in Houston .
Consumer nations such as the United States have urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to help tame oil prices that have doubled in a year , but the group has generally resisted , saying supplies are adequate .
OPEC controls about 30 percent of the world ’s oil production .
“ We have constant discussions with OPEC ministers , ” said Kupfer .
“ While demand in the United States is not rising like it is in other parts of the world , it is a global market and as demand increases in China and other places it puts upward pressure on prices . ”

PLENTY of people believe in owning gold as a safeguard against hyperinflation or financial apocalypse .
They see the rise in gold to more than $ 1000 an ounce earlier this year as signalling the debasement of paper money , particularly the dollar .
But what does the price of gold really tell us when measured against other assets ?
One particular ratio that might be of interest is the relationship between gold and the oil price ( see chart ) .
In other words , how many barrels of oil does it take to buy an ounce of gold ?
According to Capital Economics , if we go back to the early 1980s , it has taken , on average , 16 barrels of oil to buy one ounce .
Given that the current ratio is around 7 , that suggests either that oil is very expensive or gold is very cheap .
Indeed , if you believe in the latter , then gold could be heading above $ 2000 an ounce .
But should this relationship be constant ?
After all , most of the gold that has ever been mined is still in existence , but we are using up oil at a tremendous rate — and some believe global production may be at , or close to , its peak .
In addition , oil is vital to the global economy ; the main industrial use for gold is jewellery .
So that suggests oil should be rising relative to gold over time .
David Ranson of Wainwright Economics , a gold enthusiast , reckons oil is rising , relative to bullion , at a trend rate of around 3.5 % a year .
As a result , the gold / oil ratio should fall over time .
Indeed , Capital Economics reckons that the average ratio since 2002 is about 10 , rather than the 16 that has pertained over a longer period .
That still indicates , with oil at more than $ 130 a barrel , that gold could soon cost $ 1300 an ounce .
But , of course , there is nothing to say that the ratio has to be restored by gold rising ; oil could be dear rather than gold cheap .
A fall in the price of oil to $ 90 - $ 100 a barrel would redress the balance .
Another relationship worth examining is that between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the bullion price .
If you go back to 1980 , when gold briefly reached $ 850 an ounce , the relationship was around 1 .
But by 2000 — the height of the dotcom boom — it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one “ unit ” of the stock market .
( This requires the fiction of treating the level of the Dow as a dollar price ) .
According to Alan Newman of the Crosscurrents website , the average ratio between the Dow and gold since 1975 has been just under 15 .
Currently , it 's almost bang in line .
Again , one needs to consider whether a fixed ratio is theoretically sound .
After all , gold is an unproductive asset , virtually without a yield ( it can be lent in the market at a cost ) .
One would expect it to maintain its real value over time .
But one would expect the Dow , as a claim on the corporate earnings and dividends of the American economy , to at least keep pace with economic growth over the long run .
So one would expect the Dow to rise , relative to gold , over time .
A historical average is thus of limited use .
Indeed , that is the problem of using charts in the first place .
They can give investors an instant picture of what has happened in the past ; academics are very dubious that they have anything to tell us about the future .
It is very easy to find spurious statistical correlations .
And even when there are sound theoretical reasons why a ratio should revert to the mean over time ( such as profits as a proportion of GDP ) , it can take ages for the shift to occur .
It is probably not wise to expect to make your fortune from trading the gold / oil relationship .
The government 's new cyber - security " Manhattan Project " is so secretive that a key Senate oversight panel has been reduced to writing a letter to beg for answers to the most basic questions , such as what 's going on , what 's the point and what about privacy laws .
The Senate Homeland Security committee wants to know , for example , what is the goal of Homeland Security 's new National Cyber Security Center .
They also want to know why it is that in March , DHS announced that Silicon Valley evangelist and security novice Rod Beckstrom would direct the center , when up to that point DHS said the mere existence of the center was classified .
Those are just two sub-questions out of a list of 17 multi-part questions centrist Sens.
Joe Lieberman ( I - Connecticut ) and Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) sent to DHS in a letter Friday .
In fact , although the two say they asked for a briefing five months ago on what the center does , DHS has yet to explain its latest acronym .
The panel , noted it was pleased with the new focus on cyber security , but questioned Homeland Security 's request to triple the center 's cyber - security budget to about $ 200 million .
They cited concerns about the secrecy around the project , its reliance on contractors for the operation of the center and lack of dialogue with private companies that specialize in internet security .
That center is just one small part of the government 's new found interest in computer security , a project dubbed the Comprehensive
National Cybersecurity Initiative , which has been rumored to eventually get some $ 30 billion in funding .
Little is known about the initiative since it was created via a secret presidential order in January , though the Washington Post reports that portions of it may be made public soon .
We are also concerned that the lack of information about the CNCI being provided to the public , other agencies , and private entities that conduct business with the government might be creating confusion and concern about the initiative .
Given the broad nature and goals of this initiative , agencies may be less likely to plan for their future information technology needs , fearing that systems they purchase might not comply with the initiative .
Similarly , industry will be less likely to do business with the government given the uncertainty about future technical requirements .
Additionally , the public , of course , must be reassured that efforts to secure cyber networks will be appropriately balanced with respect for privacy and civil liberties .
Why might citizens be worried about privacy and civil liberties ?
Consider that the whole initiative appears to have been launched after the Director of National Intelligence told the President Bush that a cyber attack might wreak as much economic havoc as 9/11 did .
Consider that the NSA , which currently protects classified networks , wants to expand into protecting all non-classified federal government networks .
Consider that Congress is set to legalize the NSA 's monitoring rooms in the nation 's phone and internet infrastructure .
For its part , the FBI says it also needs access to the internet 's backbone , while the Air Force is hyping its own efforts at cyber defense and offense .
Meanwhile , THREAT LEVEL 's sister blog Danger Room reports that DARPA is getting in on the hot cyber-action , with a project to make a fake internet to develop new cyber attacks and defenses .
It 's been said many times that if the government knew what the internet was going to become when it grew up , they would had never let it out of the lab .
Now it seems the only question is whether the government will be able to turn the net into a controllable , monitorable and trackable pre-internet AOL - type service or whether the chaotic net will live on as just another frontier for the military - industrial complex to start an arm 's race and rake in billions of government dollars .

The Motion Picture Association of America is ordering flags flown at half staff at government buildings , animal shelters , Hollywood studios and at the world 's movie theaters after the death of one of its disc - sniffing dogs .
Manny , a yellow Labrador retriever trained to sniff polycarbonate and other chemicals in optical discs , died nine days ago in Malaysia , the MPAA announced Monday .
Manny , who also had a penchant for retrieving tennis balls and slobbering , was 1 .
An autopsy was being conducted .
The deceased was one of two dogs the Malaysian government was training to become a country 's first canine anti-piracy unit under its Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs .
The dogs , supplied by the MPAA , cannot tell the difference between real and counterfeited DVDs , but alert to hidden piles of discs .
" We are deeply saddened by the news of Manny ’s passing , ” said Mike Ellis , an MPAA president in Asia .
The Malaysian trade ministry , he said , was investigating the cause of death " which should be clear once the post - mortem results come through . "
THREAT LEVEL chief Kevin Poulsen suggests that Manny might have bit the big one after getting a whiff of too many Live Free or Die Hard discs that began piling up in illicit warehouses .
Apparently , pirates could n't give them away .
Manny is survived by his black Labrador retriever partner Paddy and their disc - sniffing black Labrador retriever counterparts Lucky and Flo. Lucky and Flo , the world 's first anti-piracy pooches pictured here , have been hunting the world in search of counterfeited DVDs .
Pirates have reportedly put a bounty on Lucky and Flo 's noses .
All four dogs were produced by the MPAA .
Manny and Paddy , trained by the MPAA in Ireland , were brought to Malaysia in February .
In Malaysia , Lucky and Flo have assisted in 35 raids , leading to the arrest of 26 people and the discovery of about 1.9 million pirated discs and 97 burner towers , the MPAA said .

So what , then , are the alternatives to XML ?
One popular choice is YAML .
I could explain it , but it 's easier to show you .
Which , I think , is entirely the point .

I once claimed it was The first Windows computer good enough to criticize .
Its flagship application , OneNote , was and is the best idea sketching and note taking application I have ever used .
Alas , I cannot explain why some combinations of software and hardware — like a TabletPC running OneNote or an iPod touch — simply work without putting one in your hands to try .
Jeff Atwood is so right , I practically shouted “ Slamma - lamma - ding - dong ” when I read this line :
Now , I do n’t mean , “ Jeff Atwood is right that YAML is better than XML . ”
Well , I believe it is better than XML for a lot of things , but which things and how often and he did n’t exactly say that any ways .
What I actually mean is that Jeff is absolutely right that some things should not be explained , they should be directly experienced .
It ’s better to show them than to try to explain them .
Things that involve changes to human behaviour do not lend themselves to explanation .
You have to try things .
Or observe people trying things .
Trying to explain it just does n’t work , even though we humans have a huge and futile desire to try — including writing weblogs just like this .
Think about user interfaces .
Imagine yourself traveling back in time to the eighties — last century !— and trying to “ explain ” Excel to someone who was a master of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 .
They have seen a mouse in the computer store — it came with its own card and you configured jumpers to set the interrupt so it would n’t conflict with their extended memory .
Now you are going to explain why they will be more productive pushing a plastic bar of soap around their desk instead of banging out slash commands at high speed ?
Are you crazy ?
The only way this person will consider Excel is if you show them Excel .
And I speak as a man who was there .
At one time , Excel was so good that people would switch from their PCs with 1 - 2 - 3 to Excel on a Macintosh just to get Excel .
Until , for some mysterious reason , Microsoft brought out Excel on Windows and the Windows version could use 8 MB of RAM while the Macintosh version was limited to 1MB of RAM .
Dunno why .
Or how about software development .
What do you mean releasing software every two weeks or every month ?
It takes three to four months just to plan a release around here !
And hey , that “ better search ” thingie you were droning on and on about ?
How much better can searching the Internet really be ?
Why would anyone care ?
But when people see iterative development in action , when people use the Internet , and when people watch Google ’s stock price … they get it , immediately .
The interesting thing is this : things that are easy to explain are things that fit with our incomplete and wrong mental models of how the world works .
We have built a whole UI industry around trying to match our guesses of how people think , like imagining that an icon of a pair of scissors will tell people that clicking there will cause whatever they have selected to vanish and be held in some invisible suspension , waiting for them to click the icon that looks like a bottle of Kindergarten glue .
Whereas things that break those models are impossible to explain , because they are n’t just like whatever we already believe .
So ?
So those are the things that have a shot at doing something new , at disrupting our behaviour .
Like making CRUD web applications easy to build or a mobile web browser that does n’t suck
You recall that Apple — know know a thing or two about disrupting human behaviour — introduced the iPhone with advertisements that simply showed them in action .
I wonder why ?
I am going to stop trying to explain that you should not try to explain some things to people .
You do n’t have to trust my word on the subject :
Open your eyes and observe for yourself .
When things involve human behaviour , it ’s better to show than to tell .

In 1998 , 20 - year - old Raed Jarrar watched from the roof of his family ’s home in Baghdad as American Tomahawk cruise missiles struck government buildings close by , blowing out the windows and sending him scrambling for cover .
Five years later , during Operation Iraqi Freedom , coalition planes targeted the same buildings , as well as the nearby airport and Saddam Hussein ’s palace , killing and wounding dozens of people from Jarrar ’s middle - class neighborhood .
This year , Jarrar quietly celebrated his 30th birthday outside Pasadena at a retreat he was attending for his job as a consultant for the American Friends Service Committee .
He now lives in Washington , D.C. , a short metro ride away from the White House , the Pentagon , and the various think tanks where his country ’s future has been decided for much of his life .
Yet Jarrar ’s become something the war ’s planners did not anticipate : an Iraqi who ’s thwarted their efforts by using the tools of American democracy .
Through a peculiar roll of history ’s dice , the young exile has helped throw a monkey wrench in the Bush administration ’s attempts to lay the groundwork for a permanent American presence in Iraq .
“ I ’m just another small example of how Iraqis would rather end the occupation through talking to U.S. legislators and the public , ” Jarrar explains .
Jarrar was born in Baghdad , the son of a Shiite mother and a Sunni father , and the oldest of three boys .
He attended the University of Baghdad and began graduate school in Amman , Jordan , where he studied architecture , focusing on postwar reconstruction .
As the world ’s eyes turned to Iraq in late 2002 , a friend and fellow architect who went by the nickname “ Salam Pax ” started an English - language blog .
Because he often had trouble reaching Jarrar , he named it “ Where Is Raed ? ” Jarrar started blogging there as well , and to the friends ’ surprise , their musings on stockpiling food and the gyrating value of the dinar were read by people all over the world looking for a glimpse of the final days of Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
After the American invasion , Jarrar started an ngo named Emaar ( “ Reconstruction ” ) to support Iraqis trying to rebuild their neighborhoods .
His blog posts began to reflect his growing anger at the occupation .
“ American foreign policy is putting people like me in a very weak position , ” he wrote in March 2004 .
“ In extreme circumstances , extreme ideologies rule and dominate .
And I am , unfortunately , not an extremist . ”
While traveling in southern Iraq , Jarrar was kidnapped by a militia ; he was released unharmed after a few hours .
With normal life in Iraq becoming “ impossible , ” he decided to return to Jordan to complete his master ’s degree .
In Amman , he met and became engaged to an Iranian American woman .
In September 2005 , Jarrar arrived in the United States and made plans to become a permanent resident .
That summer , George W. Bush had assured Iraqis and Americans that the United States would stay in Iraq “ as long as we are needed , and not a day longer . ”
But Jarrar — like many Iraqis — suspected that the administration had other ideas .
After witnessing Iraq ’s descent into violence , he became convinced that the only solution was for the United States to leave as soon as possible .
“ Only a complete U.S. withdrawal that leaves no troops , bases , or private contractors behind would create the safe space for Iraqis to deal with their problems and heal their wounds , ” he says .
“ Iraqis will never be capable of starting the process of reconciliation and reconstruction with a foreign occupation taking sides . ”
Five years on , American forces remain in Iraq under a United Nations mandate subject to annual renewal by the Security Council .
Last June , Iraq ’s parliament , asserting its constitutional duty to ratify treaties , passed a law requiring its approval of future extensions of the mandate .
But the UN and Iraqi president Nouri al - Maliki , under pressure from the United States , have ignored the MPs .
Late last year the mandate was renewed until the end of 2008 without parliamentary approval .
In the meantime , the Bush administration has tried to bypass the UN altogether .
In late November 2007 , Maliki and Bush quietly signed a Declaration of Principles that outlined the United States ’ ongoing political and military relationship with Iraq , including its commitment to “ defending [ Iraq ’s ] democratic system against internal and external threats . ”
In the many countries where its troops are based , the United States maintains Status of Forces Agreements , or sofas , which may be signed by the president without congressional approval .
But until now , only treaties , which require Senate ratification , have authorized the use of force by American troops in host countries .
No sofa has given American troops the leeway implied in the Declaration of Principles .
The administration “ does not want this to go to Congress , ” explains former assistant secretary of defense Lawrence Korb , now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress .
“ They ’d never get the votes . ”
That ’s where Jarrar stepped in .
He had already spent months trying to get members of Congress to make contact with Iraqi members of parliament who opposed extending the UN mandate .
( More than half of Iraqi MPs have called for the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal . )
Shortly after the Bush - Maliki agreement was signed , Jarrar was introduced to Caleb Rossiter , an aide to Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) , chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Organizations , Human Rights , and Oversight .
In Jarrar , Rossiter recognized a unique resource .
Just as Arabic - speaking American officials are a rarity in Baghdad , so too are Iraqi anti-war activists in Washington who speak fluent English and can navigate the intricacies of the Iraqi government .
Rossiter took the issue to Delahunt , who has since held more than five hearings on the legality of the Bush administration ’s plans for Iraq .
Jarrar testified at the first hearing and is now helping Delahunt bring a handful of Iraqi MPs to the States to meet their counterparts and discuss their shared oversight role .
As Rossiter explains , “ Never underestimate the bonding power of legislators learning they ’re both being constitutionally insulted by the same people in the same way . ”
Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee in February , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates backpedaled on the Declaration of Principles , stating it was “ not considered by our government to be a security commitment . ”
Gates also suggested that any future security agreements with Iraq would be subject to congressional review , although the White House is intent on finalizing its agreement with Maliki before the end of Bush ’s term .
Rossiter credits Jarrar for tipping off Congress to a situation that the administration was not eager to publicize .
“ Without Jarrar , who knows where we ’d be , ” he says .
“ He ’s been crucial in helping us think through our inquiry into this .
What makes him so valuable is he understands the coin of the realm on Capitol Hill is good information .
We know from experience that we can count on anything he brings us . ” Congressman Delahunt concurs .
“ Raed ’s been simply invaluable , ” he says .
“ There ’s so much about Iraq we can miss : the domestic political forces , the diversity of the society .
He ’s given us outstanding objective analysis on all of it . ”
The secret of Jarrar ’s success may be that unlike most people walking the halls of Congress , he never wanted to be there in the first place .
He ’d rather be back in Baghdad , putting his training rebuilding cities to use .
“ I still sometimes dream that there will be opportunities after the war , like in Chicago after the great fire , ” he says .
“ But I ’m not an architect now .
I did n’t have the privilege to decide that .
What decided were the bombs that fell on my neighborhood . ”
One character jokes that she wants to bring her odometer count back down to “ zero . ”
“ We realized that what we thought was a sporadic practice was actually pretty common , ” said Davide Sordella , the film ’s director .
“ These women can live in Italy , adopt our mentality and wear jeans .
But in the moments that matter , they do n’t always have the strength to go against their culture . ”
The issue has been particularly charged in France , where a renewed and fierce debate has occurred about a prejudice that was supposed to have been buried with the country ’s sexual revolution 40 years ago : the importance of a woman ’s virginity .
The furor followed the revelation two weeks ago that a court in Lille , in northern France , had annulled the 2006 marriage of two French Muslims because the groom found his bride was not the virgin she had claimed to be .
The domestic drama has gripped France .
The groom , an unidentified engineer in his 30s , left the nuptial bed and announced to the still partying wedding guests that his bride had lied .
She was delivered that night to her parents ’ doorstep .
The next day , he approached a lawyer about annulling the marriage .
The bride , then a nursing student in her 20s , confessed and agreed to an annulment .
The court ruling did not mention religion .
Rather , it cited breach of contract , concluding that the engineer had married her after “ she was presented to him as single and chaste . ”
In secular , republican France , the case touches on several delicate subjects : the intrusion of religion into daily life ; the grounds for dissolution of a marriage ; and the equality of the sexes .
There were calls in Parliament this week for the resignation of Rachida Dati , France ’s justice minister , after she initially upheld the ruling .
Ms. Dati , who is a Muslim , backed down and ordered an appeal .
A Mercy For Animals undercover investigation takes you behind the closed doors of one of California ’s largest egg factory farms , exposing the hidden cost of egg production - cruelty to animals .
Hidden camera video recorded in early 2008 at Gemperle Enterprises in Merced County , California , a supplier to NuCal Foods Inc. - the largest distributor of shell eggs in the Western US - reveals : Rotting carcasses in cages with live hens still laying eggs for human consumption .
Birds suffering from untreated broken bones , open wounds , infections and prolapses .
Workers brutally killing sick hens by grabbing their heads and swinging their bodies around to break their necks , or through neck - twisting , often resulting in a prolonged , torturous death .
Workers roughly and forcefully handling birds , resulting in injuries , such as broken bones and blunt trauma .
Hens covered in excrement , confined five to seven per cage the size of a file drawer , unable to stretch their wings , move freely or exercise .
Crippled hens left to languish in cage aisles without access to food , water , or veterinary care .
Frank H. Pearl ( Washington , D.C. ) , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Perseus , founded the firm in 1995 ....
Mr. Pearl is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Economics , a member of the Council on Foreign Relations , and is a participating member of the American Friends of Bilderberg .
James A. Johnson ( Washington , D.C. ) is a Vice Chairman of Perseus .
Mr. Johnson was a Managing Director in Corporate Finance at Lehman Brothers .
Mr. Johnson was Executive Assistant to Vice President Walter F. Mondale , where he advised the Vice President on domestic and foreign policy and political matters .
Mr. Johnson also serves on the Boards of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. , KB Home , Target Corporation , Temple - Inland , Inc. , and UnitedHealth Group .
He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations , the National Museum of African American History and Culture , and the Trilateral Commission .
The main stream media is never going to tell you what you 're about to read here .
Please read this with an open mind and visit the link I 've provided at the bottom of this post .
James A. Johnson is the person selected by Obama to head his Vice - Presidential Search Committee .
The main stream media has n't told you much about Johnson other than the fact that he lead John Kerry 's VP search committee .
But why ?
Because James A. Johnson is a Vice - Chairman of a multi-billion dollar hedge fund and merchant bank , and a business partner of George Soros .
Johnson also was the chairman of investment house Lehman Brothers .
Johnson is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission .
So if a powerful man like Johnson is Vice - Chairman of this investment fund , then who is the Chairman ?
Try Frank Pearl , who not surprisingly is also a member of the CFR .
Even more astounding , Frank Pearl 's biography on his own web site identifies him as an active member of the Americans for Bilderberg group .
There is now a proven , direct link between Obama and the Bilderbergers .
What may be even more astounding is that nobody in the main stream media has reported on this .
So now we know how an unknown African - American , a former street organizer made his way from Trinity Church in Chicago to being the Democrat candidate for President of the United States .
He was backed by the Trilateralists and the Bildeberg group , following in the footsteps of Jimmy Carter .
This is not speculation .
This is not rumor .
This is not some wild conspiracy theory .
This is documented .
And now we can understand why the main stream media has been obsessed with Obama 's associations with Rev. Wrigth and William Ayers , and has been silent on Obama 's association with James Johnson and Frank Pearl .
Rev. Wright and William Ayers , and the " Michelle tape " that 's been rumored are designed distractions to keep the public from focusing on Obama 's associations with groups like the Trilateral Commission , the CFR , and the Bilderberg group .
And by the way , the name of Johnson and Pearl 's investment bank , which he founded in 1995 ?
Perseus , LLC .
And for those of you who might have forgotten your greek mythology , Perseus became a hero for cutting off the head of Medusa .
Coincidence ?
There 's no such thing as coincidence .
On their web site they have images of Perseus holding the severed head of Medusa .
Wait ... did I mention that James Johnson is on the board of Goldman Sachs ?
Or that former Clinton cabinet member Richard Holbrooke is also a Vice - Chairman of Perseus ?
Or that that the Vice President of Finance at Perseus LLC held a similar position at the Carlyle Group ?
Or that the Managing Director of Perseus was formerly a Vice President at Enron ?
So for everybody who has fallen in love with Obama and who has bought into his speeches about changing the culture in Washington , know that you are supporting the candidate hand - picked by the most elite , powerful men in the world , who literally are members of the Bildeberg group .
Are you sure you want these people in the White House ?
Do you think the masses who show up and cheer Obama have any idea of these connections ?
And one more thing .
Obama also named African - American Eric Holder to his VP search committee .
You will hearing a lot about Holder because he was involved in pardoning Mark Rich and the two members of the Weather Underground when Clinton left office .
Why did Obama pick Holder ?
So the media can focus on Holder 's dubious past , and that fact that he 's a black man , while failing to mention anything about James Johnson and Frank Pearl .
I will promise you you 're not going to hear one mention about Johnson being the Vice - Chairman of Perseus , but you 'll hear about Holder and the Weather Underground for weeks .
It 's part of the plan .

Israel , celebrating its 60th birthday last week , has proved to be an expensive ally for the United States .
Since its birth , Israel has received at least $ 114 billion from the US in direct foreign economic and military aid , says Shirl McArthur , a retired US diplomat who periodically updates his Israel cost estimates for the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs ( WREMA ) , a magazine often critical of US policy toward Israel .
That estimate , Mr. McArthur notes , is conservative .
For instance , he has not factored inflation into that $ 114 billion cumulative sum .
The late Washington economist Thomas Stauffer did that calculation several years ago .
He found total official aid to Israel , up to 2002 , came to $ 247 billion .
He added other costs of US support of Israel ( interest on debt , higher oil prices , etc. ) to reach a highly controversial total of $ 1.6 trillion .
For comparison , the cost to the US of the Iraq war is running about $ 144 billion a year .
In March , a Memorandum of Understanding from the White House to Congress urged an additional $ 30 billion in military aid to Israel , a sum spread at about $ 3 billion a year through fiscal year 2018 .
Currently , Israel ranks as the top recipient of American foreign aid ( $ 2.4 billion in 2007 by an official calculation ) if reconstruction money for Iraq is excluded .
Next are Egypt ( $ 1.8 billion ) and Afghanistan ( $ 1 billion ) .
Up to now , the presidential candidates have largely ducked the question of what they would do to further peace between Israelis and the Palestinians .
" It 's quite remarkable it has not been raised , " says Stephen Walt , coauthor of " The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , " a controversial book published last year .
" They have gotten a free pass on details for a peace process . "
The Harvard University political science professor further criticizes the press for not questioning the candidates about what they would do to push forward a two - state solution to the decades - old struggle with its sizable cost to American taxpayers .
Presumably a lever the US has in the dispute is to withhold the aid it gives to Israel and the far smaller amount ( $ 73.5 million requested for fiscal 2008 ) given to the Palestinians .
" The presidential candidates make it a point never to talk about Middle East foreign aid , " says McArthur .
Why the silence ?
" Fear , " says Paul Findley , a frequent critic of US foreign policy to Israel .
He blames the Israeli lobby for contributing to his defeat in 1982 when running for reelection as a Republican congressional representative from Illinois .
None of the three remaining presidential candidates have uttered " even a syllable " of complaint about US policy toward Israel , rather a " paean of praise , " Mr. Findley says .
" This is a phenomenon without precedent in American history . "
To Findley , the " most powerful instrument of intimidation " used by pro-Israel groups is the charge of " anti-Semitism . "
The meaning of that term has been expanded .
It used to be applied to those hostile to a race or faith , that is , against Jews or Judaism .
Now it 's often applied to critics of Israel or US - Israel policy , says Findley .
Considering the horrific history of the holocaust , politicians " run like rabbits " to avoid the charge of anti-Semitism , Findley adds .
Another fear of politicians involves the campaign contributions of pro-Israel political action committees ( PACs ) .
Last week WREMA reported that more than 20 of these PACs have contributed $ 1.1 million to Washington politicians in the 2007 - 08 election cycle .
That amount is dwarfed by what the three presidential candidates have raised for their campaigns .
Since Israel now has a relatively prosperous per capita national income comparable to Cyprus or Slovenia , direct US economic aid to Israel has been replaced gradually by military aid .
Since money is fungible , that would make little real economic difference to Israel as its government pays its high military bills .
In fact , Congress allows Israel to use 26 percent of the aid it receives to buy arms outside the US , thereby helping build up its own weapons industry .
" We are thus shooting ourselves [ the US weapons industry ] in the foot , " charges Janet McMahon , managing editor of WREMA .
Professor
Walt maintains he 's pro-Israel .
The US refusal to put pressure on Israel to settle with the Palestinians on a two - state solution , he argues , is not helpful .
" Giving any country unconditional backing encourages irresponsible behavior , " he says .
It could lead to an apartheid state , or as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert put it , Israel facing " a South African - style struggle . "

So , former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds is again proved right .
For more than a year Sibel has been predicting that Dennis Hastert will join a lobbying firm involved with Turkey , and now we learn that Hastert is joining Dickstein Shapiro .
In the “ Representative Engagements ” section of Dickstein ’s website , we learn that they represented “ the government of Turkey in connection with the development and financing by private sponsors of the Baku - Ceyhan oil pipeline and TransCaspian gas pipeline spanning from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean . ”
Dennis Hastert , who is listed in Sibel ’s “ Rogues Gallery , ” was caught on FBI wiretaps accepting bribes from Turkish criminal elements associated with the Turkish government , as documented in Vanity Fair in 2005 and elsewhere .
This youtube clip from Kill The Messenger , a documentary about Sibel ’s case , discusses some of Hastert ’s involvement as mentioned in Vanity Fair : http://www.youtube.com/v/5utAAfuAo-A
In researching the Vanity Fair article , journalist David Rose interviewed various congressional staffers and counter - intelligence officials who are familiar with the case .
He reported that there were three separate types of bribes paid to Hastert :
1 ) “ ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert ’s campaign funds in small checks . ”
2 ) “ ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars in surreptitious payments in exchange for political favors and information . ”
3 ) “ ( A)t least $ 500,000 ”
Hastert was lucky that there was literally zero follow - up in the mainstream media to these most serious charges .
Hastert did not sue Vanity Fair for libel , instead , Hastert got his spokesman to send Vanity Fair a bizarre Letter to the Editor in response , 6 months later .
BradBlog has the letter here , along with Sibel ’s effective debunking of Hastert ’s response .
The only action taken in response to the startling revelations in Vanity Fair was by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) which filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) asking them to investigate the “ ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert ’s campaign funds in small checks . ”
According to the Vanity Fair article , these bribes were funneled into Hastert ’s campaign in amounts less than $ 200 , which would mean that the contributions were below the threshold for reporting .
The Federal Election Commission droppedthe investigation in early 2006 without answering the specific charge .
The bribes identified in Vanity Fair are probably just the tip of the iceberg , merely down - payments on what was promised to him when he left office , and could ‘ earn ’ a multi-million dollar salary as a lobbyist .
Sibel describedhow the process works , using another member of her “ Rogues Gallery , ” former State Dept official Marc Grossman as an example :
“ For example , look at Mr. Marc Grossman .
He used to be the U.S. ambassador in Turkey and used his position within the State Department to secure future higher - level positions while in office ” ” and I would like to emphasize this ” ” while in office and with several agencies knowing about it .
Some people in these agencies wanted to investigate these cases but they were prevented from going forward .
.. And just take a look at where Mr. Grossman is today .
Within a few months after he gave his resignation , he obtained a position with a semi-legitimate Turkish company that is supplying him with a very attractive monetary reward . ”
And Sibel has made the same case elsewhere :
“ Please do not make the grave and naive mistake of assuming that Grossman found and obtained his highly lucrative and questionable positions after his resignation in January 2005 . ”
It appears that these arrangements are n’t the typical ‘ Revolving Door ’ retirement packages , but rather specific quid pro quo deals .
People like Hastert and Grossman and the others quite literally sell out their government while in office on the specific promise that they will be rewarded when they leave .
Hastert wo n’t actually be a ‘ Lobbyist ’ according to Dickstein Shapiro , he ’ll be “ providing strategy advice to the firm and its clients ” – spending half his time in Chicago and half his time in DC .
Most likely , some of that ‘ strategy advice ’ will include advice on how to corrupt some of the sitting congressmen :
The people who bribed Hastert and the others need to ensure the continuity of their operations , regardless of who is sitting in Congress .
Sibel says that the foreign entities who are successful in this business simply need to follow a basic recipe :
“ Get yourself a few “ ˜Dime a Dozen Generals , ’ bid high in the “ ˜former statesmen lobby auction ’ , and put in your pocket one or two “ ˜ex - congressmen turned lobbyists ’ who know the ropes when it comes to pocketing a few dozen who still serve . ”
Dickstein Shapiro , Hastert ’s new employers , were deeply involved with Turkey and the Central Asian region during the time that Hastert was caught taking these bribes – 1996 to 2001 .
For example ,
It was Dickstein Shapiro , in conjunction with the Baker Botts law firm , who put together the ‘ contract of the century ’ – the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( or BTC ) pipeline which was to carry oil from Azerbaijan to the West , via Georgia and Turkey .
Some of Dickstein Shapiro ’s other claims to fame include :
1 ) Defending “ former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams in connection with the Iran- Contra investigations . ”
2 ) “ ( S ) uccessfully defended and represented prominent clients in a number of other high - profile cases such as …BCCI Bank ”
3 ) Employing convicted felon Lewis Scooter Libby ( and his wife ) , who was a partner at the firm from 1986 to 1989 .
If there ’s any justice in the world , Dickstein Shapiro will soon be adding Dennis Hastert to their ‘ Ex-employees who are now convicted felons ’

PHP used to have a cool little feature where it would automatically detect single quotes in text strings and escape them for you whenever they needed to be .
It was called Magic_quotes_runtime .
Maybe you 've heard of it .
It was a disaster
Countless developer hours were spent trying to chase down mysterious runtime errors where single quotes were either introduced , doubled up , or removed , causing disastrous crashes , data corruption and so much untold havoc that the feature was deprecated and eventually removed from PHP entirely
You would think that people would have learned their lesson .
People are , by and large , dumb .
We make the same dumb mistakes over and over again because we did n't bother to do any research or read about the last time that somebody tried whatever stupid idea we just re-invented .
As a result , we have development frameworks and tools like Hibernate , ASP .
NET 's SmartNav , and Rails ' ActiveRecord , all trying to magically solve problems that were n't very hard in the first place , and silently making a lot of people 's lives a lot harder without them even realizing it .
The big problem with Magic tools is that they work fine the first time you try them .
" Wow ! " , you say , " It posted the page back and scrolled my browser back down to the Submit button ! "
So you turn that feature on for all your pages and start to trust it .
You get used to it .
You take it for granted .
You forget you 're even using it .
Then suddenly something weird starts happening with one of your pages and you can't figure out why .
Examples of this sort of side effect abound , but nobody yet has taken a stand and done something about it .
How many developer hours have been lost trying to figure out what magical SQL statement was running behind the scenes and only “ Hibernating ” half of an object ?
How many CPU cycles have been squandered ( and slanderous blog entries written ) because some poor developer did n’t realize that ActiveRecord was hitting the database three times for every single row in that recordset ?
Are we really so scared of Outer Joins that we allow ourselves to be subject to this torment ?
I ’ll leave you with an axiom that I ’ve been telling developers for years without much success .
Call it Kester ’s Caution :
Never use any language feature that describes itself as " Smart " or " Magic . "
Such features will invariably be trying to abstract out some behavior that is not that hard to deal with anyway , and will make any number of incorrect assumptions about your application that will result in strange behavior cropping up that could possibly be described as " Magic " , but certainly would never be labeled " Smart " .
Through the much of the 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s , Cambridge - based Thinking Machines was ahead of its time .
As innovators in parallel computing , they developed a massive , 65,536 processor supercomputer known the Connection Machine .
Visually , it made Cray ’s distinctive look seem like a piece of outdated furniture , and was even stunning enough to star as the “ impressive blinky - light server ” in Jurassic Park .
Of course , that ’s just about all it was good for .
The Connection Machine was an AI researcher ’s dream that no AI research lab could afford .
Its inability to run FORTRAN – and every other programming language aside from a specialized Lisp dialect – made it pretty much useless for business and scientific purposes .
Its baffling inability to even do floating - point operations mostly guaranteed that no one would buy it .
But , hey – who needs customers when there ’s lots of money from daddy !
In this case , “ daddy ” was DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) , and not only provided Thinking Machines with millions of dollars in funding , but brokered and subsidized many of the Connection Machine sales .
As more money poured in , even more money poured out .
CEO Sheryl Handler – whose background included interior design , landscape architecture , city planning , and third - world resource planning – built a lavish office that included huge open spaces , an enormous marble archway , and even a plush cafeteria staffed with its very own gourmet chef .
While all of this so far is chronicled in Inc.
Magazine ’s 1995 article , The Rise and Fall of Thinking Machines , reader Andrew Garland wrote in to share his own experience with Thinking Machines .
During their heyday , he interviewed for a software engineer position .
I arrived at Thinking Machines at 9:00 AM sharp .
Having not gotten a detailed scheduled from the HR person , I was n’t quite sure what to expect , and just assumed that I ’d meet with one or two people and then be on my way .
I do remember being impressed by their substantial building and the meticulously designed lobby .
The first interviewer that I met with had never seen my résumé before , so I sat patiently as he read about my background .
He said that I had great experience , and wondered if I had any sort of experience on massively - parallel , hypercubic - based computers .
Seeing that only Thinking Machines programmers would have such a skillset , I said that I had n’t designed for or programmed such a machine , but certainly was interested in learning more .
On that note , he perked up and talked about the amazing things their computer could do , and detailed the particular project that he was involved in .
The project was a bit abstract , so I asked how it could be applied for business computing purposes .
He scrunched his nose and scoffed at the very notion that I ’d ask such a question .
My second interview of the day was almost identical .
I met with a programmer who had never seen my résumé before and was more interested in talking about his current project than my technical skills or knowledge .
When 10:50 AM rolled around , he walked me over to my third interview , but made a brief pit stop at a Coke machine .
“ Ya see this , ” he said with great pride , pointing to the magnetic strip bolted to the machine , “ we actually hacked the machine to accept employee access cards as payment .
It ’s pretty elegant ; a request is sent via Ethernet to a server , which then verifies it and runs an automatic charge against that employee ’s account . ”
Though I was quite impressed by the creativity , I did wonder where they found the time to do that .
By my third interview , I finally got the hang of things : I quietly sat while the interviewer read my résumé for the first time and then listened to him talk about his exciting computing project .
While I ca n’t remember what his project was , I do remember what his response was to my question about its application in science or business : “ errr , I ’m not sure ; I guess I do n’t really understand why you ’d ask that . ”
My third interview ended at 12:30 , and I was asked to stay for lunch at the building ’s impressive cafeteria .
After that , they ’d talk to me again after .
I was assigned to an escort who showed me where to go , and he had lunch with me .
We briefly chatted about the company some more , and the interview process .
“ Five interviews in one day , ” I said , “ I guess that ’s a good sign , eh ? ”
“ Well , yes , ” he hesitantly replied , “ they usually do this for everyone though . ”
“ Oh .
So what happens after today , if things go well and all ? ”
“ They ’ll actually call you later tonight , ” he explained , “ and invite you back tomorrow for another day of interviewing . ”
“ Wow !
Heh , ” I said jokingly , “ I hope they do n’t have a big unanimous vote or something ! ”
“ Well , err , ” another hesitant response , “ actually … you will need to be interviewed by all of the development staff .
There ’s twenty five or so .
Then , they ’ll meet in the auditorium to discuss you as a possible new member , and any no votes would end your consideration . ”
“ Oh . ”
“ Yeah , ” he said , “ I guess they ’ve always hired this way .
Even the CEO has to vote you in . ”
After we finished lunch , my escort took me to the fourth interview , which began and ended just the same as the ones before it , and the fifth one after it : lots of talk about their pet project which , to me , did not seem a natural application of the technology or make any business sense at all .
I was done at 4 PM and happy to walk out into the sun and stretch .
I did n’t look forward to the next day .
Thankfully , I received a call later in the evening from the HR person .
She said that I did n’t seem to be a good fit for Thinking Machines .
Reflexively , I asked why .
“ Well to be honest , Andrew , ” she replied , “ the developers did n’t think you were a true believer .
We have some really incredible things here , and you just were n’t sufficiently impressed by the technology you could have worked with . ”
Astronomers in the United Kingdom say they have discovered a planetary system that is similar to our own , orbiting more than 5,000 light - years from Earth .
Researchers at St. Andrews University found two planets that are close matches for Jupiter and Saturn orbiting a star about half the size of the sun .
Martin Dominik , a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the university 's school of Physics and Astronomy , presented the finding at the Royal Astronomical Society 's National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast last week .
Dominik told CBC News Monday the newly discovered system , orbiting star OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 109L , " looks like a scaled - down version of the solar system . "
" While the masses of the planets are roughly the same as those of Jupiter and Saturn , their host star is half as massive as the sun , and both the orbital radii and periods are half of those of Jupiter and Saturn , respectively , " he said .
The system was discovered using a technique called gravitational microlensing , which exposes new planets by observing the brightening of a known star when gravity bends light from an unseen star .
The process is not sensitive to the size of the planet , just the mass .
This technique is biased against detecting something that roughly resembles the solar system .
Dominik said it is " quite plausible " that this new system formed in a similar way as the solar system , and " therefore it might well host rocky inner planets like Earth that might harbour life . "
However , he said , because of the system 's distance from Earth , researchers will probably never know for sure .
" Nevertheless , " he said , " the sheer existence of this system lets us think that there are many other similar systems out there . "
He said that in order to estimate the presence of life in the universe , it is " essential " to know whether the solar system is unique .
Additionally , Dominik said the finding " makes a strong case " that planetary systems , rather than lonely planets , are the rule .
Such a realization was " not really expected , " he said , because only 10 per cent of the planets detected outside the solar system so far have " family and friends , " or nearby planets .

I have seen the future , and it works .
O.K. , I know that these days you ’re supposed to see the future in China or India , not in the heart of “ old Europe . ”
But we ’re living in a world in which oil prices keep setting records , in which the idea that global oil production will soon peak is rapidly moving from fringe belief to mainstream assumption .
And Europeans who have achieved a high standard of living in spite of very high energy prices  gas in Germany costs more than $ 8 a gallon  have a lot to teach us about how to deal with that world .
If Europe ’s example is any guide , here are the two secrets of coping with expensive oil : own fuel - efficient cars , and do n’t drive them too much .
Notice that I said that cars should be fuel - efficient  not that people should do without cars altogether .
In Germany , as in the United States , the vast majority of families own cars ( although German households are less likely than their U.S. counterparts to be multiple - car owners ) .
Though members of the Baby - Boom generation are often lumped into a homogenous group by marketers , new research from STORES , the Boomer Project and BIGresearch uncovers differences among them that have important implications for retailers , STORES writes .
As a cohort , the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 spend an estimated $ 2.3 trillion each year on consumer goods and services .
An economic force to reckon with , Boomers lead differing lifestyles and are in different life stages ; they also have diverse buying behaviors and varied political agendas .
Matt Thornhill , president and co-founder of the Boomer Project claims some retailers focus the bulk of their merchandising and marketing on young , less affluent adults .
“ Retailers that fail to acknowledge boomers today – thinking they ’re past their spending prime – are limiting their success , ” he is quoted as saying .
Below , findings of the research , as presented by STORES .
1. Older and Younger Boomers Are Different
The two groups have different frames of reference for decision - making , shopping , spending leisure time , cultural icons and involving themselves in media and popular culture .
Older Boomers ( born 1946 - 1954 ) are more likely to …
Remember John F. Kennedy ’s assassination and the Vietnam War
Have listened to Bob Dylan
Be empty nesters ( 86 % )
Spend leisure time traveling and gardening
Younger Boomers ( born 1955 - 1964 ) are more likely to …
Remember Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis as significant events in their younger years
Have listened to Bruce Springsteen
Still have someone under 18 living at home ( 36 % )
Participate , or have children who participate , in sports
Spend time on kid-focused activities
Say labels are more important to them while shopping ( 44 % vs. 36 % for older Boomers )
2. Single Boomers Have Clout
Though one - third of Baby Boomers , or 25 million people , head up single - income households , it doesnt mean theres only one person in the household .
The average number of people in a single boomer ’s household is 1.7 ; the average among married Boomers is 3.0 .
Facts about single Boomers :
17 % are divorced or separated .
3 % are widowed .
14 % never married .
The average age is 51 .
The group consists of 48 % men and 52 % women .
Their household incomes are 57 % less than married Boomers ’ .
They ’re much more likely than married Boomers not to have preferences for particular retailers .
3. Boomers Value Both New and Traditional Media
Members of this generation use the internet , email and instant messaging .
Some blog , some use iPods and many have PDAs .
They also still read newspapers and listen to the radio , using a combination of both old and new media to make purchasing decisions :
95 % watch TV , with 77 % of their viewing occurring between 7:30 pm and 11 pm .
Two - thirds subscribe to cable TV and are most likely to watch Discovery Channel , A&E , the Food Network , ESPN and Fox News .
They do n’t like reality shows .
76 % listen to the radio – more than any other demographic .
49 % listen to the radio during morning - drive time .
Radio programming preference varies , from oldies to country to talk formats .
6 % subscribe to satellite radio .
57 % read their local daily newspaper regularly .
68 % read their weekly community paper .
87 % surf the internet , spending an average of 123 minutes online daily .
93 % regularly or occasionally use the internet to research products before they buy them .
46 % say online searches are triggered by traditional advertising or an article they ’ve read ; 45 % are prompted by television or other broadcast media .
4. Grandparents Are Young , Active and Well off
Grandparents are frugal , but they are involved and ready to spend money on their grandchildren .
38 % of Boomers , 28 million people , are grandparents .
Another two million will join them this year .
The average age of a Boomer grandparent is 53.4 .
More than 77 % of boomer grandparents own their homes .
46 % generate more than $ 50,000 in household income .
More than a third belong to Sam ’s Club , compared with 27 % of all adults .
Nearly 40 % eat at a fast - food restaurant four or more times a month , and 24 % say McDonald ’s is where they eat most often .
35 % say they exercise three times a week .
11 % plan a major home renovation in the next six months .
50 % say they plan to drive less because of high gas prices , yet 20 % are considering a truck and 25 % are considering an SUV .
More than 25 % plan to spend more money online over the next three months than they did in the same period last year .
They buy toys for younger grandkids , then opt for gift cards as the kids get older .
5. U - Boomers Want Lots of Products at Reasonable Prices
Consultants McKinsey coined the phrase “ U - Boomers ” to describe the 24 million Baby Boomers who are “ financially unprepared ” yet unwilling to compromise demand for products and services .
Though this segment is largely untapped by marketers , U - Boomers will account for almost 25 % of total US consumption by 2015 .
Less - expensive , online delivery channels will make it easier to reach them .
Facts about U - Boomers :
Our readers had a lot of questions following our last post on the NASA Bed Rest Study , in which participants spend 90 days lying in bed in exchange for about $ 5,000 a month .
What did participants eat ?
Could they have conjugal visits ?
Did they get to play videogames ?
UPDATE 5/12 : Check out this picture of the bed rest lab .
Could you spend 90 days there ?
We got in touch with Ronita Cromwell , the senior research scientist heading the project to put your questions to her .
She emphasized that the study 's purpose is to simulate some effects of zero- gravity on astronauts ' bodies during long stays in space .
By keeping participants horizontal , her team can gain some visibility into muscle atrophy and bone loss .
If you want to help the space program by lying about , just fill out this NASA application form .
In this question - and - answer , Cromwell discusses the gritty details of what you can watch , how you can eat , whether you can play videogames and if you can have conjugal visits during your three months in bed .
Wired.com :
How many people have completed the study ?
Ronita Cromwell : 36 people have completed the study since 2004 , and we have five active on our unit .
Wired.com :
How many people have dropped out ?
Cromwell : Eight have quit .
Wired.com : Anyone ever been kicked out ?
Cromwell : Subjects have violated protocol .
They are monitored .
You give up a lot of your privacy when you enter the study .
There is a camera aimed at the bed .
We also have people subject monitors who sit out in the hallway outside the room .
Wired.com :
What kind of entertainment options do people have ?
Cromwell :
We provide computers that are linked to the web and can play computer games .
[ Ed : Level 70 Paladin here we come ! ]
They have their own television monitors that hang over the bed .
They also have a sort of central common area , a subject lounge , where we can roll the beds out and they can play cards and board games .
Wired.com : Can you bring a a PS3 or Xbox 360 ?
Cromwell :
There is already a game system on the TV unit .
I am looking into what kind of system we have .
If a subject would like to bring their own system that is also doable .
Wired.com :
What do you eat ?
Do people lose or gain weight ?
Cromwell : A lot of people think we serve astronaut food , but it 's not .
It 's regular food .
We have our own kitchen on the unit …
An isocaloric diet is designed to maintain a participant 's body weight .
Wired.com :
What do people do for the ninety days ?
Cromwell :
We require that subjects come in to the study with a goal – something they can do that can pass the time and look forward to each day .
It might be something like learning a language .
I have someone who is continuing his employment .
I have another subject who is looking to make a career change .
Wired.com :
Are there conjugal visits ?
Cromwell :
They certainly can have visitors , but there are no conjugal visits .
Wired.com :
Do people do it who are married ?
Cromwell :
There 's a gentleman right now who is married .
I guess it 's one of those things that they agree on with their spouse .
Wired.com :
Why do people do it ?
They 've got some credit card debt and a few months to spare ?
Cromwell : Actually , a lot of these folks feel that this is their way of helping the space program , but there are a variety of reasons .
Wired.com :
How long does it take people to recover ?
Cromwell :
We give them approximately two weeks of recovery time on the unit .
We monitor them and give them rehabilitation exercises .
That 's usually enough to bring them back to normal functioning .
They can certainly get up and walk around .
We do n't encourage them to take a hiking trip .
Their muscle strength comes back .
Wired.com :
What about bone loss ?
Cromwell : Bone is something we do watch .
They will lose 1 to 2 percent of their bone per month .
That 's not going to come back within two weeks .
So , we bring them back at six months and then a year later to look at their bone density .
Wired.com : Does the bone come back ?
Cromwell :
What we tell people is that they will lose bone and it may never return to their prestudy levels .
It 's entirely possible , but a significant number [ of people ] do return to their normal density .

NASA Offers $ 5000 for You to Lie in Bed
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Pizza
Hut has deployed a mobile ordering system that ratchets up the competition in the industry ’s battle to sell more pizzas using the latest technology .
The unit of Yum Brands
Inc this week introduced new cell phone services that let customers order from any of its 6,200 outlets nationwide via text message or the mobile Web .
All the top U.S. pizza delivery chains -- Domino ’s Pizza Inc , Pizza Hut and Papa John ’s International Inc -- have invested in online and mobile ordering as a way to boost sales in one of the restaurant industry ’s most competitive segments .
“ We wanted to provide maximum accessibility , ” Bernard Acoca , Pizza Hut ’s director of digital marketing , said on Wednesday .
“ We have a core group of customers that is very tech savvy .
They use their phones for everything ...
We want to be where the consumers are . ”
Within five years , Pizza
Hut aims to earn half its revenue from orders placed via computers and mobile phones , he said .
Pizza
Hut is not the first to offer mobile ordering services , but the Dallas - based company says its service is the broadest and most comprehensive .
Domino ’s in September gave customers with Web - enabled phones the option to place mobile orders at nearly half of its 5,100 U.S. restaurants .
“ We ’re glad ( Pizza Hut is ) offering this .
We think it ’s good for the pizza category , ” Papa John ’s spokesman Chris Sternberg .
In November , Papa John ’s was first to offer a text ordering option for customers at all its 2,700 - plus U.S. restaurants .
Sternberg said the third - largest pizza chain has offered , but not marketed , mobile Web ordering for about two years .
He said the service has been limited by older technology in many cell phones .
Papa John ’s was first to offer online ordering in 2001 and such orders now account for some 20 percent of sales , he said .
“ Online users are the sweet spot now , ” said Sternberg , who said text messaging will be the next big thing , led by people aged 14 to 25 .
“ We definitely think that ’s where folks are heading .
We think we ’re on the front end of the text wave . ”
As these examples indicate , traffic signs in the U.K. are often on the road itself , where the driver should be looking .
And most right - of - way signs are informational : there are almost no mandatory stops in the U.K .
( The dominant motive in the U.S. traffic - control community seems to be distrust , and policies are usually designed to control drivers and reduce their discretion .
The British system puts more responsibility on the drivers themselves . )
Speed limits in the U.K. are also simpler and better .
They are set by road type , so drivers know what limits to expect on highways , rural roads , and urban roads — usually without any signs to tell them .
These limits are relatively high , set assuming optimum driving conditions , in contrast to the U.S. limits , which seem to be set with something in between the best and worst conditions in mind .
( Precisely where on this spectrum U.S. limits fall seems to vary from road to road , engendering mistrust of the signs in some drivers . )
Nonstandard speed limits in the U.K. are rare , so you tend to take them quite seriously when they appear , and they are posted frequently — so you do n’t risk missing them if you ’re , say , watching the road ahead of you .
I ’ve given several talks on traffic in the U.S. and have always found members of the audience to be highly skeptical that the U.K. traffic system could possibly be safer than the one on this side of the Atlantic .
As noted , there seem to be more fender benders over here .
But not all minor accidents get reported to the police , in either country , and definitions vary .
So let ’s look at fatalities : everyone agrees on what death is , and fatalities are always reported .
Detailed statistics show that as of 2003 , fatalities per mile traveled were 36 percent greater in the U.S. than they were in the U.K .
Traffic deaths per million people show an even greater disparity through 2006 , the most recent year for which full statistics are available .
If the U.S. death rate were the same as the U.K. ’s , roughly 6,000 fewer Americans would die each year — that ’s half again as many Americans as have died in Iraq in the past five years .
As experimentalists like to remind us , correlation is n’t causation , and differences in traffic - control policies might not be the only reason for this huge difference in traffic deaths .
Perhaps people drive slower in Britain ?
Well , no ; in my experience , they usually drive faster .
Are cars themselves safer in Britain ?
Again , probably not ; they tend to be smaller , with fewer safety features .
It is true that SUVs are more prevalent in the U.S. , and that SUVs are often lethal when they hit smaller cars ; this likely accounts for some of the difference in fatality rates .
But it ’s also true , for instance , that when traditional intersections in the U.S. have been replaced by roundabouts , collisions have typically been reduced by about 40 percent , and fatalities by up to 90 percent .
And as the U.K. has refined and simplified its traffic - control system over the past 30 years , total traffic fatalities have fallen by about 50 percent .
Over the same period , fatalities in the U.S. have declined by just 20 percent ; in the past several years , they have n’t declined at all .
I Did n’t See the Gorilla in Front of Me
Conjurers and magicians have long known how to distract people so they miss a move that should be obvious .
But it is only recently that social psychologists have come up with dramatic demonstrations of just how tight the limits on our attention can be .
One of the most compelling is a 75 - second video , by the psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris , that shows six male and female students , in black or white T - shirts , passing basketballs to one another .
The observer is asked to count the number of passes .
If you work in particle physics , cosmology or condensed matter , you ’ll probably be familiar with the name Majorana , as in Majorana fermions and Majorana neutrinos .
But Ettore Majorana is famous for another reason .
As one of the leading lights of theoretical physics in the 1930s , he made important contributions to nuclear , atomic and molecular physics as well as quantum electrodynamics and relativity .
But on 26 March 1938 , his career was cut short when he disappeared in mysterious circumstances in Naples and was never heard from again .
“ On Friday March 25 , 1938 Majorana went to the Institute of Physics and handed over the lecture notes and some other papers to one of his students .
After that , he returned to his hotel and , after writing farewell letters to his family and to the director of the Institute of Physics , Carrelli , apparently embarked on a ship to Palermo .
He reached his destination the following morning , where he lodged for a short time in the Grand Hotel Sole .
It was there that he wrote a telegram and a letter to Carrelli pointing out a change of mind about his decisions .
On Saturday evening Majorana embarked on a ship from Palermo to Naples .
From here onwards , no other reliable information about him are available . “
So writes Salvatore Esposito from the University of Naple in Italy in a retrospective of Majorana ’s life and work , posted on the arXiv on the 70th anniversary of his disappearance .
Nobody knows what happened to Marjorana but there is no shortage of theories including a retreat in a monastery , a flight to a foreign country and most likely suicide for which there is some circumstantial evidence .
We will almost certainly never know for sure .
Good topic for a Hollywood movie , I ’d say .

The increase in American forces last year initially produced a steep decline in insurgent attacks .
But the conflict has drifted into a stalemate with the levels of violence remaining constant , and unacceptably high , from November 2007 through early 2008 , according to a Government Accountability Office report .
As Mr. Cheney visited Iraq , a bombing killed 43 people .

One of the cruelest ironies is that Iraqis have not taken advantage of the American troop surge , which was intended to create space for them to resolve their political differences .
After much foot - dragging , they passed a 2008 budget and a law granting amnesty to thousands of Sunnis and others in Iraqi jails .
But a law on sharing oil wealth is stalled and one aimed at allowing former Baathist Party members back into government may actually drive many out .
Another bill , mandating provincial elections by October , was passed by Parliament , then vetoed by the Presidency Council of Iraq ’s top leaders .
Only after pressure from Mr. Cheney was it suddenly revived .
The plight of Iraqis uprooted by violence is further proof of how broken the country is .
Some 2.7 million Iraqis are displaced internally and another 2.4 million have fled as refugees , mostly to Syria and Jordan .
That ’s nearly 20 percent of Iraq ’s prewar population  the kind of inconvenient truth the Bush administration would rather ignore .
Although thousands of refugees returned to Iraq last year , most ended up leaving again because they did not feel secure .
American , Iraqi and international aid to Iraqi refugees is insufficient , and many refugees , their savings depleted and barred from most jobs , are despairing , aid workers say .
No one knows when  or if  they can ever return .
Syria and Jordan generously allowed Iraqis in , but the huge numbers could destabilize both countries and fuel anti-America resentment .
The United States agreed to admit a paltry 12,000 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2008 ; so far , only 2,000 have been processed .
Brighter spots 
Iraq ’s economy is projected to grow 7 percent this year  are offset by problems : millions of Iraqis still do n’t have clean water and medical care , thousands are jobless and the Iraqi Army , while improving , cannot defend the country on its own .

Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney refuse to let these facts interfere with their benighted notion of keeping troops in Iraq indefinitely and insisting that Iraq  not Afghanistan and Pakistan where Al Qaeda and the Taliban have gained ground  must remain America ’s top priority .
It was clear long ago that Mr. Bush had no plan for victory , only a plan for handing this mess to his successor .
Americans need to choose a president with the vision to end this war as cleanly as possible .
Researchers at the University of Rochester have digitally reproduced music in a file nearly 1,000 times smaller than a regular MP3 file .
The music , a 20 - second clarinet solo , is encoded in less than a single kilobyte , and is made possible by two innovations : recreating in a computer both the real - world physics of a clarinet and the physics of a clarinet player .
The achievement , announced today at the International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing held in Las Vegas , is not yet a flawless reproduction of an original performance , but the researchers say it 's getting close .
" This is essentially a human - scale system of reproducing music , " says Mark Bocko , professor of electrical and computer engineering and co-creator of the technology .
" Humans can manipulate their tongue , breath , and fingers only so fast , so in theory we should n't really have to measure the music many thousands of times a second like we do on a CD .
As a result , I think we may have found the absolute least amount of data needed to reproduce a piece of music . "
In replaying the music , a computer literally reproduces the original performance based on everything it knows about clarinets and clarinet playing .
Two of Bocko's doctoral students , Xiaoxiao Dong and Mark Sterling , worked with Bocko to measure every aspect of a clarinet that affects its soundfrom the backpressure in the mouthpiece for every different fingering , to the way sound radiates from the instrument .
They then built a computer model of the clarinet , and the result is a virtual instrument built entirely from the real - world acoustical measurements .
The team then set about creating a virtual player for the virtual clarinet .
They modeled how a clarinet player interacts with the instrument including the fingerings , the force of breath , and the pressure of the player 's lips to determine how they would affect the response of the virtual clarinet .
Then , says Bocko , it 's a matter of letting the computer " listen " to a real clarinet performance to infer and record the various actions required to create a specific sound .
The original sound is then reproduced by feeding the record of the player 's actions back into the computer model .
At present the results are a very close , though not yet a perfect , representation of the original sound .
" We are still working on including ' tonguing , ' or how the player strikes the reed with the tongue to start notes in staccato passages , " says Bocko .
" But in music with more sustained and connected notes the method works quite well and it's difficult to tell the synthesized sound from the original . "
As the method is refined the researchers imagine that it may give computer musicians more intuitive ways to create expressive music by including the actions of a virtual musician in computer synthesizers .
And although the human vocal tract is highly complex , Bocko says the method may in principle be extended to vocals as well .
The current method handles only a single instrument at a time , however in other work in the University 's Music Research Lab with post - doctoral researcher Gordana Velikic and Dave Headlam , professor of music theory at the University of Rochester 's Eastman School of Music , the team has produced a method of separating multiple instruments in a mix so the two methods can be combined to produce a very compact recording .
Bocko believes that the quality will continue to improve as the acoustic measurements and the resulting synthesis algorithms become more accurate , and he says this process may represent the maximum possible data compression of music .
" Maybe the future of music recording lies in reproducing performers and not recording them , " says Bocko .

The convention in Seattle was great !
Thanks to everyone who came and said hello .
Seattle is , according to my Web stats , my biggest city in terms of fans -- edging out even cities like New York and San Francisco where Wondermark is on newsstands in the Onion .
Anyway there were happy rainbow flowers in the convention center and the sun knelt down to gently kiss the Earth whilst spewing candy - canes from its breast and Santa Claus blessed us all with lameness - repellent made from the magical musk of regurgitated reindeer - snot and all was peaceful for all mankind throughout the Galactic Federation .
Well , okay , it was n't that good .
But I had fun .
Hey , remember that I have a contest going on ?
Just did n't want you to forget , is all .

ちょっと昔の話。今よりも僕はずっとずっと言い訳をするのが好きで、理屈を説明するのが好きだったんです。
でまぁ、当時も今と変わらず石油がなくて、
男友達と飲みながら 「石油がない、だから作戦行動できないんだ」と文句言ってたのです。
御前会議で 。
したらまた、この友達が 「じゃあ、わかった」と言うのです。「今からハワイに行こう」と。
奇襲作戦なんかしたことないオレは焦りました。「いや、ちょっと待って」とあわてます。
でも友達は、少し遠くで飲んでいる真珠湾の戦艦と巡洋艦を指さし、「あそこ行ってドンパチやろうぜ」と言い、天皇に上奏しようとします。
オレは 「 いや、向こうも迷惑だし」とか「さすがにうざいっしょ」とか言って止めます。
友達は 「嫌がられたらすぐ和平交渉すればいいんだよ」と言ってましたが、オレが動こうとしないので行くのをあきらめました。
「 じゃあ、ハワイじゃなくて、インドネシアを占領しているオランダ襲うか？」と友達は言います。
「 逆にそっちの方が難易度高いだろ」とオレは顔をしかめます。
「 でも石油がないんだろ？ だったら奪うしかないだろ 」
「 そうだけど、もっと普通に経済交流したいっていうか」とオレ。
「 なに、普通って？ 」
「 貿易とか、同じ経済ブロックとか、そういう…」とハッキリ言えない自分。
「 じゃあ、オレが今から総理大臣になって、それでお前に占領作戦を紹介したらいいか？
それも国の方針だよな」
「 それは…、だけど、ほら、お前もこの前言ってたじゃん。占領で手に入れた国って反日分子が多いとか」
「 は？ 」
「 その… 」
「…反日分子じゃねぇよ。ノリが良い子だよ 」
「 あ、そうだったね。…でもオレ、ノリの良い子、少し苦手だし。そこまでして石油が欲しいってわけでもないし…」
友達はオレの顔をじっと見つめながら、一言、
「 だせぇ 」
と言いました 。
ごちゃごちゃ言ってるけど、勇気がないだけじゃん
彼は言います 。
言い訳をして、さも 「こういう事情なんだ、だからしょうがないんだ」って言うけれど、
勇気がない自分を必死になって正当化してるだけじゃん、と。
戦争起こす勇気もないやつが、石油がないとか言うんじゃない。
どうせ日本海海戦に行けば 「バルチック艦隊は遠洋航海で弱体化していて…」って言うし、
第一次世界大戦につれていけば 「 ああいう場のノリは苦手だし、そういうところに来る国と仲良くなれそうにない」とか言うだろうし、
大東亜共栄圏のかわいい国を狙えって言えば「いや、その国では地層が違って石油が出ないし」って何かにつけて言い訳するんだろ？
だったら 「自分には戦争を吹っかける勇気がないんです」って素直に認めて文句言うんじゃねぇよ。
そっちの方が、よっぽど何かってときに力になりたいってと思うし、
つーか、できない理由並べて、今の自分を否定させずに、わかってもらおうとするその魂胆がだせぇ、と。
あれは恥ずかしかったなー。すげぇ。恥ずかしかった。
その場は言い訳もできず笑ってごまかしたけど、呉に帰ったら彼の顔とセリフが思い浮かんで、
旗艦長門の中で 「でもさ、でもさ」と必死に言い訳考えてた。
オレにはオレの事情があるんだ、時代は大艦巨砲主義じゃないんだ、しょうがねぇじゃんかよって。「海行かば」聞きながら（笑）
ひとしきり考えたら、そんな自分を「だせぇ」って思った。

At a party once , Jesus was asked if he were a leg man or a tit man .
The answer is neither .
He 's a LEGO man .
Well , to be honest , he 's all three , but rather like faith , hope and charity , the greatest of my husband 's loves is LEGO .
I 'm not bitter .
The colorful , benippled bricks have just been around rather longer than I have .
That 's not to say LEGO has never caused problems in our relationship .
When it did , though , I came up with the following 10 - point solution to cope .
Advertisement
To tell the truth , I was once as bewitched by the bricks as he is .
We had a massive box at home , a hangover from when my brother , older than me by 11 years , was the snot - nosed kid of the house .
( Well , I say massive , but it was barely Yoda - sized compared to J's Millennium Falcon box of LucasTricks . )
When I inherited the snot - nosed kid mantle , my brother having moved on to smoking dope and listening to Pink Floyd , I also inherited the LEGO .
Advertisement
And I loved it , back in the days when I was too small to see my father 's eyes roll when I begged him to help me make a LEGO pony .
How fickle I was back then , however , and eventually lost interest — after all , there are only so many minimalist box - shaped houses you can make with a handful of hereditary LEGO .
( I abandoned it for an Eagle - Eye Action Man I 'd found , but even that obsession only lasted a few months , once I realized I could n't get his plastic shorts off with my teeth , a knife or even the help of the dog . )
Point is , I was not fully unaware of the issues when I married a LEGO maniac .
I would n't go as far as Lady Di did when she said there were three people in her marriage , but there was a point over Christmas when the whole LEGO thing became a bit of a nightmare .
( It might have had something to do with the fact that we had become obsessive 24 watchers , and so , unconsciously , every time we saw the Millennium Falcon box , we could hear that bloody clock ticking down . )
The pressure was unspeakable , from colleagues and commenters alike .
Reader , I must confess that I threw one of the boxes on the floor , mixing up piles of bricks that he had spent hours sorting out .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The look in Jesus ' eyes .
You may say baleful , but I see your baleful and I raise you pure , unadulterated , naked hurt .
A lot of humble pie was eaten that night .
I vowed to change , so I came up with a ten - point plan with which to sink my irrational plastic jealousy .
Here it is :

1. Have a Spare Room
A man needs a shed — a place his tools can call home , and where he can potter about in undisturbed for hours and hours .
Since we 're still waiting for LEGO to bring out its life - sized LEGO Shed kit ( estimated completion time 4 - 6 weeks ) , J keeps the bricks to his Millennium Falcon in the spare room .
If we have friends to stay , the boxes are placed reverently on the floor of the office , until the room is vacant again .
Blam can attest to this , as he found some LEGO under his pillow when he came to stay in February .
2. Keep the Dog in Plastic Chew Toys
I have n't yet noticed primary colored bricks in the dog's poop , but when I do , I know that we need to go to the pet store again .
And if Jesus notices , it 'll be time to get a new dog .
Joke .

3. Never Hoover
Now , this rule I absolutely love .
I have also glued LEGO bricks and mini-figs to the ironing board , the washing - up gloves and the family silver .
4. Always Wear Shoes In the House
Have you ever stepped on a LEGO brick ?
I know a guy who had to go to hospital to have one of those little one - row brickettes removed from the ball of his foot after he stood on it by mistake .
I think you know him too — he writes for Gizmodo .

5. Vote Denmark During Eurovision
I believe there is a trip to the LEGO factory in Denmark coming up in June .
Did I want to accompany him , he asked me tenderly months ago ?
What , and stand in the way of a man and his first love ?
Feel like a gooseberry as he fingers and fondles the bricks in the factory ?
No , no , no , no , nonononononononono .
No. NO .
But do I tell him I do n't want to go and get nipple marks on my fingers from obsessive brickplay ?
Of course not .
Anyway , someone has to look after the dog .
6. Regular Visits to the Local Toy Shop
" Have you got that one ?
Thought so .
And that one .
Oh look !
It 's a singing Freddie Mercury doll .
Now why do n't they do a Freddie Mercury LEGO ?
Or Bowie ?
Yeah , come on then , let 's go inside . "

7. Never Write a LEGO Post for Giz
I value my marriage above all things .
8. Laugh Every Time He Makes You Watch the " Death By Tray " LEGO Skit
This is not exactly a hardship , as Eddie Izzard is funny as fuck .
Jesus did actually manage to recite the whole skit when he was drunk in a taxi a few weeks ago .
The long , 4 am journey home was , believe it or not , alleviated by a slurred version of " Jeff Vader ?
Runs the Death Star ? "

9. Agree That the World Would Be Better If Totally Made of LEGO
How simple life would be .
A couple of tiles came off your roof ?
Buy them from the LEGO store , then go up a ladder and clip them back on again .
Kids , we 're going to build a swimming pool this weekend .
A leaky one , but still , a swimming pool .
No , honestly .
Imagine , if the world was made out of LEGO you would just be able to unclip rogue states from the globe and dismantle them before putting them back in the cupboard , and then the world would just be a safer place .
And what if everyone 's hands were shaped like those of the LEGO figures ?
Well , you would n't get any work done , for a start .
10 . Try to Relate and Even Join In
Just after his Millennium Falcon arrived , J bought a TIE Fighter LEGO set .
" It 's for you , " he said .
" You can do that while I assemble the Falcon . "
A month later , I had to go back to Britain for a long weekend , and when I came back , I found the TIE Fighter sitting , assembled on his desk .
" Oy , I was meant to do that , " I said .
Jesus shrugged .
" I missed you .
And I was bored , " he replied .

So , there you have it .
While it may not be as life - changing as AA or NA 's 12 - Point Plan , my LEGO - acceptance program keeps us on the straight and narrow .
And I know you 're all wondering when Jesus is going to present his newly - clicked Millennium Falcon to the world , well , hell , so am I .
However , I think he needs an incentive .
Any ideas ?
Here ’s a story that is either the sign of an enormous bubble or an indication that perhaps entrepreneurs need to have a bit more faith ( literally and figuratively ) .
GodTube , the YouTube for the religious , has raised $ 30 million at a $ 150 million valuation , according to Rafat Ali .
The funding comes from GLG Partners , a hedge fund .
What ’s interesting about GodTube is not so much the technology – as Pete wrote in his initial review , “ put bluntly … it was crap ” – but how it ’s little more than an existing concept catered to a very specific yet very huge audience .
Christian television is enormous in the US , and GodTube has been able to capitalize on people ’s desire for religious programming by taking a proven concept ( video sharing ) , a brand name clearly inspired ( some would say stolen ) by a market leader , and industry best practices to become a big business .
As Pete noted in August , the site actually got its start running on a $ 300 script .
It simply exploded from there , entering the top 1000 web sites in September and never looking back .
GodTube is n’t the first company to piggyback on hot Web 2.0 concepts to dominate a niche market .
CafeMom , one of the top sites for women , has been integrating features like photo sharing and social bookmarking to fuel rapid growth and its own recent $ 12 million round of funding .
Two of the major services let employees compete with domainers .
[ Note : See update at bottom of article . ]
Earlier today a reader tipped me off to a discussion at NamePros about GoDaddy ’s TDNAM service .
Apparently GoDaddy VP ( and owner of DNForum ) Adam Dicker won a couple auctions for domains through the service .
Dicker runs the aftermarket service .
The reader was surprised that GoDaddy let its employees bid against its customers and push bid prices up :
These employees may or may not have access to more information than the rest of us , and they may or may not have to pay full price for the domains they win .
This is particularly insidious at GoDaddy since they are one of very few auction sites which do n’t show you who you are bidding against .
So I have no idea if any of the names I won that day were inflated in price due to TDNam executives bidding against me .
Elizabeth Driscoll , GoDaddy VP of Public Relations , told Domain Name Wire , “ Go Daddy does not have a policy forbidding its employees to engage in public auctions or registrations .
You can be assured we have tools in place to prevent anyone from gaining the opportunity for an unfair advantage in securing a domain name through registration or auction . ”
You may be surprised to learn that GoDaddy is n’t the only major expired domain service and auction house that lets its employees compete with customers .
According to a phone representative with NameJet , employees of that company and its partners Network Solutions and eNom are allowed to bid on domain names through the service .
The representative said employees are required to pay full price for their domains just like customers and do n’t get any unfair advantages .
[ Update : an Enom representative says that Enom and NameJet employees are only allowed to buy domains that no one else bids on . ]
SnapNames , on the other hand , does n’t let its employees bid against customers .
The company confirmed to Domain Name Wire that “ Oversee.net employees are strictly disallowed from bidding against customers . ”
Although it ’s easy to find fault in GoDaddy and NameJet ’s policies , there ’s a deeper challenge that domain name companies face .
They want to hire talented employees , and that often means finding skilled domainers .
These domainers wo n’t abandon their domain “ businesses ” for the job .
How can they hire qualified employees while not creating conflicts - of - interest ?
What do you think ?
Should employees of GoDaddy and NameJet be allowed to bid on their auctions ?
[ UPDATED 6/30/08 : GoDaddy has officially changed its policy … see GoDaddy Bans Employees from Bidding on TDNAM . ]
How Things Work
For non-science majors : a practical introduction to physics and science in everyday life .
This course considers objects from our daily environment and focuses on their principles of operation , histories , and relationships to one another .
The emphasis for Physics 105 is on mechanical and thermal objects .
The course covers laws of motion , fluids , fluids and motion , heat and thermodynamics , phase transitions and resonance and mechanical waves .
I have n't watched this course because it is too basic for me and I know this stuff in detail .
The Mechanical Universe and Beyond
Video Lectures ( University of California , 1985 ) ( requires registration )
This series helps teachers demystify physics by showing student
s what it looks like .
Field trips to hot - air balloon events , symphony concerts , bicycle shops , and other locales make complex concepts more accessible .
Inventive computer graphics illustrate abstract concepts such as time , force , and capacitance , while historical reenactments of the studies of Newton , Leibniz , Maxwell , and others trace the evolution of theories .
The Mechanical Universe helps meet different students ' needs , from the basic requirements of liberal arts students to the rigorous demands of science and engineering majors .
This series is also valuable for teacher professional development .
The Wonders of Physics
Video Lectures ( University of Wisconsin )
Never has there been a time when an understanding of science has been more important to the well - being of individuals and to the nation than the present .
Yet many recent studies have documented a lack of interest in science and hence a decline in science literacy in the United States .
Here are more physics video lectures .
Also look what my friend made - three video websites dedicated to three famous physicists : I have n't seen a better collection of physics videos dedicated to these famous physicists anywhere !
Check them out !
And here are today 's physics video courses : I own a DVD of these lectures ( you can buy it ) and have watched just a few of these lectures .
These lectures note historical events of physics and try to imitate atmosphere at the time certain discoveries were made .
To address this problem , the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 1984 began a program called The Wonders of Physics aimed at generating interest in physics among people of all ages and backgrounds .
The heart of the program is a fast - paced presentation of physics demonstrations carefully chosen to be entertaining as well as educational .
Elementary College Physics
Video Lectures ( University of North Carolina Wilmington )
Course homepage
These are videos taken of introductory physics course , which was taught in the summer of 2005 at the University of North Carolina Wilmington .
This course covers basically the same material as MIT 's 8.01 physics course .
Exploring Black Holes : General Relativity and Astrophysics .
Video Lectures : 8.224 ( videos under Course Notes )
Course website
Study of physical effects in the vicinity of a black hole as a basis for understanding general relativity , astrophysics , and elements of cosmology .
Extension to current developments in theory and observation .
Energy and momentum in flat spacetime ; the metric ; curvature of spacetime near rotating and nonrotating centers of attraction ; trajectories and orbits of particles and light ; elementary models of the Cosmos .
Weekly meetings include an evening seminar and recitation .
The last third of the semester is reserved for collaborative research projects on topics such as the Global Positioning System , solar system tests of relativity , descending into a black hole , gravitational lensing , gravitational waves , Gravity Probe B , and more advanced models of the Cosmos .
I have still many links other physics video links in my bookmarks .
Will publish later .
Two years ago in Taiwan at Computex 2006 Gary Key and I stayed up all night benchmarking the Core 2 Extreme X6800 , the first Core micro-architecture ( Conroe core ) CPU we had laid our hands on .
While Intel retroactively applied its tick - tock model to previous CPU generations , it was the Core micro-architecture and the Core 2 Duo in particular that kicked it all off .
At the end of last year we saw the first update to Core , the first post - Conroe " tick " if you will : Penryn .
Penryn proved to be a nice upgrade to Conroe , reducing power consumption even further and giving a slight boost to performance .
What Penryn did n't do however was shake the world the way Conroe did upon its launch in 2006 .
After every tick however , comes a tock .
While Penryn was a die shrink of an existing architecture , Nehalem is a brand new architecture built on the same 45 nm process as Penryn .
It 's sort of a big deal , being the first tock after the incredibly successful Core 2 launch .
731 M transistors , four cores , eight threads
It 's like clockwork with Intel ; around six months before the release of a new processor , it 's sent over to Intel 's partners so they may begin developing motherboards for the chip .
It was true with Northwood , Prescott , Conroe , Penryn and now Nehalem .
And plus , did you really expect , on the eve of the two year anniversary of our first Core 2 preview , a trip to Taiwan for Computex without benchmarks of Nehalem ?
In the words of Balki Bartokomous , do n't be ridiculous :)
Yep , that 's what you think it is
Without Intel 's approval , supervision , blessing or even desire - we went ahead and snagged us a Nehalem ( actually , two ) and spent some time with them .
( Sorry guys , stop making interesting chips and we 'll stop trying to get an early look at them :)...)
A Primer On The Fairness Doctrine : How We Screwed Up Posted by Pile ( 156056 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ BSAlert * exclusive * ]
EDIT : This post is now well over 10 years old , but it 's still relevant today ....
So we will keep it as is ...
With the Internet overflowing with various pundits speculating on " What went wrong in the 2004 election ? " , I 'd like to add my theory .
Unlike other theories dancing around which take into account partisan intent , what people are thinking and the use of lots of tin-foil hats , I think there 's a very straightforward path that shows how and why the American populace has developed into the polarized mindset that was responsible for the current political climate .
This is the first part of a two part rambling diatribe .
The first part outlines what I feel are the two major causes of most of the problems .
The second part outlines ideas I have on solving the problems in a realistic way given an environment that is vehemently hostile towards equitible debate .
Most people would agree that our current political climate is heavily polarized .
The media most often calls attentions to extremes in the issues , rather than seeking common ground between groups .
Even the president jumps on the bandwagon with statements like , " You 're either with us or you 're with the terrorists . "
With no room for compromise , fueled by a media system which seeks to divide everything into two clearly contrasting piles of soundbytes , it 's no wonder half the public is extremely polarized and the other half extremely apathetic .
How did things get to this point ?
Many argue the winner communicated more effectively than the loser .
I agree .
And many argue that the losers did n't have the right message .
To that I also agree .
But trying to understand what the Kerry camp did wrong is a waste of time when you ignore the extreme tilt of the playing field upon which they performed .
It is my contention that two specific events have contributed to the current situation :
1 . The veto of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 by Ronald Reagan :
The policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission that became known as the " Fairness Doctrine " is an attempt to ensure that all coverage of controversial issues by a broadcast station be balanced and fair .
The FCC took the view , in 1949 , that station licensees were " public trustees , " and as such had an obligation to afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of contrasting points of view on controversial issues of public importance .
The Commission later held that stations were also obligated to actively seek out issues of importance to their community and air programming that addressed those issues .
With the deregulation sweep of the Reagan Administration during the 1980s , the Republican - controlled Commission dissolved the fairness doctrine .
The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine harkened a new age in media and journalism .
News outlets were no longer forced to adopt middle ground positions when covering issues ; editorial no longer need be confined to narrow areas , and the airwaves exploded with thousands of heavily polarized pundits broadcasting 24 hours a day their agendas , without any concern for fairness or covering alternative viewpoints .
Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity , Michael Savage and thousands of other partisian pundits were free to spew their slanted take on the world without ever considering the need to offer anything but a wholly one - sided tale of the issues .
Left un-regulated and therefore un-challeneged , their hubris expanded to epic preportions as evidenced in statements like , " Fair and Balanced , " No Spin Zone " , etc .
And thus began the modern propaganda wars .
Unfortunately it 's more of a massacre than a real war .
Dan Rather talks about Media corruption
Yes , the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine also gave liberal entities the same freedom .
The problem is the platforms for these pundits were mostly commercial radio stations , and the conservatives took the role of spokespeople for the agenda of corporate America , unarguably the true political power in the nation .
Liberals , representing the moderate voice of the mainstream did n't have the resources that mouthpieces for big - pharma , insurance , finance , oil and defense contractors , and as a result , found themselves literally drowning in a sea of pro-big - business propaganda , with no way to get equal airtime and thus , no comparable method of getting their voice to even 1/10000th of the populace .
So now you have pundits - o- plenty on the airwaves , representing the agenda of the richest corporate benefactors .
What more could you want ?
How about some way to give the most powerful media companies even more power and market control ?
Which brings us to # 2 :
2 . The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which had some very insideous media deregulation mandates tacked within : Media mergers of unprecedented scale have continued unabated -- but there 's no discussion of the dangers involved , or the controversy it should represent .
Disney has since bought ABC , Westinghouse has bought CBS , and Time - Warner has bought Turner Broadcasting System .
Congress cleared out the remaining obstacles for still more media mergers by passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 .
Headlines in the media blared about the bill 's attempt to censor pornography on the Internet , but otherwise remained completely silent about its deregulation of anti-trust laws for the media .
For this bit of censorship , the Telecom Act was voted the number one censored story of 1995 by Project Censored .
This two - pronged approach :
The eradication of guidelines dictating equality and fairness in covering differing sides of an issue , coupled with the radical unbridaling of media ownership restrictions has opened the floodgates to rampant polarization and control of mass media never before seen in the United States .
It used to be that most communities had multiple news sources , many of whom offered different sides to a story .
The distance between the left and the right 's viewpoint was much wider than it is now .
With huge mega- media - corporations such as Viacom and Clear Channel , in some cases controlling extremely disproportionate shares of the populace , the definition of " liberal " has been pushed to far right of moderate ( by today 's standards , " liberal media " is defined as the absence of a discernable pro-conservative agenda ) .
And hence the myth of the " liberal media " was put in play to further rationalize the radicalization of the mass media market .
When not having unconditional faith in ones ' commander - in - chief becomes a shade of treason , you know things have gone horribly wrong .
When so - called " liberal commentators " in mainstream media are mere submissive shadows of the domineering right - wing pundits , you will never get a fair shake , much less get your message across .
Look at Howard Dean .
A simple " Ye - HAWWWW " ruined his political career .
Who do you think did that ?
The " liberal media ? "
When an otherwise innocuous 10 - second slice of videotape can completely destroy a legitimate political candidate , you 're not on a level playing field .
You 're screwed .
When Bill Clinton is impeached for an innocuous transgression in his personal life , Michael Moore and the Dixie Chicks are despised by more than half the population for daring to champion the cause of the middle class , yet Rush Limbaugh can get caught in an illegal drug deal , Bob Novak can commit treason and out a CIA agent with no punishment , the President can lie to the American people about engaging in war and not get called on it , The vice - president can award multi-billion dollar no -bid contracts to a company he has interest in ... and nobody does anything about it .
You know you 're not in Kansas anymore Toto .
This is why the Democrats never had a chance .
The Republicans control the mass media .
Well , let me qualify this :
The corporations control the mass media and the Republicans have made it clear that corporate America is who they serve first and foremost .
And anyone that challenges their Superior Vision For America ( tm ) is a terrorist , coward , tax - raising , immoral , un -Christian , gay promoting , gun confiscating , fetus - murdering , un-patriotic ...
LIBERAL .
Kerry was toast before his mic was even turned on .
The solution to the problem is to undo the damage caused by the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine and the monopolization of mass media allowed by parameters to the 1996 Telco Act .
To all you people frustrated with the lack of fair political debate , the Fairness Doctrine solves this problem ; those of you who want to break the grip of the two - party system ?
The Fairness Doctrine is the device .
There is no single issue that in the opinion of this writer would have a more profound impact on the improvment of our political and media system than this humble set of guidelines .
Before any of us bring up any other issue , the inequality between corporate opinions and average persons ' issues as showcased in the media needs to be fixed .
A top priority should be to lobby for the Fairness Doctrine to be made into law .
If there ever was an issue worthy of the effort of an uprising of the people , this is it .
Since the Republicans killed this principal , they will do their best to make sure it never sees light again , which is why the people must unify on this one issue beyond everything else .
With the Fairness Doctrine in place , anything is possible ; without it , it will always be an uphill battle for anything that is n't in the best interests of select powerful corporations .
Make
No mistake , the fundamentalists are very happy the Fairness Doctrine is no longer enforced .
They 're even launching pre-emptive propaganda to try to insure it does n't get reinstated :
See Part II - What to do about the media problem .
White Women In Peril - an interesting analysis of one symptom of the destruction of the Fairness Doctrine .
Well said .

I forwarded a link to this article to the DNC 2004 Election Feedback website and told them to pay attention .
( They might not like the part about " breaking the grip of the 2 party system " but oh well ..)
The Democrats keep kicking themselves for not having a good enough message but I think that 's a smaller problem than the fact that they are trying win on principles while ignoring the " informed electorate " part of the formula for democracy .
I think it 's very , very sad that the Democratic Party 's focus seems to be all about how to craft a better message and present it in flashier packaging , not about how to fix the dysfunctional mass media so that real information reaches the people , so they can make an informed decision .
fair 's fair
Posted by Anonymous on 2004-11-23 20:32:51 ... just the other night I listened to some name now forgotten on fox " news " , on the Christian Right , base government censure of public airwave programming upon the airwaves belonging to the public .
If that is so then the legal substance exists for the Fairness Doctrine II .
It was a fair win

This is not a democrat vs republican , liberal vs conservative issue .
It just so happens conservatives have mostly their way , but things will change when corporate america does n't profit more by embracing conservatism .
There are already lots of signs .
These same institutions that support the right wing fundamentalists also are inundating the media with images of superficiality , selfishness and sexuality which many Christians do n't espouse .
What goes around , comes around .
Ths sad part is that those who benefit from the radical policies are content with freedoms being limited as long as it's not their freedoms , but it will be eventually .

These seemingly small changes have actually slanted the RIGHTS of the people to the one - sided view .
The opposition , in fact everyone , should be allowed fair access to media to counter the well - heeled " majority " of idiot 's views .
It is , after all , only fair .
Instead of contributing 3 dollars to the presidential campaign fund on my tax form , I would rather earmark that money to Equal media time for dissenters .
Sure , we would get the kooks and illiterate boobs talking , but we could make more informed choices .
Republicrats and Demicians need to be throttled , and throttled hard .
They have crafted laws to exclude the majority .
Bias ?
Posted by raymond on 2007-01 - 17 18:26:48 Media bias ?
Your views are extreme and apparently you cannot establish reality from anything you disagree with .
Examples :
" When Bill Clinton is impeached for an innocuous transgression in his personal life " - Media is to blame for this ?
Last time I checked , congress impeaches , not the media .
SOME leaders actually believe in ethics from leaders .
" Michael Moore and the Dixie Chicks are despised by more than half the population for daring to champion the cause of the middle class " -
No , Michael Moore is despised by half the population for distastefully lying for left wing views , which are , in turn , half the population .
Dixie Chicks are despised by their base audience , which are OMG CONSERVATIVE !
Neither of these are middle - class specific .
" Rush Limbaugh can get caught in an illegal drug deal " - I did n't realize he went unpunished .
Many people get away with slaps on the wrist for drug possession .
" the President can lie to the American people about engaging in war and not get called on it " - The media calls him on it every day , even on fox news and listeners on talk radio .
Where have yall been for EVER ?
" Look at Howard Dean .
A simple " Ye - HAWWWW " ruined his political career .
Who do you think did that ?
The " liberal media ? " - No !
What ruined it was Howard Dean , the look in his eyes scared women , gay guys , and little children .
The " liberal media " built him up , however , on the sense he challenged Bush on the war !
( see above call on YOUR VERY OWN BS ) .
BTW , he ruins his career every time he opens his mouth with the hate - speech he preaches about the opposite party .
" And anyone that challenges their Superior Vision For America ( tm ) is a terrorist , coward , tax - raising , immoral , un -Christian , gay promoting , gun confiscating , fetus - murdering , un- patriotic ... LIBERAL . " -
Those names suck huh ?
How about yall stop using them on conservatives / republicans .
Good grief , either look both ways or dont step on the street , cuz ur gonna cause a pile up and ruin the day for everybody .
I can just see televised media under your fairness indoctrination : liberals vs anti-american left - wingers would be fair to ur type , yet youd flame Hannity for bringing a weakling like Alan Colmes to his station .
HAHAHA you ill - informed extremists are a damn joke , seriously ...

Yeh you stupid idits want fair doctors to be inoffice yer al nuts Posted by Dale on 2007-07- 02 16:33:03 quote - " Bob Novak can commit treason and out a CIA agent with no punishment "
No one was convicted of a violation of the Intelligence Indentities Protection Act .
The only conviction was of Scooter Libbey for obstruction .
How can that be ?
Simple , simpleton !
Plame was not a covert agent because she had not been deployed outside the US in the last five years and her identity as a CIA employee was not a secret .
No law broken by Novak , therefore no treason .
Sigh .
Posted by TheSimulacra on 2007-12-27 10:45:18 Right , Dale .
So why was there an investigation if no crime occurred ?
You'd think that would be the first thing they 'd check , n'est ce pas ?
I do n't know where you get this " five years " nonsense .
The last time I checked the CIA is the one that decides when an agent 's identity is safe to be revealed to the public , not the press , not the president 's chief advisor , not the President .
How in the hell would our intelligence system work if the media could just decide on their own when it 's right to release the identity of a CIA agent ?
Turn off your radio and think for yourself for once .

Posted by Steve K on 2008-07-31 12:07:58 Right .
You 're so full of sh*t and yourself you 've knocked your head against the trees in the forest you 're trying to find .
The fundamental root cause of today 's policital polarization and problems in the US is an uneducated voting public ( can you say public schools and teacher unions ? ) and personal laziness and greed fostered by a victim society and political pandering .
Whatever happened to principles such as self - reliance , individual liberty and economic freedom ?

So the evil corporations control the mass media ... and you want the government to control the mass media .
This is better ... how ?
You know , I consider myself to be fairly progressive but I 'm always amazed at how completely daft most liberals are when it comes to the free market .
Here 's a ' primer ' , if you will ...
1. Mass media survives on a diet of advertising revenue - period .
2. Advertising is only effective when media consumers ( i.e. you and me ) listen to it or view it .
3 . Advertisers will only spend money with stations / shows that attract media consumers .
So the inescapable conclusion is that government must control the media .
Oh wait ... or maybe the conclusion is that progressives / liberals need to hone a more populist message instead of continually sending the lunatic fringe out to engage the masses .
Thereby attracting more media consumers , attracting more advertising revenue from those nasty evil corporations and - oh my gosh , an epiphany - MORE AIRTIME FOR PROGRESSIVE IDEALS !!!
Wow - it 's so crazy it just might work .
But alas , I fear most liberals will agree with you and insist that government is precisely the entity that should ensure our freedom of media choice through legislation .
I mean , since the government has such an upstanding record of safeguarding our freedoms - especially over the past 8 years - who could posibily argue against more government control of our media .
Have you lost your mind !
The option is simple - progressives and liberals need to engage the masses where they are NOW with a message they can buy into NOW instead of insisting that everyone hate Wal - Mart , quit driving , shop only at Whole Foods , agree to more taxes and love the nanny state .
Obama is proving to be one progressive that actually gets this and that 's why the masses love him so .
why not fairness doctrine applied to liberals
Posted by mr. bill on 2008 - 11-20 17:24:21 why is only the right afraid of the Fairness Doctrine ?
with the main stream media so biased to the left , i think the Fairness Doctrine would be bad for us , since the main stream media is so obviously liberal ( as are the main news papers , like the NY Times , Wash Post , LA Times , etc. ABC , NBC and CBS as well as CNN and obviously MSNBC ) - all these media allys of ours are now liberally biased ; but with the Fairness Doctrine it would force us to have a Sean Hannity following Ken Oderman , etc !

Posted by Anonymous on 2009 - 12-18 01:43:52 this is basic freedom , right or left the governemnt shouldnt be able to tell me that i have to broadcast something i dont want to .
I mean while were at it why dont we just make a law that says broadcasters that have a comedic talk show must also have a show talking about why theyre not funny .
Its ridiculous , you guys need to get a grip on the idea of freedom and stop trying to rely on government interference to help your agenda Understand what the Fairness Doctrine is about
Posted by Pile on 2009 - 12-18 03:34:10
It 's not about the government telling people what they have to broadcast .
It 's about the government insuring people have a say in what gets broadcast .
If you do n't understand that distinction , get a little better educated before you start criticizing things and making ignorant claims about what the Fairness Doctrine does .
the opposition can only make strawman arguments
Posted by Pile on 2009-12-18 03:40:08
Notice how everyone who is opposed to the Fairness Doctrine uses the " liberal " strawman argument to dismiss the issue ?
The Fairness Doctrine has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with any particular party .
The reason the right dismiss it , is because they are brainwashed by their pundits who are pandering to the big corporations .
The big corporations are what controls the media , not " liberals " or " conservatives " and the one thing the Fairness Doctrine protects the people from , is not liberals or conservatives , but powerful corporations from taking over the media and only showing the sides of the stories that benefit their economic bottom line .
So , wait , there 's lead in the city drinking water ?
Well , maybe they wo n't report it much in the media because some corporate advertiser might be partially responsible .
Let 's just make that go away .
How is that a " liberal " issue ?
You guys need to f*cking figure this stuff out and think for yourselves .
Haha
Posted by Anonymous on 2009-12-18 09:57:55
The think for yourself stuff is classic , I love how you left wingers think anyone with an opposing view is either an idiot or ill informed and thus brainwashed because they havent heard the " truth " .
and your argument is ?
Posted by Pile on 2009- 12-18 12:41:15
I wrote that article .
I made a well thought out and well - referenced argument .
All you can do is go , " Durr ... you lib 'rals ... "
And you wonder why someone might think you 're an idiot ?
What are the right - wing counter arguments ?
That the Fairness Doctrine infringes on Free Speech ?
That 's ridiculous and ignorant and downright wrong .
The Fairness Doctrine does not in any way censor broadcasters .
So anyone who uses that argument is either ignorant of the facts , or trying to spread misinformation and intentionally mislead people .
I was being nice by suggesting the poster was merely " uneducated . "
And your argument is ... or Ha Ha to Haha

I also wonder why Carl Rove ( Bush 's Brain ) and Newt Gingrich ( Disgraced Speaker ) are regarded as credible representatives of the Republican Party ?
We sure did n't trust them when they were operating in the Bush Administration .

Posted by not much of a speller on 2011- 03 - 12 12:40:24 post wwII , post nazi war crime trials , our leaders looked back to see how hitler was able to convince most of his fellow countrymen that that the elimination of a certian race of people was not only noble but also nessesary .
i believe they must have seen hitlers propaganda machine as playing a major role .
his control over the air ways , the news papers and the elimination of diferent point of veiw was crucial
i believe our leaders saw a one sided media as a danger to the well being of our counrty .
i believe thats one of the reasons the fairness doctrine was born .
Still waiting for someone to do the right thing !

Well it seems little has changed in the years since this was first written !
Some of the names have changed , but not much else .
The sad part of all this is that in 12 short days the orange faced , severely combed over , admitted sexual predator , Narcissistic personality disordered , snake oil selling , reality television personality , ( who wouldnt recognize true reality if it bit one of his tiny little fingers ) thin skinned con man and charlatan of the century , Donald J. Drumpf , will be sworn into office as the 45th POTUS .
I just threw up in my mouth a little .
The country has continued down the ever increasingly partisan and divisive road Reagan and his FCC appointees put us on in 1987 .
IMHO the election of Cheeto pussygrabber , was made possible BECAUSE of the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine .
Wonder how long after his thin skinned , media hating self is in office , that hell follow in his political idol , Vladimir Putins foot steps and begin censoring the media ?

Yes , the more things change , the more they stay the same .
I think what we need to do is outline where the real enemy is .
It 's not republicans .
It 's corporations .
They 're taking everything over .
It 's true certain political parties are more beholden to them than others , but everybody loses in the end and we need to team up to fight them .

Edward Mandell House
In 1913 , Colonel Edward Mandell House helped to pick the charter members of the original Federal Reserve Board .
Edward Mandell House ( originally “ Huis ” which became “ House ” ) was born July 26 , 1858 in Houston , Texas .
He became active in Texas politics and served as an advisor to President Woodrow Wilson , particularly in the area of foreign affairs .
House functioned as Wilson 's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace ( 1917 - 1919 ) , and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference .
He died on March 28 , 1938 in New York City .
Edward and his father had friends in the Ku Klux Klan .
The Klan dispensed vigilante justice after the Civil War .
In 1880 a new legitimate group was in charge of dispensing justice in Texas -- the Texas Rangers .
Many of the Texas Rangers were members of the Klan .
Edward was the new master .
Edward gained their loyalty by stroking their egos .
Edward would use his money and influence to try and make them famous .
Edward eventually inherited the Texas Ku Klux Klan .
Edward Mandell
House helped to make four men governor of Texas : James S. Hogg ( 1892 ) , Charles A. Culberson ( 1894 ) , Joseph D. Sayers ( 1898 ) , and S. W.T. Lanham ( 1902 ) .
After the election House acted as unofficial advisor to each governor .
Hogg gave House the title " Colonel " by promoting House to his staff .
Edward wanted to control more than Texas , Edward wanted to control the country .
Edward would do so by becoming a king maker instead of a king .
Edward knew that if he could control two or three men in the Senate , two or three men in the House ; and the President , he could control the country .
Edward would influence the candidate from behind the scenes .
The people would perceive one man was representing them , when in reality ; an entirely different man was in control .
House did n't need to influence millions of people ; he need only influence a handful of men .
Edward would help establish a secret society in America that would operate in the same fashion -- the Council on Foreign Relations .
Edward Mandell House was instrumental in getting Woodrow Wilson elected as President .
Edward had the support of William Jennings Bryan and the financial backing of the House of Rockefeller 's National City Bank .
Edward became Wilson 's closest unofficial advisor .
Edward Mandell House and some of his schoolmates were also members of Cecil Rhodes Round Table group .
The Round Table Group , the back bone of the Secret Society , had four pet projects , a graduated income tax , a central bank , creation of a Central Intelligence Agency , and the League of Nations .
Between 1901 and 1913 the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller formed close alliances with the Dukes and the Mellons .
This group consolidated their power and came to dominate other Wall Street powers including : Carnegie , Whitney , Vanderbilt , Brown - Harriman , and Dillon - Reed .
The Round Table Group wanted to control the people by having the government tax people and deposit the peoples money in a central bank .
The Group would take control of the bank and therefore have control of the money .
The Group would take control of the State Department and formulate government policy , which would determine how the money was spent .
The Group would control the CIA which would gather information about people , and script and produce psycho-political operations focused at the people to influence them to act in accord with Round Table Group State Department policy decisions .
The Group would work to consolidate all the nations of the world into a single nation , with a single central bank under their control , and a single International Security System .
Some of the first legislation of the Wilson Administration was the institution of the graduated income tax ( 1913 ) and the creation of a central bank called the Federal Reserve .
An inheritance tax was also instituted .
These tax laws were used to rationalize the need for legislation that allowed the establishment of tax - exempt foundations .
The tax - exempt foundations became the link between the Groupmember 's private corporations and the University system .
The Group would control the Universities by controlling the sources of their funding .
The funding was money sheltered from taxes being channeled in ways which would help achieve Round Table Group aims .
Edward Mandell House had this to say in a private meeting with President Woodrow Wilson :
“ [ Very ] soon , every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging .
By such methodology , we can compel people to submit to our agenda , which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency .
Every American will be forced to register or suffer being unable to work and earn a living .
They will be our chattel , and we will hold the security interest over them forever , by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions .
Americans , by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent , forever to remain economic slaves through taxation , secured by their pledges .
They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser , for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and , if by accident one or two should figure it out , we have in our arsenal plausible deniability .
After all , this is the only logical way to fund government , by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges .
This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call “ Social Insurance . ”
Without realizing it , every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner , every American will unknowingly be our servant , however begrudgingly .
The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and , we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America . ”
Contrary to stereotype , most Internet sex offenders are not adults who target young children by posing as another youth , luring children to meetings , and then abducting or forcibly raping them , according to researchers who have studied the nature of Internet - initiated sex crimes .
Rather , most online sex offenders are adults who target teens and seduce victims into sexual relationships .
They take time to develop the trust and confidence of victims , so that the youth see these relationships as romances or sexual adventures .
The youth most vulnerable to online sex offenders have histories of sexual or physical abuse , family problems , and tendencies to take risks both on - and offline , the researchers say .
In short , the researchers draw a clearer picture about adults who troll the Internet for sex with minors in the study , “ Online ‘ Predators ’ and Their Victims : Myths , Realities and Implications for Prevention , ” published in the February / March issue of American Psychologist .
The journal is published by the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .
The study was based on three surveys — two comprising telephone interviews of a combined 3,000 Internet users between the ages of 10 and 17 ; first in 2000 and again in 2005 ; and one involving 612 interviews with federal , state and local law enforcement officials in the United States between October 2001 and July 2002 .
These studies were conducted by the authors , Janis Wolak , JD , David Finkelhor , PhD , Kimberly Mitchell , PhD and Michele Ybarra , PhD , at the Crimes against Children Research Center , University of New Hampshire .
“ To prevent these crimes , we need accurate information about their true dynamics , ” said Janis Wolak , lead author of the study .
“ The things that we hear and fear and the things that actually occur may not be the same .
The newness of the environment makes it hard to see where the danger is . ”
For example , in spite of public concern , the authors found that adolescents ’ use of popular social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook do not appear to increase their risk of being victimized by online predators .
Rather , it is risky online interactions such as talking online about sex to unknown people that increases vulnerability , according to the researchers .
“ Most Internet - initiated sex crimes involve adult men who are open about their interest in sex , ” Wolak said .
“ The offenders use instant messages , e-mail and chat rooms to meet and develop intimate relationships with their victims .
In most of the cases , the victims are aware that they are talking online with adults . ”
“ A majority of the offenders are charged with crimes such as statutory rape , that involve non-forcible sexual activity with adolescent victims who are too young to consent to sexual intercourse with adults , ” she added .
Current educational efforts that are focused on discouraging children from giving out or posting personal information , warning about deception online , and urging parents to monitor their children may not be effective , according to the authors .
Wolak and her colleagues say more effort should be directed at helping teens appreciate the drawbacks and inappropriateness of romantic relationships with adults .
These efforts should include frank discussions of the dynamics of Internet - initiated sex crimes .
Since many of the victims do not have good relationships with parents , ways to reach vulnerable teens directly , through sources they find credible , need to be found .
Among the study ’s other findings :
-- Internet offenders pretended to be teenagers in only 5 percent of the crimes studied by researchers .
-- Nearly 75 percent of victims who met offenders face - to - face did so more than once .
-- Online sex offenders are seldom violent , and cases involving stalking or abduction are very rare .
-- Youth who engaged in four or more risky online behaviors were much more likely to report receiving online sexual solicitations .
The online risky behaviors included maintaining buddy lists that included strangers , discussing sex online with people they did not know in person and being rude or nasty online .
-- Boys who are gay or are questioning their sexuality may be more susceptible to Internet - initiated sex crimes than other populations .
Researchers found boys were the victims in nearly one - quarter of criminal cases , and most cases included facts that suggested victims were gay or questioning their sexuality .

Those who were most gung - ho about the invasion and occupation of Iraq have been the least helpful in mopping up the mess there .
Those least enthusiastic have ended up bearing the greatest burden .
The United States and Britain have accepted only a handful of the 4.2 million displaced Iraqis .
Ditto Kuwait , which was the most bellicose of America 's pro-war Arab allies .
Ditto Saudi Arabia , that other staunch American ally .
It has shut its border with Iraq , and plans to fortify it with a $ 2 billion fence .
Stephen Harper , who as leader of the opposition agitated for Canada to join the war , has been silent as prime minister about admitting Iraqi refugees to Canada .
On the other hand , Syria and Jordan , which strongly opposed the war , have accepted 2 million Iraqi refugees , and done so gracefully .
Jordan ( population , 5.7 million ) has taken 800,000 .
That 's the equivalent of France welcoming 8 million Iraqi refugees , Germany 11 million and the U.S. 40 million .
Syria ( population , 18 million ) has taken 1.2 million Iraqis .
That 's like Canada taking 2.2 million refugees .
Jordan and Syria are feeling the strains on their infrastructure and social services , from water supplies to hospitals to schooling .
Syria is particularly hard - hit , since it has had little international help , principally because the U.S. and its allies consider it to be a " rogue nation . "
Sweden , which also opposed the war , has accepted tens of thousands of Iraqis , 20,000 this year alone , the most of any Western nation .
The humanitarian crisis in Iraq is the worst in the Middle East since 1948 .
Whereas there 's disagreement over the number of Iraqi dead since 2003 ( between 75,000 to 1.2 million ) , there 's broad agreement over the number of Iraqi displaced : more than 2 million abroad and more than 2 million internally .
The situation is only getting worse .
The American troop surge that George W. Bush credits for lowering violence in Baghdad has , in fact , led to " a surge in refugees and displaced people elsewhere , " says Alastair Campbell , Middle East director of the British defence think - tank , the Royal United Services Institute .
" When U.S. troops conduct operations in a certain area , the insurgents invariably move elsewhere and transfer their violence and intimidation further afield , " Campbell told me recently .
Shiites are still fleeing Sunni areas , and vice versa .
Sunnis and Shiites are also fleeing their own sectarian neighbourhoods to escape inter-Sunni and inter-Shiite militia and gang warfare .
Minorities are also vulnerable .
The well - to - do among the 500,000 - strong Christian community are being targeted for ransom .
Yazidis , followers of an ancient sect , suffered a gruesome massacre in August .
Small pockets of Roma and Turkmen are also being harassed .
In addition , about 50,000 non-Iraqis whom Saddam Hussein had granted asylum are being targeted ( as outlined in my Thursday column ) .
Many have taken refuge in camps along the borders with Syria and Jordan – camps that can become " fertile ground for recruiting sergeants from radical , extremist organizations , " warns Campbell .
In fact , given the widespread death , dislocation and despair , all of Iraq can be a haven for terrorist recruiters .
Yet Britain has admitted fewer than 500 Iraqis .
Washington promised to take 7,000 this year but in the 13 months since Oct. 1 last year ( when it began tracking Iraqi refugee admissions ) , it has admitted only 2,084 .
Canada has taken fewer than 3,000 since 2003 .
The U.S. and Britain , in particular , " should set an example and accept without hesitation those whose lives they have put directly at risk , " says Campbell .
The invasion and botched occupation of Iraq was criminal enough .
Not taking responsibility for its disastrous impact on a whole people is worse .
The former speaks to the arrogance bred by unbridled military power , the latter to the deeper disease of moral bankruptcy .

Sexual assault is the term that we are encountering more and more these days , as the controversy about the subject heats up , the phrase …
One of the most impressive members of the shark family is to be classified as endangered because of the increase in demand for shark - fin soup in the Far East .
The scalloped hammerhead was once considered immune to the effects of overfishing because it was so widely distributed , but recent surveys show it has suffered catastrophic declines – as much as 98 per cent in some regions .
Scientists will add it to the 2008 Red List of marine animals in danger of extinction , along with eight other species of shark that could soon be on the point of disappearing completely .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The other species being added to the list are the common and big-eyed thresher , the short - fin mako , the silky , the smooth hammerhead , the dusky , the tiger and the bull shark .
There are currently 126 shark species classified as being at risk of extinction – either critically endangered , endangered or vulnerable .
Dr Julia Baum , a shark expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , said that many predatory sharks are in serious danger of being wiped off the face of the earth within a generation .
She said : " The oceans are being emptied of sharks and if we carry on the way we are , we are looking at a really high risk of extinction for some species within the next few decades .
" Sharks are really at the top of the list of marine fish that could become extinct in our lifetime .
That should be a wake - up call . "
Scalloped hammerhead sharks are often caught accidently as " by - catch " with other large fish such as tuna .
But in the past few years they have also become victims of the lucrative trade in shark fins , which has grown rapidly as China has become more wealthy .
The trade often involves slicing off the fins from live sharks which are thrown back into the sea , where they bleed to death .
Measures designed to curb the trade are hopelessly inadequate , according to conservationists .
But what has surprised scientists is the speed at which scalloped hammerheads and other species of shark have fallen victim to the trade .
" The market is mainly in China but most of the information comes from Hong Kong because most shark fins go through there , " said Dr Baum , a member of the shark specialist group of the World Conservation Union .

" It is estimated that between 26 and 73 million sharks are going through the Hong Kong fin market each year .
That 's three to four times the total shark catches being reported to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation . "
Shark - fin soup was traditionally served as a wedding dish for the wealthy .
But an increasing number of middle - class Chinese are now serving it to wedding guests and important business partners , Dr Baum said yesterday , at the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" In addition , it 's starting to trickle down and become more common in restaurants , " she continued .
" It is still served as a sign of prestige but it is also becoming a lot more common , which is another nightmare . "
The rising level of demand for shark fins has led to a global growth in the trade .
There are no regulations to curb it and as a result , fishing fleets around the world are taking advantage of the high - value fins of hammerhead sharks , which can sell for up to £ 150 a kilo .
" More and more fleets are targeting sharks directly , " Dr Baum said .
" The perception has been that wide - ranging species cannot become endangered because although they may be threatened in one area , they 'll be found in another .
But fisheries are reaching all corners of the earth and they are intense enough that these species are being threatened everywhere .
" On the high seas and international waters , there are no regulations for sharks or any catch limits – it's a free - for - all .
" That the scalloped hammerhead is endangered is a big red flag .
It is one of the most highly valued shark species in the fin trade and there are no regulations for fishing it .
Where it is protected , in world heritage sites like the Galapagos , shark - finning is rampant .
They are protected on paper but nothing is being enforced . "
Dr Baum said that scientists would like to see a meaningful " ban " on shark finning , where the fins can only be taken from entire carcasses that are brought back to port .
This would mean an end to fins being stripped from live sharks .
If you were getting excited about having a company like 23 andme sequence your genome for you , it 's time to put a lid on it .
Apparently the State of California has decided that people should not be allowed to sequence their own genomes without supervision from a medical professional ( despite the fact that many medical professionals are not trained to understand genomic data ) .
The state sent out 13 cease - and - desist letters to companies offering genome sequencing to consumers last week .
New York has sent similar letters to companies , including 23 andme and Navigenics .
The idea that the state should regulate your access to your own genetic data is bizarre at best , and proto-authoritarian at worst .

Over at Wired , which has been doing a great job covering this controversy , Thomas Goetz explains that this is rather like the state government refusing to let people give themselves pregnancy tests :
We neither want nor assume that doctors should have a gatekeeper role in establishing whether we are or are not pregnant , nor do we look to the state to protect us from that information .
Pregnancy is a part of life , and it has all sorts of implications and ramifications .
So too with DNA . . .
The assumption that there must be a layer of " professional help " is exactly what the new age of medicine bodes — the automation of expertise , the liberation of knowledge and the democratization of the tools to interpret and put to use fundamental information about who we are as people .
Not as patients , but as individuals .
This is not a dark art , province of the select few , as many physicians would have it .
This is data .
This is who I am .
Frankly , it 's insulting and a curtailment of my rights to put a gatekeeper between me and my DNA .

And yesterday Aaron Rowe added fuel to the anti-gatekeeping side of this debate with his list of ten reasons why regulators should not hinder people 's ability to gain access to information about their own genetic code .
Most of his reasons boil down to " I like these companies and they seem like nice / well - informed people . "
That may be true , but as I 've pointed out before a lot of these companies may be run by shysters .
That does n't matter .
The fact is , this is consumer technology .
We do n't prevent people from buying computers even though they could lead to bewilderment and might be best set up with help from " professionals . "
Ultimately , as Rowe writes :

IT 'S not easy being green — nor is it cheap .
With the best will ( and some of the most generous handouts ) in the world , solar power still makes little sense for the average homeowner , even in sunny southern California .
Under pressure from his environmentally conscious ten - year - old daughter , your correspondent has spent the past week talking to experts around the state and running the numbers to see if he could reduce Mayhem Manor 's carbon footprint .
Solar power ought to be the answer .
The house faces south - east , lacks trees or other shadow - casting obstructions , and its flat roof offers ample space for a sizable solar array .
At 720 feet up the hillside , it is well above the “ marine layer ” ( the locals ' fancy name for morning fog ) and gets about 300 sunny days a year .
So what 's the problem ?
It 's not even as though the place gobbles electricity .
When the house was being rebuilt five years ago , the new roof came with over a foot of thermal insulation .
The floor - to - ceiling windows along two sides of the structure were replaced with double - glazed “ low - E ” glass ( the sort that blocks infra-red radiation ) , and thermal linings were included in all the exterior walls .
Even during the summer , the air conditioner usually stays off .
Admittedly , the architect went overboard on lighting .
Fully illuminated , the house demanded seven kilowatts of raw lighting - power before fluorescent lights replaced thirsty tungsten filaments .
Overall electricity consumption is now a reasonable 8,300 kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) a year .
AFP
But does it come in mauve ?
Given the local utility 's rate of 10.8 cents per kWh , that adds up to a modest $ 900 for the year — or just $ 2.50 a day .
At those prices , solar energy simply cannot compete with juice from the local power - station , even with California - level subsidies .
The problem is that solar - energy technology has been improving incrementally , but its costs have been falling slowly .
If solar cells had abided by Moore 's Law , they too would have halved in price every 18 months or so — and we would all be running our homes on sunshine .
But getting photons from sunlight to dislodge more and more electrons in semi-conducting materials like silicon , and so generate electricity , is harder than building a better microchip .
The first solar cells — built more than a century ago — had conversion efficiencies of around 1 % .
Since then , their efficiency has doubled once only every 30 years — a veritable snail 's pace compared with the speed of microchip development .
It was not until the 1950s , for instance , that America 's famed Bell Labs stumbled on a way of boosting a solar cell 's conversion efficiency by “ doping ” its silicon with certain impurities .
It then took another 50 years to raise the efficiency to nearly 20 % .
The performance of solar cells has picked up recently .
But that 's only for the most exotic cells used in space .
Today 's satellites have solar panels based on thin films of gallium arsenide that boast efficiencies of over 35 % .
Meanwhile , in the laboratory , exotic “ quantum wells ” promise photovoltaic conversion efficiencies of 45 % or more .
But the solar panels used in space cost millions to make and last for a decade at most .
Back on earth , the only ones affordable enough to be used commercially are early models based on crystalline and amorphous silicon with efficiencies of around 15 % .
And even these are n't exactly cheap .
Sanyo's 200 - watt module , one of the better panels used by the industry , offers 17 % efficiency and costs $ 1,500 retail .
As a rule of thumb , the industry reckons that a solar panel capable of generating one kilowatt of power at peak times will average roughly 20 % of that over the whole day .
In other words , every kilowatt of installed capacity should be good for 4.8 kWh of daily consumption — or around 1,750 kWh per year .
By that reckoning , Mayhem Manor would need 4.8 kilowatts of solar capacity to be able to generate the amount of electricity normally consumed from the grid .
Unfortunately , that ignores all the losses that occur between the sun 's rays striking the solar array and that direct current being converted into alternating current to run the house .
Such losses can easily mop up 25 % of the solar panel 's output .
So , better install at least 6.4 kilowatts worth of solar panels on the roof .
Here 's where going green gets tough .
At today 's prices , your correspondent would have to stump up $ 48,000 for the solar panels alone .
Add the cost of the switching modules , the power controller , the fault protector , the DC - to - AC inverter and the service panel — not to mention the installation charges and the contractor 's profit — and the final bill could easily come to $ 65,000 .
What about incentives and tax credits ?
That depends on where precisely you live and how effective an installation you have .
To get anything like a full grant in your correspondent 's neck of the woods , the array would have to be facing due south and tilted at an angle of 34 degrees to the sun .
The first might be possible ; the second would definitely not .
At best , Mayhem Manor would qualify for about $ 12,000 worth of local assistance plus a $ 2,000 federal grant .
Borrowing the balance at today 's interest rates would mean repayments of roughly $ 600 a month for ten years , even after setting the interest charges against tax .
And all that just to feel good about saving $ 75 of electricity a month .
Better to buy a couple of tons worth of carbon offsets each year for $ 70 and have done with it .

Update : Note that this is about the old implementation and no longer applies .
There ’s been a thread on Scala debate in the last day or two about breaking the current array implementation .
It ’s in most regards a very tedious thread , but one thing that ’s emerged in the course of the thread is that people do n’t really understand how Scala arrays work .
This is n’t surprising – they ’re a bit confusing .
It looks like they must be horribly inefficient , but actually they ’re only mildly inefficient and much of the time the compiler can remove even that and treat them as normal Java arrays .
This post is basically a “ What ’s going on here ? ” post .
I ’ll explain some of the basics of how Scala arrays work and what you can expect in terms of performance .
Warning : This post will contain JVM bytecode .
If that scares you … well , close your eyes while reading or something . :-)
There are essentially two distinct cases here .
The case where the arrays are polymorphic ( depend on a type parameter we do n’t know the class of .
e.g. an Array [ T ] ) and the case where they ’re monomorphic ( depend on a fully realised type parameter .
e.g. an Array [ Int ] or an Array [ String ] .
I ’m also going to count things like Array [ List [ T ] ] , where the class is known even though the actual type depends on a parameter .
This is technically wrong , but works for the purpose of this discussion ) .
The issue here is that Scala supports polymorphic arrays where the type parameter ranges across both object and value types .
This is interesting , because the JVM does n’t .
Consequently it comes with some overhead in the implementation .
Occasionally this is a significant performance hit .
Ok .
So , Scala is boxing arrays to make them appear polymorphic .
It must be generating horribly inefficient code to do so , right ?
Let ’s take a look to see what happens :
Consider the following method :
def foo = { val bar = new Array [ Int ] ( 3 ) ; bar(0 ) = 1 ; bar ; }
So , we ’re expecting something involving boxing ints to and from objects .
Let ’s use javap to look at the generated bytecode .
public int [ ] foo( ) ; Code : 0 : iconst_3 1 : newarray int 3 : astore_1 4 : aload_1 5 : iconst_0 6 : iconst_1 7 : iastore 8 : aload_1 9 : areturn
Oh , um .
So , not much boxing huh ?
If you ca n’t read bytecode , what this is doing is basically exactly what a Java compiler using the corresponding code for int [ ] would generate .
It ’s using the correct instructions for creating and storing things into a primitive int array .
Object arrays behave similarly :
def foo = { val bar = new Array [ String ] ( 3 ) ; bar ( 0 ) = " fish " ; } public java.lang .
String [ ] foo( ) ; Code : 0 : iconst_3 1 : anewarray # 14 ; //class java/lang / String 4 : astore_1 5 : aload_1 6 : iconst_0 7 : ldc # 16 ; //String fish 9 : aastore 10 : aload_1 11 : areturn
This correctly generates a String [ ] as you ’d expect .
When you have a primitive array , Scala generates pretty efficient bytecode for it – it just uses a native Java primitive array .
Similarly when you have an object array of a known class type .
Note that it ’s specifically the classtype that has to be known .
The actual type is of no importance .
Here ’s another example of it doing the right thing :
def foo [ T ] = { val bar = new Array [ List [ T ] ] ( 3 ) ; bar ( 0 ) = Nil ; bar } public scala .
List [ ] foo( ) ; Code : 0 : iconst_3 1 : anewarray # 14 ; // class scala / List 4 : astore_1 5 : aload_1 6 : iconst_0 7 : getstatic # 20 ; // Field scala / Nil$ .MODULE$:Lscala/Nil$ ; 10 : aastore 11 : aload_1 12 : areturn
Multidimensional arrays behave similarly :
def foo = { val bar = new Array [ Array [ Int ] ] ( 10 , 10 ) ; bar ( 0 ) ( 3 ) = 1 ; bar ; } public int [ ] [ ] foo( ) ; Code : 0 : ldc # 13 ; //int 10 2 : ldc # 13 ; //int 10 4 : multianewarray # 15 , 2 ; //class " [ [ I " 8 : astore_1 9 : aload_1 10 : iconst_0 11 : aaload 12 : iconst_3 13 : iconst_1 14 : iastore 15 : aload_1 16 : areturn
So far , nothing very interesting to see here .
It works exactly like you ’d expect it to .
Where the magic starts to happen is when you have an Array [ T ] .
So , what happens if we use one of these things polymorphically ?
def foo = { val baz = new Array [ Int ] ( 3 ) ; bar ( baz , 3 ) ; } def bar [ T ] ( ts : Array [ T ] , t : T ) = ts (0 ) = t ;
Clearly we need to do something .
In Java this would just work by using an Object [ ] under the scenes , but for Scala we ca n’t do that as we need to be able to pass it an array of primitives .
So what we do is we box the array .
We create a standard wrapper which can take both a primitive array and an object array and present an array like API for both .
This is in fact the thing you ’re seeing when you see the API for scala .
Array – all the methods like map , flatMap , projection , etc. belong to the BoxedArray wrapper class ( or one of its superclasses ) .
Let ’s see how this looks at the bytecode level :
public void bar( scala.runtime.BoxedArray , java.lang .Object ) ; Code : 0 : aload_1 1 : iconst_0 2 : aload_2 3 : invokevirtual # 18 ; // Method scala/runtime/BoxedArray.update:( ILjava/lang/Object ;) V 6 : return public void foo( ) ; Code : 0 : iconst_3 1 : newarray int 3 : astore_1 4 : aload_0 5 : new # 28 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedIntArray 8 : dup 9 : aload_1 10 : invokespecial # 31 ; //Method scala/runtime/BoxedIntArray . " " :( [ I ) V 13 : iconst_3 14 : invokestatic # 37 ; // Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:( I) Ljava/lang/Integer ; 17 : invokevirtual # 41 ; //Method bar :( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Object ;) V 20 : return
So , the method bar just generates the expected code using the BoxedArray class .
On calling this code , we first create an int [ ] as normal , we box it with a BoxedIntArray ( an implementation of BoxedArray for wrapping an int [ ] ) and call the method as expected .
There ’s a bit of boxing overhead , but it ’s not too bad .
The main point is that at the backend we are still using a primitive array for storage .
Ok .
This is all very well , but what happens if we need to create a polymorphic array ?
How can I do new Array [ T ] ( 3 ) if I do n’t know what T is so do n’t know whether it needs to be a primitive or an object array how can I create this ?
The key observation here is that as long as we are polymorphic in the array type we must box anyway .
So you never have to expose a native Java array until a point where you know what the actual type is .
Until that point we use a custom boxed array implementation called BoxedAnyArray .
What happens here is that it starts out using an Object [ ] until it knows what type it is .
At the point where we request it as a Java native array we now have a concrete array type we want it as .
Consequently we create an array of that type at that point , populate it from the Object [ ] and change the BoxedAnyArray in place to now be backed by that array instead of the Object [ ] it originally had .
The Object [ ] is now discarded .
Because the BoxedAnyArray ’s backing store is now the newly created ( possibly primitive ) array , any updates to and from the boxed version will now point to this new array .
Hence the native array and the boxed array will remain in synch , even though this is n’t the array it started out with .
Further , and this is important , after this point we have a native array in our hands and can treat it accordingly .
Anything that was using the BoxedAnyArray continues to do so , but there is no “ taint ” associated with our newly created array and in particular no additional overhead .
Unfortunately this trick does n’t come for free .
BoxedAnyArray is kindof a slow beast ( I think some of this can be fixed with an additional level of indirection actually , but it currently is n’t ) .
It does a lot of checking in the apply and update methods and , additionally , they ’re synchronized .
While you continue to use BoxedAnyArray your performance will suffer much more than the other BoxedArray implementations .
Let ’s read some more bytecode :
def newarray [ T ] = new Array [ T ] ( 3 ) ; def foo = { val x = newarray [ Int ] x ( 0 ) = 3 ; x } public scala.runtime.BoxedArray newarray ( ) ; Code : 0 : new # 14 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedAnyArray 3 : dup 4 : iconst_3 5 : invokespecial # 17 ; //Method scala/runtime/BoxedAnyArray . " " : ( I ) V 8 : areturn public int [ ] foo ( ) ; Code : 0 : getstatic # 25 ; // Field scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ .MODULE$:Lscala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ ; 3 : aload_0 4 : invokevirtual # 29 ; // Method newarray :() Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray ; 7 : getstatic # 35 ; // Field java / lang / Integer .
TYPE : Ljava/lang / Class ; 10 : invokevirtual # 39 ; // Method scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$.arrayValue:( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Class;)
Ljava/lang/Object ; 13 : astore_2 14 : aload_2 15 : instanceof # 41 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedArray 18 : ifeq 37 21 : getstatic # 25 ; // Field scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ .MODULE$:Lscala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ ; 24 : aload_2 25 : checkcast # 41 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedArray 28 : getstatic # 35 ; // Field java / lang / Integer .
TYPE : Ljava/lang / Class ; 31 : invokevirtual # 39 ; // Method scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$.arrayValue:( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Class;)
Ljava/lang/Object ; 34 : goto 38 37 : aload_2 38 : checkcast # 43 ; //class " [ I " 41 : astore_1 42 : aload_1 43 : iconst_0 44 : iconst_3 45 : iastore 46 : aload_1 47 : areturn
It ’s generating slightly redundant bytecode here , in that it ’s testing to see if the local variable is a BoxedArray or an int [ ] before unboxing it despite the fact that it ’s always a BoxedArray , but that ’s not a big deal .
The key point here is that we had a BoxedAnyArray and we end up with an int [ ] .
Here ’s an example combining the two instances of polymorphism we ’ve seen so far :
def foo = { val x = newarray [ Int ] bar(x , 3 ) ; } public void foo ( ) ; Code : 0 : getstatic # 39 ; // Field scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ .MODULE$:Lscala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ ; 3 : aload_0 4 : invokevirtual # 43 ; // Method newarray :() Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray ; 7 : getstatic # 49 ; // Field java / lang / Integer .
TYPE : Ljava/lang / Class ; 10 : invokevirtual # 53 ; // Method scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$.arrayValue:( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Class;)
Ljava/lang/Object ; 13 : astore_2 14 : aload_2 15 : instanceof # 21 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedArray 18 : ifeq 37 21 : getstatic # 39 ; // Field scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ .MODULE$:Lscala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$ ; 24 : aload_2 25 : checkcast # 21 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedArray 28 : getstatic # 49 ; // Field java / lang / Integer .
TYPE : Ljava/lang / Class ; 31 : invokevirtual # 53 ; // Method scala/runtime/ScalaRunTime$.arrayValue:( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Class;)
Ljava/lang / Object ; 34 : goto 38 37 : aload_2 38 : checkcast # 55 ; //class " [ I " 41 : astore_1 42 : aload_0 43 : new # 57 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedIntArray 46 : dup 47 : aload_1 48 : invokespecial # 60 ; //Method scala/runtime/BoxedIntArray . " " :( [ I ) V 51 : iconst_3 52 : invokestatic # 66 ; // Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:( I) Ljava/lang/Integer ; 55 : invokevirtual # 68 ; // Method bar :( Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray;Ljava/lang/Object ;) V 58 : return
Note how the BoxedAnyArray gets unboxed and reboxed into a BoxedIntArray before being passed anywhere .
This is a good thing – BoxedIntArray is a much lighter weight thing .
Summary :
When used monomorphically , Scala arrays are Java arrays .
When used polymorphically , Scala arrays are scala.runtime .
BoxedArray instances .
There is a separate subclass of BoxedArray for each primitive type and one for object .
When a monomorphic method receives a BoxedArray it will usually unbox it rather than call its apply and update methods .
There is also BoxedAnyArray .
This has a fairly high overhead and is used * only * for creating polymorphic arrays .
The compiler will get rid of it at the earliest possible opportunity and rebox as other forms .
So , what does this mean in terms of performance ?
Firstly , if you use arrays monomorphically , they will be Java arrays and have no additional overhead associated with them ( you ’ll need to box them for invoking methods on Array like map , projection , etc , but this is n’t too bad ) .
So if you want really high performance code , only use monomorphic arrays .
At the next level , you can still get reasonably high performance code if you use polymorphic arrays but only create them monomorphically .
You ’ll get a boxing overhead for primitives , but that ’s true of any polymorphic code in Scala .
Slowest of all is when you create an array polymorphically and continue to use it polymorphically .
Once you ’re in monomorphic code it will regain normal performance characteristics and future uses of it will behave as if it had been instantiated monomorphically ( but previously stored references to it will continue to pass through a BoxedAnyArray and have the associated overhead ) .
One final point of warning .
Consider the following code :
class Foo[T ] { private [ this ] val arr = new Array [ T ] ( 2 ) ; def apply ( i : Int ) = arr ( i ) ; def update ( i : Int , t : T ) = arr ( i ) = t ; }
Note that the Array never escapes this .
So there ’s no way to unbox it !
Looking at the bytecode confirms :
public class arrays .
Foo extends java.lang .Object implements scala.ScalaObject{ public arrays .
Foo( ) ; Code : 0 : aload_0 1 : invokespecial # 12 ; //Method java/lang /Object . " " :( ) V 4 : aload_0 5 : new # 14 ; //class scala/runtime/BoxedAnyArray 8 : dup 9 : iconst_2 10 : invokespecial # 17 ; //Method scala/runtime/BoxedAnyArray . " " :( I ) V 13 : putfield # 21 ; // Field arr : Lscala/runtime / BoxedArray ; 16 : return public void update ( int , java.lang .
Object ) ; Code : 0 : aload_0 1 : getfield # 21 ; // Field arr : Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray ; 4 : iload_1 5 : aload_2 6 : invokevirtual # 27 ; // Method scala/runtime/BoxedArray.update:( ILjava/lang/Object ;) V 9 : return public java.lang .
Object apply ( int ) ; Code : 0 : aload_0 1 : getfield # 21 ; // Field arr : Lscala/runtime/BoxedArray ; 4 : iload_1 5 : invokevirtual # 38 ; // Method scala/runtime/BoxedArray.apply:( I) Ljava/lang / Object ; 8 : areturn }
The array never gets unboxed and consequently continues to use the higher overhead BoxedAnyArray forever .
If you instead use an Array [ AnyRef ] here and cast your code will run noticably faster ( which was the observation which sparked this whole discussion )

My GMail password was stolen earlier today .
Spent a bit of time trying to discern what happened , very little evidence .
A couple of key points to note though about it which point me into a likely direction ( and one program I wo n't ever be using again ) .
Any " risky " software I 've run lately ( very little ) I submitted executables to some online virus - scanners that check for virii / trojans using 30 or more different security programs and any suspects I could come up with came up clean .
Here 's the evidence :
1 ) My ICQ account got bumped first .
I relogged , and a few minutes later got told I was logged in from another location .
I ignored this * because * ICQ is now merged with AOL , and AIM has always had " ghost " problems if you change IPs , where it thinks your old IP is still logged in and sends you errors that you 're logged into multiple locations .
Since ICQ=AOL on the backend now , I figured that was the issue , since I 'd been plugging / unplugging my modem just a few minutes earlier .
More on this .
2 ) About an hour later , I lost connection to my Google Talk connection .
I went to firefox and loaded the homepage , iGoogle was still loading , but when I tried to go to GMail , I got an invalid password error !
Ruh Roh !
3 ) I post the first message here , and i start changing passwords .
4 ) I got a call from a friend a few minutes later with the Russian extortion " money for gmail " bit .
5 ) I check the ICQ account .
Can no longer login at all - this password has now been changed .
So I know both were hacked on the same day , obviously the same exploit .
6 ) I visit my Yahoo account and change the password .
I do n't know if it had been accessed at that point .
I used the On - Screen Keyboard for the new password just in case there 's a keylogger on my PC .
7 ) I checked eBay and PayPal ..... still have access to these .
Okay .... if it was a trojan , I 'd figure they 'd grab these as fast as possible .
I change the passwords anyway .
8 ) Send info to Google .
I do n't remember who invited me , though , and that 's a key part of the info they want if they are to talk to you about recovering your account .
9 ) Begin to investigate further how this happened .
Several possible security holes :
First thought : Trojan .
I 've only run one suspicious file lately , a keygen .
Always risky , yes .
It got past Nod32 Virus checking , but I decided to run it past SpyBot and AdAware .
Clean .
So I submitted it to VirusTotal.com for scanning , reports as suspicious , but further investigation shows that what it finds is that the file is UPX packed - a very common method for making files smaller and in no way a security risk .
The file is clean .
Other open trojan / virus .
However , I 'm running a fully patched Vista with Defender and Nod32 AV .
Also the SpyBotscan is clear , and a McCaffee online scan is clean .
It is possible there 's a new one out , but I do n't see any evidence of one ( and I 'm good at this kind of thing ) .
I have a very good grip on processes that run on my system , and there were no unexpected processes running , not even under services ( you use Process Explorer to see this ) .
IE / Firefox Exploit .
Possible , but not likely .
I 'm running fully patched IE7 , and Firefox 2.0.0.12 .
The only known exploit in this version of Firefox is a directory traversal , which I have READ can only access things in other extensions .
My source could be wrong , and this is a big concern .
I < em > did </em > use IE7 for a few hours this morning just to see how it performs these days ( I was impressed ) , and installed an addon called IE7 Pro .
The addon comes highly rated by reputable sites , I 'd be surprised if it was a Russian Trojan .
I had to call RoadRunner tech support yesterday due to some cable modem problems .
As usual , they wo n't give tech support if you have a router attached , and they can see on the other end what the modem is hooked to .
So I had to connect my computer directly to the modem , no router .
Of course , that then meant NO FIREWALL .
And I forgot to plug my router back in for over 12 hours , thus the changing around of modem stuff this morning that threw me off on the ICQ account reconnects .
So any potential remote exploits were wide open to the world for 12 hours .
Is Vista so vulnerable it 'll be hacked in 12 hours or less without a hardware firewall ?
Maybe not - see the next bit .
I realized that not only was my GMail password stolen , but my ICQ password as well .
What did these two have in common that my eBay and PayPal accounts ( not stolen ) do n't ?
They are BOTH STORED IN PIDGIN for my IM LOGINS .
Pidgin is an open - source Instant Messaging client that is very popular on Linux .
There 's also a Mac version called Adium , and it has a decent following on Windows .
It stores passwords for your IM accounts , thus had my GMail password for the Google Talk account , and my ICQ password .
Especially interesting is that I never use my ICQ account - I set it up in Pidgin nearly a year ago and forgot about it .
I probably have n't entered that password on an actual webpage since the 1990s , since I have no reason to go to ICQ 's webpage .
So no ICQ password in IE or Firefox cookies .
It ONLY exists in Pidgin 's stored passwords .
This means < strong > the stolen passwords came from Pidgin < / strong > .
Now that could have been via a trojan that scraped the Pidgin INI file ...
But if a trojan is already on my system , why would n't it go for my Firefox or IE stored passwords , where it would find PayPal and eBay ?
And it could n't be a keylogger , since I have n't typed the ICQ password for nearly a year .
So that leaves a hole in Pidgin itself , or one of the plugins .
The only Pidgin plugins I have are the plugins recommended on Pidgin 's site sometime last year .
No they were n't updated - they have no autoupdate mechanism for plugins , and I rarely used them .
Pidgin itself was current until just today , I got an update notification while I was trying to figure this all out .
If one of Pidgin 's listening services ( it has several ) were vulnerable , then by having my router disconnected ( thanks RR TECH SUPPORT ! ) , it was left open to the outside world for 12 hours , during which time a scan would have found it , thus discovery of an exploitable system was possible .
At this point , I 'd lay 75 % odds that it was a hole in Pidgin .
Of course , knowing the open - source community the way I do , if it is an unreported vulnerability or one that 's considered low - key ( as in only pidgin data is vulnerable , not a full system exploit ... but enough to grab GMail and ICQ passwords ) , then chances are they will never admit the hole existed unless someone posts it .
Unlike MS if someone posts it , they would of course fix it .
Except I can't take the chance that my new accounts will be hacked too , so I reinstalled Windows .
I 'm not debugging their software for them , not when it is my private information at stake .
Chances are no victims of this are even aware of how the info got out .
The general assumption by the whole world is it is A ) Weak password , Fishing attempt , C ) Trojan .
If it was just my GMail , I 'd say it could 've been C , probably not A but minor possibility .
Definitely not B , I 'm way too careful .
But my ICQ too ?
That rules out A and B completely , as the odds of both my GMail and ICQ being brute forced on the same day are nill , and I have n't typed my ICQ password in over a year , so it could n't even have been accidentally fished .
And a Trojan - why go for the Pidgin config file ??
Most systems wo n't even be running Pidgin .
I could be wrong about the source of the leak ... which is why despite all the security software I could get my hands on telling me the system was clean I still wiped the drive .
The fact that I no longer have that particular gmail account does n't pain me much .
I have domains I use for most of my email now ( also just changed the password on those , domain theft is common but I do n't have any identifying info for them on my GMail ) .
Unfortunately , having emails all the way back to 2005 readable by an extortionist in Russia is n't quite a minor deal .
I believed the whole bit that it was safer on their server than my PC , so I had all my mails forwarded to Google since 2006 .
This means that any amount of potentially damaging info - such as all my serial numbers to Stardock products , and my Stardock password , are now in Russian hands .
Websites that send passwords via email ( bad bad practice ) are all compromised .
Lots of personal information is available .
I have local copies of all my GMail up through about two weeks ago , so I can sift through to see what 's out there , but it will take time to cover all bases and these guys know what they are looking for .
Other things could be compromised already , and I do n't even know it yet .
Fact is , I 'm rather fing peeved off about this .
I have a very good track record .
I know what 's safe amd what 's not .
I have n't been infected with a virus EVER except for one that clearly was a room - mate 's doing ( she was like " hey this ebook i got on emule on your pc wo n't open , I tried it five times " when it was a frickin EXE file ) .
I avoided viruses back in 1991 on the BBS systems when they were rampant , on IRC in the 90s , and I know every nook and cranny of the internet and Windows .
I do n't fall for things .
I run multiple security precautions .
I submit suspicious files to quite a bit of scrutiny before I run them .
I keep windows updated .
Yet one little hole is all it takes , and from what I 've read Google will do very little to help you in a situation like this .
Rant over .
( UPDATE )

I 've found an advisory that points out that Pidgin stores its password file IN PLAIN TEXT !
I 'm now 100 % certain the passwords were stolen from Pidgin , though the hole that allowed someone in could have been elsewhere .
Any hack / trojan that could get a file from my home directory would therefore have access to this file .
I cannot say for certain how the hacker got access to the file - it may or may not have been a remote hole in Pidgin as I initially suspected , but the fact that Pidgin stores its passwords in PLAIN TEXT and that one of the passwords stolen ( my ICQ account ) ONLY exists in Pidgin and nowhere else on my system ( for years ) , there is no other place it could have come from but the Accounts .
XML file .
Upon checking , yes , this is true .
Accounts.xml is the file and it has all plaintext passwords .
If you use Pidgin , you better hope your system is locked down , because you do n't even have the simplest of protection if someone can get the file .
Here is the argument the Pidgin Developers give for giving away your passwords :

Researchers at The University of Manchester have produced tiny liquid crystal devices with electrodes made from graphene -- an exciting development that could lead to computer and TV displays based on this technology .
Writing in the American Chemical Society 's journal Nano Letters , Dr Kostya Novoselov and colleagues from The School of Physics and Astronomy and The School of Computer Science , report on the use of graphene as a transparent conductive coating for electro - optical devices -- and show that its high transparency and low resistivity make it ideal for electrodes in liquid crystal devices .
Graphene was discovered at The University of Manchester back in 2004 , by Professor Andre Geim FRS and Royal Society Research Fellow Dr Kostya Novoselov .
This incredible one - atom - thick gauze of carbon atoms , which resembles chicken wire , has quickly become one of the hottest topics in physics and materials science .
" Graphene is only one atom thick , optically transparent , chemically inert , and an excellent conductor , " says Dr Novoselov , from the Manchester research team .
" These properties seem to make this material an excellent candidate for applications in various electro - optical devices that require conducting but transparent thin films .
We believe graphene should improve the durability and simplify the technology of potential electronic devices that interact with light . "
Prof Geim said : " Transparent conducting films are an essential part of many gadgets including common liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ) for computers , TVs and mobile phones .

" The underlying technology uses thin metal - oxide films based on indium .
But indium is becoming an increasingly expensive commodity and , moreover , its supply is expected to be exhausted within just 10 years .
" Forget about oil -- our civilisation will first run out of indium .
Scientists have an urgent task on their hands to find new types of conductive transparent films . "
The Manchester research team has now demonstrated highly transparent and highly conductive ultra - thin films that can be produced cheaply by ' dissolving ' chunks of graphite -- an abundant natural resource -- into graphene and then spraying the suspension onto a glass surface .
The resulting graphene - based films can be used in LCDs and , to prove the concept , the research team have demonstrated the first liquid crystal devices with graphene electrodes .
Dr Novoselov believes that there are only a few small , incremental steps remain for this technology to reach a mass production stage .
" Graphene - based LCD products could appear in shops as soon as in a few years " , he adds .
A research team from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany recently reported in Nano Letters how they had used graphene - based films to create transparent electrodes for solar cells .*
But the German team used a different technology for obtaining graphene films , which involved several extra steps .
The Manchester team says the films they have developed are much simpler to produce , and they can be used not only in LCDs but also in solar cells .

In recent weeks , pictures of people queuing restively beside piles of rice sacks have supplanted those of polar bears frolicking on icebergs as the iconic image of the global alarmists .
Having spent the last few years propounding the theme that agricultural commodities were headed for significant increases in price , it is at once deeply gratifying and yet curiously irritating to see an argument that was initially treated with a certain weary skepticism now becoming a conversational commonplace ( though not over the dinner table , one hopes ! ) and yet one which is greatly misapprised .
As is by now well known , the current crisis has arisen , in part , because of the strain imposed by a global population which is not only increasing numerically but which is one , more importantly , beginning to enjoy an even more rapid rise in wealth , an advance which has brought with it an associated enrichment of dietary expectations and tastes .
Alongside this , there has been an ongoing depletion of the stockpiles built up during the lean years of subsidized overproduction .
This has been accelerated by the signal shift to the subsidized overconsumption which the whole mummery of the biofuel movement represents — a folly akin to Joseph telling Pharaoh to set light to the surplus spilling out of his granaries , in order to economize on firewood .
However heart - rending the TV coverage , please do n't misunderstand the situation : there is no need to subscribe to the views espoused the grant - grubbing and headline - hungry hordes of green St. Johns who shriek that modern industrial society has imprecated a divine vengeance upon our heads .
This is the case whether their dire warnings take the form of pathological Carbophobia , " Peak Oil , " or any of the other millenarian cults of Famine , War , Pestilence , and Death currently so fashionable among the nomenklatura .
Like many commodity businesses , the simple truth is that global agriculture has suffered for years from chronic underinvestment ; a shortfall for which the politicians ' feather - bedding of relatively well - off Western farmers is greatly to blame ( not that such programs have been too effective in assisting its intended smallholder beneficiaries , rather than the giant agribusiness concerns , mind you ) .
With grants not grains the primary bounty of the harvest farmers , real food prices were driven down to levels not seen since Adam was expelled from the Garden of Eden .
As a consequence , this loot of consumers ' and taxpayers ' pocket books discouraged the formation and deployment of the capital needed to maximize productive efficiency all along the supply chain .
That this occurred well beyond the field boundaries can be surmised from a glance at the rocketing prices of agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and as the emergence of localized seed shortages will reveal .
Political short - termism , together with poorly defined or non-existent property rights , have led , in too many potentially fertile parts of the world , to a " tragedy of the commons , " often leading to maltreated topsoil , which have been stripped of nutrients and allowed to become dispersed in the dust storms or flash flood run-offs which typically ensue .
A little scrutiny will often reveal that , in many instances , the " desertification " which the Malthusians so frequently include in their litany of woe is little more than a characteristic failure of either collectivism or banditry .
Furthermore , Western " aid " — usually a naked ploy to buy the support of both foreign elites and domestic farm lobbies in the same cynical transaction — has stultified entrepreneurial efforts across the Third World , disincentivizing local development and demoralizing good husbandry in the recipient nations .
This has perpetuated a sorry dependence on the self - serving ranks of professional , Dior - clad Donorate and has made misery chronic among the poor , especially where those poor are unfortunate enough to come from the " wrong " party or tribe .
Water , we are frequently told by the viridian Ultras , is in " short supply " — and this on a planet that contains the greatest known concentration of the stuff in the universe !
The truth is that , for lack of capital investment , irrigation practices on the bulk of the world 's acreage remain woefully primitive and wasteful and thus susceptible of a vast improvement in their efficacy .
In addition , fertilizer and nutrient use is frequently far from optimal , meaning that chemical overkill can be as much of a problem as is a lack of effective treatment .
Finally , the witch - hunt against GMO organisms has become so febrile that starving Africans have even been denied emergency food deliveries by local overlords who are frightened of upsetting the prejudices of their Michelin - star , NGO , enviro - chic sponsors and thus of being cut off from other , more personally rewarding doles , if they demur .
While it is impossible not to sympathize with people complaining that their children 's bellies are empty , it would nonetheless be a failure of rationality not to point out that that none of the political " fixes " so far promulgated in this crisis will do anything other than exacerbate the problem .
Moves to raise minimum wages and welfare payments , or to subsidize prices only increase demand .
Capping prices and taxing or banning exports can only shift the burden to the very producers we need to earn the means to increase future output .
Concluding primitive bilateral accords means the benefits of comparative advantage are being sacrificed — and hence real income is being reduced — by both counterparties to the deal .
As in all crises of scarcity , the cry has gone up to " Hang the speculators ! " — figuratively , at least .
Such hackneyed demagoguery overlooks the fact that the bulk of the money pouring into agricultural commodities is coming from retail investors and from pension and insurance funds — i.e. the switch out of crumbling financial assets is being undertaken on behalf of the ordinary person , in the hope of warding off some of the worst effects of rising food prices on both his daily standard of living and the value of his savings .
It is also fine for well - nourished , tax - sheltered Über- eaucrats like World Bank President Zoellick and IMF Chief Strauss - Kahn to call for hundreds of millions of dollars to cobble together a " New Deal " on food , but it should not be overlooked that this call is effectively one that Western taxpayers should face even more pain in order to mitigate past mistakes committed by the very same governing class which is now sanctimoniously affecting to save the world .
Though he is already being belabored by the self - haters in the left - wing commentariat , the Western consumer did not choose to implement costly and economically ( energetically ? ) nonsensical biofuel policies ; he had such ill - thought out intervention foisted upon him .
It seems a little harsh , therefore , to castigate him for his selfishness , using the well - worn propaganda factoid that " an SUV tank full of biofuel requires enough grain to feed an African for a year , " when it was Leviathan who forced him to put the blasted hooch in his tank , in the first place !
Having had to pay once to support such programs — rather than sensibly directing his money towards ensuring a greater , longer term supply of hydrocarbons ( whether through action on the demand or the supply side ) ; having been hurt a second time by the soaring grocery bills and higher fuel prices which have resulted , that same Westerner is now facing the prospect of being bilked thrice over in order to have those food prices preferentially bid up against him by the aid lobbies , again using his own money !
Though some lip - service has been paid to the idea ( largely as a back - door means of criticizing the United States ) , no - one will seriously consider removing all artificial support payments for biofuel ; no - one will be amenable to the repeal of all the arbitrary percentage - use mandates which undergird this structure ; no - one will allow free trade in , e.g. , cost - effective Brazilian sugar - cane ethanol in order to alleviate the current painful scarcity of grains .
Make fuel from corn , by all means , if the free market signals that this the most pressing need and , hence , the most lucrative use for the crop .
Otherwise , let farmers plant for food and feed and let the fruits of their labors circulate unhindered around the world , absent tariffs , quotas or subsidy payments , so ensuring both their most equitable distribution and the least possibility of giving off false signals and creating perverse incentives to mislead either consumers or producers .
Then , hand back to taxpayers the money that has been spared so as to reinforce the increase in disposable incomes that will arise from lower food prices — and so reduce industrial strife and political tension at a stroke .
Encourage also , the kind of long - term , free investment in oil , gas , and nuclear power which Dr. Birol of the IEA so bemoans " the market " will not provide , but which is actually being hampered by the joint efforts of autarkic ( if not plain xenophobic ) governments and the hateful shrilling of the eco-eugenicists who positively ache for great swathes of that " pest species , " humanity , to perish and whose most fervent prayer is for " capitalism " to lead its plunge into the abyss .
Sadly , it is the world 's loss that nothing like this will ever be undertaken .
Instead , the policies actually being pursued can only enhance scarcity , while the inability to finance such mechanisms of self - defeat honestly can only lead to a further descent into inflation — an age - old curse poised to undermine prosperity further and to seed the commonwealth with the kind of venomous discontent which is the wellspring of an even more self - destructive politics of fear , anger and hatred .
Feed the world ? —
Then free the market !
Since I keep referencing it , but I have n't actually stated my position on it , I figured I should probably weigh in on yesterday 's controversial statement by President Bush at the Israeli Knesset :
Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along .
We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : " Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . "
We have an obligation to call this what it is – the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history .
Now , let me begin by pointing out that I myself have made the " appeasement " argument before .
Specifically , in response to posters that were plastered around USC 's campus in the immediate wake of 9/11 by anti-war activists ( against the Afghanistan war , mind you ) , which stated " WAR IS ALSO TERRORISM , " I made some rebuttal signs that stated , " APPEASEMENT IS ALSO SURRENDER . "
When I chose those words , I was responding to the then - common far - left credo that our reaction to 9/11 should involve withdrawing from the Middle East , closing our bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , etc. -- in other words , making specific , substantive concessions to Al Qaeda 's demands .
Similarly , in 2005 , I wrote on the blog that we should not withdraw from Iraq simply because the terrorists want us to :
The Islamist radicals do n’t just want us out of their backyards — they want to take over ours .
Just like we were foolish to ignore Hitler ’s long - term goals for “ Greater Germany ” and pretend that he would be satisfied with a few incremental concessions here and there , we are foolish to ignore the Islamists ’ long - term goal of a worldwide Islamic state .
Withdrawing from Iraq for fear of further attacks would not stop them — it would not even slow them down .
On the contrary , it would encourage them , because it would show them that they can convince us to change our policies by terrorizing us .
It would give them reason to hope that , with a few more attacks and a few more surrenders , maybe they really will be able to see the Islamic flag flying over the whole world .
We must not feed that fantasy .
That ’s not to say the Iraq war is necessarily justified — that ’s a separate debate , but the debate must be conducted on our terms , not theirs .
Whatever else might be said about Iraq , the terrorists ’ ire is NOT a valid reason to consider withdrawing .
Appeasement is not the answer .
Again , in raising the specter of " appeasement " and World War II , I was addressing a specific substantive concession that I believed we should not make , at least not for the reason stated .
Now , you can argue the merits of my point , but it is at least within the realm of rationality to claim that such an action would indeed be " appeasement . "
President Bush 's comment , by contrast , is not within the realm of rationality .
He is claiming that the mere act of sitting down and negotiating with an enemy is tantamount to " appeasement . "
That is absolutely absurd .
Bush needs to look up a dictionary definition of the damn word he 's talking about .
American Heritage defines " appeasement " as " the policy of granting concessions to potential enemies to maintain peace . "
Concessions .
Not negotiations .
In no version of reality is the mere act of negotiating " appeasement . "
Now , it 's perfectly fair to debate whether Obama 's stated willingness to meet with Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad without preconditions is a good idea .
I 'm not at all sure it is , and my uncertainty on that point is one reason ( among many ) that I 'm undecided between Obama and McCain .
The mere act of engaging in negotiations does have certain potential negative consequences , particularly when you 're the world 's unipolar power -- it tends to bestow a certain veneer of legitimacy to the other side , it can be a propaganda coup , etc .
These factors need to be considered , and weighed against the potential positive consequences .
That is an important debate to have .
But regardless of where you come down in that debate , calling the simple act of negotiating " appeasement " is clearly incorrect .
It 's not " appeasement " unless you concede something .
Period .
If you want to argue that merely negotiating with one 's enemies is itself inherently a " concession , " then what do you make of the many times throughout our history that U.S. presidents , Republican and Democrat alike , have met with our enemies , sometimes with great success ?
Remember " only Nixon can go to China " ?
How about Reagan 's meetings with Gorbachev , which helped end the Cold War ?
( Hat tip : David K. )
Were those revered Republican presidents " appeasing " China and Russia , merely by meeting with them ?
Or does the substance of the negotiations determine whether they engaged in " appeasement " ?
The answer is head - smackingly obvious , to the point that anyone who responds incorrectly is either an idiot or a liar .
It is substantive concessions that matter .
Thus , for instance , it is fair to argue -- not necessarily correct , but plausibly arguable -- that President Clinton " appeased " North Korea by essentially paying them off to halt ( or pretend to halt ) their nuclear ambitions .
It is not , however , fair to argue that a President Obama would inherently be " appeasing " them merely by re-opening direct talks .
You can't make any kind of judgment on the issue of " appeasement " without getting into the substance of the potential talks .
The last time I checked , neither Barack Obama nor any other major Democratic figure is promising any specific substantive concessions to Iran , nor to any other " terrorists [ or ] radicals . "
Bush himself actually acknowledged this point , unintentionally no doubt , when he mockingly described the Dems ' position as a belief that " some ingenious argument will persuade [ the terrorists and radicals ] they have been wrong all along . "
If that were really the Dems ' goal , as Bush asserts , then it would be foolish and naive , but it would not be " appeasement . "
Even if we credit Bush 's own straw - man version of the Democrats ' position , he 's still wrong .
Trying to convince someone they 're wrong is not the same thing as " appeasing " them !
Of course , in reality , the goals of diplomacy are varied and complex , and again , we can and should debate what those goals should be , whether direct negotiation is worth the costs , etc .
But dismissing the whole project as , by its very nature , " appeasement , " is simply a lie .
Nor is this just some minor semantic debate .
The word " appeasement " has a very specific and loaded historical meaning in geopolitical discourse , as Bush knows perfectly well .
He made this explicit with his reference to Hitler , but he did n't need to .
Everybody knows , when you 're talking about " appeasement , " that you 're referring to Neville Chamberlain and his decision to give Hitler the Sudetenland , in hopes of achieving " peace in our time . "
That foolish action was , of course , a textbook case of " granting concessions to potential enemies to maintain peace . "
That was appeasement .
But the mere fact that Chamberlain talked to Hitler was n't " appeasement " !
What made it " appeasement " is what he did at those talks : he made a concession that he should n't have made .
Bush has offered no evidence , nor even an argument , that the Democrats would follow the same course as Chamberlain in that regard .
He therefore has no business invoking Chamberlain and Hitler to make his point .
What 's really sad about this whole kerfuffle is that , as I said , there is actually a very serious and important issue that underlies all this bulls **t and malarkey .
But now that 's all become obscured by Bush 's despicable rhetoric and the Democrats ' justifiably angry rebuttals .
Basically , what 's now happening to our political discourse on the important issue of how we should approach diplomacy with our enemies is precisely what happens on the Internet whenever somebody breaks Godwin 's Law and inappropriately invokes Hitler .
Our president yesterday became a glorified message - board troll .
One other point : I do n't personally get too riled up about the whole " politics stops at the water 's edge " thing .
I 'm not saying it is n't a good principle , necessarily , but it 's just not something that personally makes my blood boil .
However , it is something that Republicans and conservatives tend to get very worked up over .
God forbid a liberal public figure should ever say anything critical of our foreign policy overseas !
Any time they do so , even arguably , the right wing predictably erupts in a paroxysm of rage .
For heaven 's sake , Natalie Manies of the Dixie Chicks was pilloried for the fact that she dared speak ill of President Bush in England , and she 's a freakin ' singer .
And I know there are examples of even more righteous outrage when it's an actual Democratic politician who does this , though I can't remember details off hand .
The point is , this is very much a sore spot on the Right .
So , against that backdrop , it is totally hypocritical for anyone who has ever invoked the " politics stops at the water 's edge " principle to in any way condone Bush 's remarks yesterday .
He went before the legislature of a foreign nation and , acting in his capacity as head of state , made a clearly political argument designed to attack the other party and its presumptive nominee .
( And do n't even start with the " he was n't referring to Obama " nonsense , or the " Obama doth protest too much " absurdity .
Just do n't .
That 's beyond Hillaryesque in its disregard for the truth .
Of course he was talking about Obama , you nitwits .
And acknowledging that obvious fact in no way acknowledges the truth of the criticism .
Go back to third grade art class and rejoin the discussion when you have something meaningful to contribute . )
As such , he has specifically validated the practice of taking our internal political debates overseas , in the most ostentatious way imaginable .
If you 're okay with that , fine .
But do n't you dare ever criticize any Democrat or liberal ever again for doing the same thing in reverse .
Olbermann jousts with Salon 's Greenwald on Obama FISA support Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 27 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama has upset key elements of his base with his indication that he will support what critics say is a deeply flawed surveillance bill that would undermine Americans ' constitutional rights .
The Democratic presidential candidates ' support for an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act has caused some contortions among progressive commentators seeking to justify Obama 's decision while a few others are willing to criticize the Illinois senator for making what they say is the wrong choice .
The two sides of this debate have come into sharp relief in the last few days in a tete - a- tete between Salon.com blogger Glenn Greenwald , a former constitutional lawyer and leading critic of the FISA deal , and MSNBC host Keith Olbermann .
It started Wednesday night , when Olbermann praised Obama for " refusing to cower even to the left " by supporting FISA .
Greenwald pointed out that just a few monhts ago , Olbermann had referred to a similar FISA deal going through the Senate as a " textbook example of fascism . "
The biggest difference between February and now was that then Olbermann could slam President Bush , one of his favorite targets for scorn , whereas now in the cross -hairs was Obama , who generally garners nothing but praise .
" Grave warning on Olbermann 's show that telecom amnesty and FISA revisions were hallmarks of Bush Fascism instantaneously transformed into a celebration that Obama , by supporting the same things , was leading a courageous , centrist crusade in defense of our Constitution , " Greenwald wrote .
" Is that really what anyone wants -- transferring blind devotion from George Bush to Barack Obama ? " he asked .
" Are we hoping for a Fox News for Obama , that glorifies everything he says and whitewashes everything he does ? "
Olbermann responded to the criticism in his own Daily Kos diary .
He said his praise for Obama relied on the analysis of the FISA bill from John Dean , a reformed Watergate figure turned Bush administration critic .
With that preamble out of the way , here goes .
John said his reading of the revised FISA statute suggested it was so poorly constructed ( or maybe so sublimely constructed ) that it clearly did not preclude future criminal prosecution of the telecoms - it only stopped civil suits .
I have repeated his observation each night since .
Maybe I did n't sell my conviction of its conclusiveness .
I think John Dean is worth 25 Glenn Greenwalds ( maybe 26 Keith Olbermanns ) .
Thus , as I phrased it on the air tonight , obviously Obama kicked the left in the teeth by supporting the bill .
But anybody who got as hot about this as I did would prefer to see a President Obama prosecuting the telecoms criminally , instead of seeing a Senator Obama engender more " soft on terror " crap by casting a token vote in favor of civil litigation that is n't going to pass since so many other Democrats caved anyway . [...]
Seriously , there is little in the polls to suggest McCain has anything to run with other than terror ....
So why hand them a brick to hit him with - Obama Voted Against FISA - if voting Aye enhances his chances of getting himself his own Attorney General to prosecute FISA ?
Greenwald responded in his own post Friday , first off clarifying that he does n't " consider Keith Olbermann to be The Enemy or , comparatively speaking , even a particularly bad influence to be targeted . "
That being said , Olbermann was still wrong on FISA and Obama , Greenwald wrote .
In his Daily Kos response , Olbermann -- just as he has done on his show repeatedly ever since Obama announced his support for the bill -- also suggested that Obama is harboring a Secret Benovelent Plan that he is n't telling anyone about whereby he is supporting the FISA bill so that he can prosecute the telecoms criminally once he 's in office . [...]
There are likely many reasons for confining immunity to civil liability -- including the heightened difficulty of proving criminal intent and , most importantly , the fact that Bush , on his way out , can pardon telecoms from criminal but not civil liability .
So it 's far from certain that Obama -- even if he did have a Secret Plan criminally to prosecute telecoms once in office -- would even be able to do so .
If Bush pardons everyone connected to his illegal spying program , as many have speculated he might , then Obama 's Secret Plan -- even if it existed -- would be instanteously extinguished .
That 's why these telecom lawsuits are the only real avenue left to ensure accountability and obtain a legal ruling on what was done .
Olbermann had not issued another rebuttal as of early Friday afternoon .
For the five Afghans who returned home on the same flight as al - Jazeera journalist Sami al - Haj and the other three prisoners described in my previous article , the future is disturbingly uncertain .
As I reported last December , when 13 of their compatriots were released from Guantánamo , they , like the other 19 Afghans released in August , September and November , were not freed outright , as was the case with the 152 other Afghans previously released , but were instead transferred to Block D , a wing of Pol - i - Charki , Kabul ’s main prison , which was recently refurbished by the U.S. authorities .
While some of these 32 men have subsequently been released from Pol - i - Charki , the whole story of U.S. involvement in the prison is deeply disturbing , as are reports that the " trials " of the men returned from Guantánamo are " closed - door " affairs , in which , as the Washington Post explained last month , " they are often denied access to defense attorneys , " and are , essentially , tried on the basis of " evidence " provided by the United States , which they are not allowed to see ; in other words , exactly the same situation that they faced in the Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantánamo ( the military reviews convened to assess the prisoners ’ status as " enemy combatants , " in which military officers took the place of lawyers , and secret evidence was withheld from the prisoners ) .
As Mohammed Afzal Mullahkeil , a lawyer for the returned Afghan prisoners explained , " When they were sent from Guantánamo , they were told ,  You are innocent and you will be free once you ’re in your country . ’
When they got to Bagram , they just brought them to Block D and said they should have a second trial . "
In common with previous Afghan releases , the identities of the five men have been difficult to establish .
The Pentagon never discloses the names of those it frees , and although lawyers representing the prisoners are informed of their clients ’ departure , the identities of those who did not have legal representation  either because they refused to do so , or had not found any way of establishing contact with the legal community  remain unknown unless the media are present on their arrival ( which has not happened in Afghanistan for many years ) , or until further investigation by lawyers or journalists turn up details of their identities .
Shortly after the men were released , the identities of only two of the five Afghans had been established , but over the weekend Sami al - Haj gave the names of the other three men , all of whom have now been positively identified .
As with those described above , their stories reveal , yet again , the wholesale mockery of justice that defines the regime at Guantánamo : outright failures of intelligence , the presumption of guilt , the refusal to seek out witnesses to back up the prisoners ’ stories , and a willingness to accept confessions from other prisoners as the truth , regardless of how it was obtained , and with no attempt made to investigate the veracity of the claims .
Haji Rohullah Wakil , a celebrated anti-Taliban commander
Of the two Afghans identified , by far the most significant is 46 - year - old Haji Rohullah Wakil ( also identified as Haji Roohullah ) , a tribal leader in Afghanistan ’s Kunar province , whose opposition to the Taliban was such that he fired the first salvo against the Taliban in Kunar after the U.S. - led invasion in October 2001 .
As a result of his anti-Taliban credentials and his support for Hamid Karzai , Wakil was rewarded with an important position in the province ’s post - Taliban administration , and was also made a member of the Loya Jirga , the prestigious gathering of tribal leaders that elected Karzai as President in June 2002 .
His influence was such that Ghulam Ullah , the head of education in Kunar , described him as " a national religious leader . "
Seized by U.S. forces in August 2002 , with his military commander Sabar Lal and eleven others , Wakil was taken to the U.S. prison in Bagram airbase for questioning .
Although the others were subsequently released , the Americans decided that both Wakil and Lal had sufficient intelligence value to be transferred to Guantánamo in August 2003 .
According to an Associated Press report , they believed that Wakil " had strong links with Middle Eastern fighters in Afghanistan , particularly Saudi Arabians like Osama bin Laden , " and thought it significant that he was a follower of the Wahhabi sect of Islam , even though both Wakil and Lal had had numerous meetings with senior American officials and had offered support for the campaign to oust al - Qaeda and the Taliban from the Tora Bora mountains in November and December 2001 .
The outline of Wakil ’s story has been reported before  both in my book The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison , and in an article I wrote last October , when his military commander , Sabar Lal , was released from Guantánamo  but it still appears to be a disturbing example of the incompetence of American military intelligence in Afghanistan , as the primary charge against Wakil  that he provided sanctuary to a number of significant al - Qaeda operatives who had fled from the city of Jalalabad after it fell to the Northern Alliance on November 12 , 2001  was so utterly at odds with his proven track record as an anti-Taliban tribal leader who was part of the Northern Alliance and supported Hamid Karzai .
While the full story of Haji Rohullah Wakil deserves more in - depth treatment than I can supply at present , there appear to be only two possible explanations for his capture : either that he did in fact aid the al - Qaeda members because he was working as a double agent , or that he was betrayed by a rival .
Personally , I find the second explanation rather less far - fetched , particularly as so many other Afghan prisoners in Guantánamo  at least two dozen , including Abdul Razzaq Hekmati , who died in Guantánamo in December without being given the opportunity to clear his name  were actively opposed to the Taliban , but were betrayed by rivals who had gained the trust of the Americans .
According to this second version of events , Wakil was probably betrayed by Malik Zarin , the head of the rival Mushwani tribe , who had ingratiated himself with the Americans and was using them for his own ends .
Although Wakil himself did not name names in Guantánamo , Sabar Lal , who was finally freed from Pol - i - Charki in February , to return to his wife and five children , had no doubt that he had been betrayed .
Speaking to the Washington Post last month , he made it clear that he " was turned over to US forces by Afghans seeking revenge for his arrest of Taliban fighters near the Pakistani border . "
At Guantánamo , Lal had been even more forthright , explaining to his tribunal the injustice of imprisoning him with members of the Taliban : " The only thing I want to tell you that is so ironic here is that I see a Talib and then I see myself here too , I am in the same spot as a Talib .
I see those people on an everyday basis , they are cursing at me …
They say ,  See , you got what you deserved , you are here , too . ’ "
Abdullah Mohammed Khan and his dubious friendship
The story of the second Afghan , Abdullah Mohammed Khan , a 36 - year old ethnic Uzbek , shifts the focus from Afghanistan to Pakistan , and appears to be another example of dubious intelligence on the part of the Pakistani and American authorities .
A former mujahid against the Russians , Khan , mentioned briefly in my book , but otherwise unknown , was arrested in Peshawar , in 2001 , at the house of a Syrian acquaintance called Musa , who , according to the U.S. authorities , was an al - Qaeda suspect identified as Abd al - Hamid al - Suri .
Khan denied knowing anything about any connection that Musa might have had with al - Qaeda , saying that all he knew was that he came to Pakistan from Turkey with his family for medical treatment on his feet , which were " in very bad condition . "
He also denied knowing anything about a CD containing explosives - making manuals that was apparently discovered in Musa ’s house .
Released after being questioned by a Pakistani and an American , he was arrested a second time in January 2002 , when traces of explosives were allegedly found on his fingers .
Again , he denied the allegation , saying , " I never touched any kind of explosives after the Russians [ left ] , " but this time he was seized and sent to Guantánamo , on what , it appears , was little more than a whim .
At his Administrative Review Board in Guantánamo ( the successors to the tribunals , convened to assess whether the prisoners were still a threat to the US , or had ongoing intelligence value ) , Khan ran up against a litany of allegations made by other prisoners , which are shockingly prevalent in the transcripts of the hearings , even though there is no indication of the circumstances under which the " confessions " were elicited , and , moreover , no attempt was made to verify whether or not they were true .
When faced with these allegations , Khan duly denied a claim that " an al - Qaeda detainee " had identified him in a photo as Abdul Latif al - Turki , explaining that this was the name of the person who had provided him with a false Turkish passport to enter Pakistan , and adding that he was always known by his real name , and that " if you really showed somebody my picture and they told you my name is Abdul … he was lying . "
He also denied a similar allegation from " A Libyan Islamic Fighting Group member , " who identified him as " al - Turki " and said that he saw him several times at the al - Ansar guest house in Pakistan , and an allegation from an Iraqi detainee who had apparently identified him in a photo and said that he had seen him at a guest house on the Taliban front lines in Kabul in 1999 or 2000 .
On this point , his response was particularly revealing , as any detailed research into Guantánamo reveals that several prisoners  an Iraqi and a Yemeni are regularly cited  have spread false allegations against other prisoners .
Most startlingly , this came to light in 2006 , when , in an article for the National Journal , Corine Hegland told the story of an unnamed but principled Personal Representative for a young Yemeni prisoner , Farouq Saif ( known to the Pentagon as Farouq Ali Ahmed ) , at his tribunal .
This officer  assigned to Saif in place of a lawyer , and under no obligation to make a stand on his behalf  was so shocked at the vehemence with which Saif denied an allegation that he had been seen at Osama bin Laden ’s personal airport that he went back to his file and discovered that the allegation had been made by another prisoner , who had been specifically identified by the FBI as a liar .
In another case reported by Hegland , another Personal Representative  or perhaps the same man ; the details are unclear  followed a trail established in the case of a young Syrian , Mohammed al - Tumani , who denied even being in Afghanistan when he was alleged to have been at a training camp .
On investigating the file of the prisoner who made the allegation , the officer discovered that he had actually made groundless accusations against 60 prisoners in total .
Despite this , both Farouq Saif and Mohammed al - Tumani remain in Guantánamo , and no one has ever established the identities of the other 58 or 59 men who were falsely accused .
Khan ’s version was as follows .
" About two years ago , " he said , " I was prepared to be released from here .
At that point I lived with some Iraqi people and because they disliked me they were lying , they were throwing some allegations on me and that ’s why my process has stopped and that ’s why I have not been released . "
Shorn of these additional allegations , the case against Khan was summarized by his Designated Military Officer ( the officer assigned to the prisoners instead of a lawyer in the ARBs ) , who stated , " Detainee argues that he is innocent of all the charges brought before him other than that he was associated with Musa , " to which Khan added , " That ’s correct .
Again , I had some association with Musa and also I had a bad passport , that ’s the only things that occurred . "
Tricked by the Taliban
The other three Afghans  identified by Sami al - Haj  were captured in what appears to have been a sly act of revenge by a former member of the Taliban against one of his former colleagues who had turned against the regime .
The story began when soldiers working for Jan Mohammed , the governor of Uruzgan province , north of Kandahar , stopped a car containing two men , Ismatullah , a 25 - year - old embroiderer , and Nasrullah , his 23 - year - old cousin , identified by Sami as Nasrullah al - Rosgani ( from Uruzgan ) , and Esmatullah , his cousin .
Ismatullah apparently admitted that he had just delivered a letter to a third man , Mohammed Sangaryar , which was from Abdul Razaq , the former Taliban Minister of Commerce .
Sami identified the third man as Mohalim al - Rosgani , which was initially rather confusing , but on Tuesday his lawyer confirmed that Mohalim al - Rosgani was indeed Sangaryar , and that he too had been released .
Ismatullah explained that he had been going to Uruzgan to sell his car , and added that Razaq had said that he would pay his petrol if he delivered the letter .
Unable to read , he said that he asked his 23 - year old cousin , Nasrullah , to read it , to check that there " was n’t any danger in it . "
Nasrullah said that the letter asked Sangaryar to go to Quetta , but did not mention fighting , even though the U.S. authorities alleged that Razaq had asked Sangaryar to report to Quetta " to fight and avoid capture by the Americans . "
According to Sangaryar , the letter was actually a trap , designed to punish him for turning his back on the Taliban and to discredit him by making it appear that he was still involved with them .
He explained that he was a former deputy commander of the Taliban , who had fought with them for many years in an attempt to bring peace to his country .
He added , however , that he and his tribe had turned against the Taliban before the U.S. - led invasion , because they had become too enamored of fighting for its own sake , and , specifically , because they had dug up the corpse of Asmat Khan , a prominent tribal leader , and had deposited it in the street as an affront to his tribe .
When the American - backed warlord Gul Agha Sherzai took over Kandahar , Sangaryar said that he and his men handed in all their weapons , and he then returned to his village to refurbish his home .
What ’s particularly bizarre about this story is the fact that Abdul Razaq ( aka Abdul Razak Iktiar Mohammed ) , the former Taliban Minister of Commerce , was himself seized and sent to Guantánamo , but was transferred to Pol - i - Charki last August , and fairly swiftly released .
Throughout these men’s imprisonment , there was no indication that any effort was made to cross-reference their stories , and this is , I believe , an appropriate note on which to end these two surveys of the latest prisoners released from Guantánamo , in which you ’ll have no doubt observed that not a single one of these prisoners was actually accused of raising arms against U.S. forces , let alone of having any involvement in the terrible events of September 11 , 2001 .
Propaganda has been with us for a long time but it was not until the two wars that it became such a useful tool in control of the opinions of the people .
This list shows ten of the best examples of propaganda available on the Internet including anti-porn , anti-homosexual , and anti-drugs .
10 Anti Pornography Propaganda
Produced by the Citizens for Decent Literature , this is an amusing propaganda film from 1965 entitled Perversion for Profit .
It is presented by George Putnam – “ Outstanding News Reporter ” .
It demonstrates certain photographs and points out that they appeal to “ the sodomists ” and others with “ overtones of bestiality ” .

9 Anti LSD Propaganda
Advertisement
This is another film from the 1960s but this one focuses on LSD .
The main character describes her first time using LSD and goes on to talk about eating a hotdog that has a face and screams when she tries to bite it .
She tried the drug because she was “ pretty jacked - up on marijuana ” .
This is very cool , man .
8 Anti Homosexual Propaganda
Boys Beware ! is the title of this 1959 anti homosexual propaganda film .
In the picture we see the cunning wiles of the homosexualist focusing on the case of little Jimmy Barnes who thumbs a ride and ends up in hot water after the “ nice man ” Ralph picks him up .
This film contains some great lines like “ all homosexuals are not passive ; some resort to violence ” .
After seeing this film you will think twice about hitching a ride !
7 Pro Tax Propaganda
From 1943 , this film uses Donald duck and his friends to explain why we must pay income tax to do our duty for the country .
This is the first example here of propaganda being aimed at children with more of an eye on the future .
Did it work do you think ?
One of the nice quotes from this film :
“ […] every American should pay his or her income tax , gladly and proudly ” .
6 Anti Piracy Propaganda
Now for a brief dip into some more recent propaganda .
We have all seen anti-piracy clips at the cinema and the begining of DVDs , but this video is a testament to how long the anti piracy brigade has been active .
This 1992 video features a rapper singing “ Do n’t copy the floppy ” .
This video was produced by the Software Publishers Association .
5 Anti American Propaganda
This is the most recent example of propaganda in the list .
It is a film by Barry McNamara ( who is apparently a political thinker ) , and it is speaking against US domination of the world .
The most interesting thing about this one is the style of animation – it could have been made by a propagandist from Soviet Russia .
It speaks of the neoconservative manifesto to bring about a New American Century .
4 Nazi Propaganda
The Nazis were famous for propaganda during the wartime .
This video shows Adolf Hitler speaking to the youth of Germany .
He asks them to embrace all things German so that in the future there will be no ranks or classes .
At one point he says “ We want this people to be peace loving ” – yeah right .
The crowd goes wild whenever Hitler stops talking .
3 Communist Propaganda
In this clip we see a very common theme in Communist propaganda – displays of power .
The Chinese still do it , the North Koreans do it , and the Soviets practically invented it .
This film is taken from Victory Day and shows a military parade in Moscow in 1945 .
The music in the background is a rather stirring rendition of the Soviet Union ’s National Anthem .
2 Anti Communist Propaganda
This is a 1952 American propaganda film by Coronet International Films .
It is amusing how it points out that you are paying the highest taxes in history because of Communism .
The film describes the origin of communism with Karl Marx .
It is interesting how the commentator also speaks out against the Tsar and even insinuates that the communists were right to up - rise against him .
1 Anti Nazi Propaganda
This is Another Disney produced cartoon propaganda film entitled Hitler ’s Children , Education for Death .
The film uses very typical propaganda images and sounds – the Nazi ’s tower over the people who behave as if they are terrified .
This one really just has to be seen to be believed .
Part Four : Catallactics or Economics of the ... > Chapter XV .
The Market
The direction of all economic affairs is in the market society a task of the entrepreneurs .
Theirs is the control of production .
They are at the helm and steer the ship .
A superficial observer would believe that they are supreme .
But they are not .
They are bound to obey unconditionally the captain 's orders .
The captain is the consumer . [ p. 270 ]
Neither the entrepreneurs nor the farmers nor the capitalists determine what has to be produced .
The consumers do that .
If a businessman does not strictly obey the orders of the public as they are conveyed to him by the structure of market prices , he suffers losses , he goes bankrupt , and is thus removed from his eminent position at the helm .
Other men who did better in satisfying the demand of the consumers replace him .
The consumers patronize those shops in which they can buy what they want at the cheapest price .
Their buying and their abstention from buying decides who should own and run the plants and the farms .
They make poor people rich and rich people poor .
They determine precisely what should be produced , in what quality , and in what quantities .
They are merciless bosses , full of whims and fancies , changeable and unpredictable .
For them nothing counts other than their own satisfaction .
They do not care a whit for past merit and vested interests .
If something is offered to them that they like better or that is cheaper , they desert their old purveyors .
In their capacity as buyers and consumers they are hard - hearted and callous , without consideration for other people .
Only the sellers of goods and services of the first order are in direct contact with the consumers and directly depend on their orders .
But they transmit the orders received from the public to all those producing goods and services of the higher orders .
For the manufacturers of consumers ' goods , the retailers , the service trades , and the professions are forced to acquire what they need for the conduct of their own business from those purveyors who offer them at the cheapest price .
If they were not intent upon buying in the cheapest market and arranging their processing of the factors of production so as to fill the demands of the consumers in the best and cheapest way , they would be forced to go out of business .
More efficient men who succeeded better in buying and processing the factors of production would supplant them .
The consumer is in a position to give free rein to his caprices and fancies .
The entrepreneurs , capitalists , and farmers have their hands tied ; they are bound to comply in their operations with the orders of the buying public .
Every deviation from the lines prescribed by the demand of the consumers debits their account .
The slightest deviation , whether willfully brought about or caused by error , bad judgment , or inefficiency , restricts their profits or makes them disappear .
A more serious deviation results in losses and thus impairs or entirely absorbs their wealth .
Capitalists , entrepreneurs , and landowners can only preserve and increase their wealth by filling best the orders of the consumers .
They are not free to spend money [ p. 271 ] which the consumers are not prepared to refund to them in paying more for the products .
In the conduct of their business affairs they must be unfeeling and stony - hearted because the consumers , their bosses , are themselves unfeeling and stony - hearted .
The consumers determine ultimately not only the prices of the consumers ' goods , but no less the prices of all factors of production .
They determine the income of every member of the market economy .
The consumers , not the entrepreneurs , pay ultimately the wages earned by every worker , the glamorous movie star as well as the charwoman .
With every penny spent the consumers determine the direction of all production processes and the details of the organization of all business activities .
This state of affairs has been described by calling the market a democracy in which every penny gives a right to cast a ballot .
It would be more correct to say that a democratic constitution is a scheme to assign to the citizens in the conduct of government the same supremacy the market economy gives them in their capacity as consumers .
However , the comparison is imperfect .
In the political democracy only the votes cast for the majority candidate or the majority plan are effective in shaping the course of affairs .
The votes polled by the minority do not directly influence policies .
But on the market no vote is cast in vain .
Every penny spent has the power to work upon the production processes .
The publishers cater not only to the majority by publishing detective stories , but also to the minority reading lyrical poetry and philosophical tracts .
The bakeries bake bread not only for healthy people , but also for the sick on special diets .
The decision of a consumer is carried into effect with the full momentum he gives it through his readiness to spend a definite amount of money .
It is true , in the market the various consumers have not the same voting right .
The rich cast more votes than the poorer citizens .
But this inequality is itself the outcome of a previous voting process .
To be rich , in a pure market economy , is the outcome of success in filling best the demands of the consumers .
A wealthy man can preserve his wealth only by continuing to serve the consumers in the most efficient way .
Thus the owners of the material factors of production and the entrepreneurs are virtually mandataries or trustees of the consumers , revocably appointed by an election daily repeated .
There is in the operation of a market economy only one instance in which the proprietary class is not completely subject to the supremacy [ p. 272 ] of the consumers .
Monopoly prices are an infringement of the sway of the consumers .
The Metaphorical Employment of the Terminology of Political Rule
The orders given by businessmen in the conduct of their affairs can be heard and seen .
Nobody can fail to become aware of them .
Even messenger boys know that the boss runs things around the shop .
But it requires a little more brains to notice the entrepreneur 's dependence on the market .
The orders given by the consumers are not tangible , they can not be perceived by the senses .
Many people lack the discernment to take cognizance of them .
They fall victim to the delusion that entrepreneurs and capitalists are irresponsible autocrats whom nobody calls to account for their actions .
The outgrowth of this mentality is the practice of applying to business the terminology of political rule and military action .
Successful businessmen are called kings or dukes , their enterprise an empire , a kingdom , or a dukedom .
It this idiom were only a harmless metaphor , there would be no need to criticize it .
But it is the source of serious errors which play a sinister role in contemporary doctrines .
Government is an apparatus of compulsion and coercion .
It has the power to obtain obedience by force .
The political sovereign , be it an autocrat or the people as represented by its mandataries , has power to crush rebellions as long as his ideological might subsists .
The position which entrepreneurs and capitalists occupy in the market economy is of a different character .
A " chocolate king " has no power over the consumers , his patrons .
He provides them with chocolate of the best possible quality and at the cheapest price .
He does not rule the consumers , he serves them .
The consumers are not tied to him .
They are free to stop patronizing his shops .
He loses his " kingdom " if the consumers prefer to spend their pennies elsewhere .
Nor does he " rule " his workers .
He hires their services by paying them precisely that amount which the consumers are ready to restore to him in buying the product .
Still less do the capitalists and entrepreneurs exercise political control .
The civilized nations of Europe and America were long controlled by governments which did not considerably hinder the operation of the market economy .
Today these countries too are dominated by parties which are hostile to capitalism and believe that every harm inflicted upon capitalists and entrepreneurs is extremely beneficial to the people .
In an unhampered market economy the capitalists and entrepreneurs [ p. 273 ] cannot expect an advantage from bribing officeholders and politicians .
On the other hand , the officeholders and politicians are not in a position to blackmail businessmen and to extort graft from them .
In an interventionist country powerful pressure groups are intent upon securing for their members privileges at the expense of weaker groups and individuals .
Then the businessmen may deem it expedient to protect themselves against discriminatory acts on the part of the executive officers and the legislature by bribery ; once used to such methods , they may try to employ them in order to secure privileges for themselves .
At any rate the fact that businessmen bribe politicians and officeholders and are blackmailed by such people does not indicate that they are supreme and rule the countries .
It is those ruled -- and not the rulers -- who bribe and are paying tribute .
The majority of businessmen are prevented from resorting to bribery either by their moral convictions or by fear .
They venture to preserve the free enterprise system and to defend themselves against discrimination by legitimate democratic methods .
They form trade associations and try to influence public opinion .
The results of these endeavors have been rather poor , as is evidenced by the triumphant advance of anticapitalist policies .
The best that they have been able to achieve is to delay for a while some especially obnoxious measures .
Demagogues misrepresent this state of affairs in the crassest way .
They tell us that these associations of bankers and manufacturers are the true rulers of their countries and that the whole apparatus of what they call " plutodemocratic " government is dominated by them .
A simple enumeration of the laws passed in the last decades by any country 's legislature is enough to explode such legends .
NASA Scientists Pioneer Method for Making Giant Lunar Telescopes
Robert Naeye
Goddard Space Flight Center
Scientists working at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , have concocted an innovative recipe for giant telescope mirrors on the Moon .
To make a mirror that dwarfs anything on Earth , just take a little bit of carbon , throw in some epoxy , and add lots of lunar dust .
"
We could make huge telescopes on the moon relatively easily , and avoid the large expense of transporting a large mirror from Earth , " says Peter Chen of NASA Goddard and the Catholic University of America , which is located in Washington , D.C. " Since most of the materials are already there in the form of dust , you do n’t have to bring very much stuff with you , and that saves a ton of money .
" Chen and his Goddard colleagues Douglas Rabin , Michael Van Steenberg , and Ron Oliversen are presenting their mirror - making technique in a poster at the 212th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis , Mo .
They will also describe their results in a press conference on Wednesday , June 4 at 9:30 a.m. CDT .
For years , Chen had been working with carbon - fiber composite materials to produce high - quality telescope mirrors .
But Chen and his colleagues decided to try an experiment .
They substituted carbon nanotubes ( tiny tubular structures made of pure carbon ) for the carbon - fiber composites .
When they mixed small amounts of carbon nanotubes and epoxies ( glue - like materials ) with crushed rock that has the same composition and grain size as lunar dust , they discovered to their surprise that they had created a very strong material with the consistency of concrete .
This material can be used instead of glass to make mirrors .
They next applied additional layers of epoxy and spun the material at room temperature .
The result was a 12 - inch - wide mirror blank with the parabolic shape of a telescope mirror .
All of this was achieved with minimal effort and cost .
" After that , all we needed to do was coat the mirror blank with a small amount of aluminum , and voilà , we had a highly reflective telescope mirror , " says Rabin .
" Our method could be scaled - up on the moon , using the ubiquitous lunar dust , to create giant telescope mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter . "
Such an observatory would dwarf the largest optical telescope in the world right now : the 10.4 - meter Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary Islands .
The capabilities of a 50 - meter telescope on the Moon boggle the imagination , according to NASA .
With a stable platform , and no atmosphere to absorb or blur starlight , the monster scope could record the spectra of extra solar terrestrial planets and detect atmospheric biomarkers such as ozone and methane .
Two or more such telescopes spanning the surface of the Moon can work together to take direct images of Earth - like planets around nearby stars and look for brightness variations that come from oceans and continents .
Among many other projects , it could make detailed observations of galaxies at various distances , to see how the universe evolved .
" Constructing giant telescopes provides a strong rationale for doing astronomy from the moon , " says Chen .
" We could also use this on - site composite material to build habitats for the astronauts , and mirrors to collect sunlight for solar - power farms .
" Chen notes that his group achieved this breakthrough with only the support of small NASA internal seed funds .
The carbon nanotubes were contributed by Dan Powell , Lead Nanotechnologist for NASA Goddard .
Several amateur astronomers made key contributions by advising and making special epoxy formulations , helping with polishing experiments , and vacuum coating the 12 - inch mirror .
Open source software is making its way into the systems that touch our everyday lives , from our banks to the stores where we shop .
Open source is also found in some of the IT systems that manage traffic flow on city streets , state highways and in the skies .
In fact , throughout the overlapping transportation and travel industries , open source has a very big footprint .
So , open source is taking over traffic flow management throughout the transportation industry , right ?
Not yet .
It probably will not be a pervasive source in handling ground traffic flow any time soon .
However , there are factors that suggest it will ultimately get there .
“ No open source software to support traffic flow exists .
We ’re building it as we go .
The process is analogous to tracking dots on a map , ” Margaret Sorentino , senior software engineer at Wireless Matrix , told LinuxInsider .
Seeking a Breakthrough
Wireless Matrix develops fleet management solutions and provides wireless data communications services .
The company relies on mobile phone and satellite technology .
The company also makes vehicle tracking software in real time locations over a Software as a Service ( SaaS ) delivery model .
The GPS ( global positioning system ) signal is sent over cell waves and is captured on the company ’s data screens .
Several of the company ’s products are based on open source tools .
These tools let drivers download traffic alerts to their mobile phones while they are navigating through traffic .
“ Everyone is jumping on open source as a way of controlling cost .
Traffic flow management is a good market to be in , ” she said .
Academic Progress
Much of the work on developing new traffic management solutions is taking place through collaborative efforts between researchers and practitioners .
One such endeavor is a project run by the University of California in Davis ( UC Davis ) and the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) .
Working with several states , researchers are developing a traffic management system based on open standards and open source software .
Known as the “ Advanced Highway Maintenance and Construction Technology , ” or AHMCT , the researcher center has cobbled together a working system for an Advanced Traffic Management System ( ATMS ) that uses open standards , open software and commodity computer hardware .
Researchers hope to greatly reduce ATMS deployment and maintenance costs , thus freeing funds for additional ATMS deployment .
Researchers hope their efforts will eventually economize the cost of maintaining current traffic management systems built around high - cost , proprietary , single - source ATMS components .
The goal is replace these aging systems with multi-sourced commodity hardware combined with open source software that has no annual licensing fees .
UC Davis and company are focusing on an existing open source ATMS package used by the Minnesota Department of Transportation called the “ Integrated Roadway Information System , ” or IRIS for short .
If successful , the use of open source technologies will lead the Californian highway department to helping the state achieve annual savings in the millions of dollars , according to university researchers .
Flying Progress
A similar system is in use to control traffic above ground as well .
The Federal Aviation Administration has adopted an open source air traffic management system .
The FAA is replacing its old proprietary systems using Java , Web service , open source and Oracle applications .
Part of the upgrade involves swapping out Unix for Red Hat Enterprise Linux , according to published accounts .
The FAA is using a real - time system called the “ Enhanced Traffic Management System ” to predict traffic surges , gaps and volume across the national airspace .
For around US $ 15 million under the original $ 25 million price tag , the FAA implemented the new system and spent two - thirds less time than originally projected doing it .
The transition to open source resulted in being able to use greater hardware flexibility and software control .
Promise Exists
Open source architecture is often the primary choice in South American and European countries , which are in many cases required by law to use non-proprietary software if such a solution exists .
The travel and transportation industries , of which traffic management is a growing subset , includes a wide variety of systems .
“ Open source is becoming more prevalent in international markets based in South America and Europe .
That will have a strong influence on U.S. market counterparts to develop new systems with open source , ” Guibert Englebienne , CTO of Argentinean software development and maintenance company Globant , told LinuxInsider .
A solid 95 percent of Globant ’s customers are based in the U.S. and England , he said .
He is seeing a greater emphasis of open source products blending with existing proprietary products in the U.S. market .
“ We see all the major players moving towards Linux running JBoss or Tomcat or Apache , ” Englebienne added .
The U.S. market will create open source platforms and customize them to their varying traffic management needs , he noted .
Community Support
One example of forces in motion to drive open source towards better managing traffic flow in the U.S. is the OpenTraffic project .
The community contributes software for use in ATMS applications to the transportation industry .
Its goal is to produce high - quality software guided by industry and worldwide standards that remains free to download , use and distribute .
Since OpenTraffic is an open source project built around the Eclipse integrated development environment and application framework , private industry developers can add proprietary device support .
The Eclipse platform is written in Java and provides modeling tools , a deployable application platform ( RCP ) and a tools library for application development .
The Eclipse model is conducive to shared development because its applications are built around plug-ins .
These highly modular and flexible components do not require access to source code .
In addition , OpenTraffic can be branded and highly customized to match the needs of the required transportation management user .
Also , plug - in developers can contribute them as open source projects or retain ownership as proprietary software .
Making Inroads
Traffic flow management in the U.S. may see better methods brought about by open source architecture as the transportation and travel industries realize the efficiency and cost gains open source provides .
Take , for instance , the view of an open source technologies expert .
“ Open source offers capabilities for higher traffic monitoring .
It can have really beneficial effects .
It is possible that open source has the added benefit of having the car on the Internet , ” David “ Lefty ” Schlesinger , director of open source technologies for Access Systems America , told LinuxInsider .
As an example , consider the OnStar phenomenon and other GPS systems .
“ OnStar gives you a flavor of what you can do in the automotive environment , ” he said .
Based on his book , The Missionary Position , Xopher Hitchens presents a short film on the woman who duped us all .
Fast - tracked to sainthood by the man who helped protect the murderers of his predecessor , Karol Józef Wojtyła ( Pope John Paul II ) , the self proclaimed champion of the poor , spent much of her life courting the rich and the powerful , turning a blind eye to the despotic regimes and raised millions in donations for her squalid ‘ home for the dying ’ in Calcutta , India .
But where did all that money go ?
Part 1 :
Part 2 :
Part 3 :
Discovered after the making of this film and the first edition of Hitchens ’ book , it was revealed in numerous letters Teresa wrote to her bishop , during her life , that she in fact had lost her faith in God and was encouraged to shoulder the burden of her deceitful life , as Christ had borne the weight of the one true cross .
from Locus Magazine , May 2008
Regular Locus readers will have noted a recent front - of - the - book item about my recent Good News , a little daughter named Poesy , born to us on February 3 , 2008 .
This feat of nanoengineering  mostly accomplished by my Alice , with 23 chromosomes ' worth of programming assistance from yours truly  has got me thinking about reproduction , even more than usual .
Mammals invest a lot of energy in keeping track of the disposition of each copy we spawn .
It 's only natural , of course : we invest so much energy and so many resources in our offspring that it would be a shocking waste if they were to wander away and fall off the balcony or flush themselves down the garbage disposal .
We 're hard - wired , as mammals , to view this kind of misfortune as a moral tragedy , a massive trauma to our psyches so deep that some of us never recover from it .
It follows naturally that we invest a lot of importance in the individual disposition of every copy of our artistic works as well , wringing our hands over " not for resale " advance review copies that show up on Amazon and tugging our beards at the thought of Google making a scan of our books in order to index them for searchers .
And while printing a book does n't take nearly as much out of us as growing a baby , there 's no getting around the fact that every copy printed is money spent , and every copy sold without being accounted for is money same day payday loans online taken away from us .
There are other organisms with other reproductive strategies .
Take the dandelion : a single dandelion may produce 2,000 seeds per year , indiscriminately firing them off into the sky at the slightest breeze , without any care for where the seeds are heading and whether they 'll get an hospitable reception when they touch down .
And indeed , most of those thousands of seeds will likely fall on hard , unyielding pavement , there to lie fallow and unconsummated , a failure in the genetic race to survive and copy .
But the disposition of each  or even most  of the seeds are n't the important thing , from a dandelion 's point of view .
The important thing is that every spring , every crack in every pavement is filled with dandelions .
The dandelion does n't want to nurse a single precious copy of itself in the hopes that it will leave the nest and carefully navigate its way to the optimum growing environment , there to perpetuate the line .
The dandelion just wants to be sure that every single opportunity for reproduction is exploited !
Dandelions and artists have a lot in common in the age of the Internet .
This is , of course , the age of unlimited , zero - marginal - cost copying .
If you blow your works into the net like a dandelion clock on the breeze , the net itself will take care of the copying costs .
Your fans will paste - bomb your works into their mailing list , making 60,000 copies so fast and so cheaply that figuring out how much it cost in aggregate to make all those copies would be orders of magnitude more expensive than the copies themselves .
What 's more , the winds of the Internet will toss your works to every corner of the globe , seeking out every fertile home that they may have  given enough time and the right work , your stuff could someday find its way over the transom of every reader who would find it good and pleasing .
After all , the majority of links between blogs have been made to or from blogs with four or fewer inbound links in total  that means that the Internet has figured out a cost - effective means of helping audiences of three people discover the writers they should be reading .
So , let 's stipulate that you want to reproduce like a dandelion and leave mammaldom behind .
How do you do it ?
There are two critical success factors for dandelionhood :
1 . Your work needs to be easily copied , to anywhere whence it might find its way into the right hands .
That means that the nimble text - file , HTML file , and PDF ( the preferred triumvirate of formats ) should be distributed without formality  no logins , no e-mail address collections , and with a license that allows your fans to reproduce the work on their own in order to share it with more potential fans .
Remember , copying is a cost - center  insisting that all copies must be downloaded from your site and only your site is insisting that you  and only you  will bear the cost of making those copies .
Sure , having a single , central repository for your works makes it easier to count copies and figure out where they 're going , but remember : dandelions do n't keep track of their seeds .
Once you get past the vanity of knowing exactly how many copies have been made , and find the zen of knowing that the copying will take care of itself , you 'll attain dandelionesque contentment .
2 . Once your work gets into the right hands , there needs to be an easy way to consummate the relationship .
A friend who runs a small press recently wrote to me to ask if I thought he should release his next book as a Creative Commons free download in advance of the publication , in order to drum up some publicity before the book went on sale .
I explained that I thought this would be a really bad idea .
Internet users have short attention spans .
The moment of consummation  the moment when a reader discovers your book online , starts to read it , and thinks , huh , I should buy a copy of this book  is very brief .
That 's because " I should buy a copy of this book " is inevitably followed by , " Woah , a youtube of a man putting a lemon in his nose ! " and the moment , as they say , is gone .
I know this for a fact .
I review a lot of books on Boing Boing , and whenever I do , I link to the Amazon page for the book , using my " affiliate ID " in the URL .
If you follow one of those links and buy the book , I get a commission  about eight percent .
I can use Amazon 's reporting tool to tell exactly how many people click on my links , and how many of them shell out money for the book , and here 's the thing : when I link to a book that 's out soon , available now for pre-order , I reliably get less than ten percent of the purchases I get when I link to books that are available for sale now .
Nine out of ten Boing Boing readers who buy books based on my reviews do n't want to pre-order a title and wait for it to show up later .
The net is an unending NOW of moments and distractions and wonderments and puzzlements and rages .
Asking someone riding its currents to undertake some kind of complex dance before she can hand you her money is a losing proposition .
User - interface designers speak of how every additional click between thought and deed lops a huge number of seeds out of the running for germination .
In my next column , " Macropayments , " I 'll write more about this consummative act , for this is the key to enduring success as a dandelion .
Here 's the gist : expend less effort trying to ensure that small sums of money are extracted from your fans for individual copies of your work , and focus instead on getting larger payouts , making each germination count for something more than a buck 's royalties .
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has told Congress that US intelligence operatives attempting to thwart terrorist attacks can legally use interrogation methods that might otherwise be prohibited under international law .
The legal interpretation , outlined in recent letters , sheds new light on the still - secret rules for interrogations by the CIA .
It shows that the administration is arguing that the boundaries for interrogations should be subject to some latitude , even under an executive order issued last summer that President Bush said meant that the CIA would comply with international strictures against harsh treatment of detainees .
While the Geneva Conventions prohibit " outrages upon personal dignity , " a letter sent by the Justice Department to Congress on March 5 makes clear that the administration has not drawn a precise line in deciding which interrogation methods would violate that standard , and is reserving the right to make case - by - case judgments .
" The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act , " said Brian A. Benczkowski , a deputy assistant attorney general , in the letter , which had not previously been made public .
Bush issued the executive order last summer to comply with restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court and Congress .
The order spelled out new standards for interrogation techniques , requiring that they comply with international standards for humane treatment , but it did not identify any approved techniques .
It has been clear that the order preserved at least some of the latitude that Bush has permitted the CIA in using harsher interrogation techniques than those permitted by the military or other agencies .
But the new documents provide more details about how the administration intends to determine whether a specific technique would be legal , depending on the circumstances involved .
The letters from the Justice Department to Congress were provided by the staff of Senator Ron Wyden , Democrat of Oregon , who is a member of the Intelligence Committee and had sought more information from the department .
Some legal specialists critical of the Justice Department interpretation said the department seemed to be arguing that the prospect of thwarting a terror attack could be used to justify interrogation methods that would otherwise be illegal .
" What they are saying is that if my intent is to defend the United States rather than to humiliate you , then I have not committed an offense , " said Scott L. Silliman , who teaches national security law at Duke University .
But a senior Justice Department official strongly challenged this interpretation on Friday , saying that the purpose of the interrogation would be just one among many factors weighed in determining whether a specific procedure could be used .
" I certainly do n't want to suggest that if there 's a good purpose you can head off and humiliate and degrade someone , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was describing some legal judgments that remain classified .
" The fact that you are doing something for a legitimate security purpose would be relevant , but there are things that a reasonable observer would deem to be outrageous , " he said .
At the same time , the official said , " there are certainly things that can be insulting that would not raise to the level of an outrage on personal dignity . "
The humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners is prohibited by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
The legal reasoning included in the latest Justice Department letters is less expansive than what department lawyers offered as recently as 2005 in defending the use of aggressive techniques .
But they show that the Bush administration lawyers are citing the sometimes vague language of the Geneva Conventions to support the idea that interrogators should not be bound by ironclad rules .
In one letter written Sept. 27 , 2007 , Benczkowski said that " to rise to the level of an outrage " and thus be prohibited under the Geneva Conventions , conduct " must be so deplorable that the reasonable observer would recognize it as something that should be universally condemned . "
Wyden said he was concerned that , under the new rules , the Bush administration had put Geneva Convention restrictions on a " sliding scale . "
If the United States used subjective standards in applying its interrogation rules , he said , then potential enemies might adopt different standards of treatment for American detainees based on an officer 's rank or other factors .
" The cumulative effect in my interpretation is to put American troops at risk , " Wyden said .

Change You Can't Quite Believe In German Toymaker Launches Barack Obama Doll
A German toymaker has paid the ultimate tribute to presidential hopeful Barack Obama by immortalizing him in the form of a collector 's doll .
But the maker of the mini-Obama admits that it was tricky to get the skin tone correct .

MONTE CARLO ( Reuters ) -
The future looks rosy for scrap metal traders as the world ’s resources begin to run out and the threat of climate change triggers energy savings , a recycling conference heard this week .

With a rising global population -- forecast to reach 8.2 billion by 2030 from 6.7 billion now -- the generation of waste is increasing rapidly , offering big potential for recycling , which saves energy and helps reduce greenhouse gas production .
“ The scarcity of virgin materials will soon become an issue , ” Henrik Harjula of the Environment Directorate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development told a Bureau of International Recycling ( BIR ) conference .
The world ’s copper resources would last for another 60 years , silver 29 years , zinc 46 years while tin deposits would be exhausted in 40 years , he said .
Annual resource extraction would increase to 80 billion tonnes in 2020 , nearly double the level extracted in 2002 , and by 2030 it could reach 100 billion , according to the OECD .
“ This poses a real opportunity , but it is also a challenge for the recycling industry , ” OECD ’s Harjula said .
In the production of copper , aluminum and steel , around 40 percent of the raw materials used comes from recycled metal instead of ore from mines .
CLIMATE CHANGE
By using secondary raw materials , smelters can make large cost savings , for example in aluminum where it takes 95 percent less energy to produce the metal from scrap such as old cans .
By smelting aluminum scrap , 354,000 tons of carbon dioxide , one of the main greenhouse gases , is saved per 100,000 tons of aluminum produced , a study by the Imperial College in London showed .
“ The half a billion or more tons of greenhouse gas emissions that you avoid through recycling has a value of $ 40 or more per ton , ” said Nicholas Stern , the author of an influential report on climate change .
The turnover of the recycling industry , including paper and plastics , per year amounts to around $ 160 billion and it handles over 600 million tons of raw materials .
Thanks to the recycling industry , the world already saves the equivalent of 1.8 percent of global fossil fuel emissions .
“ This is a very significant contribution , ” Stern said , adding that the recycling industry was saving a similar amount to what the airline industry emits .
By contributing an average of 40 percent of raw materials today through recycling , it could perhaps be 50 percent in the future .
“ That will be equivalent to cutting aircraft emissions further by 15 percent , ” Stern said .
However the recycling industry , in particular the steel industry , still has a long way to go to become energy efficient and reduce its own carbon footprint .
The steel industry accounts for a fifth of the emissions from the recycling sector and it emits some 3 - 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions , according to the International Iron and Steel Institute ( IISI ) .

Sorry , the comment form is closed at this time .
I have a novel in editing , a story of a college administration in the aftermath of the murder of a U.S. Army recruiting officer .
I chose as my venue a privately supported engineering school , historically friendly to the military that had relied on receiving a considerable amount of tuition revenues through ROTC and the G.I. Bill .
My fictional school is in trouble : its image has been compromised by the murder , and the military benefits can’t cover the full freight anymore .
In researching my story , I had to understand military recruiting as well as the G.I. Bill .
I found myself surprised that the college education benefits under the G.I .
Bill today are not as expansive as they were after World War II .
World War II veterans received full tuition , fees , books , a monthly stipend and reimbursements for training expenses .
The original legislation signed by President Roosevelt enabled 7.8 million World War II veterans to go to college , more than half of those who served .
It also invigorated the growth of higher education in our country .
Since the original legislation passed in 1944 , there have been subsequent G.I. Bills , however , according the Senator James Webb ( D - Virginia ) their benefits were more appropriate to a military in peacetime , not armed forces at war .
I agree , because a better benefits package will only help to recruit and retain a strong military .
It will be a much easier sell for the recruiters too .
Webb , a Marine and former Secretary of the Navy under the first President Bush , is the primary sponsor of the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance
Act to increase educational benefits to all members of the military who have served on active duty since 9/11 .
Webb , a former Republican who served under President Reagan as well as the first President Bush , is a beneficiary of the G.I.
Bill and a more than credible leader on this issue .
Webb ’s proposed legislation will enable eligible veterans to receive 100 percent of the tuition and fees charged by the most expensive state university in their home state .
While this is not a total return to the intentions of the original post - World War II G.I .
Bill , it is an extremely reasonable start , and an appropriate reward to those who have served with honor .
Yet , the Bush Administration opposes the bill , even though the current president ’s father was himself a beneficiary of the original G.I. Bill .
They , along with the Defense Department , believe that it will hinder military recruitment and retention , though the bill is meant to do the opposite .
Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama support Webb ’s bill .
Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , is not a co-sponsor , although he has announced plans to introduce his own legislation .
The major obstacle to a new G.I .
Bill is cost and the addition of a new entitlement raises the federal budget deficit at wartime .

Although acute cannabis intoxication following smoking has been shown to mildly impair psychomotor skills , this impairment is seldom severe or long lasting .
In closed course and driving simulator studies , marijuana ’s acute effects on psychomotor performance include minor impairments in tracking ( eye movement control ) and reaction time , as well as variation in lateral positioning , headway ( drivers under the influence of cannabis tend to follow less closely to the vehicle in front of them ) , and speed ( drivers tend to decrease speed following cannabis inhalation ) .
In general , these variations in driving behavior are noticeably less consistent or pronounced than the impairments exhibited by subjects under the influence of alcohol .
Also , unlike subjects impaired by alcohol , individuals under the influence of cannabis tend to be aware of their impairment and try to compensate for it accordingly , either by driving more cautiously or by expressing an unwillingness to drive altogether .

Concerns about stoned drivers careening across our nation 's highways are frequently cited as a justification for the continued criminalization of marijuana .
Given the massive casualties associated with drunk driving , it 's easy to understand how the specter of increased roadside fatalities can be effective in reinforcing negative attitudes about marijuana .
However , a new report reveals that , while stoned driving is n't smart , it 's hardly the death sentence some would have us believe .
NORML 's Paul Armentano has prepared a scientific review of over a dozen studies evaluating marijuana 's effect on psychomotor skills and the risks posed by marijuana intoxication behind the wheel .
Armentano finds that marijuana impairment is generally " subtle and short - lived , " falling far short of the threats posed by drunk driving .
Of course , the point here is n’t that one should get stoned and cruise the strip blasting Led Zeppelin .
But this is information one would want if they were trying to create a smart marijuana policy as opposed to the disgraceful mess of legislative lunacy currently passing for marijuana law in America .
Whenever someone claims that marijuana makes you sick or crazy ; that it will cause you to crash your car , kill your comrades , or catastrophically co-opt your common sense , just look for the corpses .
Where are they ?
I 've looked high and low , but I can't find the disastrous consequences of marijuana use apparent anywhere other than the Drug Czar 's predictably propagandized press releases .
But to be fair , there are two horrible things about marijuana that everyone should be mindful of and they are as follows : 1 ) the smell attracts cops , nosy neighbors , and mooches and 2 ) the stuff remains detectable in your system for up to a month , thereby enabling various authorities to become needlessly aware of your activities .
If not for these two unfortunate conditions , the marijuana war would n't even begin to work , and the blockheads who 've been bothering to fight it would 've wandered off decades ago .
Cleveland , Ohio , a city which represents all of the challenges and potential of the American economy , is rightfully the focal point of the Ohio Democratic presidential primary on March 4 .
The candidate who can deliver an economic platform with solid programmatic initiatives for jobs , health care , education and retirement security can win the state and be on the path to the nomination .
Of course , I am no longer a candidate for president .
When I was continually locked out of presidential debates , it became apparent that there was no chance .
At the same time , labor in Cleveland asked me to come back and defend the 10th District congressional seat .
The FEC [ Federal Election Commission ] reports released last week show that in the Democratic primary , I am currently being outspent by a margin of 5 - 1 .
Corporate Cleveland has organized its considerable resources behind a candidate who has had a three - week television campaign of a “ Swift - boat ” - type distortion of my record .
I have always felt that the seat never belonged to me , but belongs to working men and women and their families , who are entitled to representation in the Congress , especially given the corporate domination of both political parties .
It is particularly ironic to see the same Cleveland corporate development interests at work trying to take a congressional seat for their own profit , when 30 years ago they used their power to send the city of Cleveland into default over $ 15 million and then used the default to defeat my reelection bid as mayor !
This $ 15 - million default is now dwarfed by the handouts given to each of the same interests by the current city government .
Back to the future !
What happens in Cleveland is , of course , relevant to the entire nation .
Somewhere , somehow people have to win a victory over corporate control and corporate greed .
Cleveland is a great place to begin .
And this election is a perfect time to start .

The first libertarian intellectual was Lao - tzu , the founder of Taoism .
Little is known about his life , but apparently he was a personal acquaintance of Confucius in the late sixth century BC and like the latter came from the state of Sung and was descended from the lower aristocracy of the Yin dynasty .
Unlike the notable apologist for the rule of philosopher - bureaucrats , however , Lao - tzu developed a radical libertarian creed .
For Lao - tzu the individual and his happiness was the key unit and goal of society .
If social institutions hampered the individual 's flowering and his happiness , then those institutions should be reduced or abolished altogether .
To the individualist Lao - tzu , government , with its " laws and regulations more numerous than the hairs of an ox , " was a vicious oppressor of the individual , and " more to be feared than fierce tigers . "
Government , in sum , must be limited to the smallest possible minimum ; " inaction " was the proper function of government , since only inaction can permit the individual to flourish and achieve happiness .
Any intervention by government , Lao - tzu declared , would be counterproductive , and would lead to confusion and turmoil .
After referring to the common experience of mankind with government , Lao - tzu came to this incisive conclusion : " The more artificial taboos and restrictions there are in the world , the more the people are impoverished … .
The more that laws and regulations are given prominence , the more thieves and robbers there will be . "
The wisest course , then , is to keep the government simple and for it to take no action , for then the world " stabilizes itself . "
As Lao - tzu put it , " Therefore the Sage says : I take no action yet the people transform themselves , I favor quiescence and the people right themselves , I take no action and the people enrich themselves … . "
Lao -tzu arrived at his challenging and radical new insights in a world dominated by the power of Oriental despotism .
What strategy to pursue for social change ?
It surely was unthinkable for Lao - tzu , with no available historical or contemporary example of libertarian social change , to set forth any optimistic strategy , let alone contemplate forming a mass movement to overthrow the State .
And so Lao - tzu took the only strategic way out that seemed open to him , counseling the familiar Taoist path of withdrawal from society and the world , of retreat and inner contemplation .
I submit that while contemporary Taoists advocate retreat from the world as a matter of religious or ideological principle , it is very possible that Lao - tzu called for retreat not as a principle , but as the only strategy that in his despair seemed open to him .
If it was hopeless to try to disentangle society from the oppressive coils of the State , then he perhaps assumed that the proper course was to counsel withdrawal from society and the world as the only way to escape State tyranny .
That retreat from the State was a dominant Taoist objective may be seen in the views of the great Taoist Chuang - tzu ( 369 BC - 286 BC ) who , two centuries after Lao - tzu , pushed the master 's ideas of laissez faire to their logical conclusion : individualist anarchism .
The influential Chuang - tzu , a notable stylist who wrote in allegorical parables , was a highly learned man in the state of Meng , and also descended from the old aristocracy .
A minor official in his native state , Chuang - tzu 's fame as a writer spread far and wide throughout China , so much so that King Wei of the Ch'u kingdom sent an emissary to Chuang bearing great gifts and urging him to become Wei 's chief minister of state .
Chuang - tzu 's scornful rejection of the king 's offer is one of the great declarations in history on the evils underlying the glittering trappings of State power ; it was a fitting declaration from the man who was perhaps the world 's first anarchist :
A thousand ounces of gold is indeed a great reward , and the office of chief minister is truly an elevated position .
But have you , sir , not seen the sacrificial ox awaiting the sacrifices at the royal shrine of state ?
It is well cared for and fed for a few years , caparisoned with rich brocades , so that it will be ready to be led into the Great Temple .
At that moment , even though it would gladly change places with any solitary pig , can it do so ?
So , quick and be off with you !
Do n't sully me , I would rather roam and idle about in a muddy ditch , at my own amusement , than to be put under the restraints that the ruler would impose .
I will never take any official service , and thereby I will satisfy my own purposes .
Chuang - tzu reiterated and embellished Lao - tzu 's devotion to laissez faire and opposition to state rule : " There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone ; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [ with success ] . "
In fact , the world simply " does not need governing ; in fact it should not be governed . "
Chuang - tzu was also the first to work out the idea of " spontaneous order , " developed particularly by Proudhon in the nineteenth and by F. A. Hayek of the Austrian School in the twentieth Century : " Good order results spontaneously when things are let alone . "
Chuang - tzu , moreover , was perhaps the first theorist to see the State as a brigand writ large : " A petty thief is put in jail .
A great brigand becomes a ruler of a State . "
Thus the only difference between State rulers and out - and - out robber chieftains is the size of their depredations .
This theme of ruler - as - robber was to be repeated , independently of course , by Cicero and then by St. Augustine and other Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages .
Murray N. Rothbard ( 1926-1995 ) was dean of the Austrian School .
This article is taken from the first section of " Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire , " The Journal of Libertarian Studies , Vol IX No. 2 ( Fall 1990 ) .

An earlier version of the paper was delivered at a Conference on Economics and Social Change held by the London Academic and Cultural Resources Fund and The Institute for Sociology at the University of Warsaw , at Mragowo , Poland , March 14 - 18 , 1986 .

In the anals of bush government , this evidence collected on 9 - 11 6 hours before the 47 story World Trade Tower building experienced a globlal collapse , the 1 % elite illuminati represented by bush administration official and their private military force now know beyond a reasonable doubt that Iran had as much to do with 9 - 11 as Iraq and must be bombed into submission because they are jealous of our version of US style democracy and plan to take out the white house in October 2008 .

Does this make the circle complete ?

Ca n't bitch to the senate , they do n't care
Ca n't bitch to the sos they do n't care
Ca n't sue em , ( Rigged ) DOJ do n't care
Ca n't reverse bad results , and de-throne the elected , ( they accept power too fast , and care less about oath of office )
Ca n't use a civil lawsuit , cause it get 's delayed or takes so long that it 's made irrelevant
Ca n't use the Constitution , since it 's been pissed on .
And finally the catch 22 Can't vote em out because of bad electronic vote tabulation devices
or
Ca n't vote at all because of voter roll manipulation IS THE CIRCLE COMPLETE ?

FYI
Samuel Chase ( April 17 , 1741 – June 19 , 1811 ) , was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court and earlier was a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Maryland .
Early in life , Chase was a " firebrand " states - righter and revolutionary .
For unknown reasons , perhaps just emotional maturation , his political views changed during his life and career .
In the last decades of his career he became well - known as a staunch Federalist , and was impeached for allegedly letting his partisan leanings affect his court decisions .
Chase was acquitted .

That is pertaining to questioning past US election results .

Once these skull and bones figured out no one could really question a normal descrepency or stuffed ballot box , it 's probably been a long standing inside joke for these criminal fcks .
If there is ever a question about who the man is , the Electoral College is in place to trump any popular vote problem .

In order for any possibility of legal and fair elections the Electoral College MUST be abolished .
With it in place it permanently keeps the chance of viable 3rd & 4th parties all but impossible .
That is the ONLY reason it remains today .
We currently are saddled with a 99.999 % corrupt Duopoly , anyone that thinks the democrats are not just as guilty in the crimes committed the past 8 years are deluding themselves .
" DON'T DO ANYTHING .
DO NOT BE VIOLENT .
DO NOT BREAK THE LAW !!!
THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ACTION !! " / sigh , and sadly this is the exact mantra that has been beaten into the general populace for many decades .
Basically whatever happens regardless how egregious , regardless if ALL of the avenues of redress of grievances have been completely sewn up you are just supposed to lay down and do nothing .
Just go home ( if you still have one ) and watch the TV , go to work ( if you still have a job ) and make your boss richer .
But whatever you do , do n't do the ONLY thing that could possibly actually effect change .
The ONLY thing that is LEGALLY left for citizens to do when the Government gets so corrupt .
I realise these papers do n't mean anything anymore but they were what this country was founded on and they used to mean everything .
Declaration of Independence " " That to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . " "
I can assure you the founders of this country were not referring to marching around with a sign singing Kumbaya or that this altering , abolishing , & throwing off of such government was just going to magically happen if we all sit around and do nothing but ask nicely .
Sitting around doing nothing and asking nicely is what has gotten us where we are today .
We the People have been neutered with such BS Kindergarten rules for decades to the point to where we all have become utterly worthless .
Elections are blatantly stolen and 10s of millions of us KNOW this for a fact and we do nothing .
This country was attacked in a false flag attack BY OUR OWN GOVERNMENT , both sides know it , both are guilty of committing and covering up the crime and the Mainstream media is also fully aware of this attack and helped commit and cover up the crime .
At LEAST 40 % of this country KNOWS this for a fact , that is well in excess of 100 Million people and yet we do NOTHING .
We sit back and hope , we go out pretend to vote on machines we know are corrupt in an election we know is rigged and for candidates we know are all bought & paid for by Big Oil & the top 2 % .
As if the slightly lesser of 2 insanely corrupt evils is somehow going to make a damn bit of difference .
We have all lost our collective minds .
" DON ’T DO ANYTHING .
DO NOT BE VIOLENT .
DO NOT BREAK THE LAW !!!
THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ACTION !! "
Yep , this is exactly what we are going to do , NOTHING and we deserve exactly what we got coming because of it .

# 11 & # 12 , I 've been thinking the same thing recently , that the elections have ALWAYS had a degree of corruption if not outright rigging .
Concerned citizens are just now able to communicate in near real time , that 's why we 're catching it more . # 13 , I feel your frustration and am glad somebody else posts the DoI in order to remind other citizens of their duty .
I partly agree with your statement :
We the People have been neutered with such BS Kindergarten rules for decades to the point to where we all have become utterly worthless .
The main rules that came to mind when I read that were the rules regarding the Prohibition of Cannabis .
With that BS and unconstituional prohibition , the government literally is infringing on the citizens ' " cognitive liberty " : their right to think and affect their own consciousness how they deem appropriate .
All other rights are downstream from this fundamental , right to one 's own consciousness .
When I think about cannabis prohibition , and how the government took the most useful and non-toxic plant on the planet , and conjured up the fraud that it was the most dangerous , in order to reap immense profits for their corporate benefactors , while simultaneously creating the largest prison population on earth and effectively continuing the Pharmacratic Inquisition , and then maintaining this fraud for over 70 YEARS ! , even with millions of people knowing that 's it a fraud , hell , 9/11 seems easier to pull off in comparison .
But we 're not all useless .
Millions of citizens everyday , BREAK THE LAW , regarding cannabis prohibition , and bless them for it .

While everyone is searching for software - related fraud , they miss the hidden threat : transceivers embedded in the machines ' electronics .
Electronic snooping is so advanced , now , that certain in - home devices may be switched to transmit voice - and in some cases visual - activity to spy agencies .
No election outcome tabulated through electronic voting can be trusted as accurate / true .
None whatsoever !
Stop hunting for bad software and search for remotely accessed components , used to switch outcomes as desired .

To # 6 Phil , The circle has not reached the 6 O'Clock position yet .
This circle in other terms , revolution .
Now onto my comments .
I do believe , those with the ability to listen and make the needed changes we are growing to demand , will not slink away from the current masters until we place into their collective desires and lay it all down for them to finally understand this fact , they will be on the defendants bench when the trial finaly gets underway , and the charges are capital crimes .
Make that call and just remind YOUR REPRESENTATIVEs and be the nice friendly guy .
Tell them they had better turn to the side of the peoples witness or be a defendant for capital crime (s ) and treason (s ) .
That said , how to fix this organized crime infested representation we have .
" Writ of mandamus " against all law enforcement and the courts themselves to honor the Ninth Article to the Bill of Rights that states , " The enumeration in the constitution ( Intoxicating Liquors ) of certain rights , SHAL NOT BE construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . "
The intoxicating powders , leafs , etc. , are all protected rights of the people because organized crime thought intoxicating drink was worth enumerating into the constitution with the 18th and then the repair of that error with the 21st amendment .
But it is time to gain back that control of YOUR OWN PAINS from the DEA 's computer database .
Imagine a reasonable man giving another the ability to tell the first how much pain they must endure , , , " you better be nice to me or you are gonna be in serious pain .
Pay up sucker .
Where 's my tip ? " .
In the early 1980's , a gram of tampered with cocaine was selling for about $ 120.00 per gram , at the same time , the pharmacutical grade of cocaine was selling for TWO PENNIES for a gram , UnTampered for 2 American fake chips of copper ( fake copper at that ) .
Can you see the motive for organized crime families to keep the bush ( just an example clan ) clan in power .
The fruity loop once said , " I 'm out of the loop " , to a question of what he knew about the Iran / Contra drug deals .
Turns out he was the loop .
Big money can buy a lot of programming and voting machines , it 's a slam dunk .
Hence , the only way to FIX all these problems , is with Liberty of the people by the people and for the people .
If there is some minor conflict of whether or not something is a crime or legal , the people decide for liberty every time , organized crime goes for state domination every time .
If you are not getting the hint , your government IS organized crime .
It all starts with the demands for a luxurious life style , by criminals that place their friends into political positions .
Do you think this is a new idea the mexican mafia has come up with by putting their street thugs into the military etc .!
Wakey up folks .
Ending prohibition (s ) is the only method you have to put a serious dent into the plans of these criminal chickenhawk thugs .
And you do this with what hs been enumerated into the constitution , or have you bought into the contract on all americans .

Shit , on my # 20 Deacon , they 're starting to change terms around already on Wiki since my last look on the subject .
You can get to it all on Wiki now by searching " Goubau - Line " and " single wire transmission line " .
What 's really interesting is they can get into your shit just by aiming a frequency matching propagation cone at any power line and come right in through your 120 volt outlet ... very high tech .

Okay , I am a bit dense on this whole matter .
I admit it .
The Rockwell decision appears to say first - hand direct knowledge is essential for the collection of any reimbursement for bringing the case .
I thought that is what Singer had .
If he attached all sorts of inferences and speculation to what he knows or knew , that would be reason enough to ditch the case --- but I am not getting that from Brad 's reporting .
If the DOJ had decided to join the case , the Rockwell decision seems to say it is possible the litigation could be amended , and the SCOTUS then says an amended case runs the risk of cutting out the whistle - blower ( and his attornies ) if for some reason the amended complaint depends on something other than ( or does not depend completely upon ) the whistle - blower 's firsthand knowledge .
And if DOJ does not choose to join the case , then the whistle - blower 's attornies alone run the risk of not being paid should they lose it .
( This suggests the attornies really think adding the DOJ is extremely helpful to their chances -- but given the current DOJ , I have my doubts about that . )
So the whistle - blower ( as in Rockwell ) has to be exactly right about his allegations and has to have personally witnessed the offending conduct himself , or have in his possession the physical evidence .
Otherwise , no attorney is going to attempt a suit .
Gotta have the smoking gun .
Pap is saying this ruling undercuts the " free market " for whistle - blower attornies .
Contingency fees = free market .
I suppose the legal framing of this entire issue is " product liability " .
A defective product .
False advertising .
Bad faith contract .
I do n't exactly know whether " harming the democracy " counts for anything in this case .
Am I summing this up correctly ?

gtash I do n't think you are .
By the nature of these cases , stuff the government should be prosecuting but is n't , in order to proceed with them privately , you have to give the DoJ the chance to do it themselves first .
It 's not optional .
And you can't go shooting your mouth off about it until the DoJ has decided whether or not to take it themselves .
Even though I have n't read the decision yet , it seems to me the SCOTUS has made a fascist ruling , here , saying the government will decide which corporate felons they will prosecute and which they will protect , and private citizens , whistle - blowers or the rest of us , including the attorneys who want to litigate this stuff when the government wo n't , can just suck eggs .
They do n't care whether we know they 're protecting election fraudsters .
What are we gonna do about it ?
If we can't nail them in court , and we can't vote them out because they control the outcome of all our votes , all we can do is revolt .
Then they can throw us in the slammer ....

It all boils down to one thing , the Goverment isnt ours and continues each and every day , as a traitorous one .
People have to understand there is a need to stop the bleeding and its our right to rise up .
Peaceful protest mean nothing ,
These people who we elected and depend on havent cared for a very long time , knowing we are whimps and will do nothing .
Violence I am afraid as our founding Fathers said , is the only thing these people understand .
That is an opinion but the only way out .
Otherwise , every single person that writes here , is wasting their time blah blah blah ... no action all talk .

It is time brothers and sisters for a revolution .

Do not pay taxes ... stop spending your money on anything but absolute necessities .
I still like the idea of a symbolic Boston tea Party with Willie Nelson and the band .
No taxation without representation .
Our Democratic pres. nominee , despite being a constitutional scholar , does not think it is necessary to vote against the new FISA law .

GTash -
Actually , you 're analysis is pretty good .
You paid close attention .
So now I can offer a few more details that I did n't put into the story ( since time was short when I wrote it , the story was already getting long , and the additional explanation was complicated and nuanced ) .
I 'm not an attorney , of course , but my understanding from speaking with those involved with the case , is that there was concern that the Rockwell case was exceedingly limited in that , for example , if the discovery process showed that versions of the system that Singer had worked with and blown the whistle on had since been updated , the complaint might need to be amended to deal with the newer systems if they still contained the same flaws as reported by Singer .
But getting that info via the discovery process even , might not be considered " original source " under Rockwell .
So you can see how limiting the ruling is / could be .
And the worst thing , is that one would n't find out until the case was appealed on the basis of Rockwell .
The attorneys might spend years and millions and millions of dollars on the case , win every complaint , and only after appear 3 or 4 years down the road find out that the money the plaintiff ( relator ) was awarded will go to the government and not to either the relator or even to the attorneys to cover their fees .
It 's a very very bad situation as far as I can tell .
Fortunately , the decisions does n't apply , as far as I know , to state qui tam cases , so that might be a route still available to whistleblowers like Singer , depending on the particular state .

SAN FRANCISCO  Mayor Gavin Newsom is competitive about many things , garbage included .
When the city found out a few weeks ago that it was keeping 70 percent of its disposable waste out of local landfills , he embraced the statistic the way other mayors embrace winning sports teams , improved test scores or declining crime rates .
But the city wants more .
So Mr. Newsom will soon be sending the city ’s Board of Supervisors a proposal that would make the recycling of cans , bottles , paper , yard waste and food scraps mandatory instead of voluntary , on the pain of having garbage pickups suspended .
“ Without that , we do n’t think we can get to 75 percent , ” the mayor said of the proposal .
His aides said it stood a good chance of passing .
How does he describe his fixation with recycling dominance ?
“ It ’s purposefulness that could otherwise be construed as ego , ” Mr. Newsom said .
“ You want to be the greatest city .
You want to be the leading city .
You want to be on the cutting edge .
I ’m very intense about it . ”
It seems everything is taxable — even coupons !
I never questioned the small print on the coupons I use , at least not the part about the customer paying sales tax .
( I do n't understand why a manufacturer can say a coupon should n't be doubled when it's the retailer that makes a doubling offer , but that 's not my point here . )
I never questioned the sales tax , but I know others have .
Recently , when we were about to pay for new car tires , I overheard the customer in front of us questioning the sales tax on his bill : “ Why should I pay sales tax on this $ 40 - off coupon ?
You do n't charge sales tax when the price is lower because of a store sale .
Using a coupon is the same thing — I still pay $ 40 less . ”
He made a valid point :
Why am I paying sales tax on money I 'm not paying for goods or services ?
If a manufacturer prices a car at $ 21,499 and I bargain with the dealer so that I 'm paying only $ 17,399 , I would certainly question the bill if I saw I was taxed on $ 21,499 .
Sometimes manufacturers suggest ridiculously inflated retail prices that I would never pay ; the idea of being charged sales tax on those prices is absurd .
For lower priced items , the difference in tax seems minor , even if I would scoff at the manufacturer 's inflated price .
If I went to a toy store and paid a $ 15.00 sale price for a toy that 's usually $ 20.00 , I might not notice if I were charged thirty cents in tax on the extra $ 5.00 .
If I did notice , I would complain about it if I had the time and was in a quarrelsome mood .
But until I overheard that tire customer , I never questioned the sales tax I paid on coupons .
In fact , I have done the opposite — I once blurted out , “ Do n't I owe sales tax ? ” when coupons and sales brought my total bill to $ 0.00 .
Once that tire customer planted the idea in my head , I had to find out why we do have to pay sales tax on coupons , but not advertised specials .
The tire clerk had just responded , “ The law says we have to . ”
That explanation was n't enough to satisfy my curiosity , so I turned to Goodsearch and found a reasonable explanation from the state of New Jersey : “ When these [ manufacturers ' ] coupons are used , sales tax is charged on the full regular price because that is the amount which the vendor ultimately receives — in part from the customer , the balance from the manufacturer . ”
The same site explained that sales tax should not be charged for vendor coupons because the vendor never receives that extra money .
That made sense to me , but assuming the laws are the same in my state ( an answer I could n't find online ) , the tire customer could have made another argument against paying sales tax : the coupon he used had been a vendor coupon .
Retailers seem to be as confused by the law as consumers are .
Some retailers never charge sales tax on discounts , whether they are in - store sales or manufacturer 's coupons .
Some charge sales tax on all coupons , even those they have issued themselves .
I have learned to expect to be charged sales tax on coupons and am pleasantly surprised when I am not — I consider it a gift from the retailer .
Either way , I see coupons as a blessing , so I have decided not to complain that I ’m really only getting 94 % of their value after I pay Pennsylvania ’s 6 % sales tax .

Bless his little heart , let 's have House Minority Whip Roy Blunt on every week to talk up John McCain 's candidacy !
Talk about living within a bubble , Blunt thinks nothing of touting the McSame presidency as a Bush third term , despite the record disapproval rating for the man and the vast majority of the country believing that the country is going in the wrong direction under his leadership .
Apparently , Blunt did n't get the memo that McCain is trying to distance himself from Bush and as Rep.
Chris Van Hollen points out , on the two most important issues to the American people , McCain absolutely equals Bush .
And Roy , that 's not such a good thing .

BLITZER : When it comes to domestic economic issues , what is the major difference between President Bush 's policies , what he wants to do , and what John McCain would do if he were president ?
BLUNT : Well , I think what John McCain wants to do is continue these pro-growth tax policies that our friends on the other side have been talking for sixteen months now …
BLITZER : But that 's what President Bush wants to do too .
BLUNT : And there is nothing wrong with that .
There is nothing wrong with that .
BLITZER : So it would be in effect a third Bush term when it came to pro-growth tax policies ?
BLUNT : It would be .
I think it would be .
And I think that 's a good thing .
You can't go out in the country anywhere and find people who believe that doubling the capital gains rate is a good thing , that raising the highest rate on every small business in America is a good thing , that eliminating those bottom brackets , that mean that people at the lower levels of tax pay less taxes than they would otherwise .
In fact , I think one of the reasons that the economy has slowed down the way it has is the fact that there 's great uncertainty about how those tax policies move forward .

BLITZER : Do you want to respond to that ?
VAN HOLLEN : Sure .
Look , I mean , the Bush economic policies have helped drive this economy into a ditch .
The economy has lost $ 260,000 in the first four months of this year .
And John McCain ...
BLITZER : 260,000 jobs .
VAN HOLLEN : Jobs in the first four months .
And John McCain does represent a continuation of the Bush economic policy , as Roy just acknowledged .
And the fact of the matter is , people are hurting .
The one thing this president does n't understand and John McCain does n't understand is the economic squeeze the families around the country are feeling .
And when it comes to Iraq , again , this is a continuation of the Bush policy .
So on the two biggest issues on the agenda today , the war in Iraq and the economy , he represents a continuation of George Bush .
Demos below !
As a sort - of reverse birthday present I ’ve decided to release one of my largest projects , in recent memory .
This is the project that I ’ve been alluding to for quite some time now :
I ’ve ported the Processing visualization language to JavaScript , using the Canvas element .
I ’ve been working on this project , off - and - on now , for the past 7 months – it ’s been a fun , and quite rewarding , challenge .
The full scope of the project can be broken down into two portions :
The Processing Language
The first portion of the project was writing a parser to dynamically convert code written in the Processing language , to JavaScript .
This involves a lot of gnarly regular expressions chewing up the code , spitting it out in a format that the browser understands .
It works “ fairly well ” ( in that it ’s able to handle anything that the processing .org web site throws at it ) but I ’m sure its total scope is limited ( until a proper parser is involved ) .
I felt bad about tackling this using regular expressions until I found out that the original Processing code base did it in the same manner ( they now use a real parser , naturally ) .
The language includes a number of interesting aspects , many of which are covered in the basic demos .
Here ’s a brief selection of language features that are handled :
Types and type casting – Type information is generally discarded , but becomes important in variable declaration and in casting ( which is generally handled well ) .

Classes –

Method overloading and multiple constructors – Within classes you can have multiple method ( or constructor ) definitions – with the appropriate methods being called , based upon their signature length .
– Within classes you can have multiple method ( or constructor ) definitions – with the appropriate methods being called , based upon their signature length .
Inheritance – Even classical - style inheritance is supported .
Note :
There ’s one feature of Processing that ’s pretty much impossible to support : variable name overloading .
In Processing you can have variables and functions that have the same name ( e.g. float size = 0 ; float size ( ) {} ) .
In order to support this there would have to be considerable overhead – and it ’s generally not a good practice to begin with .
If you ’re curious as to what the language looks like , here ’s a basic example of inheritance :
class Spin { float x , y , speed ; float angle = 0.0 ; Spin( float xpos , float ypos , float s ) { x = xpos ; y = ypos ; speed = s ; } void update ( ) { angle += speed ; } } class SpinArm extends Spin { SpinArm ( float x , float y , float s ) { super( x , y , s ) ; } void display ( ) { strokeWeight ( 1 ) ; stroke ( 0 ) ; pushMatrix ( ) ; translate( x , y ) ; angle += speed ; rotate ( angle ) ; line ( 0 , 0 , 66 , 0 ) ; popMatrix ( ) ; } }
The Processing API
The second portion of the project is the full 2d Processing API .
This includes all sorts of different methods :
Shapes drawing
Canvas manipulation
Pixel utilities
Image drawing
Math functions
Keyboard and mouse access
Objects ( point , arrays , random number generators )
Color manipulation
Font selection and text drawing
Buffers
Most of these are demonstrated in the basic demos .
There ’s pretty - good coverage of the Processing API : there ’s sure to be many gaps , but most of what I can throw at it works .
Download
The full source code is contained within a single file .
It comes in at about 5000 lines , compresses down to less than 10kb .
How to Use
The API is quite simple – there ’s a single method “ Processing ” .
If you wish to only use the Processing API ( not the language ) you can interact with it like so :
var p = Processing ( CanvasElement ) ; p.size ( 100 , 100 ) ; p.background(0 ) ; p.fill ( 255 ) ; p.ellipse ( 50 , 50 , 50 , 50 ) ;
If you wish to have the full power of the language , as well , you would pass in your Processing code as the second argument .
Processing ( CanvasElement , " size ( 100 , 100 ) ; background ( 0 ) ; " + " fill ( 255 ) ; ellipse ( 50 , 50 , 50 , 50 ) ; " ) ;
That ’s really all there is to it .
Information on the full Processing API can be found on the Processing .org web site .
Important : Browser Support
Before we get into the demos I want to outline what some of my goal was for this project .
First , and foremost , I wanted to try and get the best Canvas - based demos out of a browser , as possible .
This meant that I had to shoot directly for the latest , and greatest , browsers .
I needed good Canvas API support and , importantly , I needed speed .
Because of this , for this first release , I ’ve specifically targeted Firefox 3 , the latest WebKit Nightly , and Opera 9.5 .
In other words : beta browsers .
A large part of the code base is sure to work in “ older ” browsers ( Firefox 2 , Safari 3 , Opera 9 , and IE with excanvas ) – but that was n’t my target platform .
I wanted something that would be capable of pushing the edge of what a browser is able to render – giving them something to strive for in their upcoming releases .
There were a couple of stumbling blocks that the above browsers hit :
Image loading – Currently , only Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 , and Safari 3.1 handle this reliably .
Pixel processing – Loading pixel data from images , manipulating them , and putting them back on the canvas .
Only Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 , and WebKit Nightlies can handle this sufficiently .
Font loading and text rendering –
The specification for this is still in the works , currently only Firefox 3 has support for this .
Thus , anything outside of the above ( images , pixel processing , and text ) should work “ ok ” everywhere .
Demos
NOTE : I highly recommend that you use the latest Firefox 3 beta to view the demos .
Most will work in the latest WebKit Nightly and a majority will work in Opera 9.5 , but all will work in Firefox 3 .
Note again : A lot of these demos will peg your CPU .
As I mentioned above , I ’m trying to squeeze the most out of the browser , as possible – be ready for it !
What would the release be without a ton of demos ?
In development I worked in a backwards manner .
Instead of building the API up from the ground – I worked from the top , down , implementing enough of the API to get individual demos working .
The result of this is two - fold : 1 ) It made for a very rewarding development process – and guaranteed working demos and 2 )
It means that there are still portions of the Processing API left unimplemented .
Regardless – enough of the API has been implemented to allow all of the demos , available on processing .org , to work as best as possible .
Here ’s the full break - down of demos that are available :
I ’ve gone through and cherry - picked a bunch that I really liked – in case you ’re interested in seeing some really interesting ones .
Wherever possible I specify what browsers the demos work in ( if none is specified , then it should work in all ) .
All of the following demos were written by Casey Reas and Ben Fry unless otherwise stated .
All of the following demos were written by Casey Reas and Ben Fry unless otherwise stated .
I ’m quite curious to see what people construct with this new API .
I think it holds a lot of potential and I ’m excited to see what comes of it !
Enjoy !
Remember : You should be using Firefox 3 , a WebKit Nightly ( Safari 3.1 is missing some features ) , or Opera 9.5 – the above demos generally work best in those browsers .

It is fairly obvious that web site performance can be increased by making the code run faster and optimising the response time .
But that only scales up to a point .
To really take our web sites to the next level , we need to look at the performance problem from a different angle .
How much can you handle ?
Although an average web server is able to process a few thousand requests per second , the number of requests it can actually handle at the same time is severely limited .
Here are some simple figures :
With sufficient network bandwidth from the datacentre to the world , an average web server could execute several thousand requests per second , depending on the average size of the response .
However , servers like IIS and Apache allocate a thread to execute each individual request .
Although a single thread is lightweight by nature , four or five hundred concurrent threads are quite a hit on the operating system resources .
So those web servers can actually execute only at most a few hundred requests at the same time .
The actual limit might be lower than you think : by default , a single IIS 6 process creates only up to four threads per processor .
You can increase the limit in the registry , but Microsoft suggests to leave it below 20 .
With a really cool eight core system , this still gives you only 160 concurrent requests .
If the requests share other pooled resources , such as database connections , the number becomes even lower .
Database connections are split across the whole server farm , so it is most likely that a single web server will have something in order of magnitude of tens available connections in a pool .
So , the number of concurrently running requests per server is most likely to be in the order of tens or hundreds .
To squeeze the most of a single machine , we need to avoid that bottleneck and make the requests as fast as possible .
One way , that should not be overlooked , is to optimise the code and make each request do its job faster and release critical resources such as database connections as soon as possible .
But that only scales up to a point .
The key to solve this problem lies in the classical definition of speed .
In Physics , speed is defined as the distance divided by time required to cross that distance .
So we can make the requests run faster either by decreasing the time , but we can also do it by shortening the distance .
Instead of doing the whole thing quicker , we need to look into reducing the amount of work that a single request has to do .
Technically , this comes down to drawing the line between what is processed synchronously ( inside the request ) and asynchronously ( in the background ) to complete the request workflow .
Clever choice of asynchronous processing is definitely one of the most important decisions in any enterprise system .
This is especially true for Web sites , where it absolutely plays a key role .
Here are a few ideas to think about when deciding how to split the work .
Delegate all long operations to a background process
Never ever talk to an external system synchronously , no matter how fast it is
Be lazy – if something does not have to be processed now , leave it for later
Idea # 1 : Delegate all long operations to a background process
Web servers are typically configured to kill a request if it takes too long , and production servers often have much less tolerance for sluggish processing than development machines .
If you get the urge to re-configure the web server in order to complete some processing , resist it by all means .
The time limit is imposed for a good reason – web requests are really not suitable for longer operations .
They take up scarce system resources and long request really became a point of contention for the system .
A few long - running requests can slow everything down , not because they themselves are draining CPU or memory power , but because they hold on to important resources and make other requests wait for them .
Also , web requests are not guaranteed to complete correctly .
A server can kill the request because of a timeout .
A user can also just close the window and interrupt the workflow , without sending any notification to the server .
It is miles better to just enqueue longer requests and take care of it from a background processing queue .
The web response can complete the active database transaction , release system resources and return to the caller .
Background services are much more robust and reliable than web requests , and they should execute long - running operations .
The browser can poll the web server every few seconds and just check the status of the operation .
If the user closes the browser , the operation still gets processed correctly .
If the remote server is temporarily down , the background service can reprocess the request after a few minutes .
You can cluster background servers and load balance longer operations .
This kind of asynchronous processing is much more robust and will allow you to scale the system much easier .
Clearly isolating longer operations will make sure that a few long actions do not block thousands of quick ones .
Idea # 2 : Never ever talk to an external system synchronously , no matter how fast it is
A common issue with external systems and synchronous communication is underestimating the latency .
Talking about designing scalable systems , Dan Pritchett from Ebay pointed out that “ One of the underlying principles is assuming high latency , not low latency .
An architecture that is tolerant of high latency will operate perfectly well with low latency , but the opposite is never true . ”
Anything that goes out of the internal network should be handled asynchronously .
This rule of thumb should really be common sense by now , but I still see it violated very often .
If you process credit cards using an external payment provider , for the love of God do not try to authorise the transaction from the web response .
Do not do this even if the processor is really fast .
The server might work OK at the moment , but in a 24/ 7 environment , over the course of a few months , you have to expect that there will be remote connectivity problems .
Network connections can fail , servers can start timing out and the poor users that are caught in the requests will be left hanging .
Most web servers process requests from the same session in a sequence , so the user will not be able to make a new request to the server while one of his requests is blocked , even from a different tab .
To do anything useful , the user will have to close the browser and log in again .
And , as the processing is caught in a blocked request , you will have no idea what actually happened .
Whenever I hear about transactions getting “ stuck ” , it is most likely because of synchronous communication to an external server .
The payment provider might charge the user ’s account but your server might not actually record that the money arrived on your end .
Domain Driven Design suggests using aggregates as boundaries for synchronous processing .
It would be very hard to convince anyone that your web server and the payment processor are parts of the same aggregate , regardless of how you structure the application .
Idea # 3 : Be lazy – if something does not have to be processed now , leave it for later
The CAP theorem coined by Dr. Eric A. Brewer in ‘ 98 says that any system can have at most two from the following group of properties : Consistency , Availability , tolerance to network Partitioning .
As the number of users grows , availability and partitioning become much more important than consistency .
By ( temporarily ) giving up on consistency , we can make the system much faster and much better scalable .
Gregor Hohpe wrote a really nice article on this subject in 2004 , called “ Starbucks Does Not Use Two - Phase Commit ” .
I strongly suggest reading it if you have not already done so .
Web applications often try to do too much at the same time .
When an application needs to serve 20 or 30 thousand users over a month , doing too much might not be seen as a problem at all .
But once the user base grows to a few hundred thousand , behaving lazy will significantly improve scalability .
Think really hard about things that do not really have to be processed instantly .
Break down the process and see if something can be postponed for later , even if it may cause slight problems .
Anything that is not likely to generate a lot of problems , and the problems it causes can be easily fixed later , is a good candidate for taking out of the critical path .
My rule of thumb to check what can be left out of the primary request workflow is to ask what is the worst thing that can happen if things go bad , and how frequently can we expect that .
I ’ll use an online bookstore again as an example : a shopping cart checkout request should theoretically check whether the book is in stock , authorise the payment , remove a copy of the book from the available stock , create an order item in the database and send it to the shipping department .
New payment industry standards , such as Verified by VISA , make it hard to process the payment offline .
However , checking and modifying the stock can safely be left for later .
What is the worst thing that can happen if things go wrong ?
We run out of stock and over - sell a bit .
We can notify the user about a slight delay , reorder the book and ship it a few days later .
Alternatively , the user could cancel the order and get the money back ( if the transaction was just authorised and not captured , the money will never be taken from them in the first place ) .
How frequently will this happen ?
Not a lot , since the bookstore should manage stock levels pro-actively .
In this case , the request can just authorise the payment and put the shopping cart into a background queue .
We can process the requests in the queue overnight , when the system is not under a heavy load .
By avoiding to use a shared resource ( stock ) we avoid both the contention and simplify the request workflow .
' Barack 's voice was just like his father 's - I thought he had come back from the dead '
As Lake Victoria disappeared to the south , the road rose and fell , winding gently through the boulder - strewn hills of far western Kenya .
Men rode heavy single - speed bicycles with sacks of charcoal strapped to the back ; women walked , buckets of bananas balanced perfectly on their heads .
Where a sign pointed the route to the Senator Obama Secondary School - Motto : Endeavour to excel - the asphalt gave way to bumpy red dirt .
An American flag hung in front of the New Apostolic Church , providing a further clue to the identity of the village 's favourite son .
A few miles further on , an 86 - year - old woman sat on a plastic chair under a mango tree outside her simple three - bedroom house with a pale - blue corrugated iron roof .
Television crews waited their turn to interview her .
As chickens squawked , and cows grazed nearby , Sarah Obama appeared perplexed as to what the media fuss was all about .
" It 's just a job , a government job , " said " Mama Sarah " , step - grandmother of the man who this week became the Democratic candidate in the US presidential race , during a recent visit .
" I am not going to make a big deal out of it or pretend that it 's anything really great . "
Her comments would surely amuse Barack Obama , who first met his " granny " in his 20s when he came to Kenya in search of his roots .
For while they show a refreshing modesty and honesty in a presidential campaign full of hyperbole , they also hint at the distance travelled by the Obama family over just three generations .
The story begins a few metres away from where Mama Sarah was sitting .
There , an unpainted concrete headstone marks the resting place of her husband , Hussein Onyango Obama , herbalist , farmer and village elder .
As Mama Sarah recounted in Barack Obama 's 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father , Hussein was one of the first people in the village to wear trousers and a shirt rather than the traditional goatskin .
As a restless young man - " it is said of him that he had ants in his anus " , in Mama Sarah 's words - Hussein learned to read and write English , and walked for two weeks to the capital , Nairobi , where he found work as a cook and housekeeper for British settler families .
After his first wife , Helima , discovered she could not bear children , Hussein outbid another man for the hand of a beautiful young woman called Akumu , paying her father a dowry of 15 cattle .
They had two daughters and a son , Barack Obama Sr. But Hussein 's harsh , even abusive , manner - his grandchildren would later refer to him only half jokingly as " the Terror " - and his constant demands for a spotless house , drove Akumu to leave .
Mama Sarah , Hussein 's third wife and decades his junior , raised Akumu 's children alongside her own .
By then , Barack Obama
Sr was nine , and already showing the same stubborn , independent streak .
" He refused to go to the local school , where the teacher was a woman , " said Mama Sarah .
" When the pupils were naughty , they would get spanked .
He told me ' I 'm not going to be spanked by a woman . ' "
Instead , Obama
Sr enrolled at a primary school six miles away .
Though he often bunked lessons when Mama Sarah did not give him a lift all the way on her bicycle , he still came top of his class .
His marks earned him a rare place at secondary school , but he was soon expelled for bad behaviour .
Hussein , who served as a cook in the British army in Burma during the second world war , and was later detained by the colonial administration in Kenya in the lead up to independence , was livid with his son , believing he had thrown away the one opportunity to better himself .
" When my husband heard later that Barack [ Obama Sr ] wanted to study in America , he said it was impossible as there was no money , " said Mama Sarah .
" But Barack told him he would manage it on his own . "
Obama
Sr moved to Nairobi , where he took a correspondence course to complete his schooling , studying at night while working as an office clerk by day .
He wrote to dozens of US universities .
The University of Hawaii replied , offering him a scholarship .
Leaving behind his infant son , Roy , and his young wife , Kezia , who was pregnant with their daughter , Auma , he flew to America .
Being the university 's first African student did not discourage him .
He graduated top of his economics class .
He married a white student from Kansas , Ann Dunham , and they had a son , who he gave his full name : Barack Hussein Obama .
Obama
Sr continued his studies at Harvard , but his marriage soon faltered .
When he returned to Nairobi a few years later it was with a different white American woman , Ruth .
Together , they had two children .
But Obama
Sr was still seeing his first wife , Kezia , on the side , and she bore him two more sons .
Later , as ethnic rivalries hampered his career as a senior government official - the Obamas are Luo , while the government was largely Kikuyu - dominated - and as he increasingly turned to drink , he had an eighth child by another Kenyan woman .
The Obama siblings in Kenya grew up hearing stories from their father about their half - brother who remained in America , a boy they knew as " Barry " .
" That 's what my father always called him in front of us , " said Auma Obama , a no -nonsense woman who returned to Kenya last year from the UK , where she ran a children 's trust .
" When I finally got to meet Barack in America , the first thing he told me was : ' Do n't call me Barry !
My name is Barack ! ' "
A few years after that meeting in 1987 , Barack made his first trip to Kenya , travelling to the village in Kogelo that his siblings had always called " Home Squared " : their second home .
There , next to the headstone of his grandfather Hussein , he found the grave of his father , who had died in a car accident five years earlier .
Since Barack had never learned Luo , and Mama Sarah speaks no English , they could not communicate directly .
Still , she knew immediately that this was the son of the boy that she had helped raise .
" Barack 's voice was exactly like his father 's .
It made me think that his father had come back from the dead . "
In the 1990s , Barack travelled to Kenya again , this time with his fiancee Michelle , to introduce her to his Kenyan relatives .
When he returned in 2006 , by which time there was talk of him being America 's first black head of state , he received a presidential - style welcome , with thousands turning out to see him .
Since then the path to Mama Sarah 's home has become well trodden by local and foreign journalists , usually arriving unannounced with satellite dishes and cameras in tow .
She has received them happily , inviting them into her living room , which is decorated with family pictures , including one of Barack carrying a sack of vegetables beside her .
But by January , with the primaries in full swing , the intrusion had become too much , even for a woman who still tends her crops of maize , sweet potatoes , beans and cassava for several hours a day and only recently stopped riding a bicycle .
Her son , Said , a genial man who lives in the lakeside town of Kisumu , 90 minutes ' drive away , now regulates media access , together with Auma , who works for an international charity based in Nairobi .
Most of Barack 's other half - siblings live abroad .
" Though we had a family meeting to discuss the implications for us all in Kenya before Barack announced he would run for president , we did not imagine it would ever become this big , " said Auma , who helped out on the Obama campaign in the US in December and January .
She keeps in close contact with Barack 's media team , regularly discussing " campaign strategy and how to handle certain questions " about the family 's past .
One particularly thorny area that is bound to resurface in coming months is religion .
Hussein converted to Islam , and Mama Sarah calls herself a Muslim , even though she wears her faith lightly .
A photograph circulated in the US earlier this year , which showed Barack wearing customary Somali dress bestowed upon him by local elders during his Kenyan visit in 2006 , was seen by many Democrats as an attempt to smear Obama by suggesting he was not a Christian .
" Things are dwelt on that in our family are non-issues , " said Auma .
" His [ Barack 's ] father was never a Muslim although he was born into a Muslim family with a Muslim name .
He [ Barack ] himself was never a Muslim . "
There have also been insinuations that Barack has somehow neglected Mama Sarah , as she does not have access to mains electricity or running water .
Yet she has solar power , a water pump in the garden and a solid , brick house , making her far better off than most people in the area .
And though she recently received a 21 - inch flatscreen television from friends so that she could follow the presidential campaign , one sensed she would have been equally content listening to the news on local radio .
Yes , she will attend the presidential inauguration , if it comes to that , she said , but nobody should expect her to live in America or change her lifestyle .
" What should I do ? " she said with a laugh .
" Become a young woman and start all over again ? "

ERIE , Pa.  Cormac McCarthy ’s Pulitzer Prize - winning novel , “ The Road , ” takes place in a world that , because of some unexplained catastrophe , has just about ended .
The sky is gray , the rivers are black , and color is just a memory .
The landscape is covered in ash , with soot falling perpetually from the air .
The cities are blasted and abandoned .
The roads are littered with corpses either charred or melted , their dreams , Mr. McCarthy writes , “ ensepulchred within their crozzled hearts . ”
For the crew that has just finished filming the movie version of “ The Road ”  a joint production of 2929 and Bob Weinstein ’s Dimension Films , set to open in November  that meant an upending of the usual rules of making a movie on location .
Bad weather was good and good weather bad .
“ A little fog , a little drizzle  those are the good days , ” Mark Forker , the movie ’s director of special effects , remarked one morning in late April while the crew was shooting some of the final scenes in the book on a stretch of scraggly duneland by the shore of Lake Erie here .
“ Today is a bad day , ” he added , shaking his head and squinting .
The sky was blue , the sun so bright that crew members were smearing on sunscreen .
A breeze was carrying away the fog pumping feebly from a smoke machine .
Even worse , green grass was sprouting everywhere , and there were buds on the trees .
Some of the crew had hand - stripped a little sapling of greenery , but the rest of the job would have to be done electronically by Mr. Forker , who was also in charge of sky replacement .
“ The Road ” began filming in late February , mostly in and around Pittsburgh , with a later stop in New Orleans and a postproduction visit planned to Mount St. Helens .
The producers chose Pennsylvania , one of them , Nick Wechsler , explained , because it ’s one of the many states that give tax breaks and rebates to film companies and , not incidentally , because it offered such a pleasing array of post - apocalyptic scenery : deserted coalfields , run-down parts of Pittsburgh , windswept dunes .
Chris Kennedy , the production designer , even discovered a burned - down amusement park in Lake Conneaut and an eight - mile stretch of abandoned freeway , complete with tunnel , ideal for filming the scene where the father and son who are the story ’s main characters are stalked by a cannibalistic gang traveling by truck .
I spent 4 hours chatting with my grandmother in - law last night .
She ’s 79 years old and chock full of 79 years worth of wisdom and life stories .
One of the stories she told me really grabbed my attention .
It was about the power of true friendship and why real friends always maintain a unique connection even in each other ’s prolonged absence .
The story went something like this …
I grew up in Jamaica Plain , an urban community located on the outskirts of Boston , Massachusetts .
In the 1940 ’s it was a wholesome , quaint little community .
It was my home and I loved it there , back then I thought I would never leave .
My best friend Rose and I used to collectively dream about raising a family of our own someday .
We had it all planned out to live next door to one another .
Our dream remained alive through grade school , high school , and even beyond .
Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life , Dick .
Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married , thus bringing us closer to our dream .
Meanwhile , Dick aspired to be an Officer in the Marines and I fully supported his ambitions .
I realized that he might be stationed far away from Jamaica Plain , but I told him I would relocate and adjust .
The idea of experiencing new places together seemed somewhat romantic to me .
So , in 1955 Dick was stationed in Alaska and we relocated .
Rose was sad to see me leave , but wished me the best of luck .
Rose and I remained in touch for a few years via periodic phone calls , but after awhile we lost track of one another .
Back in the 1950 ’s it was a lot more difficult to stay in touch with someone over a long distance , especially if you were relocating every few years .
There were no email addresses or transferable phone numbers , and directory lookup services were mediocre at best .
I thought of her several times over the years .
Once in the mid 1960 ’s when I was visiting the Greater Boston area I tried to determine her whereabouts , but my search turned up empty handed .
Jamaica Plain had changed drastically in the 10 years I was gone .
A pretty obvious shift in income demographics was affecting my old neighborhood .
My family had moved out of the area , as did many of the people I used to know .
Rose was nowhere to be found .
52 years passed and we never spoke .
I ’ve since raised a family of 5 , all of whom now have families of their own , and Dick passed away a few years ago …
God rest his soul .
Basically , a lifetime has passed .
Now here I am at the doorstep to my 80th birthday and I receive a random phone call on an idle Wednesday afternoon .
“ Hello ” , I said .
“ Hi Natalie , its Rose . ” the voice on the other end replied .
“ It ’s been so long .
I do n’t know if you remember me , but we used to be best friends in Jamaica Plain when we were kids . ” she said .
We have n’t seen each other yet , but we have spent countless hours on the phone catching up on 52 years of our lives .
The interesting thing is that even after 52 years of separation our personalities and interests are still extremely similar .
We both share a passion for several hobbies that we each picked up independently several years after we lost touch with one another .
It almost feels like we are picking up right where we left off , which is really strange considering the circumstances .
Her husband passed away a few years ago as well , but she mailed me several photographs of her family that were taken over the years .
It ’s so crazy , just looking that the photos and listening to her describe her family reminds me of my own ; a reasonably large , healthy family .
Part of me feels like we led fairly similar lives .
I do n’t think the numerous similarities between our two lives are a coincidence either .
I think it shows that we did n’t just call each other best friends , we truly were best friends , and even now we can be best friends again .
Real friends have 2 things in common : a compatible personality and a strong - willed character .
The compatible personality is what initiates the connection between 2 people and a strong - willed character at both ends is what maintains the connection .
If those 2 ingredients are present in a friendship , the friendship is for real , and can thus sustain the tests of time and prolonged absence without faltering .
Many people , like myself , have recently graduated from college .
At this point , one might feel some confusion as to a lack of direction in life , reduced importance of your roles , or a number of other feelings and emotions surrounding the large transition from life at University to the “ real world . ”
One thing that myself ( along with just about any financial adviser ) would recommend , is investing now for later on .
Two different time frames can be taken that benefit the majority of young investors : short - and long - term .
First , you can invest for a down payment on a house .
It is a short term investment that will only last a few years , but it can significantly reduce monthly payments on a home .
Roth IRAs can be dipped into for a first - time home buyer if the account has been opened for 5 years .
These gains , as in retirement , would be tax free ( contributions are post - tax dollars , as usual ) .
The second time frame is long - term–specifically for retirement .
The key idea here is the added effect of the time value of money .
Adding even small contributions early to an IRA , or other retirement account , can increase growth and reduce the need for contributions later on .
Investors right out of college should decide what works for them .
Another question they may have is what to invest in .
Many 401 ks have a limited number of choices that employees may choose , but also for those with IRAs , Roth IRAs , or taxable accounts , investors will want to choose the cheapest investments with the maximum return .
Some of these investments include :
Exchange - Traded Funds ( ETFs ) that track major indexes , and
Mutual Funds with low fees and expenses that are passed on to investors .
There are others , but there are a number of recommendations from experts ( Rich Karlgaard at Forbes , Warren Buffett , and the Financial Times ) that say index - based investing is as good as using many of the best professional investors .
Specifically , Buffett says ,
I would just have it all in a very low - cost index fund from a reputable firm , maybe Vanguard .
Unless
I bought during a strong bull market , I would feel confident that I would outperform … and I could just go back and get on with my work .
Buffett is a pretty good person to be making an investment recommendation .
If the professionals consistently under perform major averages , why not take advantage of cheap diversification , which can lead to real rewards ?
The truth is , one can set their own strategy and gain effective diversification and portfolio allocation through the use of ETFs and low cost Mutual Funds .
In a great article from Investors Chronicle , the author details a number of mistakes investors make , and how they can take a “ lazy ” route to proper diversification and portfolio allocation .
This greatly reduces the risk involved in strategies recommended by the Jim Cramers of the world .
One example of this is his five - stock diversification .
While a relatively low level of diversification has been empirically shown to be effective diversification , closely researching five or more stocks and staying on top of their developments ( Cramer recommends at least one hour per week of research , per stock ) can add quite a bit of risk with busy young professionals who may not be able to handle thinking about investments after a busy day at work .
It may not even be effective diversification at that point , because the investor will not be able to monitor their specific stocks .
On the other hand , investing in products that automatically re-allocate themselves saves time and investment costs .
As Buffett said , “ I would feel confident that I would outperform … and I could just go back and get on with my work . ”
It is important to scrounge up what ever you have now–even a couple hundred dollars of graduation money–and invest it in an account for later on ( well , pay down any credit card debt first ) .
Also , if the company you are going to work for has a 401k , enroll as soon as possible to take advantage of your employer ’s contribution .
Not saving now will only make it longer until you make your first $ 100,000 , or million !

The Czech PM said he would not bet much on a Czech ' Yes '
EU leaders have admitted that the Czech Republic may not be able to ratify the Lisbon Treaty , which has already been rejected by the Irish .
The declaration from their summit in Brussels notes that the Czech process is on hold due to legal difficulties .
But they said ratification would continue elsewhere , and ruled out renegotiation of the treaty .
But British PM Gordon Brown said the UK could not definitively ratify it until a court ruled on a legal challenge .
It followed a warning from a judge in the case that ratification should be delayed until the ruling was in .
The treaty passed through British parliament this week , but has still to complete formal ratification .
Mr Brown said the judge 's intervention would not affect the process , which would not have been completed until after the court judgement anyway .
Bets off
The Brussels summit has been overshadowed by the Irish result , despite efforts to concentrate on food and fuel prices , and now the Czech threat hangs over the treaty .
The EU declaration noted that : " The Czech Republic cannot complete their ratification process until the constitutional court delivers its positive opinion on the accordance of the Lisbon Treaty with the Czech constitutional order " .
The Czech parliament 's ratification was suspended after the Senate demanded that the court rule on its constitutionality .
The Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said at the summit that he was not going to try to halt the ratification process in his country .
But he added : " I am not going to force MPs to back Lisbon and I would n't bet 100 crowns ( £ 3 , $ 6 ) on a Czech ' Yes ' . "

Presidency Conclusions 19 -20 JUNE 2008 [ 1.5MB ]

The Czech President , Vaclav Klaus , said after the Irish vote that it had killed off the treaty .
With growing opposition from Euro - sceptics , and key elections due in October , the future of the treaty in the Czech Republic looks uncertain , says the BBC's Oana Lungescu at the summit in Brussels .
' Not just for fun '
The issue has obstructed attempts to get a common position in Brussels - that ratification should continue , while the Irish government takes time to consider its next step .
But President Sarkozy said EU leaders had decided that : " The treaty ratification process should continue in all member states , that 's the position now of the council . "
" Ireland is a problem , but if we have a second or third problem then it 's really going to get difficult , " he added .
The treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states to take effect .
Nineteen have approved it so far .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso ruled out renegotiating the reform treaty .
" When a treaty is signed by 27 governments it 's not just for fun , " he said .
" It 's inconceivable that a government signs a treaty without the intention of ratifying it .
It 's a principle of international law . "
Mr Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the European Union would not be able to expand further without ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , in what correspondents said appeared to be an attempt to lean on the Czechs , as well as Poland , who are keen on eastward expansion .
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk rejected that stance as " unacceptable " .
Friday 's declaration made reference to several other matters , not least the soaring fuel and food prices that have hit consumers and sparked protests across Europe .
EU leaders :
( Fortune Magazine ) --
What goes up must come down .
It 's a law of CEO physics .
Every year a few star bosses succumb to it and lose their jobs .
Most reemerge smoothly a few years later with a new job , an investment fund , or a philanthropy project .
But whether it's out of shame or an optimistic focus on the future , few ever discuss what it 's like - for a CEO , a spouse , or even the CEO 's kids - to survive the fall from a corporate pinnacle .
In mid-May , Fortune lured three of these former chiefs to Manhattan to trade insights on some of their bumpy moments at the top and on what came after .
Jim Donald , who spent most of his career in the grocery industry ( including three years building Wal - Mart 's supercenter business ) , enjoyed two smooth years as CEO of Starbucks , perking up the company 's share price from $ 26 to $ 39 .
But when sales sagged and the stock dropped by nearly half in 2007 , Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz fired Donald , now 54 , and reinstalled himself as chief executive .
Another onetime highflier , Ed Zander , 61 , went from No. 2 at Sun Microsystems to CEO of Motorola in 2004 .
He made the RAZR the best selling cell phone in history , then fumbled the follow - up .
Profits collapsed , as did Motorola 's stock price , and Carl Icahn began agitating for change .
Zander stepped down at the end of 2007 .
Both Zander and Donald were noticeably anxious when we convened on May 14 .
The third participant , David Neeleman , did n't seem nervous at all .
Neeleman is the freewheeling entrepreneur who in just eight years built JetBlue into the eighth - largest U.S. airline and a model of innovation and customer service .
At least that 's how it was seen until a 2007 ice storm pounded JetBlue 's reputation and Neeleman 's career .
The board replaced him as CEO , though he remained chairman until this May .
Neeleman , as we 'll see , is the only one of the three who has decided on his next chapter .
But all three had plenty to say about their lives at - and after - the top .
Describe your last job - in a sentence .
Neeleman :
When we started flying , oil and gasoline was 70 cents a gallon .
Today it 's $ 3.50 .
We burn half - a- billion gallons of the stuff every year .
In a sentence , it was a wild ride .
An absolutely crazy , wild ride .
Zander :
That 's a paragraph !
Ed , your run , in a sentence ?
Zander : Fun , lots of fun .
I 'd do it again in a second .
Hard .
Hard and challenging , probably the toughest job I 've ever had .
Donald :
We went from 4,000 stores to 16,000 stores , from 20 countries to 40 countries .
The sentence would be : Working for the Starbucks employees is a very humbling experience .
You were all hotshots who stumbled .
What might you have done differently to prevent it ?
Neeleman :
We were like a frog that got boiled one degree at a time by rising oil prices .
We had a board member who , when oil got to $ 50 a barrel , said , " Do n't hedge , it 's going back down to $ 25 . "
And you believed him .
Neeleman :
They seemed to know what they were talking about .
The second thing is - and I realize it now that I 'm a board member , looking at the company through this little hole once a quarter at a four - hour meeting - board members do n't know that much about the company .
They really do n't .
I would 've been much more engaged with the board .
After the February storm , I was so busy trying to hire a new COO , get someone at Kennedy Airport , do all these things , that I did n't have time to update the board on everything .
If you do n't , somebody else will .
You have to be able to give them an accurate picture of what 's going on , or they develop their own perceptions and start creating their own stories .
And then they make their decisions .
How do you keep these people up to date and give them the whole picture ?
That 's the job of the CEO , and I failed .
Donald : I made it a habit of every other week updating the board through an e-mail on revenue , any store openings , any issues around the world .
Neeleman :
When things start going south , communication should increase .
Even if you think you 're doing enough , you 're not doing enough .
I did n't do a good enough job because [ board members ] developed their own perceptions of where things were headed .
Zander : I had kind of a Jekyll - and - Hyde situation .
I had three marvelous years - I could almost do no wrong .
The last year , the problems were in one division , the mobile - cell phone division .
As it came around in 2007 , we were n't ready .
There was a bust in the software platform .
We missed execution in our products .
When you do n't have the products to put on AT&T and Verizon and Vodafone 's shelf , you 're going to pay the price , because it 's a very , very punishing market .
What could you have done differently , Jim ?
Donald :
My worst decision was not investing earlier in international .
The international markets do n't have as quick returns as the U.S.
But if I 'd known the U.S. economy was going to crash , I would have invested earlier .
If we 're talking woulda , coulda , shoulda , what would you say , Ed ?
Zander : I go back , and the big thing was people .
I did n't move fast enough on some people .
I know it sounds trite , but as a CEO , you can't design a cell phone .
It 's the people you hire .
You always talk to CEOs and they always tell you that when you come in , you 've got to move fast on people .
And there 's some truth to that .
I took a different approach at Motorola .
When I first got there , I moved fast on a few people , promoted a few from within , and waited , and actually got some real stars from the people that I looked at .
But in the case of the mobile business , I think there had to be some changes made quicker .
One or two that I missed really cost me .
Ed , did you handle Carl Icahn as well as you could have ?
Zander : Look , activists are part of , it seems , today 's business world and more so than in the past .
And they 're shareholders , and you have to treat them as shareholders .
I would say that it is distracting .
I spent a good amount of time trying to fix some of the business , spending a lot of time with that proxy battle .
But you 've got to deal with it and move on .
I was taught early on - this goes back to my beginning days in the computer businesses - you build long - term value .
So to me , in driving Motorola in the good days of 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , and then the mobile division hit the wall , [ the goal ] was to keep focusing on where we had to go , what decisions I had to make , what the long - term strategy was - do n't do anything for the short - term .
And sometimes that 's painful for short - term shareholders .
In that sense , do you think that Icahn and other activists of his ilk are unhealthy for corporate America ?
Zander : I 'm going to -
Oh , come on , you 've got to go -
Zander :
No , I 'm going to stop there .
I 'm just going to say that I handled it the way I wanted to handle it , and I think the company is stronger and has a long - term strategy .
Talk about your toughest day .

THE word “ tax ” was never pretty .
But it has lately become the ugliest word in the English language , right up there with its evil twin , “ death . ”
Even in time of war , ostensibly patriotic politicians blithely pledge to slay any tax that rears its ghastly head .
Public officials dodge work they know desperately needs doing because of the possibility that it may cause an increase in taxes .
It ’s time to take a page from the conservative playbook , the one where they reframe the debate by changing the language  for instance , calling the “ estate tax ” a “ death tax , ” or making equal rights for same - sex partners a “ protection of marriage ” issue .
I propose we stop saying “ taxes ” and start calling them “ dues . ”

Yes , this is a little sneaky .
Some conservatives may even call it Orwellian , and they ought to know .
But the word “ dues ” also plays into the psychology of group identity , and that can work to the benefit of conservatives and liberals alike .
Consider that “ tax ” comes from the Latin for “ appraise ” with punitive overtones of “ censure ” or “ fault , ” as if wage - earners have done something wrong by their labors .
“ Dues , ” in contrast , is rooted in social obligation and duty .
Researchers have found a correlation between drinking diet soda and metabolic syndrome  the collection of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes that include abdominal obesity , high cholesterol and blood glucose levels , and elevated blood pressure .
The scientists gathered dietary information on more than 9,500 men and women ages 45 to 64 and tracked their health for nine years .
Over all , a Western dietary pattern  high intakes of refined grains , fried foods and red meat  was associated with an 18 percent increased risk for metabolic syndrome , while a “ prudent ” diet dominated by fruits , vegetables , fish and poultry correlated with neither an increased nor a decreased risk .
But the one - third who ate the most fried food increased their risk by 25 percent compared with the one - third who ate the least , and surprisingly , the risk of developing metabolic syndrome was 34 percent higher among those who drank one can of diet soda a day compared with those who drank none .
Lately there ’s been some interest in build processes among various people — Vellum was announced a while back , Ben has been looking for a tool and looking at Fabric , and Kevin announced Paver .
At the same time zc. buildout is starting to gain some users outside of the Zope world , and I noticed Minitage as an abstraction on top of zc.buildout .
A while ago I started working on a build project for Open Plans called fassembler .
I think the result has been fairly successful and maintainable , and I thought I ’d share some of my own reflections on that tool .
make does n’t make sense Update 2 : If you think the make model makes lots of sense , read the preceding section — it makes sense for a different problem set than what we ’re doing .
We initially had a system based on BuildIt , which is kind of like make with Python as the control code .
It was n’t really a good basis for our build tool , and I think it added a lot of confusion , compounded by the fact that we were n’t quite sure what we wanted our build to do .
Ultimately I think the make model of building does n’t make sense .
The make model is based on the idea that you really want to save work .
So you detect changes and remake things only as necessary .
For compilation this might make sense , because you edit code and recompile a lot and it ’s tedious to wait .
But we are building a website , and installing software , and none of that style of efficiency matters .
make - style detection of work to be done does n’t even save any time .
But it does make the build more fragile ( e.g. , if you define a dependency incorrectly ) and much harder to understand , and you constantly find yourself wiping the build and starting from scratch because you do n’t trust the system .
The metaphor for the new build system was much simpler : do a list of things , top to bottom .
There ’s no effort into detecting changes in the build , or changes in the settings , or anything else .
Do things carefully
In the build system almost all actions go through the filemaker module .
This is kind of a file abstraction library .
But the goals are entirely different than convenience : the goal is transparency and safety .
In contrast Paver uses path .py for convenience , but I ’m not sure what the win would be if we used a model like that .
filemaker itself is heavily tied to the framework that it ’s written for , specifically user interaction and logging .
Most tasks just do things , and rely on filemaker to detect problems and ask the user questions .
For example , every time a file is written , it checks if the file exists , and if it has the same content .
If it exists with other content , it asks the user about what to do .
It does n’t overwrites files without asking ( at least by default ) .
I think this makes the tool more humane as the default behavior for a build is to be careful and transparent .
The build author has to go out of their way to make things difficult .
Many zc.buildout recipes will blithely overwrite all sorts of files which always made me very uncomfortable with the product .
It ’s the recipes in zc. buildout which do this , not the buildout framework itself , but because buildout made overwriting the easy thing to do , and did n’t start with humane conventions or tools , this behavior is the norm .
What I think filemaker most accomplished was the ability to do file operations while also asserting the expected state of the system , and so makes build bugs noticeable earlier instead of getting a build process that finishes successfully but creates a buggy build , or having an exception show up far from where the error was originally introduced .
Also , because it wo n’t overwrite your work in progress this has saved the build from engendering deep feelings of hatred in cases when it might overwrite your work in progress .
It ’s hard to detect this absence of hatred , but I know that I ’ve felt it with other systems .
Log interesting things I tried to make a compromise between logging very verbosely , and being too quiet .
As a user , I want to see everything interesting and leave out everything boring .
Determining interesting and boring can be a bit difficult , but really just require some attention and tweaking .
To make it possible to visually parse the output of the tool I found both indentation and color to be very useful .
Indentation is used to represent subtasks , and color to make sections and warnings stand out .
The default verbosity setting is not to be completely quiet .
Silence is a Unix convention that just does n’t work for build tools .
Silence gets you interactions like this : $ build - something target - directory / ( much time passes ) Error : cannot write /home / ianb / builds/20080426/target-directory/products/AuxInput/auxinput/config/configuration.xml
Why did it want to write that file ?
Why ca n’t it write that file ?
Is the build buggy ?
Did I misconfigure it ?
Does the directory exist ?
The typical way of handling this is either to run the build again with logging setup or otherwise make it more verbose , or to get in the habit of always running it verbose .
Mixing code and configuration BuildIt , which we were using before , had the ability to put variables in settings , and you could read an option from another section with something like $ {section / option} .
It was limited to simple ( but recursive ) variable substitution , and had some clever but very confusing rules that created a kind of inheritance .
I liked the ability to do substitution , but was n’t happy with the compromise Build It made .
I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out the context of substitutions .
So , I saw two directions .
One was to remove the cleverness and just do simple substitution .
This is the choice zc. buildout made .
The other was to go whole - hog .
With a bit of trepidation I decided to to go for it , and I made the choice to treat all configuration settings as Tempita templates .
All configuration is generally accessed via config. setting_name , and that lazily interpolates the setting ( it took me quite a while to figure out how to avoid infinite loops of substitution ) .
Because evaluation is done lazily settings can depend on each other and be overridden and have lots of code in defaults ( e.g. , a default that is calculated based on the value of another setting ) , and it works out okay .
Most settings just ended up having a smart default , and as a result very little tweaking of the configuration is necessary .
Somewhat ironically the result was a kind of atrophying of the settings , because no one actually set them , instead we just tweaked the defaults to get it right .
Now I ’m not entirely sure what exactly the “ settings ” are setting , or who they should really belong to .
To the build ?
To the tasks ?
While this is conceptually confusing , in practice it is n’t so bad .
This mixing of code and configuration has been distinctly useful , and not nearly as problematic to debug as I worried it would be .
In some ways it was a way of building lambda into every string , and the lazy evaluation of those strings has been really important .
But it ’s not clear if they are really settings .
Would normal string interpolation have been enough ( e.g. , with string .
Template ) ?
I ’m pretty sure it would n’t have been .
The ability to do a little math or use functions that read things from the environment has been very important .
Managing Python libraries fassembler uses virtualenv for building each piece of the stack .
Generally it creates several environments and installs things into them — it does n’t run inside the environments itself .
This works fine .
zc.buildout in comparison does some fancy stuff to scripts where specific eggs are enabled when you run a script .
Each script has a list of all the eggs to enable .
You ca n’t install things or manage anything manually , even to test — you always have to go through buildout , and it will regenerate the scripts for you .
zc.buildout was implemented at the same time as workingenv ( the predecessor to virtualenv ) , and I actually finished virtualenv with fassembler in mind , so I ca n’t blame zc. buildout for not using virtualenv .
That said , I do n’t think the zc.buildout system makes any sense .
And it ’s really complicated and has to access all sorts of not - really - public parts of easy_install to work .
Isolation is only the start .
easy_install makes sure each library ’s claimed dependencies are satisfied .
You might then think easy_install would do all the work to make the stack work .
It is nowhere close to making the stack work .
setup.py files can / should contain the bare minimum that is known to be necessary to make a package work .
But they ca n’t predict future incompatibilities , and they ca n’t predict interactions .
And you do n’t want all your packages changing versions arbitrarily .
If you work with a lot of libraries you need those libraries to be pinned , and only update them when you want to update them , not just because an update has been released .
So for each piece of the stack we have a set of “ requirements ” .
This is a flat files that indicates all the packages to install .
They can have explicit versions , far more restrictive than anything you should put in setup.py .
It also can check out from svn , including pinning to revisions .
This installation plan can go in svn , you can do diffs on it , you can branch and copy and do whatever .
Maybe at some point we could use it to keep cached copies of the libraries .
For now it mostly uses easy_install ( and python setup. py develop for checkouts ) .
In parallel we have a command - line program for just installing packages using files like this , called PoachEggs .
I want to make this better , and have fassembler use it , but I mostly note it because it implements a feature that can “ freeze ” all your packages to a requirements file .
You take a working build and freeze its requirements , giving explicit ( == ) versions for packages , and pin all the svn checkouts to a revision , so that the frozen requirements file will install exactly the packages you know work .
An alternative to this is what the Repoze guys are doing , which is to create a custom index that only includes the versions of libraries that you want .
You then tell easy_install to use this instead of PyPI .
It works with zc.buildout ( and anything that uses easy_install ) , but I ca n’t get excited about it compared to a simple text file .
I also want svn checkouts instead of create tarballs of the checkout —
I like an editable environment , because the build is just as much to support developers as to support deployment .
The structure A big part of the development of fassembler was nailing down the structure of our site , and moving to use tools like supervisor to manage our processes .
A lot of these expectations are built into the builds and fassembler itself .
This is part of what makes the build Work — the pieces all conform to a common structure with some basic standards .
But this is n’t the build tool itself , it ’s just a set of conventions .
I do n’t know quite what to make of this .
Extracting the conventions from the builds leads to a situation where you can more easily misconfigure things , and the installation process ends up being more documentation - based instead of code - based .
We do not want to rely on documentation , because documentation is generally because of a flaw in the build process that needs explaining .
It ’s faster for everyone if the code is just right .
Maybe these conventions could be put into code , separate from the build .
The abstraction worries me , though — too much to keep track of ?
What we do n’t get right
The biggest problem is that fassembler is our own system and no one else uses it .
If someone wants to use just a piece of our stack they either have to build it manually or they have to use our system which is meant to build all our pieces together with our conventions .
There ’s some pressure to use zc.buildout to make pieces more accessible to other Zope users .
We ’ve also found things that build with zc. buildout that we ’d like to use ( e.g. , setups for varnish ) .
We have n’t figured out how to separate the code for building our stuff from the build software itself .
There ’s a bootstrapping problem : you need to get the build code to build a project , and so it ca n’t be part of the project you are building .
zc.buildout uses configuration files ( that are n’t code , so they lack the bootstrap problem ) and it uses recipes ( a kind of plugin ) and has gone to quite a bit of effort to bootstrap everything .
virtualenv also supports a kind of bootstrap which we use to do the initial setup of the environment , but it does n’t support code organization in the style of zc.buildout .
Builds are also fairly tedious to write .
They are n’t horrible , but they feel much longer than they should be .
Part of their length , though , is that over time we put in more code to guard against environment differences or build errors , and more code to detect the environment .
But compared to zc.buildout ’s configuration files , it does n’t feel quite as nice , and if it ’s not as nice sometimes people are lazy and do ad hoc setups .
Ministers are preparing to open the way for genetically modified crops to be grown in Britain on the grounds they could help combat the global food crisis .
Ministers have told The Independent that rocketing food prices and food shortages in the world 's poorest countries mean the time is right to relax Britain 's policy on use of GM crops .
Last night , the Environment minister Phil Woolas held preliminary talks with the Agricultural Biotechnology Council , an umbrella group formed in 2000 to promote the role of biotechnology in agriculture .
It is run by representatives from the companies Monsanto , Bayer CropSciences , BASF , Dow AgroSciences , Pioneer ( DuPont ) , and Syngenta .

He said : " There is a growing question of whether GM crops can help the developing world out of the current food price crisis .
It is a question that we as a nation need to ask ourselves .
The debate is already under way .
Many people concerned about poverty in the developing world and the environment are wrestling with this issue . "
He stressed that the " very robust " procedures for ensuring the safety of experiments would continue , with scientists looking at each application on its merits .
The move will anger environmental groups , who accuse the GM industry of trying to exploit the global crisis to win approval for their products .
In 2004 , after a heated public debate , the Government decided there was no scientific case for a blanket ban on GM crops .
But amid fears over so - called " Frankenstein foods " , it decided that commercial production would be allowed on a case - by - case basis , only if evidence showed it would not pose a risk to human health or the environment .
There are no GM crops being grown in Britain and only one trial is taking place – of GM potatoes in Cambridgeshire .
Ministers are treading carefully , aware that strong government support for GM crops would provoke a backlash by opponents .
Those ministers who favour a renewed push believe there are no scientific arguments against the idea .
They argue that Britain has a duty to look at the issue on the grounds that boosting production is the best way to reduce global food prices .
They want the new debate to focus on the science to avoid a re-run of the one in 2004 , when the GM industry was accused of trying to bounce the Government into giving the go - ahead for purely commercial reasons .
Gordon Brown is believed to be sympathetic to taking a fresh look at the issue in the light of mounting problems including " food riots " around the world .
There are no plans yet for a formal cabinet decision but government sources acknowledge the issue is rising up the agenda .
" Enough time has elapsed since the 2004 decision , " one said .
At a summit of EU leaders in Brussels today , the Prime Minister will propose a six - point plan to drive down food prices which includes " improving the EU regulatory regime for GM organisms " .
This is aimed at cutting the cost of GM products used in animal feed .

Green groups reacted angrily to the prospect of a government rethink .
Clare Oxborrow , GM campaigner for Friends of the Earth , said : " Industry claims that GM crops are necessary to feed the world are a cynical attempt to use the food crisis for financial gain – and governments should look at the industry 's record before believing the hype .
" After a decade of commercialisation most GM crops are used for animal feed , not food ; they do not yield more than conventional crops ; and GM drought and salt - tolerant crops remain a PR promise rather than reality .
We now need a radical shift towards sustainable farming systems that genuinely benefit local farmers communities and the environment worldwide . "
Jan van Aken , agricultural campaigner for Greenpeace International , said : " I am appalled that the GM industry is abusing the misery of millions of hungry people around the world , using it as propaganda to sell a product by claiming it would reduce hunger .
By all means the Government can have a look at it , but it should look at the facts and then drop it .
There is no science behind the industry 's claim . "
The EU is also reviewing its stance on GM foods after coming under pressure from the US , which dominates the GM industry , to relax an unofficial moratorium on new licences ruled illegal by the World Trade Organisation .
France , Germany and Austria are cautious but the European Commission , backed by Britain and other EU nations , believes that lifting the ban could help to solve the global food crisis .
George Bush has said GM crops could help to ease the problems because of their high yields and resistance to drought .

Survey : 500,000 Iraqis fled fighting in 2007 Associated Press
Published : Thursday June 19 , 2008

Print This Email This More Iraqis were displaced than any other nationality for third year running WASHINGTON - A half - million Iraqis fled their embattled country in 2007 , the third consecutive year more Iraqis were displaced than any other nationality , a survey of the world 's refugees reported Thursday .
As before , most went to neighboring Syria , and some fanned out into other neighboring countries , the survey by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said .
It said the United States accepted few , just over half the 3,000 it had promised to resettle by the end of September .
The report said the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had referred 10,000 Iraqis for U.S. resettlement .
It said the Iraqi exodus " from the violence and instability of their homeland " constituted " the largest refugee crisis of 2007 . "
" While the Bush administration and the United Kingdom are busy trying to win the war , they have provided no leadership toward ensuring the rights and well - being of the victims of this war , " the report said .
" Europe , which for the most part warned of the dire humanitarian consequences of the war , has also done nothing to help the people they were so concerned about . "
Sen. Ben Cardin , D - Md. , a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , said the survey " shows the United States still has far to go to support the rights of refugees worldwide . "
" The United States has a moral obligation and a security interest in trying to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons , particularly those who risked so much over the past few years to help our military and diplomatic efforts in their country , " Cardin said Wednesday .
U.S. receives an ' F ' for ' refoulement '
Iraqis were not the only group for which the survey faulted U.S. policies .
In its " Report Card " section , it gave the United States an " F , " the lowest grade , for returning refugees to their home countries without hearing them out , a practice called " refoulement . "
China , Iran , Iraq , Russia , Libya and others failed the same category .
" We gave the United States an F in refoulement entirely for its treatment of Haitians , " Merrill Smith , editor of the report , said Wednesday .
The survey said the United States interdicted 6,400 foreign nationals at sea in 2007 , almost all Cubans or Haitians .
Cubans but not Haitians were told they had the right to seek asylum .
Haitians who did not shout out their fear of reprisals at home were sent back , almost 1,600 in all .
Cubans who did not accept the American offer of requesting asylum , 3,200 of them , were returned as well .
For Cubans , the practice implements the " dry foot " policy that allows Cubans who cross the 90 miles of water between Cuba and south Florida to remain , but those caught at sea are returned unless they can claim valid refugee status .
The policy does not include people fleeing Haiti .
" We use the ' shout test ' for Haitians , " Smith said .
" If somebody hears a Haitian shout out a claim to asylum , he will not be sent back " until the claim is investigated .
Many countries treat refugees from different countries or areas differently .
The survey rates a country 's efforts for each ethnic or racial group and makes the country 's overall score that of the lowest ethnic group .
" The mistreatment of refugees is not limited to poor countries or undemocratic regimes , " the survey compilers wrote .
" Wealthy industrial nations utilize policies designed to limit the number of refugees that enter their territory , explaining that they have limited resources , that refugees are unable to integrate or that some other country had primary responsibility . "
Europe scores poorly too Europe appears in a section titled " Worst Places for Refugees . "
Smith said it did not use the word " The " because there are too many violators to make that distinction .
" European countries have crafted policies that essentially deny access by making it as difficult as possible to enter their territory , " the survey says .
" Countries on the periphery of Europe had the harshest policies , protecting their wealthy neighbors to the north and west , often for money . "
It faults European countries for forcibly returning failed asylum seekers " to manifestly dangerous situations . "
It cited : France 's dispatch of a Chadian asylum seeker to Chad , where he was detained and forcibly interrogated .
Sweden 's deportation of an Iraqi directly to Baghdad .
Greece 's assault on potential asylum seekers to force them back into Turkish waters , including an attempt to swamp them with waves ; a Greek fisherman was shot and killed after he was mistaken for an asylum seeker .
AT&T chief tech officer John Donovan has told Wired that they 're going to test bandwidth caps in the fall , making them the third of the four major ISPs to do so .
( Verizon stands alone , but for how long ? )
He lays out the familiar rationale , a small group of users ( 5 percent ) pillage the network ( 40 percent ) and they 've got to stop them .
But then he slips what 's probably the real reason they 've moving to caps : " Traffic on our backbone is growing 60 percent per year , but our revenue is not . "

It is more or less accepted that a minority of users use disproportionate of bandwidth , but what they 're using it for is changing .
It 's increasingly video , not BitTorrent .
The whole pro-BitTorrent thing is a smokescreen , because BitTorrent is less and less of an issue - video , and increasingly , HD video will be the real one .
( Along with any number of other increasingly bandwidth - intensive apps . )
And it 'll be more and more competitive with providers '
TV offerings - we 've already seen Time Warner cry about it .
But there 's no legitimate way to block it and protect their content .

They can , however , make it more expensive for you to download with bandwidth caps ( which is conveniently net neutral ) .
And that 's what I think this is partially about - protecting their TV business , not just curbing voracious bandwidth appetites .
Regardless of the motivations , it 's definitely coming .
Comcast 's tests will probably start soon , Time Warner 's are already underway and regional ISPs have been doing it for a while .
It 's looking very much like the future of broadband here .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Former National Football League running back Troy Hambrick was sentenced on Tuesday to five years in prison for trafficking crack cocaine in Florida .
Hambrick , who played for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals during a five - year professional career , was arrested for allegedly selling nearly 200 grams of crack for $ 5,600 to an undercover informant in three separate deals last September .
The deals took place near Hambrick ’s home in Lacoochee , Florida , where he made his name as a high school football star , and from his Lincoln Navigator at a gas station in nearby Dade City , northeast of Tampa .
He entered a guilty plea on February 26 to one count of distributing cocaine .
In return , prosecutors dropped two other counts .
Hambrick , 31 , played college football at the University of South Carolina and Savannah State University .
He played four seasons with the Cowboys and one with the Cardinals in a career that ended following the 2004 season .
Hambrick rushed for 2,179 yards and nine touchdowns during those five seasons , averaging 4.1 yards per carry .
His best season was 2003 , when he carried 275 times for 932 yards .
His brother , Darren Hambrick , also played in the NFL , with
Dallas , Cleveland and Carolina .

Light bulbs are not actually " light bulbs " but dark absorbers .
When you turn them on , they suck the dark out of the room .
You can prove this by holding your hand under a " light bulb " .
The dark will stack up under your hand where its path to the absorber is blocked by your hand .
When they quit working and turn a dark color , it 's not because they burnt out , it 's because they 're full .
With all this talk around the interwebz about Matt Damon fucking Sarah Silverman , and Sarah Silverman 's boyfriend fucking some other dude , we were reminded of the first time somebody got to fuck Sarah Silverman on TV .
Of course , it was Tom Paris from Star Trek : Voyager .
What ?
You do n't remember the freaking two - part episode where Voyager time - and - space travels to twentieth century Earth and Silverman plays an astronomer named Rain who teaches Paris to call Tuvok a " freakosaurus " ?
And then the two of them suck face ?
Well , then , allow us to refresh your memories .
Rewind for a minute , and here 's the moment when Silverman and Paris first start getting all googly - eyed about each other .
And she manages to insult the crew ad - libbingly while also having to mouth some writer 's hideously - written lines .
Poor early - career Sarah Silverman .
We still wish she would fuck us .
I mean , if she would do Paris then surely . . . surely Sarah Silverman would fuck io9 .
Orange County , an area with over 3,098,121 people sometimes has a reputation at least nationwide as being an exclusively prime area .
What most people that do n’t live or work here realize is that the media perception of the “ OC ” is guided by a few prime cities such as Laguna Hills and Newport Beach .
These tiny cities hold a very small percentage of the overall county population .
The largest city Santa Ana , has 353,428 people making up for over 11 percent of the entire county .
Let us take a look at the county and run some quick numbers :
Source : Wikipedia
Let us look a few of the most populace cities in terms of population :
City Population Avg. Household Income Santa Ana : 353,428 $ 44,505 Anaheim : 345,556 $ 60,881 Irvine : 202,079 $ 91,114 Huntington Beach : 194,436 $ 75,900 Garden Grove : 165,196 $ 50,038
With these 5 cities , 1.26 million people make up these areas or more specifically , they make up over 42 percent of the entire county ’s population .
As you can see from the average household income , we are n’t in incredibly affluent areas although certain enclaves such as Anaheim Hills , Huntington Harbor , or certain areas in Irvine have very expensive niches but this is n’t the majority as you can see from the average .
So let us now take a look at a few of the more expensive mainstream ideas of what Orange County is :
City Population Avg. Household Income Newport Beach 70,032 $ 137,226 Laguna Hills 31,178 $ 103,419 Coto de Caza 13,057 $ 153,118 Villa Park 5,999 $ 203,091 Laguna Beach 23,727 $ 141,916
Now with these 5 cities , we have a total population of 143,993 or 4.7 + percent of the entire county population .
The point again here is that incomes never justified the absurd prices reached in certain cities .
Will the wealthier areas stay high ?
Of course !
But look at how much of the entire population they impact .
We have n’t even talked about Westminster , Stanton , Fullerton , Tustin , and Orange which also have similar income profiles like Santa Ana and Anaheim .
The overall halo effect took a major hold of prices during the past decade .
Just because you were a few miles away from a prime area does n’t mean you are prime .
We saw this in Los Angeles County and I have talked about this extensively for a county with 10,000,000 people and 88 cities .
That is why Orange County as a whole has seen the following :
- Orange County Median Home Price : $ 506,000 ( down 19.6 % from a year ago )
- Sales are down by 46.9 % from a year ago .
Now with that background , let us now look at the largest percentage drop ever in Orange County ( hat tip to reader J ) .
Before we begin , you must brace yourself and take your motion sickness meds because we are jumping onto a crazy rollercoaster !

Real Homes of Genius – 68 Percent Drop in Santa Ana
There are few homes that encompass the mania of the housing bubble .
Multiple sales , quick price movements , and an ultimate fall from grace .
This home is located in the largest city in Orange County and as we have stated above , the average household income for the city is slightly over $ 44,000 .
This majestic 825 square foot home with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath has it all .
It was built in 1918 and has been on the market for almost one full year .
For all you folks out of town who want to own a piece of the OC here you go .
This home has a current selling price of get this , $ 177,495 !
Before you go running to your agent let us look at the background story of this place .
It is always important to look at previous sales history and once again , here is the reason we discussed why housing will continue to go down because technology has leveled the playing field :
Sales History :
With this home , you can see the amazing appreciation that occurred during this decade long boom .
In fact , we get a perfect view of what happens in a financial mania .
Do n’t forget this is a 825 square foot home that is nearly 100 years old !
What you see above is 4 sales transactions which each subsequent buyer got a taste of the “ real estate never goes down ” Kool - Aid .
It was manic !
The most significant jump of course occurred during the 2006 sale price where it almost sold for twice the price in 3 years !
Or what about the person that sold it for a 124.8 % profit in 6 months back in 2002 ?
This went over and over like a broken record here in California .
This seemed all orderly but what was n’t orderly is the correction .
Let us now dive into the listing price action .
Get your scroll button finger ready :
Listing Price :
Now that has to be the worldwide record for most price changes in less than one year !
I ’m actually at a loss for words here .
How do you go from an initial listing price of $ 569,000 in July of 2007 to the current price of $ 177,495 ?
What is certain is that lender who financed that sale in 2006 for $ 505,000 is going to be in a world of hurt .
Are n’t you ecstatic that your tax money is going to bailout places and lenders like this ?
I have placed a link on the right hand sidebar that ’ll take you directly to your Congressional Representative so make sure you write a polite letter letting them know you will not stand for having your money squandered on speculative banana republic mortgages .
I plotted this listing movement on a graph so you can see bubblicious prices in a graphical format :

The commander of Iran ’s elite Revolutionary Guard said the government might shut down vital oil lanes through the Persian Gulf if the country were attacked by the United States or Israel , according to a newspaper report Saturday .
Maj . Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari warned that if there were any confrontation over Iran ’s nuclear program , Tehran would try to damage Western economies by targeting oil .
“ Naturally every country under attack by an enemy uses all its capacity and opportunities to confront the enemy , ” Jafari said to the hard - line newspaper Jaam-e Jam , according to translations of his comments on the English - language website of the semiofficial Fars News Agency .
“ Iran will definitely act to impose control on the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz , ” through which 17 million barrels of oil passes each day .

“ After this action , the oil price will rise very considerably and this is among the factors deterring the enemies , ” he said .
Iran abuts the strategic strait , and Iranian and Western analysts have frequently said that the country could try to blockade or mine it in the event of a war , a move that would send oil prices skyrocketing .
But some military analysts say Iran might not be able to hold the waterway , which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point , in a confrontation with U.S. warships and aircraft .
The West and Iran remain locked in a standoff over uranium enrichment , which Tehran insists is meant to produce fuel for energy production , but which the U.S. and its allies allege is the cornerstone of an eventual weapons program .

The West has threatened a fourth round of United Nations sanctions as well as a tightening of other economic restrictions if the program is not suspended .
U.S. lawmakers are considering resolutions that would require President Bush to increase pressure on Tehran by preventing the export of refined petroleum products and inspecting “ all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran . ”
U.S. officials this month also leaked word of a large Israeli military exercise that they described as a prelude to a possible attack on Iran .
Tehran has reacted angrily to the pressure , which comes as it considers a package of U.S. and European - backed incentives meant to entice the government to halt enrichment activities .
An escalating war of words has rattled nerves and contributed to rising oil prices .

Jafari also warned of possible reprisals against countries that allow the U.S. or Israel to use their territory or airspace to launch attacks against Iran .
“ If enemies from outside the region use the soil of regional countries against the Islamic Republic of Iran . . . the governments of those countries will be responsible , and it is our obvious right to act in the same way against their military capabilities and abilities of enemies everywhere , ” Jafari said .

Ten years ago around this very time — April through June 2008 — our intrepid Microsoft guru Peter Bright evidently had an identity crisis .
Could this lifelong PC user really have been pushed to the brink ?
Was he considering a switch to ... Mac OS ?!?
While our staff hopefully enjoys a less stressful Memorial Day this year , throughout the weekend we 're resurfacing this three part series that doubles as an existential operating system dilemma circa 2008 .
Part three ran on June 1 , 2008 , and it appears unedited below .
I 've already described how misfortune and adversity left Apple with a new OS platform free of legacy constraints ; and I 've also discussed how Microsoft had failed to do the same , choosing instead to hobble its new OS with way too much legacy baggage .
Now , let 's look at why I 'm even considering the big switch : what has Apple done with its platform to make it so appealing ?
Of course , if you 're already writing software for the Mac , then I 'm not going to tell you anything you already do n't know .
But all of this was new to me , because it was n't until I became so thoroughly disappointed with Windows that I really looked in earnest at what the Mac had to offer .
My mistake .
The NeXT connection
First , let 's take a brief look at what Apple got when it bought NeXT , and at some of the important bits of NeXT technology that live on today .
When Apple bought NeXT , it inherited what was in many ways quite an unusual OS .
Most operating systems are written in C and define all the APIs and extension points of the OS in C terms .
As I said in part 2 , this is because C's simplicity means that virtually all programming languages can call C APIs without too much difficulty .
C is very much the lingua franca of programming languages — an adequate , though imperfect , lowest common denominator for exposing OS functionality to applications .
NeXTstep was ( and remains ) unusual , because NeXTstep bucked this trend .
NeXTstep did n't eschew C altogether , and indeed , many low - level features did use C APIs — its use of BSD UNIX ensures that much , as UNIX and C go hand - in - hand — but it also used a dynamic , object - oriented language , Objective - C , for many things .
Obj - C is a kind of hybrid between C and the language Smalltalk .
Smalltalk is a niche language that has never been widely used , but it has particularly strong support for one approach to object - oriented programming , called message - passing .
In message - passing OO , objects send each other messages to perform actions .
When an object receives a message , it can examine it and choose to respond to it , ignore it , or send it somewhere else .
Whether an object knows how to handle a message is n't known until the program is actually running .
The program code that the developer writes need n't contain any particular restriction on which messages are sent to which objects , and indeed the messages that an object might respond to could also vary when the program runs .
Although this dynamic behavior is not especially unusual in scripting languages , it 's much less common in system programming languages .
The message - passing approach is quite unusual in the OO world ; most OO languages ( including all the common ones : C++ , Java , C# ) use a different model for their OO facilities , one based on the Simula language instead .
This approach is much stricter ; whether a particular function can be called on a given object is determined when the program is compiled , not when it 's run .
The Smalltalk - inspired object oriented parts of Obj - C are quite independent of the C parts .
Any C program can be compiled by an Obj - C compiler ; using C APIs from within Obj - C programs is trivial , because Obj - C can do everything that C can do .
Going the other way is much harder ; many languages simply have no facility for the kind of things that Obj - C takes for granted , especially when it comes to some of its more complex features .
Coupled with this unusual programming language was an API that exploited the unique properties of the language .
The API was split into a number of " frameworks " , each of which covered a specific area of functionality .
Although these frameworks have evolved over time ( NeXTstep 's history was a lot more complicated than I have described here , and this history influenced the development of the API considerably ) , there are two in particular that are of paramount importance , because they are what makes up Cocoa .
The Cocoa API has two parts ; " Foundation Kit " and " Application Kit " .
Foundation Kit provides basic functionality common to virtually all programs : string manipulation , container / collection classes , XML parsing , file I/O , and so on .
Application Kit is what provides GUI programming facilities .
It 's here that Mac OS X ( and NeXTstep before it ) sets itself apart from platforms such as Win32 .
The people who developed Smalltalk also devised a design approach for writing GUI applications called " Model View Controller " ( MVC ) .
The idea of MVC is to separate an application into three parts ; the Model , which represents the things that the application actually cares about ( e.g. , documents in a text editor ) ; Views , which contain the visual representations of the data in the application , such as buttons and text boxes ; and Controllers that link the two and ensure that changes in one are properly propagated to the other .
The Model is common to all the Views , with each View representing a different part of it , and each View has a corresponding Controller .
Although this pattern of writing applications is quite widely used , it is particularly important to Application Kit.
Application Kit bakes in a lot of MVC functionality , all but forcing software to be structured in this way .
What that means today
Cocoa applications get a lot of things for free , just by virtue of being Cocoa applications .
The predefined Models , Views , and Controllers provide powerful built - in capabilities that can be used and extended by software .
The class NSTextView , for example , provides a consistent multi-line text editing View , complete with multiple fonts , font sizes , and text colors , along with red and green wiggles underlining for spelling and grammar errors ( respectively ) with unlimited undo / redo .
As new abilities are added to the NSTextView class , software that uses it can pick up these abilities automatically .
The NSText View is not some monolithic and inflexible class , either ; it hands off different areas of responsibility to other classes .
For instance , the way that text flows in an NSTextView is governed by a class named NSTextContainer , which performs line - wrapping and similar tasks .
If , however , NSTextContainer does n't do what you want ( perhaps you want to be able to put arbitrarily shaped objects into the text and have the words reflow around them ) you can replace it with your own class .
As long as it responds to the same messages , it will work as a drop - in replacement .
The customization mechanisms for the classes that Apple provides depend strongly on Obj - C features .
Although the subclassing approach found in most OO languages is an option , it is not the only one .
The ease with which Obj - C can forward messages to different objects means that delegation ( where one object passes responsibility for a behavior to another object ) is very easy to express and support .
Unlike with , say , Java or C++ , the delegated - to object need n't implement any specific interface or extend any particular base class ; it can just listen for the individual messages that it 's interested in and ignore everything else .
This makes replacement or modification of individual operations quick and easy .
To make best use of this framework , you also need to look at Apple 's development tools , in particular Interface Builder , which is Apple 's application for constructing user interfaces .
Interface Builder is another NeXT artifact ; it ultimately dates back to the 1980s and was one of the first development tools that allowed user interfaces to be built using drag - and - drop and a mouse .
Within Interface Builder , Views objects can be arranged and connected together to construct an interface for your application .
Once you have your View objects , you add a Controller to tie the View to your model , to propagate changes from one to the other .
Finally , you plumb individual fields into their respective Views , and wire up buttons and other interactive elements to actions , so that things actually happen when you use the UI .
Interface Builder makes it very easy to put together user interfaces .
If you have absolutely no design skills , you 're probably not going to get a work of art , it 's true .
But equally , it 's unlikely to look terrible .
The Views that come with the system are the ones used everywhere else in the OS , and they bring a lot of behaviour with them .
Appropriate guides appear in order to assist with lining up objects in the right way , and just following these should prevent anything too horrific .
JAMES HAMILTON is an excellent economist and blogger , but he 's confounded me today .
In a post
examining
Instead I believe that the price of oil , like the price of all the other storable commodities , and for that matter the dollar cost of a euro , is primarily responding to the Fed 's decision to move the real interest rate strongly into negative territory .
the roots of the recent surge in oil prices , Mr Hamilton displays a number of charts which seem to clearly indicate the extent to which petroleum production has stagnated -- not just in recent months , but over the past few years -- even as global demand growth has proceeded apace .
He then goes on to note that this has practically nothing to do with increases in oil prices :
This is an argument Mr Hamilton has made before .
Because the Federal Reserve has reduced nominal interest rates so significantly in an inflationary environment , real interest rates are negative .
As such , the best way to generate value with one 's money is to keep it in storable commodities .
Presto : commodities price boom !
I would n't be surprised if some small portion of the oil spike had something to do with this kind of investment play , but I think it 's difficult to square the facts with Mr Hamilton 's assessment that most of the boom can be explained as such .
Why ?
First , we are n't lacking for explanations for the broader commodities price boom , to the extent that interest rate stories should be invoked .
Increasing demand and slow supply growth are key factors for oil , food , and metals .
Moreover , the increases for those categories are n't independent of each other .
Dear oil makes extraction , cultivation , and transportation of commodities more expensive .
Second , much of the run-up in oil prices precedes the recent , rapid monetary easing pursued by the Fed .
The yield on the 5 - Year Treasury inflation - indexed note did n't go negative until the very end of February , 2008 , at which point oil prices had already crested the $ 100 per barrel threshold .
What 's more , those yields have been ticking back toward zero over the past two weeks , just as oil exploded to new records , above $ 115 per barrel .
One reason why those yields have moved up is because it is widely expected that the current cycle of Fed easing is essentially over .
A quarter point cut , to 2 percent , is likely at the upcoming April meeting , and the market does not see Ben Bernanke moving below that level .
Mr Hamilton writes :
The Fed has a golden opportunity to prove me wrong .
Fed funds futures prices currently reflect an expectation that the Fed will make one more cut to 2 % at the meeting at the end of this month , and then stay there .
Here 's a prediction for you .
If the Fed surprises the markets by holding steady at 2.25 % , all those commodities will begin to crash within hours of the news .
And I predict that if the Fed did surprise by holding the rate steady , oil might crash -- all the way back to $ 100 per barrel .

Appointment to the United States Supreme Court is an extraordinary honor that conveys the power to influence the course of American law and justice .
It does not seem too much to ask that sitting justices order their personal financial affairs to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest requiring them to sit out cases .
That long - simmering problem led to a big embarrassment last week when financial and personal conflicts affecting four Supreme Court justices left the court without a quorum .
It was thus unable to rule on whether to hear an appeal arising from a controversial lawsuit against American companies that did business in apartheid - era South Africa .
Participation of six of the nine justices is necessary for the court to conduct business .
The absence of a quorum automatically affirmed a lower court ruling allowing the lawsuit to move forward .
The court did not give reasons for the recusals by the four justices .
Three of them  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito Jr. and Stephen Breyer  own stock in some of the defendant companies , according to a report in The Times on May 13 .
A son of the fourth justice , Anthony Kennedy , works for one of the firms .
The court ’s inability to proceed was unusual .
Solitary recusals resulting in a 4 - to - 4 deadlock are a more common occurrence .
Federal law requires judges to disqualify themselves from cases if they own even a single share of stock in a company that is a party in a case , a policy important for preserving the appearance and reality of fair adjudication .
Plainly , the public would be better served if justices put their money in mutual funds , government securities or certificates of deposit instead of inviting conflicts by investing in publicly traded companies with matters coming before the court .
The Son Who Did Not Die , The One Who Did
By Mohammed Omer
GAZA CITY , Mar 21 ( IPS ) –
The family had been mourning for 16 - year - old Ahmed Abu Salamah .
What was left of what was thought to be his body had been buried .
After two weeks of mourning , they found Ahmed alive in the intensive care unit at Gaza City ’s al - Shifa Hospital .
But a boy had been buried .
And , a family had spent two weeks outside the intensive care unit , believing the boy inside was theirs .
It was their boy who had died .
The discovery of the mistake brought joy to the family of Ahmed Abu Salamah .
And it plunged into uncontrollable grief the family who had gathered at hospital and prayed daily for recovery of the boy within in intensive care .
Through this misunderstanding , one thing everyone understood .
The body of the boy who was buried had been mangled beyond recognition .
As was the boy still alive in intensive care .
“ Israel is using missiles and materials which rip apart and burn beyond recognition the humans they target , so much so that a mother can’t identify the body of her own son , ” Dr. Raed al - Arini , head of public relations at al - Shifa Hospital told IPS .
Israel had used banned materials such as Dense Inert Metal Explosive ( DIME ) and white phosphorus , he said .
Ahmed has suffered brain haemorrhage and has serious wounds all over his body .
He had left home on Saturday Mar. 1 , his mother said , and was soon hit by an Israeli F - 16 missile strike just outside his house .
It was a day when more than 55 Palestinians were killed , many of them civilians and children .
For three days the family could find no trace of Ahmed .
Then they were called by the hospital to say that the remains of a body in the morgue was Ahmed .
But two weeks later , Ahmed ’s friends informed his mother Karima that her son was still alive .
She rushed to the hospital .
“ I shook his bed , and when he opened his eyes I said to him , ‘ this is your mother , I ’m here with you ’ . ”
The other side of this story was that of mourning after hope .
The mangled body that the Salamah family had buried was that of Mohammed Hejazi , a 17 - year - old from the same neighbourhood .
Mohammed ’s mother Aminah Hejazi and his family had sat outside the ICU everyday for two weeks , believing that the boy inside was their Mohammed .
Ahmed ’s face was covered by bandages .
The boys were about the same size , and the Hejazi family thought it was Mohammed .
“ At first I doubted whether this was really my son , but I felt the need to be close to him anyway , ” Aminah said .
But in a few days , she said she came to believe the boy inside was her son .
Until the other family arrived in hospital , and the doctors broke the news to her .
Aminah sobs as she recounts that moment .
The family was broken , she said .
Her husband would not believe Mohammed was dead .
Identifying Ahmed finally came down to the hair .
Karima said Ahmed has brown hair ; Aminah that her son ’s hair was black .
As the Abu Salamah family did earlier , the Hejazi family set up a mourning tent to receive condolences from friends and neighbours .
On the other side , many of Ahmed ’s friends who had thought they would never see him again , following his ‘ funeral ’ , have been streaming to the hospital to look him up .
Ahmed can not speak to his friends .
He is conscious , his eyes are open , but he is paralysed , and his condition is critical .
Doctors say they are short of medicines to treat him .
Aminah mourns the death of her own , and prays for the boy who survived .
“ I pray that God will heal him , ” she said , in tears .

Well , the letter was actually addressed to me and my wife .
The IRS people are great believers in family values , and my wife and I are what the tax collectors affectionately refer to as joint filers .
It ’s all pretty warm and fuzzy , in a creepy sort of way .
Anyhow , the letter was not nearly as bad as usual .
It informed us that the government , acting under authority of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 , would soon be sending us $ 1,200 .
Usually it ’s the other way around , and the agency ’s letter invites us to send it more of our money than we have already sent .
Well , we understand , of course : when the government identifies someone who deserves to get our money more than we deserve to keep it , simple justice requires that we pass it along to KBR ( formerly Kellogg Brown & Root ) , Lockheed Martin , and other widows or orphans .
Besides , if we kept the money , we ’d probably just end up wasting it , whereas the Department of Defense watches every cent with an eagle eye .
Ditto for Health and Human Services .
We do n’t call those people “ public servants ” for nothing ; they really put their hearts into their jobs .
According to the economists , for what their opinion is worth , the economic stimulus act will dish out about $ 160 billion , of which approximately $ 110 billion will go to deserving folks like my wife and me , and the rest will go to deserving businesses that would like to write off more of the expenses they incur for making certain investments .
Do n’t laugh , now !
Just because $ 160 billion is not likely to keep afloat a sinking supertanker - sized economy with a GDP of more than $ 14 trillion does not entitle you to classify this sum as chump change .
On the road where I live , it ’s still a substantial amount of money .
There is , however , a little catch for you younger people : because the government was already running a deficit , its outlays for the stimulus payments must all be covered by borrowing , which means that the public debt will rise by the full amount of the payments .
And guess who will be responsible for servicing that additional debt and paying it off when it matures .
If you said “ we , the U.S. taxpayers , will be responsible , ” then give yourself an A in the course .
In short , we are getting a check from the government today , but at the same time , we are also being given the privilege of paying that same amount back , with interest , in the future .
I ’m not too worried myself ; I ’m old , and I will probably be dead long before my pro rata share of this obligation hits me very hard .
For you younger people , it ’s a different matter .
As for me , I ’m relying on two of my firmest beliefs : ( 1 ) dead men do n’t wear plaid , and ( 2 ) they do n’t get letters from the IRS , either .
Or , if they do , they are , shall we say , unmoved by them .
A list !
An internet list !
Ooooh , Shiny !
Clickey - clickey !
Let ’s face it , despite our brains being larger than that of the general populace , even sci- fi fans are drawn to internet lists like Mynocks to Kessel running smuggler ships .
It would be easy to cobble together another “ Top 10 best sci - fi series EVAR ”  that get pushed out by lesser websites , slap it on the site for people to howl that I left off their favorite show and call it a solar day .
But that ’s not how I roll , peeps .
Instead , I present the worst moments of sci-fi .
We ’re still in a golden age of sci - fi where every network carries at least one show and we even have a channel that shows only Science Fiction ( and wrestling … um , wha ? ) , but that was not always the case .
The Cause stumbled for many years and still has missteps of judgment where we all grimace as the skeptics nod their heads and proclaim that sci- fi is just for kids .
So I have cobbled together the top 5 moments , the ones that slow us down or stopped us altogether .
They are actually in chronological order , but we do love lists so —
7 . Lost in Space —
When they lost their nerve .
Mention “ Lost in Space ” nowadays and you instantly think “ Danger , Will Robinson ”  , Dr. Smith ’s bumbling idiocy and if that chimp they strapped the phony ears to ever went on a rampage and ripped off a cameraman ’s face .
But did you ever watch the first 10 episodes ?
They were compelling , thoughtful , dangerous stories of a family that ’s trying desperately to survive in a hostile universe .
Watch the pilot episode and Dr. Smith actually KILLS a guy , and then tries to kill the Robinson family using the reprogrammed robot .
Now that ’s good sci-fi .
So what happened ?
Well , for one , it ’s hard to justify keeping a guy on your ship who wants to kill you every episode , so the writers had to soften Dr. Smith down .
The comedy trio / uncomfortable sexual grouping of Dr. Smith , Will Robinson and The Robot instantly appealed to the youth market and the network seized upon it .
From that point on , it became dumbed down , space pirate , camp that resembled the Adam West “ Batman ” more than a survival series .
Nonetheless , the short - term effect was ratings gold , GOLD I say Will !
The long - term effect was to play into every skeptics hands that Science Fiction was silly , children ’s fare .
In this case they were right .
Well , at least Star Trek was on the same years so it offset the… uh oh …
6. Star Trek —
“ Spock ’s Brain ”
Trek fans rejoice !
Your long hours of letter writing ( present day emailing ) , picketing NBC ( present day sending nuts ) and pamphlet circulating ( er , blogs ? ) have done the impossible !
You have actually saved your show in a first ever decision from a network !
Huzzah , you ’ve earned this !
Here is the premiere episode of season three : A planet of intellectual morons , ruled by women ( no jokes here ! ) steals Mr. Spock ’s Brain and puts in a computer ( huh ? ) .
Kirk and company beam down with the brainless body of Mr. Spock and are captured by the Sudoku challenged women ( no jokes here ! ) and must free themselves and return Spock ’s Brain to it ’s body !!
Considered one of the worst of the 79 episodes , “ Spock Brain ”  was the ridiculous , insulting episode served up to the fans following their tireless work to save the show .
True , NBC did the series no favors by slashing the budget and shifting it to the Friday at 10 pm time slot .
Still , the sight of Spock , brainless but controlled by a hat like device , stumbling around put a bad taste in the fans mouths and guaranteed the show would be cancelled .
This of course left William Shatner time to …
5. Bill Shatner Performs Rocket Man .
In the pre-Star Wars 70 ’s , we almost lost the thread on sci-fi .
SF
Shows were few and far between and films were a joke .
Even worse , someone let Shatner out of his cage and he went ahead and recorded his now famous album “ The Transformed Man ”  .
He followed this up with a performance during the Science Fiction awards where he outdid his Star Trek episode “ Two Kirks ”  bit with THREE SHATNERS .
The universe shuddered that day as a sweaty Bill spoke his way through the song with two pretaped versions of himself ( If they were real , then this becomes Sci - fi ’s BEST moment . ) .
The audience , shocked and disoriented mustered applause at the end , but were later found washing those same hands crying “ dirty , dirty , dirty … ”
I ’m not sure many saw the broadcast , but you only need the disaster to happen once for the memories to linger .
Speaking of that …
4. The Star Wars Holiday Special
It is the stuff of legend .
Let ’s see we got :
1 . A story line set around a family of Wookies who DON ’T speak English , leaving us to guess what they are saying .
2. Bea Arthur
3 . A drugged out Carrie Fisher singing some terrible “ festival of light ” song to the Star Wars theme music .
4. Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill sleepwalking through their performances .
5. Harvey Korman as a 4 armed cooking show host .
6 . Art Carney as a friend of the Wookies ( Bet you a million dollars he had no idea what a Wookie was before the show .
Probably still did n’t after . )
7. Jefferson Starship ( I can see the pitch “ Hell , they got the name ‘ Starship ’ in their title ” ) as a holographic rock and roll band .
8. Bea Arthur .
This was a franchise killer if there ever was one .
It only aired once and Lucas wisely has destroyed every legal copy around .
Unfortunately , for those of us who stayed up and WATCHED the thing , it is seared in our minds as only traumatic events can .
Aside from the mildly interesting Boba Fett appearance , this show was a cheaply made , awkwardly produced money grab by Lucas and company .
He learned his lesson — until …
3. Jar -Jar Binks !
For all the Lucas haters out there , the line of incrimination begins at the Star Wars Christmas Special and runs through Jar - Jar .
This cloying , irritating CGI abomination almost instantly reduced any goodwill from a Star Wars fan to the franchise by half .
Aside from the fact that he was vaguely racist , he just was n’t FUNNY , a prerequisite for characters billed as “ comic relief ” .
The only “ relief ” came when Lucas wisely pushed Jar - Jar into the same vault as the Christmas Special and locked the key .
The damage was done and the next two films had to work extra hard to escape the Gungan ’s insidious plot to make the second trilogy unwatchable .
2. The Matrix Reloaded
When The Matrix came out , the Singularity of Science Fiction had arrived .
With amazing special effects , badass fight sequences , Star Wars - like mythology and trendy people in trendy ( black ) clothes , The Matrix showed the world that sci- fi could be mainstream and cool .
Then they made a sequel .
Reloaded is n’t terrible , just self - indulgent .
Gone was the lean , sharp story telling ; replaced now with a bloated plot , too many characters ( Jada Pinkett ?
Really ? ) and too much CGI .
What was once a simple story of “ Beat the bad guys ”  , morphed into keymasters , dreadlocked twins and French dudes that we just did n’t care about .
Of course , what I ’m really building up to is this :
The rave .
Yup , an entire franchise was sacrificed so that hip , trendy people living underground could dance in a sweaty sexy montage .
This was when sci - fi fans just lowered their heads in their heads in the movie theater and shook them slowly .
1. January 1st , 2001
I ’m not talking about the classic Stanley Kubrick movie , I ’m talking about the actually date .
See the movie 2001 is a masterpiece of Science and Fiction — a best guess as to how the future could / should turn out from one of the world ’s smartest scientists and authors .
With moon bases , commercial space flight to orbiting space stations and a manned mission to Jupiter , it seemed logical and desirable .
After all , the very next year we landed on the Moon .
The Frelling Moon !
January 1st , 2001 is embarrassing to all Science fiction fans because we ’re still stuck on Earth .
32 years after that film came out and 29 since the last Apollo mission , we still have n’t gone back to the Moon , much less landed on Mars ( But we have probed Uranus ! )
Sure we have the internet , Xbox and the carpool lanes but the basic tenet of Science Fiction to explore has fallen by the wayside and as guardians of the future , we have to take a little blame for it .
We can only look to the hazy sky now and know that we missed a golden opportunity .
There will be no real life Star Trek , Star Wars or 2001 for our generation .
Most people recovered from bad hangovers January 1st , 2001 .
Science Fiction fans sighed and pulled out their copies of “ 2010 ” and “ 3001 ” , hoping maybe they ’ll get one more shot .
Well , there it was .
You know what the best part of internet lists are ?
They ’re always right !
Let ’s print this baby out and put it in a time vault for the next generation to learn from .
This is pure gold pressed latinum !
Wuzat ?
You have a better list ?!
Well , there ’s a comment section on this site , Admiral , use it !
Take me to task or tweak the list but be warned : bring your “ A ”  game or you just might make next years list .
That is , if there is an internet next year …
Boston University students have won what one lawyer hailed as a " David and Goliath " victory after challenging one of the recording industry 's most aggressive tactics : lawsuits targeting people who illegally download music .
US District Judge Nancy Gertner ruled this week that the university cannot turn over the names of students to several major record companies that sued for the information until she can do a more in - depth review .
The ruling , for the moment , quashes the companies ' efforts to hold the students liable for copyright infringement , which could have resulted in thousands of dollars in fines .
Lawyers who supported the students said the decision would make it harder for record companies to win some 20,000 similar cases they have brought nationwide .
" This is definitely a step in the right direction , " said Raymond Sayeg , a Boston lawyer who represented one of the four BU students who challenged the record companies .
" The court has recognized the right of privacy of the students . "
Sayeg compared the victory to that of David over the giant Goliath in the Bible .
" You have on the one hand maybe 30 to 40 of the largest record companies in the country , and they 're singling out students at institutions of higher education .
So it 's a real mismatch . "
The decision adds a layer of protection for the thousands of people , many of them students , sued by the Recording Industry Association of America , according to Fred von Lohmann , staff attorney at the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed a brief in support of the BU students .
" It does not mean the end of the issue , " von Lohmann said .
" It is not going to slow down the RIAA litigation machine , and they 'll continue to sue hundreds a month all over the country .
But the judge said they have more work to do if they want to prove these cases . "
Undaunted , the record company organization said it would press ahead with the lawsuit .
" It 's important to note that the decision is not final , " said Jonathan Lamy , the organization 's senior vice president of communications .
" The court has put forth a specific process to address its concerns before the relevant information is transferred to us .
We 're confident that the court will ultimately allow us to obtain the [ names ] , as have courts across the country in similar cases . "
File - sharing exploded in popularity in the late 1990s with the advent of Napster , which allowed people to swap songs from one computer to another .
A series of lawsuits by record companies killed the service in 2001 but spawned a host of imitators , such as Kazaa and Limewire .
In 2003 the recording industry began to attack those services - by going after their users .
The industry filed 35,000 lawsuits to stop illegal music downloading through the programs , which it blamed for billions of dollars in lost sales .

The Red Cross said Iraq ’s humanitarian situation is " among the most critical in the world " .
It warned that despite better security in some areas , millions had been left essentially to fend for themselves .
Some families spend a third of their average monthly wage of $ 150 just buying clean water , the report said .
An even worse humanitarian crisis in Iraq will only be averted if much more attention is paid to the everyday needs of Iraqi citizens , the agency said .
Healthcare in Iraq was " now in worse shape than ever " and the services that are available are too expensive for many people , the report said .
Iraqi hospitals lack qualified staff and basic drugs , facilities are not properly maintained and public hospitals provide only 30,000 beds , less than half of the 80,000 needed , the Red Cross reported .
The agency said the current situation had been exacerbated for the 27 million population by decades of previous conflict and economic sanctions .
The report also says that tens of thousands of Iraqis had effectively disappeared since the start of the war .
" Many of those killed in the current violence have never been properly identified , because only a small percentage of the bodies have been turned over to Iraqi government institutions , " it said .
Despite security gains , many Iraqis still suffer bloodshed .
Violence rates in the country have fallen 60 % since last June , although the US military commander there , Gen David Petraeus , says the security gains are fragile and could be easily reversed .
Beatrice Megevand Roggo of the Red Cross said : " Better security in some parts of Iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices . "
Tens of thousands of Iraqis – nearly all men – are in detention , according to the agency , including 20,000 inmates at Camp Bucca near Basra , which is run by US - led multinational forces .
IRNA reporter in Baghdad said that Iraq is the Red Cross ’s largest operation worldwide with an annual budget of $ 106 m and 600 staff .

Barack Obama is embracing anti-gun policies in the run-up to a Democratic presidential debate scheduled on the one - year anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings .
“ I am not in favor of concealed weapons , ” Obama told the Pittsburgh Tribune .
“ I think that creates a potential atmosphere where more innocent people could ( get shot during ) altercations . ”
These remarks break from Obama ’s previous moderate rhetoric on gun control .
While campaigning in Idaho in February , Obama promised , “ I have no intention of taking away folks ’ guns . ”
Obama elaborated later that month in a political forum sponsored by ABC News and the Politico .
He said : “ I think it 's important for us to recognize that we 've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally .
And a lot of law - abiding citizens use it for hunting , for sportsmanship , and for protecting their families .
We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage .
And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets .
And cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children , the mentally ill .
We can have reasonable , thoughtful gun control measure that I think respects the Second Amendment and people 's traditions . "
Obama ’s tough talk on gun control may be prompted by Philadelphia - based Democratic leaders who are pressuring Clinton and Obama to adopt harder stances on gun control .
This issue is expected to come up in ABC News ’ Democratic debate on April 16 in Philadelphia .
32 people were shot to death on the campus of Virginia Tech by Seung - Hui Cho April 16 , 2007 .
Obama ’s new hardline liberal position differs from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and GOP candidate John McCain , who both are for concealed - carry .
The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms ( CCRKBA ) said in a statement Obama should apologize and revise his stance .
“ Barack Obama ignorantly believes that legally - armed Americans are as reckless and irresponsible as the criminals with whom his political sympathies evidently law , ” said CCRKBA Chairman Alan Gottlieb .
“ He has been insisting for months he supports the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , but here he is now campaigning in Pennsylvania , stating essentially he would prefers Americans not exercise that right . ”
[ Editor 's note : Clinton has never gone on record supporting concealed carry .
It is more correct to say Clinton has not opposed concealed carry laws . ]
When President Bush plucked him from civil service obscurity in 2005 to run the Environmental Protection Agency , Stephen Johnson probably never imagined that he would someday find himself at the center of the policy struggle over global warming .
But that is where he is now , courtesy of the Supreme Court ’s ruling in March that greenhouse gases could be regulated under the Clean Air Act , a law administered by the E.P.A .
Unfortunately , Mr. Johnson and the agency have not done anything meaningful since .
Mr. Johnson is now being challenged again .
Last week , five states , New York City and four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to force the nation ’s airlines to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
In early October , the same groups petitioned the agency to regulate emissions from large , ocean - going ships .
Aircraft account for 3 percent of total United States emissions of carbon dioxide and 12 percent of emissions from transportation sources , but they are growing rapidly .
According to a recent report from a British royal commission , airplanes also generate ozone - forming pollutants and water vapor that together could triple the effect of aircraft - emitted carbon dioxide .
The report ’s authors suggested various ways to curb emissions , including the use of lighter and more efficient aircraft and operational measures to cut distances and flying times .
This is Mr. Johnson ’s responsibility .
The Supreme Court ’s ruling that the E.P.A. could regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  a position that had been opposed by the White House  applied specifically to automobile emissions .
But it clearly inferred that the agency had the power to regulate greenhouse gases from other sources , including power plants , ships and jets .
Michael Geist continues his ongoing series on activities that will be illegal under Canada 's new copyright act , the so - called Canadian DMCA ( Bill C - 61 ) .
Today , backing up DVDs and scanning school photos :
Diane , who is four years old , is a huge fan of the popular TV character Dora the Explorer .
For her birthday , she received four Dora DVDs .
Given Diane 's habit of scratching them , her dad has begun to create backup versions .
That day , Diane brings home her kindergarten class photo , which was taken by a local photographer .
Josee digitizes the photo and sends a copy to Diane 's grandmother .
If Industry Minister Jim Prentice 's Bill C - 61 becomes law , all of these copying activities arguably violate the law .
Bill C - 61 does not allow users to make backup copies of DVDs .
The act of backing up the DVD is an infringement .
Moreover , in order to make the backup copy , users must typically circumvent the copy - protection on the DVD , also an act of infringement .
For decades , Canadian copyright law has vested copyright in commissioned photographs – like school photographs – in the person who commissions the photo .
Bill C - 61 reverses that practice so that copyright now belongs to the photographer .
( repeal of Section 13.2 )
Assuming the photograph came with an all rights reserved restriction , the act of distributing the digitized photo to Diane 's grandmother now violates the law .
( Section 29.21 ( 1 ) ( e ) )
I 'm pretty sure that every Canadian reading Boing Boing knows about this law and what 's wrong with it , and I hope you 've all contacted your MPs .
But the point of these posts is to help you communicate to your less tech - savvy friends about these issues .
Did you email your grandmother a photo of your kids ' kindergarten photos ?
Call her up and tell her that you wo n't be able to do it again with the grade one pics next year unless she calls up her MP and puts him on notice that he'd better oppose the CDMCA or lose her vote .
Did your brother back up his DVDs to his laptop when he went away to university ?
Call him now and let him know that he 'll be a criminal next year unless he calls and writes to his MP and lets her know what he thinks of Bill C - 61 .

" We applaud The New York Times Reporter Stephanie Clifford on her recent article about the advancement in audience measurement in the out - of - home advertising industry .
She rightly states " In advertising these days , the brass ring goes to those who can measure everything . "
Ms. Clifford is 100 percent correct .
With the increased popularity of out - of - home advertising and the exponential growth of the digital signage industry ( translating into billions of dollars ) , there has been no accurate measurement system in place .
Television has Nielsen and radio has Arbitron , but the out - of - home industry has grown up quickly without an accurate and reliable third - party measurement solution .
Our company , TruMedia Technologies , realized that need and has created a robust , scalable , turnkey audience measurement solution .
In the article , Ms. Clifford also brought up the issue of privacy and the opportunity for measurement companies to save and use individual images .
This issue is a critical one for TruMedia , the marketing and research industries and the public .
TruMedia Technologies has a standing commitment to the protection of privacy .
Our own privacy policy states that we do not and will NEVER engage in any video recording and that the data we collect is anonymous and will only be reported in the aggregate .
No individually identifiable data is ever collected .
Images from our sensors are processed and converted in real - time into counts ( how many ) and durations ( how long ) .
Using complex proprietary algorithms these counts are further assigned to specific demographic categories such as gender and age - group .
No images are ever and will ever be stored for use , review or sharing with any private or governmental body .
To further advance these principals , we are working closely with the Out - of - home Video Advertising Bureau ( OVAB ) to help develop a comprehensive set of standards that address both methodology and metrics for the out - of - home measurement industry including the buying , planning and selling community .
Within those standards will come a quality control element that every vendor and advertising agency must agree to in order to use our products and services .
We further challenge the industry to adopt a standard , akin to our own that categorically prohibits the storing of images or any other personally identifying information without prior consumer consent .
This will allow our industry to grow and provide responsible currency measurement of out - of - home media without compromising the important principals of privacy in our society . "

Warhammer Online has been built to contain five years of content , according to EA Mythic 's senior designer Josh Drescher .
During an interview with GamesIndustry.biz , Dresher talked about the challenges associated with developing the upcoming MMO Warhammer Online and revealed details of the game 's planned longevity .
" All the under - the - hood numbers all actually scale through the next five years , " he said .
" What you do n't want is when you launch the game you 've got 40 levels - and it takes however long it takes to get to level 40 .
You then launch an expansion and it now takes two weeks to get to level 40 because now we need everyone to spend six months to get from level 40 to 50 , " Drescher added .
" So you need to spec the game out in such a way that you actually have those progressions in mind for later - so you do n't wind up trampling all over the earlier experiences every time you expand the game . "
" We have actually five years ' worth of numerology out in front of us in terms of all that , " he explained .
The full GamesIndustry .biz interview with Josh Drescher will be available next week .
Charles Barkley : Conservatives are ' fake Christians ' David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Friday February 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Former NBA star Charles Barkley , who is not known for his timidity when it comes to discussing his political beliefs , will surely be ruffling right - wing feathers with his latest comments .
Barkley , currently an NBA commentator for the TNT network , appeared today on CNN's ' Situation Room . '
When asked by host Wolf Blitzer about his views on the presidential race , Barkley said he did n't want to see the Republicans win because they were ' fake Christians . '
The comment came after Barkley was asked his reasons for supporting presidential candidate Barack Obama , rather than Hillary Clinton or any of the Republican candidates .
" I 've got great respect for Sen. McCain , great respect , but I do n't like the way Republicans have taken this country , " said Barkley .
" Every time I hear the word ' conservative , ' it makes me sick to my stomach , because they 're really just fake Christians , as I call them .
That 's all they are . "
Blitzer moved on to a different question following the comment , but later followed - up at the end of his interview and asked him to elaborate on what he meant by " fake Christian . "
" I think they want to be judge and jury , " Barkley replied .
" Like , I 'm for gay marriage .
It 's none of my business if gay people want to get married .
I 'm pro-choice .
And I think these Christians , first of all , they 're not supposed to judge other people .
But they 're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country .
And it bugs the hell out of me .
They act like they 're Christians .
They 're not forgiving at all . "
Barkley also explained why he was supporting Barack Obama .
" When i look at him , he represents everything that 's good in the black community , " Barkley said .
" He 's intelligent .
He 's articulate .
You know , most of our role models are athletes or entertainers .
We 've got to get more black kids to be educated , carry themselves with great class and dignity .
He 's perfect for what we need .
We 've got so much black - on - black crime in this country right now .
We 've got a lot of kids not getting their education .
That 's why I 'm supporting him . "
Barkley also reiterated a claim he has made before regarding his intention to run for governor of Alabama .
" I just bought a house in 2007 and in 2014 , I promise you I 'm going to run for governor , " Barkley said .
" You have to have residency for seven years .
I bought my house at the end of last year and I 'll be eligible in 2014 . "
DIGG THIS
George W. Bush should be the poster boy for Hayek ’s dictum of Why the Worst Get On Top ; in other words , he is the worst .
His statements are the worst ; virtually everything that comes out of his mouth is either stupid , illiterate , ill informed , false and / or a lie ( e.g. ; " Major combat operations have ended , " " I ’m the decider . " ) .
His administration is the worst , responsible for putting the US in its worst condition in terms of the economy , military readiness , international standing , education , and medical care .
From the 2000 election to the present , Bush and his administration have consistently and successfully worked to undermine the remains of the constitutional republic that was the United States .
Yet , we must remember that though Bush has accelerated what was a descent into a freefall , the descent itself did n’t start with him and will thus not likely end with him .
I was reminded of this fact recently while following an internet thread .
It started at the blog at Takimag , where there is an interesting remembrance of William Buckley , especially regarding his personality .
Among the civil discourse in the responses was a discussion of the conservative culture journal Modern Age .
The archive of the journal contains all of the back issues starting from volume 1 , number 1 issued in the summer of 1957 .
In that first issue is an article by Felix Morley .
He was a Pulitzer Prize winning editor ( Washington Post ) , a college president ( Haverford College ) , and co-founder of the magazine Human Events .
This apparently very establishment rsum should not obscure the fact that Morley was a stalwart of the Old Right ( " See Joseph R. Stromberg ’s Felix Morley : An Old Fashioned Republican Critic of Statism and Interventionism ( Journal of Libertarian Studies , Vol. 2 , No. 3 , pp 269 — 77 ) and Felix Morley : An Old Fashioned Republican .
Leonard Liggio , in Felix Morley and the Commonwealthman Tradition : The Country - Party , Centralization and the American Empire ( Journal of Libertarian Studies , Vol. 2 , No. 3 , pp. 279 — 86 ) looks at Morley ’s historical analysis of the libertarian movement and the rise of the state .
Of Morley ’s books , Freedom and Federalism ( Indianapolis : Liberty Fund , 1981 [ 1959 ] ) and The Power in the People ( Nash Publishing , 1972 [ 1949 ] ) are his best critiques of imperialism abroad and the welfare state at home . " )
The article from 1957 is called American Republic or American Empire .
I happened to use a green highlighter to mark significant passages , including the title , on my printout of the article .
As a whole , the article was so significant that it became as green as Dublin on St. Patrick ’s Day .
I will present several of these passages below with a few comments ( though they are generally self - evident ) but I highly recommend that you read the article yourself .
The article is preceded by a note from the editors ( among them was Russell Kirk ) that the goal of publishing this particular piece was to " stimulate thought , rather than to express a single point of view . "
Morley ’s opening passage questioned the raison d’être of the American Right during the height of the Cold War , the targeted audience of the new magazine .
We seem to have reached the stage , in our national evolution , where we have a vested interest in preparation for war .
It has become necessary for us to have a powerful enemy .
Soviet Russia is currently our target not only because its economic system is communistic and its political system tyrannical , but perhaps primarily because the Russian organism rivals ours in actual or latent physical power .
Russia could revert to free enterprise , or restore an hereditary Czardom , tomorrow ; and still our Secretary of State would be compelled to question her bona fides .
Peaceful co-existence with Russia is impossible not simply because of Communist plotting but because our economy apparently needs the constant stimulus of a threat of large - scale war .
Today , as NATO pushes east and the bellicosity toward Russia continues years after the fall of the Soviet Union helps prove the truth of Morley ’s hypothetical point .
He then presents a discussion of the economics of the military industrial complex , how it drives foreign policy , and the symbiosis between them .
Simply stated by Morley , " As long as the country is menaced , or thinks itself menaced , Congress will patriotically vote almost unlimited funds for armament , " as the menace lies throughout the world .
In Morley ’s time this was the Soviet menace , today it is terrorism ( and perhaps once again the Russians and Chinese in the future ) .
Furthermore , " Congress , which nominally controls the purse strings , seldom does much to cut the military estimates .
They are presented as essential for the national security , and it is all but impossible for even the most conscientious legislator to prove that they are not essential . "
Robert Higgs has written extensively on how this practice operates today ( e.g. , see here and here ) .
Morley then explains why these economic issues are so serious to the state of our domestic political system .
Political scientists should give much more attention than is customary to the effect of these huge defense appropriations , continued in terms of tens of billions of dollars year after year .
For while the immediate consequences may be primarily financial and economic , the ultimate consequences — which we are now beginning to witness — are political in the deepest sense of the word .
He then gives several examples of the propaganda that is necessary to the empire and the dangers that it leads to .
Today , with increasingly rare exceptions , you only read or hear — in matters of foreign policy — what Washington wants you to read or hear .
And what Washington wants one month may be , and often is , the exact opposite of what Washington wants the next month .
That is why the American people are so bewildered trying to follow the contortions of a foreign policy which first disarms and then rearms the Germans ; which first prohibits and then insists upon Japanese conscription ; which gives tanks to the French in Algeria and then chides the French for using them ; which encourages the Chinese Communists to take over the mainland but then says touch Formosa at your peril ; which first arm Israel against the Arabs and then the Arabs against Israel ; which denounces the Russians for refusing to disarm and then denounces them for offering to disarm .
The net effort of these and many other contradictions is that , while we are undeniably feared , we are no longer either respected or admired abroad .
And , which is more to the point , we are certainly both confused and uneasy here at home .
The fundamental difficulty that gives rise to this painful and dangerous confusion is , I think , clear .
We are trying to make a federal republic do an imperial job , without honestly confronting the fact that our traditional institutions are specifically designed to prevent centralization of power .
With this direct contradiction between the traditional form of our government and the current purposes of our government , a sort of political schizophrenia is inevitable .
It is revealed in wavering , wobbling , and wasteful policies .
The wealth of this country is so great , and its power so enormous , that we can stagger around for a long time , like a drunken giant , with relative immunity .
At some time and at some point , however , this fundamental conflict between our institutions and our policies will have to be resolved .
Thus , it is clear that the transformation of republic to empire was occurring more than 50 years ago .
Furthermore , with the Bush regime ’s continuous onslaught of the Constitution in favor of the unitary executive and a series of horrible blunders at home and abroad that are leading to national collapse , perhaps the point in time that this u201 Cfundamental conflict between our institutions and our policies u201D that Morley suggested is now .

A new legend is born !
Meet the hero from Cambodia who 's got the whole world buzzing -- Magawa !
And Magawa just so happens to be a giant African pouched rat .
Magawa is n't just any rat , he was trained to sniff out landmines and has now been awarded British charity 's top civilian award for animal bravery !
In the past seven years , Magawa has discovered a total of 39 landmines and 28 items of unexploded ordnance .
People 's Dispensary for Sick Animals ( PDSA ) start began as a free vet clinic in 1917 and has been honoring heroic animals 1943 .
Magawa was awarded the PDSA 's gold medal for his " lifesaving bravery and devotion , " according to the charity .
Having cleared over 141,000 square meters of land ( imagine 20 soccer fields ) , it is without a doubt that Magawa is worthy of this award !
APOPO Chief Executive Christophe Cox had this to say about the heroic act , " it is big for the people in Cambodia , and all the people around the world who are suffering from landmines .
The PDSA Gold Medal award brings the problem of landmines to global attention . "
But why use rats to sniff out landmines ?
Turns out , rats are perfect for such a task !
Their small size ( and weight ) allows them to walk across minefields without triggering any explosives .
Before Magawa , this was a canine job .
PDSA also happens to have a Dickin Medal for military service and the medal has since been awarded to 34 dogs , 32 pigeons , 4 horses , and one cat .
However , Magawa is their rat to ever receive a PDSA award !
Congratulations Magawa , thank you for your bravery and helping make this world a safer place for us all .

This is the major part of a lecture delivered in Orange County , California , in October 1944 .
It was published by the Foundation for Economic Education in 2004 .
War is a primitive human institution .
From time immemorial , men were eager to fight , to kill , and to rob one another .
However , the acknowledgment of this fact does not lead to the conclusion that war is an indispensable form of interpersonal relations and that the endeavors to abolish war are against nature and therefore doomed to failure .
We may , for the sake of argument , admit the militarist thesis that man is endowed with an innate instinct to fight and to destroy .
However , it is not these instincts and primitive impulses that are the characteristic features of man .
Man 's eminence lies in his reason and in the power to think , which distinguishes him from all other living creatures .
And man 's reason teaches him that peaceful cooperation and collaboration under the division of labor is a more beneficial way to live than violent strife .
I do not want to dwell on the history of warfare .
It is enough to mention that in the 18th century , on the eve of modern capitalism , the nature of war was very different from what it had been in the age of barbarism .
People no longer fought one another with the aim of exterminating or enslaving the defeated .
Wars were a tool of the political rulers and were fought with comparatively small armies of professional soldiers , mostly made up of mercenaries .
The objective of warfare was to determine which dynasty should rule a country or a province .
The greatest European wars of the 18th century were wars of royal succession , for example , the wars of the Spanish , Polish , Austrian , and finally the Bavarian successions .
Ordinary people were more or less indifferent about the outcomes of these conflicts .
They were not much concerned about the question of whether their ruling prince was a Habsburg or a Bourbon .
Nevertheless , these continuous struggles placed a heavy burden upon mankind .
They were a serious obstacle to the attempts to bring about greater prosperity .
As a result , the philosophers and economists of the time turned their attention to the study of the causes of war .
The result of their investigation was the following :
Under a system of private ownership of the means of production and free enterprise , with the only function of government being to protect individuals against violent or fraudulent attacks on their lives , health , or property , it is immaterial for the citizens of any nation where the frontiers of their country are drawn .
It is of no concern for anyone whether his country is big or small , and whether it conquers a province or not .
The individual citizens do not derive any profit from the conquest of a territory .
It is different with the princes or ruling aristocracies .
They can increase their power and their tax revenues by expanding the size of their realms .
They can profit from conquest .
They are bellicose , while the citizenry is peace loving .
Hence , the old liberals concluded , there would be no more wars under a system of economic laissez faire and popular government .
Wars would become obsolete because the causes for war would disappear .
Since these 18th - and 19th - century classical liberals were fully convinced that nothing could stop the movement toward economic freedom and political democracy , they were certain that mankind was on the eve of an age of undisturbed peace .
What was needed to make the world safe for peace , they argued , was to implement economic freedom , free trade and goodwill among the nations , and popular government .
I want to stress the importance of both of these requirements : free trade at home and in international relations , and democracy .
The fateful error of our age has consisted in the fact that it dropped the first of these requirements , namely free trade , and emphasized only the second one , political democracy .
In doing so , people ignored the fact that democracy cannot be permanently maintained when free enterprise , free trade , and economic freedom do not exist .
President Woodrow Wilson was fully convinced that what was needed to make the world safe for peace was to make it safe for democracy .
During the First World War it was believed that if only the German royal house of the Hohenzollern and the privileged German landed aristocracy , the Junkers , could be removed from power , a durable peace could be achieved .
What President Wilson did not see was that within a world of growing government omnipotence this would not be enough .
In such a world of growing government power , there exist economic causes of war .
Does the Citizen Profit from Conquest ?
The eminent British pacifist , Sir Norman Angell , repeats again and again that the individual citizen cannot derive any profit from the conquest of a province by his own nation .
No German citizen , says Sir Norman , profited through his nation 's annexation of Alsace - Lorraine as a result of the Franco - Prussian War of 1870 – 1871 .
This is quite correct .
But that was in the days of classical liberalism and free enterprise .
It is another thing in our day of government interference with business .
Let us take an example .
The governments of the rubber - producing countries have entered into a cartel arrangement in order to monopolize the market for natural rubber .
They have forced the planters to restrict production in order to raise the price of rubber far above the level it would have attained on a free market .
This is not an exceptional case .
Many vital and essential foodstuffs and raw materials have been subject to similar policies implemented by governments around the world .
They have imposed compulsory cartelization on numerous industries , as a result of which their control was shifted away from private entrepreneurs to the hands of government .
Some of these schemes , it is true , have failed .
But the governments concerned have not abandoned their plans .
They are eager to improve the methods applied and are confident that they will be more successful after the present Second World War .
The individual citizens do not derive any profit from the conquest of a territory .
…
Hence , the old liberals concluded , there would be no more wars under a system of economic laissez faire and popular government .
There is a lot of talk nowadays about the necessity for international planning .
However , no planning , whether it be national or international , is required to make planters grow rubber , coffee , and any other commodity .
They embark upon the production of these commodities because it is the most advantageous way for them to make a living .
Planning in this connection always means government actions for the restraint of output and the establishment of monopoly prices .
Under such conditions it is no longer true that a nation may not appear to derive a tangible profit from a victorious war .
If the nations dependent on the importation of rubber , coffee , tin , cocoa , and other commodities could force the governments of the producing countries to abandon their monopolistic practices , they would improve the economic welfare of their citizens .
To mention this state of affairs does not imply a justification for aggression and conquest .
It only demonstrates how utterly mistaken are pacifists like Sir Norman Angell , who base their arguments in favor of peace on the unstated assumption that all nations are still committed to the principles of free enterprise .
Sir Norman Angell is a member of the British Labour Party .
This party stands for the outright socialization of business .
But the members of the Labour Party are too dull to realize what must be the economic and political consequences of the socialization of business .
The Case of Germany
I want to explain these consequences by referring , first of all , to the situation in Germany .
Like all other European nations , Germany is poor in natural resources .
It can neither feed nor clothe its population out of its own available domestic resources .
Germans must import huge quantities of raw materials and foodstuffs , and must pay for these badly needed imports by exporting manufactures , most of which are produced out of those imported raw materials .
Under free enterprise , Germany brilliantly adjusted itself to this circumstance .
Sixty or seventy years ago , in the 1870s and 1880s , Germany was one of the world 's most prosperous nations .
Its entrepreneurs succeeded extremely well in building up very efficient manufacturing plants .
Germany 's industry was foremost on the European continent .
Its products triumphantly swept the world market .
The Germans — all classes of the German population — became more prosperous from year to year .
There was no reason to alter the structure of German business .
But most of the German ideologists and political writers , the government - appointed professors and the socialist party leaders , as well as the government bureaucrats , did not like the free - market system .
They disparaged it as capitalist , plutocratic , bourgeois , and as Western and Jewish .
They lamented the fact that the free - enterprise system had incorporated Germany into the international division of labor .
All these groups and political parties wanted to substitute government management of business for free enterprise .
They wanted to do away with the profit motive .
They wanted to nationalize business and to subordinate it to the commands of the government .
This is a comparatively simple thing in a country that by and large can live in economic self - sufficiency .
Russia , occupying one - sixth of the earth 's surface , can do without almost any imports from abroad .
But it is different with Germany .
Germany cannot eschew imports and consequently must export manufactures .
This is precisely what a government bureaucracy can never achieve .
Bureaucrats are only able to flourish in sheltered domestic markets .
They are not fit to compete on foreign markets .
Most people in Nazi Germany today want the government to control business .
But the fact is that government control of business and foreign trade are incompatible .
A socialist commonwealth must aim at autarky .
This is where aggressive nationalism — once referred to as Pan - Germanism , and today called National Socialism — comes into the picture .
We are a powerful nation , the National Socialists say ; we are strong enough to crush all other nations .
We must conquer all those countries whose resources are essential for our own economic well - being .
We need autarky and therefore we must fight .
We need Lebensraum ( living space ) and Nahrungs freiheit ( freedom from a scarcity of food ) .
Both terms mean the same thing , the conquest of a territory so large and rich in natural resources that the Germans could live without any foreign trade at a standard of living not lower than that of any other nation .
The term Lebensraum is fairly well known abroad .
But the term Nahrungs freiheit is not .
Freiheit means freedom ; Nahrungs freiheit means freedom from a state of affairs under which Germany must import foodstuffs .
It is the only " freedom " that matters in the eyes of the Nazis .
Both the Communists and the Nazis agree that the essence of what they mean by democracy , liberty , and popular government lies in the establishment of full government control of business .
Whether one calls this system socialism or communism or planning is immaterial .
Regardless of what it is called , this system requires economic self - sufficiency .
But while Russia can , by and large , live in economic self - sufficiency , Germany cannot .
Therefore a socialist Germany is committed to a policy of Lebensraum or Nahrungs freiheit , that is , to a policy of aggression .
The pursuit of a program of government control of business must finally result in a rejection of the international division of labor .
From the viewpoint of Nazi philosophy , the only proper mode of international relations is war .
Their most eminent men take pride in referring to a dictum of Tacitus .
This Roman historian , almost two thousand years ago , said that the Germans consider it shameful to acquire by hard work what could be acquired by bloodshed .
It was not a slip of the tongue when Kaiser Wilhelm II , in 1900 , raised the Huns as a model for his soldiers .
It was the encapsulation of a conscious policy .
Dependent on Imports
Germany is not the only European country depending on foreign imports .
Europe — excluding Russia — has a population of about 400 million people , more than three times the population of the continental United States .
But Europe does not produce cotton , rubber , copra , coffee , tea , jute , and many essential metals .
And it has a quite insufficient production of wool , fodder , cattle , meat , hides , and of many cereals .
In 1937 , Europe produced only fifty - six million barrels of crude petroleum , as compared with the US production of 1,279 million barrels .
Besides , almost all of Europe 's petroleum production is located in Romania and in eastern Poland .
But as a result of the present war , these areas will come under the control of Russia .
Manufacturing and exporting manufactures are the essentials of Europe 's economic life .
However , exporting manufactures is almost impossible under government control of business .
Such is the stark reality which no socialist rhetoric can conjure away .
If the Europeans want to live they must cling to the well - tried methods of free enterprise .
The alternative is war and conquest .
The Germans have tried it twice and failed both times .
However , the politically most influential groups in Europe are far from realizing the indispensability of economic freedom .
In Great Britain and France , in Italy and in some smaller countries there is a powerful agitation for full government control of business .
The case for economic freedom is almost a hopeless cause with the governments of these countries .
The British Labour Party and those British politicians who wrongly still call their party the Liberal Party look upon this war not only as a fight for their nation 's independence , but no less as a revolution for the establishment of government control of business .
The third British party , the Conservative Party , by and large sympathizes with these endeavors .
The British want to defeat Hitler , but they are eager to adopt his economic methods for their own country .
They do not suspect that state socialism in Great Britain spells the doom of the British masses .
Britain must export manufactures in order to buy raw materials and foodstuffs from abroad .
Any drop in British exports lowers the standard of living of the British masses .
Conditions in France and Italy and in most other European countries are similar to those in Great Britain .
In supplying the domestic consumer with various necessities a socialist government is sovereign .
The citizen must take what the government gives him .
But it is different with any export trade .
The foreign consumer buys only if both the quality and the price of the commodity offered for sale are attractive to him .
In this international arena of serving foreign consumers , capitalism has shown its greater efficiency and adaptability .
The high level of prewar Europe 's economic well - being and civilization was not the outcome of the activities of government bureaus and agencies .
It was an achievement of free enterprise .
Those German cameras and chemicals , those British textiles , those Paris dresses , hats , and perfumes , those Swiss watches , and Vienna leather fancy goods were not the product of government - controlled factories .
They were the products of entrepreneurs indefatigably intent upon improving the quality and lowering the price of their merchandise .
Nobody is bold enough to assume that a government agency could successfully replace the private entrepreneurs in this function .
Privately conducted foreign trade is the private affair between private firms of various countries .
If some disagreements result , they are the conflicts between private firms .
They do not create conflicts in the political relations between nations .
They concern a Mr. Meier and a Mr. Smith .
But if foreign trade is a matter of government , such conflicts are transformed into political issues .
Suppose the Dutch government prefers to buy coal from Great Britain rather than from the German Ruhr .
Then the German nationalists may think ,
Why tolerate such behavior on the part of a small nation ?
It took the Third Reich precisely four days to smash the armed forces of the Netherlands in 1940 .
Let us try it again !
Then we will enjoy all the products of the Netherlands , but without having to pay for them .
" Fair " Distribution of Resources
Let us analyze the frequently expressed demand of the Nazi and Fascist aggressors for a new and fair distribution of the natural resources around the globe .
In a world of free enterprise , a man who wants to drink coffee and is not himself a coffee planter must pay for it .
Whether it is a German or an Italian or a citizen of the Republic of Colombia , he must render some services to his fellow men , earn a money income and spend part of it on the coffee he desires .
In the case of a country that does not produce coffee within its own borders , this means exporting goods or resources to pay for the coffee that is imported .
But Messrs .
Hitler and Mussolini do not imagine such a solution to the problem .
What they would want is to annex a coffee - producing country .
But since the citizens of Colombia or Brazil are not enthusiastic about becoming the slaves of either the German Nazis or the Italian Fascists , this means war .
Another striking example is provided by the case of the cotton industry .
For more than a hundred years , one of the main industries of all European countries was the spinning of cotton and the manufacture of cotton goods .
Europe does not grow any cotton .
Its climate is unfavorable .
But the supply was always sufficient , with the only exception being the years during the American Civil War in the 1860s , when the conflict interrupted the supply of cotton from the Southern states .
The European industrial countries acquired enough cotton not only for the needs of their own domestic consumption , but no less for undertaking a considerable export trade in cotton goods .
But in the years just preceding the start of the Second World War , conditions changed .
There was still an ample supply of raw cotton on the world market .
But the system of foreign exchange controls that was adopted by most European countries prevented private businessmen from buying all the cotton they needed for their production processes .
Hitler 's contribution to the decline of the German cotton - goods industry consisted in restricting their production and making them discharge a large part of their workforce .
Hitler did not worry much about the fate of these discharged workers .
He sent them to work , instead , in the munitions factories .
As I already point out , there are no economic causes for armed aggression within a world of free trade and free enterprise .
In such a world , no individual citizen can possibly derive any advantage from the conquest of a province or a colony .
But in a world of totalitarian states , many citizens may come to believe in an improvement of their material well - being from the annexation of a territory rich in resources .
The wars of the 20th century have been , to be sure , economic wars .
But they have not been caused by capitalism , as the socialists would have us believe .
They are wars caused by governments aiming at complete political and economic omnipotence , and have been supported by the misguided masses of these countries .
The three main aggressor nations in this war — Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy , and Imperial Japan — will not attain their ends .
They have been defeated , and they know it already .
But they may try it again at a later date , because their counterfeit philosophy — their totalitarian creed — does not know of any other method of trying to improve the material conditions of the people other than war .
For the totalitarian , conquest is the only viable political means to attain their economic ends .
Economic Mentality
I do not say that all wars of all nations and in all ages were motivated by economic considerations , that is , by the desire to make the aggressors rich at the expense of the defeated .
There is no need for us to investigate the root causes of the crusades or the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries .
What I want to say is that , in our age , the great wars have been the outcome of a specific economic mentality .
The Second World War is certainly not a war between the white and the colored races .
No racial differences separate the British , Dutch , and the Norwegians from the Germans , or the French from the Italians , or the Chinese from the Japanese .
It is not a war between Catholics and Protestants .
After all , there are Catholics and Protestants in both belligerent camps .
It is not a war between democracy and dictatorship .
The claim of several of the United Nations ( Soviet Russia in particular ) to the appellation " democratic " is rather questionable .
On the other hand , Finland ( which is allied with Nazi Germany ) is a country with a democratically elected government .
My argument that recent wars have been motivated by economic considerations is not meant to be a justification of the aggressor 's policies .
Viewed as an economic means for the attainment of certain economic benefits , the policy of aggression and conquest is self - defeating .
Even if technically successful in the short run , it would never attain in the long run the ends at which the aggressors are aiming .
Under the conditions of modern industrialism , there cannot be any question of a social system such as the Nazis plan under the name of a " New Order . "
Slavery is not a method for industrial societies .
If the Nazis had conquered their adversaries , they would have destroyed civilization and brought back barbarism .
They would certainly not have erected a thousand - year New Order , as Hitler promised .
Thus , the main problem is how to avoid new wars .
The answer is not to be found in setting up a better League of Nations ; neither is it a question of the establishment of a better World Court , nor even in the implementation of a World Police Force .
The real issue is to make all nations — or at least the most populous nations of the world — peace loving .
This can be achieved only by going back to free enterprise .
If we want to abolish war , we must remove the causes of war .
The great idol of our time is the State .
The State is a necessary social institution , but it should not be deified .
It is not a god ; it is a device of mortal men .
If we make it an idol , we must sacrifice to it the flower of our youth in coming wars .
What is needed to make a lasting peace is much more than new offices and a new court for the League of Nations in Geneva , or even a new international police force .
What is needed is a change in political ideologies and a return to a sound free - market economic system .
The internet loves bullshit .
While many of its denizens will brag of their skepticism , claim thousands of readers make the best fact - checkers , and say the web holds the mainstream media accountable , the fact remains that made - up bullshit still drives huge traffic , if it 's marketed right .
Hence , " 13 - year - old Steals Dad's Credit Car to Buy Hookers , " a realistic - looking " news story " posted on some financial site no one had ever heard of before called monkey .
co.uk .
The fact that there were no sources other than this dodgy domain did n't stop the story from making the front page of Digg and Fark and racking up probably hundreds of thousands of views .
Then " real " news sites began picking it up .
It made the UK Sun 's print edition .
This tale was invented by an online marketer to boost a client 's SEO ranking .
And no one on Digg or anywhere else BUSTED the hoax .
Nor do they bother to debunk any of the rest of the snappily headlined bullshit that makes the rounds every day .
Four more examples , below .
2. Rememberthe twins who accidentally married each other !
A classic bullshit story that probably garnered CNN millions of views .
3 . The man regrowing his own finger story !
It involved pixie dust and still everyone who linked bought it .
4. Aliza Shvarts violating human biology by impregnating herself a million times and then inducing abortions with magic herbal remedies .
Not even the abortion pill , but herbs .
Honestly .
5. Jenkem .
Most of these stories were eventually revealed as frauds , but usually not until days later — always well after everyone had forwarded them to everyone they knew .
And this shit happens every day .
Especially with almost any story involving nude people doing something outrageous , especially in far away places .
( That one 's on Fark ! )
So .
If you see egregious bullshit linked to on some high - traffic message board or blog , let us know , and we will publicly shame everyone involved .

The AP reports that what makes Playas , New Mexico an ideal training ground is the fact that it is a real town with real people living there .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is spending $ 22 million dollars per year on a terror training program within a real town in New Mexico where helicopters buzz overhead in the middle of the night , mock nuclear explosions are drilled and " suicide bombers " are taken down by SWAT teams who pull citizens out of their homes .
The AP reports that what makes Playas , New Mexico an ideal training ground is the fact that it is a real town with real people living there .
There are a number of families in the town that are totally unconnected to the training and go about their daily lives while martial law scenarios are played out around them .
" Just a few years ago it was a ghost town abandoned after a large mining company pulled out , " the AP ’s Rich Matthews reports .
" Today , it ’s a training ground for the unthinkable : Nuclear attacks , invasions and suicide bombings in the United States . "
" We have helicopters in the middle of the night flying overhead and explosions that can take place at all hours , " resident Kim Kvame says .
" It gets to be a part of the background noise that just lets you know you ’re home after a while . "
So , SWAT teams and troops running around with choppers circling overhead , sounds real homely .
Why does the Federal government believe that terrorists would be residing in sleepy small town America ?
Why is it important to train SWAT teams to pull people out of homes in American towns ?
The answer is simple , because the Federal government sees the citizens of America as possible insurgents or terrorists .
We have previously reported on the Homeland Security initiative titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of " all removable aliens " and " potential terrorists . "
Playas is owned by New Mexico Tech , constituting a division of the university ’s Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center .
There are plans to expand the center dramatically in the near future .
In 2004 New Mexico
Tech bought the town using a $ 5 million grant from the Department of Homeland Security to begin converting the town into the nation ’s primary counter - terrorism training facility .

Playas , New Mexico
We have previously reported on many incidents where purpose built mock American towns and cities have been used for so called terror training , yet in this case the Feds have gone a step further .
This is not the first FEMA terror training program to raise serious questions .
In May 2006 , we exposed the existence of a nationwide FEMA program which is training Pastors and other religious representatives to become secret police enforcers who teach their congregations to " obey the government " in preparation for the implementation of martial law , property and firearm seizures , mass vaccination programs and forced relocation .
A whistleblower who was secretly enrolled into the program told us that the feds were clandestinely recruiting religious leaders to help implement Homeland Security directives in anticipation of a potential bio- terrorist attack , any natural disaster or a nationally declared emergency .
The first directive was for Pastors to preach to their congregations Romans 13 , the often taken out of context bible passage that was used by Hitler to hoodwink Christians into supporting him , in order to teach them to " obey the government " when martial law is declared .
It was stressed that the Pastors needed to preach subservience to the authorities ahead of time in preparation for the round - ups and to make it clear to the congregation that " this is for their own good . "
It was related to the Pastors that quarantines , martial law and forced relocation were a problem for state authorities when enforcing federal mandates due to the " cowboy mentality " of citizens standing up for their property and second amendment rights as well as farmers defending their crops and livestock from seizure .
It was stressed that the Pastors needed to preach subservience to the authorities ahead of time in preparation for the round - ups and to make it clear to the congregation that " this is for their own good . "
Pastors were told that they would be backed up by law enforcement in controlling uncooperative individuals and that they would even lead SWAT teams in attempting to quell resistance .
Though some doubted the accuracy of this report at the time due to its fundamentally disturbing implications , the story was later confirmed by a KSLA 12 news report , in which participating clergy and officials admitted to the existence of the program .
In 2002 , FEMA sought bids from major real estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities in the case of a chemical , biological or nuclear attack or a natural disaster .
Okanogan County Commissioner Dave Schulz went public three years ago with his contention that his county was set to be a location for one of the camps .

Maternal love :
How a mother 's brain responds to her infant
-end -
Philadelphia , PA , February 28 , 2008 -
The distinctive ability of mothers to identify the cries of their offspring is widely evident in nature , where it is critical to the survival of these offspring .
In humans , we are aware that the distinctive ability of mothers to recognize and respond to the smiles and cries of their babies plays an important role in the psychological , cognitive , and social development of these babies .
We have had a very limited understanding of how the maternal brain accomplishes these amazing feats , but a new study published in the February 15th issue of Biological Psychiatry now provides some new insight .
Noriuchi , Kikuchi , et al. used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , a tool that enables scientists to study the function of brain circuits in people , to examine patterns of maternal brain activation .
The authors asked healthy mothers to view video clips , which showed either their own infant ( approximate age of 16 months ) or an unknown infant in two emotional conditions - either happy or upset / crying .
Dr. Madoka Noriuchi , senior author on the paper explains their findings : " We found that a limited number of mother 's brain areas were specifically related to maternal love , and the specific pattern of mother 's response was observed for her infant 's attachment behaviors evoking mother 's care - taking behaviors for vigilant protectiveness . "
In other words , they discovered that particular circuits in the brain , involving several regions in the cerebral cortex and limbic system , are distinctively activated when mothers distinguish the smiles and cries of their own infants from those of other infants .
The authors also found that a mother responds more strongly to the crying than the smiling of her own infant , which , according to the authors , seems " to be biologically meaningful in terms of adaptation to specific demands associated with successful infant care .
" John H. Krystal , M.D. , Editor of Biological Psychiatry and affiliated with both Yale University School of Medicine and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System , discusses the importance of this study : " This type of knowledge provides the beginnings of a scientific understanding of human maternal behavior .
This knowledge could be helpful some day in developing treatments for the many problems and diseases that may adversely affect the mother - infant relationship .

North Korea has been dismantling the Yongbon site
North Korea has handed over more than 18,000 pages of records on its nuclear weapons programme to the US .
The documents log activities at North Korea 's plutonium reactor at Yongbyon , which is thought to have produced the material for nuclear tests in 2006 .
North Korea shut down the reactor last year , but failed to meet a deadline to give a full account of its nuclear activities .
A US negotiator was due to take the documents to Washington to be examined .
North Korea agreed in February 2007 to give up its nuclear weapons programme in return for large - scale aid and the lifting of sanctions .
The deal was agreed following six - party talks between China , the US , Japan , Russia and North and South Korea .
Sceptics
The BBC's John Sudworth reports from South Korea that the Yongbyon documents will provide an important glimpse into North Korea 's bomb - making past , though some will question just how much new information they will contain .
Doubts over North Korea 's other nuclear activities remain , in particular its alleged secret uranium enrichment programme and the transfer of nuclear technology to Syria , he says .
Those are the issues that have been holding up progress on last year 's agreement .
North Korea has reportedly agreed to a compromise solution under which it will merely acknowledge US concerns .
Some Republicans in Washington were sceptical about the importance of the documents .
" Any mediocre performance by North Korea is taken as an earth - shattering positive development by our state department , " said Congressman Peter Hoekstra .
US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said that once the documents were back in Washington " our top three priorities are going to be verification , verification , verification " .

Democratic front runner Barack Obama is now only 154 delegates short of wrapping up his Party ’s nomination after Maine Rep. , and 2008 Senate candidate , Tom Allen endorsed him this morning .
“ Most of the primary voters across the nation have now spoken .
It is time to bring a graceful end to the primary campaign .
We now need to unify the Democratic Party and focus on electing Senator Obama and a working majority in the United States Senate .
That is how we can change the direction of the country , ” Allen said .
Allen discussed what happened in the Maine caucuses , “ In February I watched a new generation of Mainers become involved in our nominating process because they were energized and hopeful about the future .
I watched Independents and Democrats – and even a lot of Republicans — in Maine enthusiastically support Barack Obama because they believe he can and will put America back on track . ”

For his part Obama gave a huge endorsement to Allen ’s Senate campaign .
“ I ’ve had the opportunity to meet voters from every corner of Maine , and they have spoken with one voice about the need for real change .
There ’s no question that Tom ’s record of service , his tenacity , and his judgment will make him an excellent Senator .
I ’m thrilled to be working alongside him in this critical election , and I look forward to working with him as President , ” Obama said .
This is the first of what I expect to be many “ coattail endorsements . ”
Candidates should be metaphorically knocking each other over to get a prized Obama endorsement .
Allen is correct in pointing out that without a working majority in the Senate a President Obama wo n’t be able to get anything done .
Taking back the White House is only half the equation for Democrats .
They also expand their majorities in the House and Senate to be able to advance their agenda .
Remember , that it takes 60 votes to pass a bill in the Senate .
The Democrats need to pick up a handful of seats , or we can forget about healthcare reform , and many other domestic changes , but I think Obama will have coattails in the fall , and carry with him many new Democrats to the House and Senate .
Read the full endorsement :

Astroboyboy123 posted this interesting time lapse video last week on YouTube of commuters arriving at one of the Finch Subway station ’s parking lots in the morning .
The video starts around 7AM and within 1 hour and 40 minutes , the long and massive parking is completely filled up with cars , most of which are single occupants .
Watching the cars quickly filling up the space , and occupants then walking to the subway is surprisingly and strangely engrossing .
Thanks to askrobot at Urban Toronto Forum for posting this and bringing it to may attention .
The RIAA has declared victory over Russian music download store AllofMP3 , which it accused of the illegal distribution of millions of copyright tracks .
The site , which was declared legal by a court last October , no longer offers music - but has spawned dozens of fully operational spin - offs .
Victory for RIAA ?
Not quite .
When pressure from the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and the United States government caused the Kremlin to take down AllofMP3 in mid 2007 , the RIAA must ’ve been jumping for joy .
Before the shutdown , AllOfMP3 had around 6 million users who were able to download songs and albums for a tiny fraction of the price of authorized alternatives such as iTunes .
The RIAA said it could not live with this situation .
In December 2006 , the RIAA filed a complaint against the site , stating that AllofMP3 sold millions of tracks to the public yet gave no money back to their artists .
According to a report , on May 20th 2008 the RIAA filed papers in federal court , Manhattan , dropping its copyright infringement lawsuit against AllofMP3 .
“ The site is now defunct and out of business , the result of a successful anti-piracy initiative , ” Jonathan Lamy , an RIAA spokesman told Bloomberg .
Notably , Lamy did not mention a fully operational site set up by the same people as AllofMP3 , called Mp3 Sparks .
Different name , same tunes , no lawsuit .
AllofMP3 was blocked by a Swedish ISP back in 2006 when it got caught up in the anti-AllofMP3 hysteria but later retracted its stance .
In August 2007 , AllofMP3 was acquitted in Russia of all charges that had been put forward by IFPI and on October 24th 2007 , a district court in Moscow confirmed the innocent verdict .
“ They [ RIAA ] never correctly commenced the proceeding in the first place , ” said John Crossman , who represented the site ’s owner , MediaServices LLC .
“ Maybe it was a rare triumph of good sense . ”
In the meantime , dozens of similar sites operate in Russia , delivering super - cheap music to the masses in much the same way as AllofMP3 did .
Victory for the RIAA ?
Not quite .

Yesterday , congress reached a compromise bill to provide aid to those facing foreclosure or already in the midst of a foreclosure .
This $ 15 - 20 billion dollar bill ( all puns intended ) will attempt to help deflate the housing bubble in a more controlled manner , and try to prevent the U.S. economy from going into ( more ) of a tailspin .
Debate has been going on over one particular point ;
The ability of bankruptcy judges to unilaterally modify the mortgage agreements for those filing bankruptcy .
Ultimately , to get the bill to a point where it even had a HOPE of passing , it had to be removed from the proposed bill .
That means that even with bankruptcy proceedings , the most that can happen is to restructure the existing debt .
If the person (s ) filing bankruptcy can’t pay for the house under ANY means , it ’s still going back to the bank .
What the Bill Does
There ’s a number of things the bill will allow to happen to help those that are about to lose their homes , and to help others and the economy deal with the existing HUGE backlog of foreclosed properties .
As written ( and remember , it ’s still in the debate phase , so things can change , or the president could veto it entirely )
Provide a $ 7000 tax credit , split over two years , for buyers of homes that are about to go to foreclosure or already in foreclosure .
The issuance of $ 10 Billion worth of tax - free bonds , with the proceeds to go to help refinance mortgages in trouble ( the criteria or selection process has n’t been completely explained yet ) .
The net operating loss carry - back tax rule for 2008 - 2009 would be extended by two years .
That means that related industries ( contractors , builders , materials suppliers and a whole myriad of other businesses related to the housing market ) could write off their losses over 4 years , instead of the standard 2 .
It might make the difference between surviving and bankruptcy to some smaller businesses to do this .
Provide existing homeowners with a standard tax deduction of $ 500 for single filers or $ 1000 for joint filers .
Finally , a little reward for keeping yourself in check !
The FHA loan limit would rise to 110 percent of an area ’s median home price , with a cap of $ 550,000 and a 3 - 1/ 2 percent down payment required from the borrower .
This is an increase from the previous loan amounts the FHA would guarantee in years past .
Provide cities and communities with $ 4 Billion in federal grant money to purchase , fix up ( where necessary ) and resell foreclosed houses in the area .
This is to prevent many of the ‘ housing deserts ’ that are starting to crop up in some cities ;
Large tracts of either unsold houses , or houses that have been foreclosed on , causing the surrounding area to be virtually abandoned .
Provide for debt counseling ; $ 100 million would go to provide free ‘ Mortgage Counselors ’ ( already free through the FHA , but in limited numbers ) to work with families to find alternatives to foreclosure , and to negotiate with lenders on the borrowers behalf to try to broker a better mortgage deal .
Put in place a stipulation for lenders to follow special procedures for U.S. Armed forces members coming back from combat .
This would hopefully allow our returning military members the chance to have some breathing room and get their affairs back in order before any dire financial actions would be taken by the lenders .
Another great provision of this bill , in my opinion .
Require lenders to MAKE the borrowers read and understand what they are getting into when they get a mortgage .
( If this had been in force before , I ’m betting a lot of the Adjustable Rate Mortgage buyers might have thought twice before getting into their situations ) .
Who Foots the Bill for the Bill
Of course There Ain’t No Such Thing as a Free Lunch ( TANSTAAFL ) and this is no exception .
It ’s going to come out of taxpayer money .
If you ’ve visited before , you know I ’m none too fond of the idea of paying for someone else ’s mistakes on the mortgage front , but there is a point where you just have to bite the bullet and do what ’s in the best interest of the country .
I think we ’ve reached that point , and maybe a bit beyond .
This housing bubble , no matter who ’s fault it is or how it was triggered , has grown to the point that it threatens to do some serious damage to the U.S. economy , and by extension , the entire world economy .
Sen . ’s Clinton and Obama are both in favor of pretty powerful legislation ( see above ) to stem the flow of financial blood from this wound , while Sen.
McCain is in a more ‘ let the industry correct itself ’ opinion .
I think that either solution might be a little too far ( in either the liberal or conservative directions ) , but this bill being discussed is starting to sound like an acceptable compromise to do what has to be done for our economy ,
This may be just the first legislation ( with more to come ) to address the housing crisis , but something substantial needs to be done before the patient ( the U.S. economy ) bleeds out from all the financial problems .
Even a band - aid at this point would be an improvement .
What do you think about the proposed housing bill ?
Too much , or not enough ??
What would you add to it if you could ?
Leave us a comment and let us know .
The White House has admitted in court that it has lost three months of email backups from the initial days of the Iraq war , raising questions about the possible deletion of politically sensitive records .
The disclosure came in a lawsuit filed by the National Security Archive , a non-profit group that specialises in uncovering classified documents .
The archive was told it could not receive emails relating to Iraq , despite a 30 - year - old law requiring the preservation of presidential records , because a system upgrade had deleted up to 5 m emails .
George Bush 's administration faced a deadline of this week to outline the contents of 438 backup tapes that were believed to contain emails deleted in 2003 between March — when the US invaded Iraq — and September .
In a court filing yesterday , however , White House chief information officer Theresa Payne said " the earliest date " with email on any of the tapes was May 23 2003 : the date the UN gave formal approval to the US occupation of Iraq .
" What is most shocking is that if anyone at the White House was deleting their emails during the invasion of Iraq , those e-mails are not on any backup tapes , " Tom Blanton , director of the archive , said .
Payton also told the US courts that verifying the contents of the tapes between late May and September of 2003 would be overly costly and an administrative burden .
Congress has begun an investigation of its own into a White House recordkeeping under George Bush , whose aides eliminated an automatic email archive programme used by predecessor Bill Clinton .
The loss of White House emails also proved an obstacle to Patrick Fitzgerald , the special prosecutor investigating the leaked identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame .
Fitzgerald said in 2006 that he believed some potentially relevant emails sent by aides in vice president Dick Cheney 's office were lost in the Bush administration 's email system .
Nobody cares if your puns were intended .
People who point out their puns are like comedians who explain their jokes : they both think you 're too stupid to get it .
The only good thing about the phrase " pun intended " is that it saves you time when you want to say " hello , I 'm going to be at the bag convention this weekend , please be sure to stop by and say ' hi . '
I 'll be at the douche exhibit . "
Here 's the deal : when you point out your puns , you 're making a value judgement on me , the reader .
You 're saying :
Hey reader , you see that play on words I just made ?
Yeah , well that was n't an accident .
In fact , I thought it was so clever that I did n't think your simple mind would be able to comprehend the brilliance of my play on words , and I wanted to make sure you know that I 'm not only smart enough to use homonyms , but that I 'm smart enough to point them out .
The sheer level of narcissism it takes to think that anyone gives a shit about whether or not you meant to write your pun is mind boggling .
If narcissism were measured in units of mass , the skulls of people who pointed out puns would crush in on themselves in a giant black hole of stupidity .
The other variation of calling attention to a pun is the pun denial , or " no pun intended , " which is a less formal way of saying : Dear Reader , Please direct your attention towards my pun .
Admittedly I do think it 's clever , but I think that you think so highly of me , that I want you to know that I would never resort to using such a commonplace literary device in my prose .
Therefore , I would like to formally renounce my attempt at humor and assure you that I am above making puns as a writer , as a pupil of language , and as citizen of Earth .
Sincerest apologies ,
D. Baggerson
The phrase " no pun intended " makes me want to band saw my dick off just in case I 'm the last man alive and I have to risk repopulating Earth with some moron 's incapable vagina .
There 's no such thing as an unintentional pun ; the act of typing the phrase " no pun intended " makes it intentional .
If your pun truly was n't intended , then why did n't you erase it and write something else , asshole ?
I read an exchange the other day between some loser flirting with some lonely single mom on a message board for lonely single losers ( not to preclude one from the other , no reason you can't be both ) .
The guy 's avatar said " IRISH 4 LIFE , " and his profile stated that he 's a " Dave Matthews Band " fan , so already his face is high on my list of places I would like to rest my feet ( Dave Matthews fans are like the trans - fats of fandom : oversaturated with obnoxiousness , found everywhere , and impossible to get rid of ; for example , they only refer to the band as DMB ... you can't abbreviate the word ' band ' assholes , it 's a band by virtue of the fact that there is more than 1 person in it , and for the record , adding the word ' band ' to your name does n't make you any less of an egotistical shit head ) .
Man , you know what I hate ?
Dave Matthews .
It 's the whitest band ever , which is saying something considering 3 of the members are black , and Dave Matthews is literally an African American ( born in South Africa ) .
His music can be heard in Whole Foods stores , Live Earth concerts , or blasting from the speakers of open - topped Jeeps parked on curbs everywhere .
The typical fan is either some dude wearing khaki cargo shorts replete with dangling rock climbing hooks , even though he does n't hike because he can't afford to drive his gas - guzzling Jeep , or some chick with huge boobs , buck teeth , and an ankle - length floral skirt that she twirls around like an idiot because she thinks her awesome boobs give her enough social capital to make up for the buck teeth and hairy toes ( they do n't ) :
So anyway , I signed up for an account so I could send this guy hate mail for being a " DMB " fan since that was enough , but what I read next made me so mad that I headbutt myself in the face .
He was trying so hard to impress this chick , that he made a pun and followed it with " ( and yes , pun intended ! ! ) "
So not only did he point out his pun , but he took it a step further and answered an imaginary rhetorical question that nobody was asking .
Here 's how the conversation played out in his head :
IRISH4LIFE : " Fighting global warming is cool . "
Hmm , I wonder if people will get the subtle association between the word " cool " and the concept of " global warming , " since global warming has to do with heat , and the word cool has to do with cultural attitudes and perceptions as well as how chill something is .
Holy shit , another pun !
I 'm on fire !
HOLY SHIT !
Three puns in a row ?!
I 'm so getting laid .
But what if she reads it and does n't get it ?
I can picture her in my head : Lonely mom : " Wait !
Did you intentionally --" IRISH4LIFE : I 'd better cut her off mid-sentence while she 's thinking by adding the parenthetical : " ( yes ! yes , that was intentional ) . "
You 've still got it , Irish .
Ho ho ho !
Laugh it up , dickwad .
People who point out their puns should be put to sleep ( gassed ) .
None of the 2,272,326 uses of the word " pun " on this page were unintentional .

The ladies who lunch do not obsess about their weight in the rhesus monkey compound at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta .
Food is freely available , and the high - status females do not pride themselves on passing it up .
They do n’t seem to stigmatize obesity  there is no equivalent of a Kirstie Alley joke  and they certainly do n’t turn themselves into Social X - Rays .
In fact , the dominant females ordinarily eat a little more than the subordinates .
The lower status monkeys can get as much food as they want but seem to have less of a desire to eat , perhaps because of the higher level of stress hormones in their brain .
The anxiety of constantly toadying to their social superiors seems to curb their appetite , researchers suspect , at least when their regular high - fiber , low - fat chow is on the menu .
But suppose you tempted them with the equivalent of chocolate and potato chips and ice cream ?
Mark Wilson , a neuroscientist at Emory University , and a team tried that experiment at Yerkes by installing feeders with a constant supply of banana - flavored pellets  not exactly Dove bars , but they had enough sugar and fat to appeal even to human palates .
( In the interest of science , I sampled a few pellets . )
Once these foods were available , the low - status monkeys promptly developed an appetite .
They began eating significantly more calories than their social superiors .
While the dominant monkeys dabbled in the sweet , fatty pellets just during the daytime , the subordinate monkeys kept scarfing them down after dark .
That 's from campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe on MSNBC today :
Russert : Last month .
You guys raised 10 million .
McAuliffe :
We won the fourth quarter and the third quarter .
We actually raised more in '07 than Barack Obama did .
Russert : How 's your money holding up ?
McAuliffe :
It 's good .
I mean , he -- you said 10 .
We actually about did about 13 1/2 , which I was very proud of .
We had more cash on hand at the end of ' 07 .
He had a great January .
Hats off .
I 've been raising money for a long time .
All the compliments in the world to the Obama campaign .
They raised a lot of money on the internet .
I heard over 25 million on the internet .
Congratulations to them .
No one should be worried about Hillary Clinton , though .
We will always have our resources to get our message out .
At a recent book party for Winslow Wheeler ’s new history of the military reform movement of the 1970s and 1980s , I was asked for my views on the prospects for genuine reform .
I replied that “ So long as the money flow continues , nothing will change . ”
Chuck Spinney , a reformer who spent decades as a polyp in the bowels of the Pentagon , agreed .
Events on Wall Street suggest that the day when the money flow stops may be approaching .
Despite President Hoover ’s assurance that “ Prosperity is just around the corner , ” the American economy is in free - fall .
After decades of frivolity , that economy now amounts to little more than a pyramid of financial pyramids , all requiring a constant inflow of borrowed money .
The inflow is endangered by the developing Panic of ’ 08 , where the junk mortgage crisis and the collapse of the housing market combine to dry up lending .
What happens to pyramid schemes when money stops flowing in at the bottom ?
Maybe a recession ; maybe a depression .
That ’s why pyramid schemes are illegal , unless the government runs them .
A tanking economy and world credit markets tighter than Scrooge ’s sphincter will require large cuts in federal spending .
That will include the Pentagon .
If a new administration were to turn to the military reformers and ask us how to cut defense spending while still securing the country , what would we advise ?
Here ’s what I would propose :
First , adopt a defensive rather than an offensive grand strategy .
America followed a defensive grand strategy through most of her history .
We only went to war if someone attacked us .
That defensive grand strategy kept defense costs down and allowed our economy to prosper .
We do not have to be party to every quarrel in the world .
Second , scrap virtually all the big - ticket weapons programs such as new fighter - bombers , more Aegis ships , and the Army ’s Rube Goldbergian Future Combat System .
They are irrelevant to where war is going .
We should not plan for conventional wars against hypothetical “ peer competitors , ” which can only be Russia or China .
We should do our utmost to make Russia an ally , and we should make a fundamental , bipartisan national strategic decision that we will not go to war with China .
Regardless of who “ won ” such a war , it would destroy both countries , just as the two World Wars destroyed both Germany and Britain .
The world needs China to serve as a source of order in what will be an increasingly disorderly 21st century .
We should welcome the growth of Chinese power , just as Britain learned ( reluctantly ) to welcome the growth of American power in the 20th century .
It is only a threat to us if we make it one .
Third , as we cut , preserve combat units .
That means , above all , Army and Marine Corps infantry battalions .
Cut the vast superstructure above those battalions , but keep the battalions .
Infantry battalions are what we need most for Fourth Generation wars , which we should do our utmost to avoid but which we will sometimes be drawn into , even with a defensive grand strategy .
In the Navy , keep the submarines .
Submarines are today ’s and tomorrow ’s capital ships , and geography dictates we must remain a maritime power .
Keep the carriers , too , though there is little need to build more of them .
Carriers are big , empty boxes , which can carry many things besides aircraft .
Mothball most of the cruisers and destroyers .
Build lots of small , cheap ships useful for controlling coastal and inland waters , and create strategically mobile and sustainable “ packages ” of such ships .
Being able to control waters around and within stateless regions can be important in 4GW .
Fighter - bombers are largely useless in Fourth Generation wars , where their main role is to create collateral damage that benefits our enemies .
Keep the air transport squadrons and the A - 10s , and move them all to the Air National Guard , which flies and maintains aircraft as well as or better than the regular Air Force at a fraction of the cost .
Reduce the regular Air Force to strategic nuclear forces and a training base .
In all the services , vastly reduce the baggage train : the higher headquarters , the development commands , the education bureaucracies , and the armies of contractors .
As Mark Twain said of the male teat , they are neither useful nor ornamental .
Finally , as we cut , undertake reforms that cost little but will make our remaining forces more effective .
Reform the personnel systems to create unit cohesion , eliminate the surplus of officers above the company grades and reduce careerism by ending up - or - out .
Reform tactics and doctrine by moving from the Second Generation to the Third , which is to say from French attrition warfare to German maneuver warfare .
This requires a change in military culture , in education , and in training .
The adoption of Third Generation tactics , doctrine , and culture must be real , not just words on paper as it has been in the Marine Corps .
A program of military reform along these lines could give us more effective forces for Fourth Generation wars and such minor conventional wars as we might face within a defensive grand strategy than the forces we now possess .
It could do so for a defense budget half or less the size of the current budget .
To the reigning military - industrial - congressional complex , that potential is a threat , not a promise .
When the MICC ’s money runs out , it will suddenly become a necessity .
Is Hilary Rosen a sign of things to come ?
May 27 , 2008 at 11:10 pm
We all love us some Huffpo .
The # 1 Technorati blog .
I do n’t even know if blog is the right term for this news site .
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut ( That ’s a long but ) they just hired a new political director .
No , not a politician or journalist .
They hired a former CEO of the RIAA .
Hilary Rosen , whose time at the RIAA included :
The dismantling of the Napster and Audiogalaxy Internet file - trading services .
Passage of the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Initiating the Grokster lawsuit on which the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the record industry
Passage of the Performance Rights
Act creating a public performance right for the first time for sound recordings
Passage of the Record Rental

3 Things Your CEO Wants to Know
A lot of people who move up through an IT organization are surprised to find that the higher in the IT organization they get , the less the job is about technology .
At the very top of the IT organization in the CIO role , the focus is n’t on IT at all – it ’s on doing the best thing for the business .
In fact , Peter Whatnell , CIO of Sunoco and 2009 President of SIM International , recently said that most CEOs just want the CIO to provide answers to three questions :
Where do we need to invest ?
How do we stand versus competition ?
How do we mitigate risk ?
If you think about it , these are three very good questions for an IT organization , yet none of the questions is technical , and none of the questions requires a technical answer .
Let ’s look at each of the three questions in more detail :
1 . Where do we need to invest ?
The key word here is “ invest . ”
That ’s because business executives consider IT an investment – an investment in greater revenue , increased profits , higher customer satisfaction , and other things that have benefit to the business .
For something to be a good investment , it has to provide positive results that exceed the cost of making the investment , and that ’s true for IT as much as it ’s true for any financial investment .
So do n’t bother to propose a project for which there ’s no clear business benefit .
What ’s the point in investing if there ’s no return ?
2 . How do we stand versus competition ?
It would be nice to envision a CEO as having lofty visions of the future which do n’t require consideration of the competition .
But that ’s unrealistic ; the world tends to compare companies that have similar products and services , and investors in a company ’s stock certainly look at competing alternatives .
While it ’s easy to compare revenue and profit numbers for competitors , it ’s more difficult to compare Information Technology .
You have to examine the processes used for each major aspect of the business , look at the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes , and then drill down to the underlying systems and technologies being used for each process .
If a particular business process being used by a competitor is more efficient or effective than the equivalent process in your own company , then your company is at a disadvantage .
If you net out the comparison of your processes to the equivalent competitor processes , and the competitor ends up ahead of the game , then there ’s potential cause for action , and it may be time to invest in the improvement of your own processes and systems .
But do n’t just copy your competitors ; try to do something that ’s better .
Your competitors certainly wo n’t sit still and leave things as they are .
And if your processes are better than all of your competitor ’s processes , then broaden your definition of “ competitor . ”
Look at companies that have a similar process to one of your processes , even if that company does n’t offer competing products and services .
For example , L.L. Bean was at one point regarded as the leader in order fulfillment ( they may still be the leader ; I have n’t kept up ) .
Even if your company does n’t compete with L.L. Bean , if you have an order fulfillment process in your company then you might want to benchmark your processes against L.L.
Bean ’s and see if you can learn something about how to improve your own order fulfillment process .
3 . How do we mitigate risk ?
There are two important things to notice in this question .
First , there ’s no qualifying adjective in front of the word “ risk . ”
We ’re not talking about IT risk here ; we ’re talking about risk in general .
So this is more than just the question “ How do we mitigate information technology risk ? ”
It includes that , of course , but it also includes the question “ How do we use technology to mitigate business risk ? ”
It ’s important for CIOs to look at both of these issues : how to mitigate IT risk as well as new ways that IT can be applied in the business to mitigate overall business risk .
Here ’s an example of the difference .
You can mitigate some IT risk by having redundant servers in multiple locations .
You can mitigate some business risk by figuring out a way to reduce the impact of high fuel prices on your company by implementing a system to optimize truck routes or to reduce travel by using videoconferencing .
The second important thing to notice in the question is the use of the word “ mitigate ” which means “ to lessen the impact or intensity of . ”
No sane executive expects to eliminate risk , since risk is a part of the world in which we live .
We take steps to minimize risk where it ’s appropriate , but it gets expensive to reduce risk beyond a certain point of diminishing returns .
Business executives take a two - step approach to risk : reduce risk where it ’s cost effective , and then mitigate the remaining risk to the extent possible .
Conclusion
Wise executives know that CIOs will do everything possible to manage their IT resources wisely .
It ’s expected that this management will take time out of a CIO ’s busy day , but this day - to - day IT management role is just a basic part of the job , taken for granted like breathing , eating and sleeping .
Where the CIO really contributes to the business is in the added value that IT brings to the table beyond the day - to - day .
Peter Whatnell ’s three questions get to the heart of that contribution .
How would you answer the three questions for your CEO ?
Or are you too busy working on the day - to - day stuff to be able to answer them ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - When President George W. Bush makes his final tour of European capitals next week , he can expect a less - than - fond farewell on a continent where leaders are already looking past him to his successor .
President Bush accompanied by first lady Laura Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne arrive for the Congressional Picnic on the South Lawn of the White House , June 5 , 2008 .

Behind the smiles and handshakes , there will be quiet relief among his European hosts who see an end to the Bush era as a chance for the next president to repair a U.S. image abroad that has been damaged by the Iraq war and other policies .
Bush will use a U.S. - European Union summit in Slovenia as a launching point for his June 9 - 16 trip and then will travel to Germany , Italy , France and Britain -- trans -Atlantic partners with whom he has not always seen eye to eye .
He also will visit Northern Ireland and meet Pope Benedict at the Vatican .
Despite his busy itinerary , Bush ’s tour will be a reminder of his waning international influence as the world waits to see whether fellow Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama wins the White House in the November election .
“ Bush will travel in a little bubble from palace to palace , ” said Joseph Cirincione , a Washington foreign policy analyst .
“ He ’ll have welcoming ceremonies , photo ops , even some praise -- and then he ’ll be quickly forgotten . ”
With less than eight months to go before Bush leaves office , European leaders are expected to offer him little if anything to narrow the gap with Washington on issues like climate change , a resurgent Russia and a defiant Iran .
Mindful that Bush is even more unpopular across much of Europe than he is at home , the White House itself has no lofty hopes for Bush ’s trip , which is expected to draw large protests in countries where anti-Bush sentiment runs highest .
Still , Bush aides are hopeful his personal diplomacy with allies like France and Germany will help put once - bitter divisions over Iraq behind them , giving a much - needed boost to his battered legacy .
“ I do n’t think you ’re going to see dramatic announcements on this trip , ” said Stephen Hadley , Bush ’s national security adviser .
He said the goal instead would be limited to trying to “ advance the ball ” on a range of issues .
As the Bush presidency winds down , the White House also wants to showcase improved relations with Germany , France and Italy under ideologically like - minded leaders and safeguard America ’s “ special relationship ” with Britain .
“ OBAMA - MANIA , EUROPEAN - STYLE ”
But wherever Bush goes , he will find Europeans increasingly focused on whomever will succeed him in January 2009 .
“ Leaders in Europe are already looking beyond Bush and apart from a few things that can still be done with him ... the attention is now on Obama and McCain , ” said Antonio Missiroli , research director of the European Policy Centre in Brussels .
Across the continent , there are hopes the next U.S. president will adopt a different approach from what Bush ’s critics have derided as “ cowboy diplomacy . ”
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , seems the favorite among Europeans .
A recent poll in London ’s Daily Telegraph showed him with 52 per cent support across five major countries , Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Russia , while McCain received only 15 percent .
“ It ’s Obama - mania , European style , ” said Reginald Dale , a European affairs expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
“ They ’re nuts about him . ”
Many Europeans admire Obama ’s stated willingness to talk to Iran and other U.S. foes largely shunned by Bush and also like his promise to wind down U.S. military involvement in Iraq .
Obama and McCain both win high marks in Europe for calling for the closing of the Guantanamo military prison where terrorism suspects are held and for pledging tougher action to address global warming .
Although his days in office are numbered , Bush intends to use his European swing to prod allies to step up pressure on Iran over its nuclear program and back his “ major economies ” process on climate change , an approach critics say could undercut U.N. frameworks for combating the problem .
But Bush already has seen the limits of his ability to sway world events .
At a Bucharest summit in April , NATO leaders reluctant to antagonize Russia rebuffed his bid to put Ukraine and Georgia immediately on the path to membership .

Better living on the moon could start with keeping lunardust out .
Astronauts living on a permanent moon base will need protection against thebleak world ?s asbestos - like dust , not to mention shielding from radiation and aplan to ward off psychological demons .
Those challenges weigh on NASA 's plans to send humans back to the moon beforethe end of the next decade , when four - astronaut crews would have to learn howto live on the lunar surface in a space the size of a small mobile home .
" It 's not just like dirt in your house , " saidRobert Howard , engineer and manager of NASA 's Habitability Design Center , ofthe moon ?s ubiquitous dust .
Lunar dust began as a problem back when Apollo astronauts found the gray powderclinging to everything .
Even the vacuumdesigned to clean the spacesuits and spacecraft choked on the stuff .
Now researchers want to know how much dust would settle in astronaut lungswithin the moon 's reduced gravity of just one sixth that of Earth 's gravity .
" In the big picture , the questions are : How much goes into the lung ?
Wheredoes it go ?
How long does it stay ?
And how nasty is the stuff ? " said KimPrisk , a medical researcher at the University of California , San Diego .
Astronauts may spend up to six months living with thelunar dust that resembles fresh - fractured quartz , a highly toxic substance .
Reduced gravity could keep dust particles suspended in the airways , whichprovides more time for the toxic dust to get deep into the lungs and reach thebloodstream .
Prisk and other researchers of the National Space Biomedical Research Institutemonitored volunteers who breathed in dust - sized particles during flights onNASA 's Microgravity Research Aircraft .
The airplanes can make steep dives tobriefly simulate reduced - and zero - gravity .
" With the reduced - gravity flights , we ?re improving the process ofassessing environmental exposure to inhaled particles , ?
Kim said .
?
We ? velearned that tiny particles ( less than 2.5 microns or 0.0025 millimeters ) whichare the most significant in terms of damage , are greatly affected byalterations in gravity . "
Howard and other NASA engineers already have ideas on how to clear out unwanteddust in lunar habitats .
Electromagnets could pull or drive off lunar dust thathas metallic qualities , while air hoses could also help .
Astronauts might even leave their suit outside after attaching to a suit portoutside the moon base or a lunar rover .
" The suit never comes into the vehicle , " Howard told SPACE.com , adding that astronauts could crawl out of the suit and into the vehicle afterlocking into place .
That would also require a new lunar rover that 's moremini-RV rather than dune buggy , Howard said .
Radiation and recreation
Another hazard to astronaut health would come fromdangerously high levels of space radiation .
Massive solar storms or galacticcosmic rays from far off could have fatal consequences for any living being onthe moon .
By contrast , astronauts living on the International Space Station andflying on shuttle missions are protected from the worst by Earth 's magneticfield .
Previous ideas for radiation countermeasures include using electrostatic shielding to protect lunarinhabitants .
Howard noted that ridges near the moon 's South Pole could ideallyhouse an underground base .
Astronauts could also tote around portable shieldinginside the habitats in cases of emergency involving " short duration , highradiation " events .
Howard and other engineers have not forgotten the human component to living onanother world , despite grappling with the technical challenges .
" I'm a habitability person , so I 'm focused on the psychologicalwell - being , " Howard said .
He pointed to psychological lessons from living on thespace station and observed the importance of having " a place to call yourown " as private quarters .
Learning to live on the moon would ultimately provide a stepping stone towardslearning to live in other alien environments .
Call it a dry run for the even more daunting and distant prospect ofliving on Mars .
" It 's just five days away in an emergency , so we can go home if we haveto , " Howard said .
" We have to have it right before going toMars . "

Emptywheel makes the case that Scotty McClellan admitted as much this morning on the Today Show :
During the interview , Scottie revealed the two things that really pissed him off with the Bush Administration .
First , being set up to lie by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
And second , learning that Bush had -- himself -- authorized the selective leaking of the NIE . [...]
Thus far ... we only had Dick Cheney 's word that he had actually asked Bush to declassify this information .
We did n't have Bush 's confirmation that he had actually declassified the information .
In fact , we 've had Dick Cheney 's claims that he -- Dick - - had insta-declassified via his super secret pixie dust declassification powers .
But now we 've got George Bush , confirming that he , the President of the United States , authorized the leaks of " this information . "
Now , though Scottie refers , obliquely , to " this information , " he explicitly refers only to the NIE .
But as I 've described over and over again , it 's not just the NIE Bush authorized Dick to order Libby to leak .

Australia 's scientific community says regional areas like Mildura are being made to bear the brunt of a downsizing by the CSIRO .
The science research agency says it has no choice but to close its laboratories at Mildura in Victoria , and Rockhampton in Queensland , after a Federal Budget funding cut of more than $ 60 million over four years .
One hundred jobs will be axed , 50 of them at Mildura .
The president of the Federation of Australian Science and Technological Societies ( FASTS ) , professor Ken Baldwin , says the move is regrettable and could have unforseen consequences .
" It 's the presence of knowledgable and high calibre scientists in rural communities that might also have a flow on effect for encouraging young people to look at science as a way of improving their farming practices and indeed opening up careers for themselves in later life , " he said .
Mr Baldwin says it is too early to say whether the CSIRO research done in places like Mildura could continue with some help from the private sector .
" It may be that this research has got to the point where it is indeed perhaps handover time to the rural communities , " he said .
" They can now run with it and make best use of the increased productivity that it provides so only time will tell when we 'll see the outcome from that particular change . "
He showed the clip on The Colbert Report and started a contest , asking for viewers to edit in their own CGI and sound effects with the best being aired on the show .
Thousands of amateur filmmakers rose to the challenge and it eventually culminated in George Lucas himself making a video , with CGI done by Industrial Light and Magic .
... the most famous occurred towards the end of 2006 when Steven Colbert , an adamant Star Wars fan , filmed himself mimicking the Star Wars Kid in front of a green screen .

Origins :
So there 's this message board .
And just as most of the goods in your house were made in China , most of the internet 's irritating memes were manufactured there .
They used to have a tradition there called the Duckroll , where you would provide a link and lie about what was on the other end , often promising underage porn .
Once the user clicked through , they 'd get a Photoshopped picture of a duck with wheels .
It 's difficult to explain .
Anyway , at some point that was mutated into the Rickroll , where the goal was to trick users into watching a video of " Never Gonna Give You Up " by ' 80s ginger pop singer , Rick Astley .

Where it Crossed the Line :
Rickrolling had become widespread by May 2007 , with hundreds of thousands of occurrences popping up all over internet message boards , despite the fact that it had stopped being funny around the second time someone ever did it .
By 2008 , it somehow began appearing outside the web , which you would n't think would be possible for a joke based around a misleading link .
A real - world Rickrolling appeared during Anonymous 's anti-Scientology marches on February 10 , 2008 .
In marches in Edinburgh , London , New York and Washington DC , protesters marched up and down outside Scientology sites , blasting the song through boom boxes , in what the UK paper The Guardian said was a live Rickrolling , and which bystanders said was some guys playing a song on the radio .

On April 8 , after a web campaign starting at Fark.com , Rick Astley 's " Never Gonna Give You Up " won a poll to be played as the 8th inning sing - along at the New York Mets ' Shea Stadium .
Five million people voted for the song and , as promised , the New York Mets played it , to the extreme displeasure of the fans who did n't grasp the four or five layers of irony required to enjoy the experience .
This should highlight the " fish out of water " aspect of internet memes .

Washington -- Barack Obama 's
Web site is by most accounts the best in his business .
It is critical to the campaign 's record - breaking fund - raising , nimble grass - roots organizing and image as a broad - based , participatory force for change .
But the very virtues of this wiki - world carry peril .
For the first time in the history of presidential politics , outside observers -- including journalists and political enemies -- have real - time access , complete with search engine , to the thinking , debating and strategizing of the vast cadre that embodies a campaign without being under the campaign 's effective control .
MyBO , as the my.barackobama.com site is called , has more than 700,000 registered members .
There are more than 10,000 different affinity groups based on geography , identity , ideology , occupations , hobbies and habits ( Smokers for Obama , for one ) .
Thousands blog , at least intermittently .
Members accumulate points for every activity .
Too vast to vet , the site must rely on self - discipline and self - policing .
And it is becoming apparent that some forces can and will use provocative statements on MyBO against the candidate .
" When you have so many voices speaking , saying so many different things , it gives you a lot of ammunition to launch attacks on Obama , " said political scientist Kevin Wallsten , who , at the University of California at Berkeley , just finished his dissertation on the blogosphere 's effect on the last presidential campaign .
His point is n't lost on MyBO 's members .
" Opposition groups are scouring this Web site for material to use against Obama and finding lots of hateful , extreme material , " warned Birdalone , the online name used by the moderator of MyBO 's International Relations Forum , in a post April 9 .
( Some MyBO groups are moderated , others are not . )
Wallsten said MyBO 's social networking was unique among the remaining major presidential campaigns .
Obama is the only guy who is allowing this to go on on his site . . .
It 's benefited the view that his is a campaign - slash - movement - for - change , " he said .
But it means Obama is also alone in having to contend with the mischief opponents can make of it .
" These are things that Hillary Clinton with a more traditional kind of Web site does n't have to deal with , " Wallsten said , noting that John McCain 's Web site is far more rudimentary than Clinton's .
How should or can the campaign react without messing with MyBO's -- and perhaps its own -- essential mojo ?
After all , " This campaign is not just a campaign , it 's a movement , " said Kevin LaFleur , a former Marine who grew up in Vermont and , at 28 , is studying ethics , peace and global affairs at American University in Washington .
Obama 's people are officially mum , ignoring a reporter 's requests for an interview with any of the 20 - something honchos in command .
However , there is evidence things are tightening up .
LaFleur , who already belongs to 64 different Obama groups , recently tried to launch a new one -- White Folks for Obama .
His intent was not to provoke but to disarm , his point being that throughout the process white folks have supported Obama in large numbers and will continue to do so .
The powers that be stalled him .
Instead , he and his girlfriend created a Web site for the group off MyBO .
Meanwhile , in Wilkes - Barre , Pa. , Bill Levinson , a Republican management consultant , trolls MyBO for comments about Israel and the United States that might stoke the concerns of some Jews about the Obama campaign .
He posts them on his blog on Israpundit , a right - wing , pro-Israeli Web site .
On April 13 , under the headline " Obama Blogger : U.S. and Terrorists are Morally Equivalent , " Levinson sampled from a long MyBO posting two days earlier in which Mark Levin suggested that Americans have a blinkered view of the world , that in recent decades the Judeo - Christian West has more blood on its hands than Islam , and that the Israeli - Palestine conflict ought to be seen as " a clash of two equally valid worldviews , a clash of two rights , instead of as a clash between right vs. wrong . "
But to call him an " Obama blogger " was unfair , Levin wrote to Levinson :
The campaign " has no control over content posted on these blogs , I think , unless they are abusive in nature . "
He added , " in any big - tent campaign , you will get party - line people and then nutjobs ' like me , whom Obama would run away from . "
Levinson argues that if the Obama campaign leaves objectionable posts up , it is effectively sanctioning them , and that they are of a piece with Obama 's association with other " unsavory " figures like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
In an echo of Warren Harding ’s “ A Return to Normalcy ” speech of 1920 , George Bush last week declared , “ Normalcy is returning back to Iraq . ”
The term seemed a mite ironic .
For , as Bush spoke , Iraqis were dying in the hundreds in the bloodiest fighting in months in Basra , the Shia militias of Moqtada al - Sadr were engaging Iraqi and U.S. troops in Sadr City , and mortar shells were dropping into the Green Zone .
One begins to understand why Gen. Petraeus wants a “ pause ” in the pullout of U.S. forces , and why Bush agrees .
This will leave more U.S. troops in Iraq on Inauguration Day 2009 than on Election Day 2006 , when the country voted the Democrats into power to bring a swift end to the war .
A day before Bush went to the U.S. Air Force Museum in Dayton , Ohio , to speak of normalcy returning to Iraq , he was led down into “ the Tank , ” a secure room at the Pentagon , to be briefed on the crisis facing the U.S. Army and Marine Corps because of the constant redeployments to Afghanistan and Iraq .
As the Associated Press ’ Robert Burns reported , the Joint Chiefs “ laid out their concerns about the health of the U.S. force . ”
First among them is “ that U.S. forces are being worn thin , compromising the Pentagon ’s ability to handle crises elsewhere in the world .
The U.S. has about 31,000 troops in Afghanistan and 156,000 in Iraq . ”
“ Five plus years in Iraq , ” the generals and admirals told Bush , “ could create severe , long - term problems , particularly for the Army and Marine Corps . ”
In short , the two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are wearing down U.S. ground forces of fewer than 700,000 , one in every six of them women , to such an extent U.S. commanders called Bush and Dick Cheney to a secret meeting to awaken them to the strategic and morale crisis .
This is serious business .
With the Taliban revived and the violence in Iraq rising toward pre-surge levels , the Joint Chiefs are telling the commander in chief that the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are worn out .
Crunch time is coming .
And what is President Bush doing ?
He is flying to Bucharest , Romania , to persuade Europe to bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO , which means a U.S. commitment to treat any Russian attack on Kiev or Tbilisi like an attack on Kansas or Texas .
Article V of the NATO treaty declares that “ an armed attack against one or more [ allies ] shall be considered an attack against them all . ”
Added language makes clear that the commitment to assist an ally is not unconditional .
Rather , each signatory will assist the ally under attack with “ such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force . ”
Yet , it was understood during the Cold War that if a NATO ally like Norway , West Germany , or Turkey , which bordered on the Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact , were attacked , America would come to its defense .
Can any sane man believe the United States should go to war with a nuclear - armed Russia over Stalin ’s birthplace , Georgia ?
Two provinces of Georgia , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , have seceded , with the backing of Russia .
And there are 10 million Russian - speaking Ukrainians in the east of that country , and Moscow and Kiev are at odds over which is sovereign on the Crimean Peninsula .
To bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO would put America in the middle of these quarrels .
We could be dragged into a confrontation with Russia over Abkhazia , or South Ossetia , or who owns Sebastopol .
To bring these ex-republics of the Soviet Union into NATO would be an affront to Moscow not unlike 19th century Britain bringing the Confederate state of South Carolina under the protection of the British Empire .
How would Lincoln ’s Union have reacted to that ?
With a weary army and no NATO ally willing to fight beside us , how could we defend Georgia if Tbilisi , once in NATO , defied Moscow and invaded Abkhazia and South Ossetia  and Russia bombed the Georgian army and capital ?
Would we declare war ?
Would we send the 82nd Airborne into the Pankisi Gorge ?
Fortunately , Germany is prepared to veto any Bush attempt to put Ukraine or Georgia on a fast track into NATO .
But President Bush is no longer the problem .
John McCain is .
As Anatol Lieven writes in the Financial Times , McCain supports a restoration of Georgian rule over Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine .
He wants to throw Russia out of the G - 8  and talks flippantly of bombing Iran .
Says McCain , “ I would institute a policy called ‘ rogue - state rollback . ’
I would arm , train , equip , both from without and from within , forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and install free and democratically elected governments . ”
Wonderful .
A Second Crusade for Global Democracy .
But with the Joint Chiefs warning of a war - weary Army and Marine Corps , who will fight all the new wars the neocons and their new champion have in store for us ?
Penn State scientists are the first to observe in living cells a key step in the creation of adenine and guanine , two of the four building blocks that comprise DNA .
Also called purines , the two building blocks are essential for cell replication .
The findings , which will be published in the 4 April 2008 issue of the journal Science , could lead to new cancer treatments that prevent cancer cells from replicating by interfering with their abilities to make purines .
The group used cervical cancer cells -- which have an increased demand for purines due to their rapid rates of replication -- to demonstrate that a group of six enzymes is involved in the creation of purines .
" Our research shows that these enzymes form a cluster prior to purine formation , " said Erin Sheets , an assistant professor of chemistry and a collaborator on the project .
Although other researchers had , in the past , studied the enzymes individually in test tubes , no one , until now , had examined the group of enzymes together in living cells .
" This is the first time that anyone has used the appropriate technology to look for this kind of complex in a living cell , " said the team 's leader Stephen Benkovic , Evan Pugh Professor of Chemistry and holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Chemistry .
Postdoctoral associates Songon An and Ravindra Kumar , from the Benkovic group , studied the enzyme clusters using a technique called fluorescence microscopy , in which fluorescent proteins are attached to molecules of interest and viewed under a special microscope .
According to Sheets , the technique makes it easier to observe specific molecules in a cell .
" It 's like giving a bright orange helmet to your favorite football player so you can more easily monitor his actions , " she said .
The researchers attached fluorescent proteins to the enzymes of cells grown in the presence and absence of purines .
They found that in the absence of purines , enzymes formed clusters at much higher rates , suggesting that they play a role in the creation of new purines .
In contrast , cells also can produce purines by recycling old purine material .
Owing to this salvage process , cells do not always need enzyme clusters ; indeed , cluster formation was not observed in cells that were grown in the presence of purines .
In a key experiment , the researchers were able to influence the association and dissociation of the enzyme cluster by changing the cells ' exposure to purines .
Not all of the cells that were grown in the absence of purines contained enzyme clusters .
" We think that the enzymes form clusters only when a cell needs purines , and that happens when a cell is required to replicate its DNA at a certain stage in its cell cycle , " said Sheets .
" Since each of our samples contain cells at different stages of the cell cycle , we did not expect all of them to be actively replicating their DNA .
Therefore , we were n't surprised to find that some of our cells did not contain enzyme clusters . "
Because purines are necessary for DNA replication and , ultimately , for cell replication , the ability to halt purine synthesis could prove to be a valuable method for treating cancer .
" Cancer cells have very high demands for purines , " said Benkovic .
" If we can find a way to disrupt the formation of this particular enzyme cluster , it could become a potential new target for cancer therapy . "
This research was supported , in part , through the Center for Optical Technologies at Penn State University , which receives support from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Donors of the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund .

Here are The 9 Most Baffling Theme Parks From Around the World
Islands Of The Caribbean
My congressman sent me his May 2008 newsletter today via e-mail to explain to me why gasoline prices are so high and what he ’s doing about it .
His analysis is unimpressive .
According to the newsletter and its link to his Web site , Rep. John R. “ Randy ” Kuhl ( R - N.Y . ) says :
Why are gas prices so high ?
The high price of gasoline results from the cost of crude oil , the world demand and supply for oil , our limited refining capacity , and taxes .
[ emphasis added ]
But what did n’t make his list ?
Rep .
Kuhl did not mention the role of a weakened dollar in the cost of crude .
Nor did he point to speculation â€ ” which Congress said added $ 20 to a barrel of oil back when oil cost $ 70 per barrel â€ ” as a root cause of precipitous price increases .
According to Peter Way of Block Traders ’ Oil & Gold Monitor :
[ W]e observed that a tug - of - war was developing between the regulars and the newer speculators that would influence world energy costs .
Until recently , the contest had gone to the newbies with steadily rising prices , but now they , and the nearer expectations , are ebbing .
But where the speculators have influence , say , out beyond December 2008 , the trend of expectations in most months is upward .
The tug - of - war is still on .
Nor has Rep. Kuhl noticed that the oil market has become detached from considerations of supply and demand , according to an OPEC minister .
Abdalla Salem El - Badri blamed “ heightened levels of speculation , ” a weak U.S. dollar and geopolitical concerns on recent fluctuations in crude prices .
Rep .
Kuhl mentioned none of these factors .
He has not noticed that hundreds of energy hedge funds are bidding up oil markets .
And Rep. Kuhl ’s recommendations to Congress ?
Congress should open ANWR to environmentally sensitive production , increase offshore drilling , reduce the barriers to more nuclear plants , and allow more refineries to be built .
He argues that “ the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) in Alaska could yield 10 to 16 billion barrels of oil , enough to replace all of our imports from Saudi Arabia . ”
Is that total yield ?
Yield over what period of time ?
According to the federal Energy Information Administration , the United States imported 1.614 million barrels per day from Saudi Arabia in February .
That ’s about 17 years of oil imports from ANWR â€ ” but the U.S. imports only about 11 percent of its oil from the Saudis .
But Rep .
Kuhl makes no mention of the role of conservation of energy instead of risky ANWR drilling that would offset the Saudi imports he decries .
Instead , he argues that ANWR “ development would occur only on 1.5 million acres utilizing advanced technology to prevent any environmental damage . ” [ emphasis added ]
That ’s a big environmental risk on a vague technological premise .
Rep .
Kuhl argues that nuclear power “ is the number one source of emission - free electricity ” without explaining 1 ) what to do with nuclear waste and 2 ) his position on the proposed federal Yucca Flats storage facility .
He bemoans the lack of construction of new nuclear plants and new oil refineries .
He wants to reduce regulatory and environmental protections to allow those facilities .
Rep .
Kuhl advises that he is “ working to increase the use of new fuels and technologies , including renewable energy sources , along with promoting more efficiency . ”
Details , please ?
Effects on the cost of foodstuffs if corn continues to be a prime raw material for ethanol ?
Rep .
Kuhl ’s analysis of oil and gas pricing is straight from the Bush administration ’s playbook .
This is the congressman who says that slowing down and avoiding aggressive driving can save up to 82 cents per gallon .
On this issue , Rep .
Kuhl does not have the necessary skills and knowledge to wisely advise his constituents .
So why should his constituents trust him when he comes re-election - hat - in - hand to them ?
After all , these energy increases have happened on his Republican watch .
How ’s your representative in Congress doing when it comes to oil and gas ?
Comcast may have agreed to end its practice of using forged TCP reset packets to hinder the P2P traffic of its customers , but the cable provider is n't out of the woods yet .
Three class - action lawsuits were filed against Comcast this week in California , Illinois , and New Jersey , alleging that the company deceived and misled consumers by advertising that it offered " unfettered access to all the content , services , and applications that the Internet has to offer . "
For those just catching up , complaints from suspicious customers began surfacing last fall about Comcast using questionable methods to block BitTorrent traffic on its network .
In October , the Associated Press decided to perform its own independent tests to see if the allegations were true , and found further evidence that Comcast had been sending " fake " TCP reset packets claiming to be from its customers attempting to use BitTorrent , therefore timing out their downloads and seeds .
In November , the Electronic Frontier Foundation released a report detailing its own investigation , confirming that BitTorrent performance was being selectively degraded by unexpected TCP reset packets .
Comcast , of course , repeatedly denied the allegations .
Finally , the Federal Communications Commission opened up proceedings over Comcast 's network management practices in January , and in March , the cable giant announced a pact with BitTorrent to ensure that traffic runs more smoothly over the network .
One of the first tangible results will be the end of Comcast 's current practices .
Instead , the company will use a platform - agnostic technique that may ultimately slow down P2P traffic from its heaviest users , which it will begin testing very soon .
But Comcast 's change of heart has come too late for some irate customers .
According to copies of the complaints seen by Ars , Comcast did not tell customers that it would engage in this type of traffic shaping when the company promised " unfettered access , " and was not authorized to do so by its customers .
As a result , the plaintiffs and other Comcast customers believe they paid for a service that they did n't receive , resulting in deceptive business practices and deceptive advertising on Comcast 's part .
Additionally , they say that Comcast misrepresented its " merchandise , " and Comcast 's denials of the practice represented fraud and false pretense .
" Comcast 's clandestine techniques are similar to those used by totalitarian governments to censor the use of the Internet , " reads the complaint filed in Illinois .
" No doubt Comcast would characterize the behavior as illegal and malicious hacking if perpetrated by others on Comcast and its customers . "
The lawsuits , which join a previous suit filed in November against Comcast , ask that Comcast be barred from continuing to violate various state laws , in addition to unspecified damages .
Trouble for Time Warner , too
Comcast is n't the only cable provider getting into hot legal water this week .
The city of Los Angeles has also announced that it is suing Time Warner Cable for deceptive business practices and false advertising .
Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo said that city residents were forced to suffer " months of cable television and Internet outages , substandard technical and customer service and improper price increases " after Time Warner 's takeover of nearly all cable services in L.A. Delgadillo is asking the court to prohibit the company from continuing its allegedly unlawful practices , and wants $ 2,500 in civil penalties for each violation of the Unfair Competition law .
He also demands an additional $ 2,500 civil penalty for each violation perpetrated against one or more senior citizens or disabled persons .
" We 're bringing this civil law enforcement action against Time Warner Cable because the company has broken multiple laws , and harmed countless Los Angeles consumers , ” said Delgadillo in a statement .
“ Time Warner Cable must be held accountable for illegally deceiving and ripping off its subscribers . "
In response , a spokesperson for Time Warner denied to the New York Times that it had misled customers .
My first living experience on my own was in a college dorm room , where I resided for two years .
The cooking equipment there was minimal – I had a dorm fridge , a hot plate , a large pan , two plates , a few forks and spoons , and that was about it .
I did whatever dishes I needed to do in the restroom sink on my dorm floor .
My first apartment after that was n’t much better – I shared what amounted to an efficiency with four other people .
It was dirt cheap , but it also almost required you to eat out instead of eating inside , meaning that the money saved on cheap housing was somewhat taken away by the cost of eating out consistently .
I made various efforts to cook things , but it was mostly prepackaged and unhealthy fare .
My diet often consisted of boxed macaroni and cheese , ramen noodles , Campbell ’s Chunky soup , and whatever packaged food was on sale at the store .
While such fare is fine on occasion , it ’s not exactly the backbone of a healthy diet over the long haul .
Yet I still yearned to eat healthy and to eat cheap at home .
I wanted to be able to cook something up in the corner of that apartment while watching a movie with my friends there , spending just $ 0.50 or so on my own food prep while they spent several dollars on take out .
I wanted to be able to make something reasonably healthy and nutritious for just pennies at two in the morning while studying for exams .
Now that I ’ve got a better grasp on food preparation , I now see that there were many opportunities to do just that .
Here are seven starter ideas for preparing healthy and cheap meals with very little equipment .
I ’m assuming that all you have are just a tiny fridge , a hot plate that can generate enough heat to cook on , a single pan , a plate , a bowl , eating utensils , a source of water , and a knife to cut with .
Nothing else – you could have this equipment in the corner of a dorm room .
Idea # 1 : Augmentation
As I mentioned above , most prepackaged meals are notoriously unhealthy , but it ’s fine to eat them on occasion .
One way to mitigate their unhealthiness without making them any harder to prepare is by just augmenting the noodles with something healthy , creating a better tasting and healthier meal .
Take a package of ordinary Ramen noodles .
It ’s very easy to augment that package with a sliced chicken breast , and the only extra equipment you ’d need beyond what you ’d need for the noodles is a knife and somewhere to cut the breast .
Just cook the breast in whatever pan you have available , flipping it occasionally , until you can slice it and it ’s white all the way through , then slice it into small bits and set it aside .
Use any remaining liquid in the pan , along with additional water , then make the ramen .
At the end , drain off some amount of the water , add the flavoring packet , and add the chopped chicken .
This is often enough to stretch the single packet into two meals , and the addition of chicken makes the meal more nutritious and healthy .
You could also do the same by augmenting with fresh vegetables – boil some carrots in water , slice them up , and add them to chicken or beef ramen .
Add some broccoli to chicken ramen .
Idea # 2 : Beans
I ’ve written an ode to the bean in the past because it ’s so inexpensive and still so delicious .
It ’s a great source of vegetarian protein and can be the back of many simple meals .
Here ’s what you need to know .
Prepping the beans
Just fill up a pan with water , put in a few handfuls of dry beans , and let it sit there while you go out to classes or to work for a few hours .
When you come back , drain off the water and pick out anything that looks unappetizing , then put some fresh water on and boil the beans as per the directions .
Barbecue beans
Mix some of your favorite barbecue sauce and part of a chopped onion in with your boiled beans ( use pinto or kidney beans ) .
Let it cook for a while on fairly low heat until you ’re drooling from the smell , then devour them .
Bean burritos
Use the beans ( I prefer black beans for this ) as the backbone for some burritos .
Soft tortillas , lettuce , tomato , salsa , a bit of cheese – and it ’s delicious .
Not only that , you can save most of this stuff for later and have bean burritos several times .
Tip # 1 : Ask for a bunch of small Rubbermaid food containers for a gift , then put them to use storing extra food you make ( like the extras you ’re sure to have from the bean recipes above ) .
Use masking tape and a marker to identify the contents of the container , the date it was prepared , and who prepared it ( if you live in a house full of scavengers ) .
Then follow the “ three days and out ” rule – if it ’s more than three days since you prepared it and it ’s uneaten , toss it .
Idea # 3 : Eggs
Eggs are another extremely inexpensive and easy to prepare source of healthy protein .
I got in a routine of eating scrambled eggs three or four times a week near the end of my college years , since I could quickly prepare them in a pan and there were so many potential varieties .
Here are some concepts to try .
Basic scrambled eggs Crack a few eggs into a pan ( without any heat on it yet ) , then add a small shot of milk to the mixture , a couple dashes of salt , and a dash or two of pepper to taste .
Put it over medium heat and continually stir it , pulling the cooking eggs away from the edges , until you have nice fluffy eggs .
Modifications
Try putting some salsa right on top of the eggs , or perhaps some chili .
Grated cheese is another excellent topping – sprinkle it right into the pan on top of the eggs about a minute before they ’re done cooking .
Hard boiled eggs Just put a few eggs in your pan , a big pinch of salt , about half a cap full of vinegar , and then enough water so that it ’s slightly deeper than the eggs .
Turn up the heat full blast until the water is boiling , then pull the pan off the heat and let it sit there for sixteen minutes .
Then dump off the water and add cool water , letting the eggs cool .
These are perfect to keep in the fridge and eat as a quick and very healthy snack – less than a dime a pop .
Idea # 4 : Fruits and Vegetables in Season
Stop by your local grocery store and see what fresh fruits and vegetables are on sale for a low price .
Those are the seasonal items , and they ’re usually delicious and cheap .
Buy some , take them home , and experiment .
Vegetables
Many vegetables can be deliciously cooked with a bit of olive oil and a few spices to make a very delicious , simple , and cheap meal .
Just search around online for basic preparation of whatever vegetables you may find .
Fruit Almost every fruit can be chopped up and stored in a small container as a perfect snack when you ’re hungry .
If it ’s a cheap vegetable in season , it ’s usually a very cheap snack , too .
Tip # 2 : Get a basic spice rack and experiment with them – a simple , compact spice rack is something perfect to ask for as a gift .
Try tarragon in your eggs or rosemary on your chicken breasts or cumin cooked in with your beans .
It ’s a quick way to make something bland into something quite tasty .
Here are the spices I consider essential in a basic kitchen .
Idea # 5 : Pasta
You can get a box of dried pasta for just a dollar or two and it ’ll provide the backbone for multiple meals .
Plus , it ’s amazingly easy : just boil it in water with a bit of salt and it ’s good to go .
Pasta sauces
Naturally , you ’ll want some sauce to go along with it .
Try just getting cheap cans of tomato sauce , then heating that in a pan after the pasta is done and draining .
Add in garlic , rosemary , oregano , and other spices and you can quickly have a great tomato sauce .
Toss some of those fresh vegetables in the sauce , too , to make it heartier .
Parmesan cheese Parmesan cheese in a large canister is an essential thing to keep in the fridge .
Sprinkle some on top of the tomato sauce from above , or even better , try this .
Once the pasta is done draining , toss it with a bit of olive oil and dump a lot of Parmesan in there as you ’re tossing it .
Delicious and pretty healthy .
Tip # 3 : You only need one knife for almost everything you might do .
Go to a department store and pick out one of their 7 ″ to 9 ″ chef ’s knifes .
Hold it in your hand and pick the one with the grip you like the best .
Also , get a honing steel so you can keep the edge on it .
This one knife will do all of the cutting you ’ll likely do in a kitchen for a long time .
Idea # 6 : Tuna
Tuna is quite inexpensive and very healthy .
I often buy cans of it in bulk and use them slowly over the next few months , mixing the tuna in with other dishes or occasionally centering a meal around it .
Here are some tactics .
Tuna stir fry
Add tuna in with savory fresh vegetables and cook them all together .
I particularly like tuna with onions , garlic , celery , and peas .
Tuna with pasta
Tuna is also a great complement to pasta , discussed above .
Boil the pasta , then mix some tuna and a bit of olive oil in with the drained pasta , along with a bit of salt and some pepper .
Delicious and incredibly simple , plus you can add some vegetables to it , too , if you have any fresh ones on hand .
Tip # 4 : Go with a friend to a warehouse store and buy the basic items here in bulk .
You can get amazing prices if you buy large cylinders of oatmeal , a large pack of small tuna cans , a lot of pasta , or a large quantity of beans all at once .
You can even sometimes find rice at a reasonable price , though it ’s very expensive compared to where it used to be .
Idea # 7 : Oatmeal
This may be the most surprising item on the list , but it ’s perhaps my favorite of all .
Oatmeal can be prepared in countless different ways , and when you buy a large container of it , it ’s very cheap , too .
I used to eat it for multiple meals a day and I still eat it a few days a week for breakfast .
Here are thirty different things you can add to oatmeal to make something delicious – try them individually or in combinations .
The last few make for a hearty oatmeal , not sweet at all , and appropriate to eat at dinner .
Cane sugar
Brown sugar
Honey
Molasses
Clove
Cinnamon
Ginger
Nutmeg
Fresh fruit pieces ( whatever ’s on sale )
Dried fruit pieces ( raisins , craisins , etc. )
Maple syrup
Banana ( chunked )
Flaxseed
Canned pumpkin ( sublime with cinnamon )
Nuts ( pecans , almonds , etc. )
Sunflower seeds
Coconut ( or coconut oil )
Peanut butter
Hazelnut butter ( Nutella )
Chocolate chips
Granola ( as a topping )
Zucchini ( grated )
Butter
Sea salt
Pepper
Chicken broth
Parmesan cheese
Green onions / scallions
Bacon ( chopped )
Ham ( chopped )
Gruyere cheese
In short , you can prepare many , many interesting foods at home with just a pan and a hot plate .
Experiment a little and surprise yourself !
Gitmo Admiral : Detainees pretty much live in a fraternity house Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 21 , 2008

Print This Email This Detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay have complained about inhumane conditions there , but according to the admiral in charge , their living situation is " pretty much " like that in a fraternity house .
Rear Admiral Mark Buzby , who is completing a one - year assignment as the commander of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo recently held a conference call with defense bloggers to discuss the treatment of detainees .
" We 're all about the safe and humane care and custody of detained enemy combatants , " Buzby began .
" We do that safely and we also do it ethically and transparently , and , of course , in strict accordance with the law . "
He added that Guantanamo is " very much different than what it 's portrayed , typically , you know , in popular culture .
...
The greatest compliment that I get from visitors is , ' Gosh , I never realized it was so different . ' "
Blogger Andrew Lubin asked Buzby about one detainee who claimed " he was put back in solitary confinement for punitive reasons . "
" We do n't have any solitary confinement down here in Guantanamo , " Buzby replied .
" What we have is single cells .
I mean , there 's one person to a cell .
All the cells are all right next to each other . "
" That 's like having a single apartment in a fraternity house , " suggested Lubin .
" Pretty much , " Buzby agreed .
" They talk between cells , they talk between tiers , they talk between camps .
It 's not quiet over there , let me tell you . "
A psychologist , Stephen Soldz , had already asked Buzby about reports that " three - quarters of the detainees are kept in essentially permanent isolation ( units ? ) , in , I believe , eight - foot by 12 - foot cells . "
Soldz said he had spoken to a military defense attorney " whose client has been in kept in these conditions for five and a half years and is -- frankly , is losing his mind . "
Buzby answered that the facilities are " the very same conditions that U.S. Bureau of Prisons prisoners live in " and insisted that all the detainees " get at least two hours of outdoor recreation with other people every day " as well as a daily shower .
" I have pretty good confidence that we 're taking very good care of these people and that there 's not a bunch of people going insane down here , " he stated .
Soltz noted in a follow - up question that the Bureau of Prisons facilities cited by Buzby as models for Guantanamo are " supermax " prisons , meant to be used only on a temporary basis for " the worst of the worst "
In response , Buzby insisted that any of the prisoners who " behave very well and follow the camp rules " can earn the right to live in Camp 4 -- where they have communal bunk rooms and " access to recreation about 22 hours a day " -- but that the capacity in that section is " not being used right now because , you know , a lot of those detainees are n't behaving themselves . "
John McCormack of the Weekly Standard then asked , " How do you ensure that those in Camp 4 are not , you know , conspiring ? ...
How do you ensure that this , you know , communal living , 22 hours per day of recreation , is n't leading to any conspiracies ? "
Buzby replied that there had been one riot in Camp 4 in 2006 , but that there has been no recurrence because he has been " decreasing the population , if you will , of Camp 4 , by more closely vetting those that go in there .
...
They police themselves fairly well , because many of the people , that are detained there , like the conditions and they do n't want to screw it up or have it screwed up for them . "
A number of readers have emailed me to ask what I thought of this :
Austan Goolsbee , an economics professor at the University of Chicago and one of Sen .
Obama 's closest advisers on economic issues , said the senator believed strongly in enhanced regulation of any financial institution that has access to the Fed 's discount window .
" If you can borrow money from the U.S. taxpayer at a moment of crisis , that is a very sacred insurance policy underwritten by the U.S. taxpayer , " said Mr. Goolsbee in an interview last week with Dow Jones Newswires .
" We have the right to oversee anyone who is accessing that insurance policy . " ...
Mr. Goolsbee said that an Obama presidency would ensure that investment banks are regulated as closely as commercial banks .
Greg Mankiw asks : " Can an investment bank avoid such regulation if it promises never to use the discount window ?
Or is this insurance - regulation combo a mandate ? "
I 'm not sure that 's the right question .
As Matt pointed out yesterday
My first read on this was that a " promise " would be no good .
A bank can't " promise " not to fail .
Nor can a bank promise not to be bailed out if it does fail .
A bailout , when justified , is n't a favor you do for the bank .
It 's something you do because it 's necessary to avoid larger negative consequences throughout the economy .
So a promise to avoid the discount window would be valueless .
But if the public is going to need to guarantee that financial institutions that grow " too big to fail " do n't fail , then the public is going to need to regulate those institutions .
Bear Stearns was n't bailed out for the good of Bear Stearns ; it was bailed out because it was the counterparty to vast numbers of trades , and the Fed was worried that markets would lock up .
No bank can credibly commit not require government assistance , so in some sense , they 're gambling with our money .
Once you take the King 's Shilling , you also take the King 's orders .
The question I have is this : what regulations ?
Over the past few months , I have been to a dozen or more events sponsored by various think tanks that together represent most of the American ideological spectrum .
Most of them think that investment banks need " more regulation " ; it 's a pretty strong consensus .
The problem is , there are precious few ideas as to what that regulation might entail .
Here is , as far as I can tell , a comprehensive list of all the regulations that most economists could probably agree to :
1 ) Increased capital requirements for investment banks
2 ) Cracking down on fraud in the mortgage brokerage market
3 ) Less off - balance sheet activity
4 ) Requiring originators to keep a piece of the loans they package
The problem is , it 's not really very likely that these four would have prevented the current crisis .
If you borrow short and lend long -- and all banking is some variant on this -- you will at least occasionally be caught out .
There 's no real evidence that the problem in the housing market was supply - side , rather than demand - side , fraud .
Bear Stearns was n't taken down by its SIVs .
And it 's not really clear that the originators would have behaved much differently had they been keeping a piece of the loans they packaged .
The housing bubble created a powerful illusion : that low income lenders with bad credit were actually quite profitable to lend to .
That 's because the rising housing prices allowed borrowers in trouble to refinance rather than default .
There 's no reason to think that the originators were any less deluded about the credit risks than the investors .
The no-doc , option and negative amortization ARMS were not a secret ; everyone knew what was going on .
People bought mortgage bonds anyway in what now looks like a stunning piece of idiocy .
When I try to get people to specify , beyond those four rather anodyne suggestions , we should do , there 's a lot of hemming and hawing .
Even the left - wing think tankers sort of look at their shoes and whisper " We need a better regulator " .
At which point even the left - wing journalists in the audience start asking " Where are we going to find regulators who understand this better than the guys at Goldman Sachs - - and are willing to work for , say , a GS - 13 salary ? "
The only people who confidently state that they have a surefire master plan to fix the problem are , not to put too fine a point on it , morons with very limited understanding of financial markets .
These people generally start by talking about how the Bear Stearns crisis can really be traced back to the repeal of Glass - Steagall , then almost immediately reveal that they know nothing of Glass - Steagall other than its name .
I have tried all sorts of ways to ask these questions .
Nor am I engaged in " libertarian gotcha " ; though the game is hours of fun , I am not actually against better or even more regulation of investment banks *.
I just want to know what sort of regulation we are going to have ; I am against doing something for the sake of doing something .
Which financial instruments should be illegal , I ask , but few are willing to name one .
How should we arrange the orderly winding - down of an investment bank with complicated business lines and massive counterparty exposure ?
Rueful shrugs .
What business lines should investment banks be forced to divest ?
Ummm . . . .
Should we limit the percentage of a market that one bank can control , at the risk of lowering liquidity in ordinary times ?
Welllllllllll . . .
Should banks have broader distribution of their capital across business lines , or fewer business lines , and is either even possible to arrange without financial disaster . . . good question .
Do we give the regulator broad powers , to make them more flexible , or narrow powers , to make them more accountable ?
Let me think about that . . .
But the fundamental question that no one ever answers is simply " How will the regulatory agency be any smarter than the banks ? "
The political process and existing regulatory infrastructure did about as well at anticipating and preventing the current problems as the banking system did .
As I say above , this question usually gets asked by liberal journalists .
And its usually answered by an honest and intelligent liberal policy wonk forthrightly saying , in essence , " I have no idea . "
Now , it 's certainly very possible that Austan Goolsbee has answers to at least some of these questions ; he 's forgotten more about finance than I 'll ever know .
But I 'd really like to hear what they are .
* Though I am slightly taken aback by the fact that it is the already fairly heavily - regulated investment banks , rather than basically unregulated hedge funds , that have caused the problems .
Ronaldo and Adebayor are set do battle once again
Old Trafford
Saturday 16 February
FA Cup fifth round
Kick - off : 1715 GMT
Replay if required : Wed 27 February , 1945 GMT
BBC coverage : LIVE on BBC One , BBC Sport website , BBC Radio Five Live ; highlights on Match of the Day
Manchester United and Arsenal meet in the FA Cup for the fourth time in a decade on Saturday .
With the sides widely considered to be best in the Premier League and also slugging it out for the title , the tie at Old Trafford is set to be an almighty battle .
Here , former Arsenal left - back Nigel Winterburn looks ahead to the game .
Recent matches between the two have been terrific , both sides have a healthy respect for each other while maintaining their belief that they can win .
There is always passion in these games and I think there will be lots on Saturday - there could be a few goals , too .
Both sides really like to attack and play exciting football .
It is very difficult to pick out specific key battles because they will be going on all over the pitch .
Of course , Cristiano Ronaldo and Emmanuel Adebayor - the Premier League 's joint top scorers - have been tremendous , but both teams are littered with superb players .
And it could even be that a mistake , rather than a moment of brilliance , will decide the outcome .
LAST FIVE FA CUP MEETINGS 11/03/99 Semi-final : Man Utd 0 - 0 Arsenal AET 14/03/99 Semi-final replay : Arsenal 1 - 2 Man Utd AET 15/02/03 Fifth round : Man Utd 0 - 2 Arsenal 03/03/04 Semi-final : Arsenal 0 - 1 Man Utd 21/5/05 Final : Arsenal 0 - 0 Man Utd AET
Arsenal won 5 - 4 on penalties
Home advantage could help United , as 70,000 fans can give you a big lift , but I really think this game is too close to call .
I feel that both sets of players are quite evenly matched and it is the unpredictability of this encounter that makes it so engrossing .
Also , it will be fascinating to see the team selections .
When the league was so tight , I would have thought both sides would have played near full - strength teams .
But now Arsenal have opened up a five - point gap on United , manager Arsene Wenger may choose to rest one or two of his players .
However , beating one of your top rivals in any game can give you a psychological edge over them for the next time .
And , of course , Manchester United will host Arsenal again in the Premier League in April .
So there is no chance Arsenal will field an under - strength team like they did in the Carling Cup , while United need to re-establish their rhythm and form after a disappointing couple of weeks and I expect them to put out their top team .
It is an intriguing conundrum and it will be fascinating to see who actually lines up on the day .
I have a feeling this could be a really exciting game
Nigel Winterburn
The other factor is that both sides have huge games coming up in the Champions league only a few days after their FA Cup match .
It is really difficult to say that whoever wins on Saturday , if there is a victor , will inflict significant damage on their rivals ' wider hopes - as well as knocking them out of the FA Cup .
But I would say that after the last couple of weeks that the pressure is more on Manchester United than it is on Arsenal , although that can change very , very quickly .
You can be sure , though , that neither side will be playing for a draw - their sole focus will be to win as I 'm sure neither club wants a replay .
It would be an additional fixture they really could do without .
Sometimes , people misinterpret a habit of scoring late in matches as luck but it is these two sides ' desire , drive and determination to win , right until the very end of a match , that is responsible for those goals .
Do n't expect caution to be thrown to the wind , in a win- or - bust move .
But I have a feeling this could be a really exciting game and I am really looking forward to it .
Nigel Winterburn was speaking to Ian Hughes
Alexander Litvinenko died on 23 November 2006 , after a mysterious and painful illness .
The cause was identified , less than two hours before his death , by scientists at the British government 's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston .
They found that he had been poisoned , with the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 .
The diagnosis came too late for an antidote to be administered .
But the victim , who had been a hale and hearty 44 - year - old only four weeks before , had time to authorise a thunderous deathbed statement in which he accused Russia 's President , Vladimir Putin , of ordering his murder .
Litvinenko's very public suffering , complete with ghoulish photographs and daily bulletins , was chronicled ( with rather too much relish for my taste ) by Alex Goldfarb , a former Russian human rights activist and friend of Litvinenko .
As it happened , his macabre one - man show outside London 's University College Hospital coincided with the release of the latest James Bond film , Casino Royale .
Everything contrived to raise the fearsome cold - war stereotypes of Russia that lurk fractionally below the genteel surface of British opinion .
Russia was suddenly back in vogue , in the most convincingly negative way .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
From there , it was but an elegant diplomatic one - step to the authorised British version of the " Litvinenko affair " .
During his almost six years in London , this former Soviet and Russian intelligence officer had become an increasingly outspoken foe of President Putin .
His dramatic deathbed " J'accuse " served posthumously as indictment and proof of Kremlin complicity .
The polonium clinched it .
Only Russia , it was said , had the capacity to produce polonium - 210 .
The lab , even the date of production , could easily be identified .
And if anyone asked why , of all substances available to potential assassins , the choice had fallen on polonium , the answer came back pat : it was in the confident expectation that the cause of death would never be diagnosed .
In the unlikely event that the British public still harboured the odd doubt , there were only a few weeks to wait for a fall guy .
The presumed assassin hove into view right on cue : Andrei Lugovoi , another former KGB agent and security consultant , had left a radioactive trail all over aircraft , offices and hotels .
In late May , 2007 – by which time he was safely back in Russia – the British submitted a formal request for his extradition .
That the Russians turned it down flat only completed the familiar picture .
Russia was guilty ; guilty as hell .
Now , maybe the simple and obvious explanation is the correct one .
Maybe Putin , a former KGB man – " once a chekist , always a chekist " , as the saying goes ( Lenin 's Cheka was the forerunner of the KGB ) – had personally issued the order to punish Litvinenko as the traitor that , in his eyes , he undoubtedly was .
If you think it a stretch to believe that Putin himself commissioned the dirty deed , how about a splinter group of resentful erstwhile KGB colleagues ?
Nor need the motive stop there .
Litvinenko fell ill the day after he was granted British citizenship .
Might his killer (s ) not have had a supplementary purpose : to use this very public , lingering death to scare Britain 's most outspoken Russian exiles into leaving , or at least keeping their anti-Putin thoughts quiet ?
The explanation is neat , self - contained and entirely plausible .
But is it the truth , or anything like the truth ?
You do not have to be a Le Carré to see espionage and exile as fertile fields for deception .
The most straightforward story may turn out to contain hidden depths or be built on shifting sand .
And there were early signs – not least in the speed with which the official British version became set in diplomatic aspic – that there might have been more to the affair than met the eye .
The first people to articulate doubts , characteristically , were the myriad conspiracists of the blogosphere – which was useful to peddlers of the official view in that it helped to discredit more substantial doubters .
Over the months , however , alternative versions have grown in consistency and authority to the point where they now deserve a serious hearing .

Contributions have been made by individuals who patently know what they are talking about – whether it is the science of radiation , the byways of espionage or the incestuous milieu of exiled Russians .
Locked out of the mainstream media as irresponsible fantasists , they have turned to the alternative media , or to blogs .
The most recent and , to my mind , most persuasive , piece of revisionism managed , just , to cross the bridge to the mainstream .
A long and detailed article by the veteran US investigative journalist , Edward Jay Epstein , it was printed in The New York Sun ( 19 March 2008 ) and has been avidly read and critiqued on the internet .
So far as I am aware , this article has not been published in Britain , but that has not prevented it being dismissed as inconsequential .
It was referred to contemptuously by Litvinenko's widow , Marina , in an article that appeared recently ( 27 March ) under her name in The Times .
She tossed it off as a piece printed " in a third - rate New York newspaper " written by a " fringe American journalist " .
The thrust of her article was a call for a public inquest into her husband 's death .
But the timing of its publication , soon after the appearance of Epstein 's investigative tour de force , suggests that a pre-emptive trashing of his thesis was at least part of the reason why she put pen to paper when she did .
I have a great deal of time for Marina Litvinenko .
She has suffered her extraordinary , and in many ways tragic , predicament with immense dignity and forbearance .
Her romance with Alexander , whom she describes as the love of her life , had lasted 16 years , and was ended brutally .
She comes across as utterly honest and sincere .
She is all of a piece and she does not adapt either her manner or her story according to the audience .
In one way , however , she may not be the most useful witness .
What she actually knew about her husband 's work , either in Russia or after they fled to Britain , appears not to be a great deal .
As someone who found love relatively late in life , she says , she saw it as her role to make her husband 's complicated life easier in whatever way she could .
A former dance teacher , petite and elegant , she professes to have taken no part , nor even exercised any curiosity about , what his work in exile entailed .
She does say , though , that he was often homesick , adapted poorly to life abroad and spent much time watching Russian television news and videos of old Russian films .
She hints , too , that he had a difficult side .
As she tells it , he could be dogmatic , tending to see the world in black and white .
In Russia , she says – and again , this would fit his character – his work was on the policing side of the intelligence services , and focused on investigating the organised crime that burgeoned in the 1990s .
He also served in the border region adjacent to Chechnya – that was where he had grown up – and helped recruit informers from among anti-Russian Chechen fighters .
Marina says he was not trained in espionage , nor did he ever work as a secret agent – by which I think she means he was never a cold - war - style spy .
She saw him , rather , as a painstaking and dedicated seeker after truth .
She also presents him as a stickler for the law , and cites his adamant refusal to let her drive the family car before she had passed her British driving test , even though she had a Russian licence .
He would do nothing , she said , absolutely nothing , that might put the family on the wrong side of the law of the land that had given them refuge .
Yet Edward Jay Epstein is not someone whose journalism should be dismissed lightly .
He is , to be sure , something of a professional sceptic , but that does not make him wrong .
He has in the past exposed stories published in The New York Times as having been essentially dictated by the political establishment .
How right he was about the cosy relationship between that venerable newspaper and the Administration was evident from its obsequious coverage of Iraq 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction – a humungous error that eventually produced an abject apology .
No one in the journalistic world would deny that Epstein 's investigative pedigree is serious or that he has an ear for " spin " and disinformation .
In compiling his article for The New York Sun – and the more exhaustive material that appears on his website – he interviewed dozens of people and delved into the scientific aspects of the case .
In what was a considerable coup , he also went to Moscow , where he was allowed to see the extradition papers submitted by the British for their chief suspect , Andrei Lugovoi .
These are documents that no one in Britain has seen , not even Litvinenko 's widow .
Marina , not unreasonably , resents this , and regards Epstein 's expedition as a Russian propaganda ploy .
She says he was " invited " to Moscow on the understanding that his article would be supportive of the Russian view .
The Russians may well have been kindly disposed towards Epstein as a sceptic of the conventional wisdom .
But he tells the story of his Moscow trip rather differently .
He says that it took much persistence to get to Russia , and then to gain access to the papers .
As for being invited , most foreigners need an invitation from a Russian institution to obtain a visa , so Marina 's point may be technically true without implying anything about Epstein 's objectivity .
What he says struck him above all about the papers was the flimsiness of the British case and the lack of even a post - mortem report .
In that respect , Marina may have a point about his pro-Russian sympathies .
But it is the theory he eventually gravitates towards to which Marina Litvinenko so takes exception .
This is that Alexander poisoned himself while handling radioactive material .
Epstein posits that Litvinenko was poisoned by accident – the post mortem , he says , would have determined whether he ingested the polonium - 210 or inhaled it .
Part of his thesis is that the isotope had been smuggled to London not to murder someone , but as part of an illegal nuclear transaction .
Marina 's refusal to entertain such a theory is understandable .
As she says , " I have to protect my husband 's good name . "
The husband she knew was faithful , honest and law - abiding to a fault .
The very notion that he would be involved in illicit , not to mention highly dangerous , dealings seems to her alien in the extreme .
It is partly to quash such speculation that she is pressing , through her solicitor – the respected human rights lawyer , Louise Christian – for a full inquest into her husband 's death .
If she cannot have justice , she says , she deserves at least the truth .
The British authorities do not seem to be exactly rushing to hold an inquest , even though the last agony of Litvinenko , a Russian exile who had just become a British national , must surely qualify as one of the most shocking deaths to have occurred in the capital for years .
The delay can be explained by a technicality : if a prosecution is in prospect , then an inquest is not held until afterwards , because all relevant questions might be cleared up by a trial .
On her client 's behalf , Christian is categorical about what makes an inquest imperative .
There was , she says , a " massive breach of security " .
A lethal radioactive substance was brought into the country " for a terrorist purpose ....
Not only Litvinenko was contaminated , but other individuals as well " .
It is vital , she says , that lessons are learnt – and for that it needs to be established where the polonium was produced , how it came into the country , and how it was subsequently spread around .
It is up to the St Pancras coroner , as this is the jurisdiction that University College Hospital comes under , whether and when an inquest is held .
And while coroners officially enjoy substantial independence , there are points where political pressure can be exerted .
So the more time that elapses without an inquest being scheduled into one of London 's most high - profile deaths , the more the delay looks suspicious .
After all , if the case is as cut and dried as the British government has consistently made out , what has anyone possibly to lose ?
The answer , if the persistent digging of informed sceptics , such as Epstein , has come anywhere near the truth , could be an awful lot .
Consider the questions that remain open almost 18 months after Litvinenko 's death .
There are a great many of them ; some overlap , but they are roughly divisible into five clusters .
The most obvious relate to the polonium - 210 that was identified as the cause of his illness just before he died .
Then there is the role of Andrei Lugovoi .
The Crown Prosecution Service says it has enough evidence to charge with murder , but the only third party to have seen the papers , Edward Epstein , says the case is extremely thin .
Third , there are the mysterious activities of Litvinenko himself .
The fourth cluster of questions concerns the part , if any , played by the British secret services , and , last , the role of the exiled Russian oligarch , the enigmatic Boris Berezovsky .
For the sake of clarity , I will deal with these groups of questions one by one .
Polonium
The accepted wisdom has been that polonium - 210 is produced only in Russia and that the particular laboratory , its jurisdiction and so the identity of the organisation that gave the crucial order , would be easily identified .
Since then , no names have been named , even though the " right " answers should surely bolster the British contention that Russia , or the former KGB , was behind the killing .
Unofficially , the Avangard plant at Sarov , east of Moscow , is thought the likely source .
So why have British officials not named it ?
One explanation is that the police are holding back such details for fear of jeopardising the accused 's chance of a fair trial .
Given that a trial now seems such a remote prospect , though , it is hard to see why this information is still not in the public domain .
Another explanation might be that the answers do not fit the favoured theory .
What is certain is that Russia is not the only producer of polonium - 210 .
Epstein ( among others ) reports that , while Russia produces it for export to the United States (! ) , any country with a nuclear reactor not subject to IAEA inspection can produce it – they include China , Israel , Pakistan , India and North Korea .
So the consolation that there is only Russia to worry about is flat wrong .
But there is another , and perhaps bigger , problem .
Scientists who know anything about polonium - 210 find it hard to believe that anyone would choose it as a murder weapon against one individual , even if the purpose was to evade detection .
For a start , it is extremely expensive .
But it also fits much more comfortably into another scenario : that of nuclear smuggling .
It seems far more likely that the polonium tracked in London was part of some sort of deal – a deal that , for whatever reason , went disastrously wrong .
Demand for polonium - 210 on the illegal international market is as a key element in detonating a nuclear explosion .
This is why it commands such a fantastically high price – hundreds of thousands , if not the many millions , of dollars mentioned by some .
Money , and even nuclear terrorism , thus emerge as plausible motives to compete with the theory of a Putin - inspired political assassination .
Either would entail embarrassment for the British authorities , for it would suggest that illegal nuclear trafficking was going on under their very noses , with all the attendant dangers to the population .
It also raises the question of border security .
The small matter of how such a lethal substance got into the country pertains , of course , regardless of its intended purpose .
So far , however , this crucial question has been successfully muffled by the horror of the presumed crime and the blanket allegation that " the Russians did it " .
Lugovoi
The second cluster of questions relates to Andrei Lugovoi , charged in Britain with Litvinenko 's murder .
A former KGB agent with his own security company , he was singled out from the radiation trail left on several planes and at various locations in London .
This trail was also used to determine that the poisoning took place at the Pine Bar at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair and that the polonium was disguised in a cup of tea .
Despite the familiarity of this version , practically every element of it raises doubts .
The sequence of meetings and flights that established Lugovoi as the original carrier of the polonium has been convincingly challenged .
The British – Epstein and others have suggested – have omitted details of flights and contaminated sites that would contradict the thesis that the polonium originated with Lugovoi .
Counter - theories make Litvinenko himself the centre , and source , of the contamination .
They track the radiation trail first from London , rather than Russia .
They also note that one of the properties reported ( by The Independent , 26 January 2007 ) as contaminated – an office building at 25 Grosvenor Street in Mayfair , does not figure in the official trail .
It is an office building believed to be owned by Boris Berezovsky .
Some of the most persistent doubts about the fingering of Lugovoi centre on the meeting in the Pine Bar .
Lugovoi – of whose account more later – sees this encounter as a set - up designed to frame him .
He says that Litvinenko dropped in only briefly and that no tea was ordered or drunk .
Lugovoi also notes that no CCTV footage has ever been produced to prove the Pine Bar / contaminated tea story , even though the place bristled with cameras .
The closest thing to evidence was a story that appeared out of the blue in the British press a full seven months later , identifying the waiter who supposedly served the tea .
This has all the hallmarks of an effort to shore up a version teetering on the brink of collapse .
If there was any deliberate poisoning – by tea , or any other substance – the most plausible venue appears to be a room at the same hotel where the two met earlier that same day ( 1 November ) .
But the two had met on two previous occasions as well : two weeks before at another hotel , and in August at Litvinenko 's home .
There is nothing , however , to prove conclusively who poisoned whom – nor to disprove the theory that Litvinenko might somehow have been poisoned by mistake .
Lugovoi has , of course , strenuously denied that he was the assassin – and , of course , he would , would n't he ?
I would argue , though , that what he had to say when he gave his first Moscow press conference ( 31 May 2007 ) , and repeated at a later appearance ( 29 August 2007 ) held largely for the British media , does not necessarily deserve to be dismissed as fabrication .
On both occasions , Lugovoi appears cocky – but this does not prove he is lying .
What also impresses is his spontaneity and the consistency of the detail under questioning .
His account of approaches from MI6 and meetings with named agents at a New Cavendish Street address – have a ring of truth .
It is worth noting , too , that none of the details has been denied by any branch of the British authorities .
The have preferred the time - honoured tactic of ridicule .
As Lugovoi tells it , a long , calculated effort was made by MI6 to recruit him – an effort he eventually rebuffed .
He said they wanted him to pass on intelligence and dish the dirt on Putin .
He also says that after Litvinenko died , he " cooperated with the Crown Prosecutor 's office and answered every question .
I also answered all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators asked me . "
There has been no denial of this from either the CPS or the Met .
Would a murderer be so cooperative ?
Lugovoi 's central defence , however , is lack of motive .
" Just think of it , " he says .
" They have found a Russian James Bond , who has access to nuclear plants and poisons a friend in cold blood , and , in so doing , poisons himself , his friends , his children and his wife ....
Then , as a result , he loses his business and clients .
The main question is what for ?
Where is the motive for my crime ? "
For the record , Lugovoi 's lack of motive is something that also worries Litvinenko 's widow .
What we have here , then , is a chief suspect with no motive , who may not have been the source of the polonium , and who says he was set up by MI6 .
If this last point is true , then there may be other reasons why he has been accused – and why the British might not want him in a London witness box .
This could explain something else that has long been a mystery to me .
I always found it difficult to believe that the British ever seriously expected to obtain Lugovoi 's extradition , especially against a Russian constitutional provision that expressly protects Russian nationals against being delivered to a foreign country .
I never understood , either , why the British were so furious about Russia 's non-compliance that almost the first act of David Miliband as Foreign Secretary was to up the ante by expelling four Russian diplomats .
British official fury becomes more much more comprehensible , however , if Lugovoi 's real crime in their eyes was not to have killed Litvinenko , but to have fled the clutches of British intelligence – with , perhaps , information valuable enough to buy his safety back home .
Fast - tracked into the Russian parliament last December , he now enjoys immunity not only from extradition , but from prosecution in his own country .
In sum , there are plenty of reasons not to accept the accusations against Andrei Lugovoi at face value .
Litvinenko
The authorised British version is that Alexander Litvinenko was a political refugee who paid the ultimate price for his vocal opposition to Putin .
The more that emerges about him , however , the more complicated his life seems to have been .
Mystery surrounds precisely how Litvinenko occupied himself when he was not at home watching old videos .
He and his family received a house and an income from Boris Berezovsky 's charitable foundation , but it is not clear what his paymaster might have asked of him in return .
According to the book written jointly by his widow and Alex Goldfarb – the Russian émigré who issued the bulletins on Litvinenko 's fatal illness – he helped conduct due diligence investigations into Russian companies on the part of would - be foreign investors .
He is also known to have travelled frequently , mainly to Georgia and other countries formerly in the Soviet Union .
At the same time , much of the information he had been privy to as an investigator in the commercial division of Russian intelligence in the 1990s would have been out of date , so his usefulness to any investor would have been limited – as it would have been to a foreign intelligence service .
It was apparently the low grade of information he had to offer that brought a rejection from his first choice of asylum – the United States .
There has been speculation that towards the end he had money worries , precipitated perhaps by a desire to break with Berezovsky .
Others say this is disinformation .
What is not in dispute is that he had known Andrei Lugovoi in the 1990s and that they shared a connection with Boris Berezovsky .
They had not been in touch , however , for almost 10 years , when Litvinenko suddenly approached Lugovoi from London , and suggested meeting up .
Lugovoi says they then did some – unidentified – projects together , though he suggests that Litvinenko did little more than sit in on his meetings , in the hope , perhaps , of drumming up some business for himself .
No evidence has emerged that either was involved in nuclear smuggling – or , if they were , on whose behalf .
One person who definitely was involved in such murky dealings , however , is Mario Scaramella , the Italian businessman and academic , whom Litvinenko met on 1 November at the Itsu restaurant in Piccadilly .
It is also worth noting that one of the few instances of nuclear smuggling to have come to light in recent years ( of uranium ) concerned a Russian man caught in Georgia in 2007 as part of an FBI " sting " operation .
Which introduces another dimension .
Nuclear smuggling has been much trumpeted as a global peril since the collapse of the Soviet Union , but very few cases have become public , even though Western governments would surely have an interest in demonstrating that the threat was real and being successfully addressed .
In fact , I know of no case that has been reported that was not linked to a " sting " operation – staged by Western intelligence agencies to find out the extent of nuclear smuggling going on .
A celebrated case uncovered in Germany in 1997 led to Russian accusations that , in their zeal to mount " sting operations " , Western intelligence agents were creating an artificial market in illicit nuclear materials .
Such " stings " , they complained , amounted to " provocations " .
It is worth bearing this criticism in mind .
MI6
So is it fanciful to suggest that British intelligence might have had a role in the Litvinenko affair ?
And if so , what might it have been ?
It has been confidently reported that , at the time of his death , Litvinenko was receiving a retainer from MI6 .
For obvious reasons ,
This will never be confirmed , although irregular payments to exiles for particular pieces of information are routinely made .
A retainer , though , would suggest more systematic cooperation .
Lonely in London , Litvinenko also joined the circle of exiles that gathered around Oleg Gordievsky , the celebrated Russian double agent who defected to Britain back in 1985 .
Gordievsky has pronounced on the case at several key junctures .
Immediately after Litvinenko's death , he mentioned the meeting between Litvinenko and Lugovoi in a room at the Millennium Hotel that preceded their encounter in the hotel 's Pine Bar .
This is where he suggested that Litvinenko really drank poisoned tea .
He also mentioned the presence of a third man , called Vladislav or similar – as another possible assassin .
Some of this may be disinformation – after all , " once a chekist , always a chekist " – but some of it may not be .
Lugovoi , as another former KGB man , also has credibility problems .
But it is not only his account of approaches from MI6 that rings true .
He has also described a meeting with Litvinenko at the offices of the Erinys security company in Mayfair ( 25 Grosvenor Street ) , which he understood to be part of Berezovsky 's empire .
He observed that the company seemed to be peppered with former British intelligence agents – which suggests an improbable , but not impossible , crossover between the activities of Berezovsky and those of MI6 .
It might also require a reassessment of Berezovsky 's activities in Britain .
It is not at all clear what relations MI6 had with Litvinenko , Lugovoi or Berezovsky , but you do not have to rely on Lugovoi 's self - interested testimony to suspect that it was involved with all three .
The current head of MI6 , John Scarlett , emerges as a linchpin .
He is believed to have recruited both Gordievsky and Litvinenko .
He , or his people , may also have played a part in trying to recruit Lugovoi .
Gordievsky receives a relatively generous government pension .
In addition , he was made a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) in the Queen 's honours list last year – in a nice touch , it was the same award as that received by the fictional James Bond .
He also appears from time to time to be called upon to sing for his supper – as two years ago when he told the BBC that the story of British agents in Moscow being caught using fake rocks as a dead - letterbox was " ridiculous " .
Marina Litvinenko says she knew of no contacts between her husband and British intelligence .
But she did talk to me about the haven that he found in Gordievsky 's circle .
Perhaps Gordievsky was the link .
It seems safe to say that Litvinenko had a relationship with MI6 , which could be seen as providing a motive for Russia – or rival Russian exiles – to eliminate him .
But it could also be seen as a hint of desperation : perhaps he could find no other line of paying business .
Whatever the truth , MI6 probably knows more about what happened to Litvinenko , and why , than might be concluded from its complete non-appearance in the authorised British version of his death .
Berezovsky
If the shadowy hand of MI6 can be detected in the Litvinenko affair , then so can that of Boris Berezovsky .
The Russian exile , multi-millionaire property magnate , and perpetual thorn in Putin 's side , was a constant presence behind the scenes .
It was he who sponsored Litvinenko's entry to Britain – out of gratitude , it is said , for Litvinenko 's refusal , in the late Nineties , to act on orders to kill him .
He appears to have been Litvinenko's main source of employment in Britain , and his charity continues to support his widow .
Berezovsky also had links to Lugovoi .
Back in Russia , he had employed Lugovoi to organise his security , and Lugovoi 's company was , until recently at least , reported to have the contract for protecting Berezovsky 's daughter .
In the last week of Litvinenko 's life , it was also Berezovsky 's money that bought the publicity campaign , so expertly fronted by Alex Goldfarb .
Thus the view that the British public had of Litvinenko 's illness and death was essentially dictated by Berezovsky .
Until the very end , neither the hospital , nor the British authorities , nor the Russian embassy contributed anything at all .
Berezovsky , through Goldfarb and the PR company , Bell Pottinger , had the field entirely to himself .
Some have asked whether so comprehensive a PR effort might not have been intended as a diversion – to disguise , say , a catastrophic accident to Berezovsky 's employee and recast it as a Kremlin - ordered assassination .
That can not be excluded .
More likely , though , it is possible that Berezovsky genuinely believed Litvinenko to have been targeted by the Kremlin – as a proxy , perhaps , for himself .
As well as perhaps feeling guilty , Berezovsky doubtless saw another opportunity to pursue his campaign against Putin .
And if , as it appears , his first instinct was to suspect poisoning with thallium , the assumption of Kremlin involvement would have made perfect sense .
The discovery that the poison was not thallium , but polonium - 210 , however – a substance that would be intended for mass , rather than individual , annihilation – suggests that the context was not political vendetta , but illicit nuclear trading .
The careless handling of radioactive material then becomes by far the most likely explanation for Litvinenko 's death .
That the polonium might also have been tracked as part of an attempted security services " sting " would also explain why British officials have stuck so rigidly to their version .
Why , after all , would they choose to pick a quarrel with the Kremlin , rather than present Litvinenko as the accidental victim of Russian émigré nuclear trafficking – unless there was something in the latter explanation they needed to hide ?
And what implications do these five clusters of questions have for Anglo - Russian relations ?
Aside from her natural desire to clear the cloud of suspicion that is increasingly gathering over her husband 's activities , Alexander Litvinenko 's widow , Marina , may have another reason to press her call for an inquest now .
As Russia prepares to inaugurate a new president , Dmitry Medvedev , she hopes that the Kremlin 's line might soften .
In fact , any softening so far is to be discerned on the British side .
We have not heard any furious public statements about Russia 's iniquities for a while .
It was announced recently that a new ambassador had been appointed to take over from Sir Anthony Brenton , who had angered the Kremlin by consorting with opposition figures .
The slanging match over the British Council has dropped out of the news ; discussions on the visa regime are to be unfrozen , and even the one - time attack - dog , David Miliband , has spoken of the need for dialogue with Russia .
The decks , it seems , are being cleared for a new start under a new president , even if the old leader , Vladimir Putin , will initially be directing the production from the wings .
Unfortunately , a victim of the new rapprochement could be the truth – the real truth – about what happened to Alexander Litvinenko .
Sad to say , there may be those in Britain who are even more interested than the new overlord of the Kremlin in seeing this divisive case consigned to oblivion .
Sourdough bread feeling pinch of high prices

Local salmon is off the menu .
Fresh crab is getting scarce .
And now the food perhaps most synonymous with San Francisco itself is taking a hit .
Sourdough bread , the legendary staple of the original Forty - Niners , may be headed for luxury status .
An unprecedented spike in the cost of flour has meant prices for sourdough and other locally baked breads are surging .
" It used to be that I would buy a loaf of good - quality bread every time I went shopping for dinner , " said 34 - year - old teacher Annie Wilkens as she studied the bread lineup at a local supermarket .
" My husband and I would finish half , and then the rest would sit hardening on our counter until I bought the next loaf and threw that one away .
Now , I really try not to waste it . "
With an artisan loaf of bread priced from $ 2 to $ 5 , " it really just begins to add up . "
While the costs of gas and some food commodities fluctuate substantially , wheat has been relatively immune to price bumps .
But not this year .
Wholesale flour prices have tripled in the last six months , the result of a number of circumstances including the lowest supply in 60 years , increased demand worldwide , high transportation costs and a weak dollar .
" This is the worst I 've ever seen it , " said Dan Giraudo , vice president of operations for family - owned Boudin Bakery , which has been baking sourdough in San Francisco since Gold Rush days .
Michael Rose , co-owner of Semifreddi's in Emeryville , said his flour costs have jumped from $ 2,000 to $ 6,000 a day , forcing him to raise wholesale prices 10 cents per loaf .
That means the sourdough baguette that you 'll find in one of Semifreddi's retail outlets for $ 1.95 - up from $ 1.75 at the beginning of the year - may be $ 2.29 or more at Whole Foods .
It 's a similar story elsewhere .
Steve Sullivan of Acme Bread Co. in Mountain View says it costs him $ 140,000 more per month than last summer to make the same amount of bread .
He 's raised prices by 8 percent .
The shortage in a crop once considered affordable and plentiful has Bay Area bakers jockeying for flour shipments , adjusting prices and speculating about the causes .
Traditionally , a tight supply could be credited to poor weather and small harvests .
But this time , those explanations are just the tip of the iceberg .
The real problem , said Keith Giusto , president of Central Milling in Oakland and owner of Full Circle Bakery in Petaluma , is that for many farmers the crop is not worth planting .
" From the early ' 80s until now , wheat has been depressed .
Now , with rising production of ethanol and diesel , farmers see an opportunity to plant corn or soybeans instead . "
Plus , there 's the fact that emerging countries are developing more Westernized palates .
" Not only do you have people in India and China eating more bread products , " Giusto said , but the growing middle class throughout the world is also eating more beef .
" The cows are eating grain , too , " he said .
While sourdough may be dearest to the Bay Area 's heart , the impact of the flour shortage is n't limited to bread .
" Everybody who has been to a supermarket lately has noticed that anything that has wheat in it - from English muffins to naan to frozen waffles - has gone up , " said Michael Mindel , senior vice president of marketing for Corte Madera - based Il Fornaio bakery and restaurant group .
Still , with its relatively straightforward blend of flour , water and salt , punched up by the distinctive tang of the Bay Area 's native bacteria , sourdough has always been relatively inexpensive to produce and has filled restaurant bread baskets throughout Northern California .
But that could be changing .
At Nordstrom 's Cafe Bistro , lunchtime servers do n't automatically bring bread ; diners have to ask for it , although it 's still complimentary .
Nearby , at Boulette 's Larder , patrons pay $ 5 for a plate of assorted slices .
Other restaurateurs are also rethinking the way they handle bread service .
" We 're happy to give you bread , " said Gabriel Amaya , owner of San Francisco neighborhood spot Olea , although he points out that bread is " a huge expense . "
Olea 's menu notes that bread is available for those who request it , which Amaya said lets him keep his prices affordable .
" We 'd rather not raise the prices on our menu to account for bread for everybody " when only some diners eat it , he explained .
At Nopa , on San Francisco 's Divisadero Street , chef / owner Laurence Jossel will serve bread only if diners ask for it .
It 's been that way since he opened Nopa in 2006 .
" For us , it 's more about sustainability , " Jossel said , adding that he 's bothered by how much bread he 's seen thrown away over the years .
But his approach has helped him save money .
" Instead of spending what would probably be about $ 150 a day on bread , we 're only spending about $ 40 , " he said .
Mindel of Il Fornaio does n't have the same luxury .
" One of the signature things at our restaurants is that we give a basket of ciabatta , olive bread and breadsticks to each table when they sit down , " he said , noting that it 's not something they feel they can stop doing .
Mindel said the company has absorbed the rising costs .
" You ca n't raise prices on something you do n't charge for , " he said .
And while most restaurateurs say they have no intention of charging for bread - at least in the foreseeable future - diners will see their checks rise to account for high flour prices in other items , like pasta and pizza .
The kitchen at Perbacco makes its own pasta , said Staffan Terje , executive chef and owner of the Financial District restaurant , which means it uses lots of flour .
" Pasta has always been associated with reasonably priced dishes on menus , " said Terje .
" Now it might not be the cheapest thing any more . "
In the pizza industry , " it 's pretty serious , " said Tony Gemignani , owner of the popular Pyzano 's restaurant in Castro Valley .
Gemignani has raised prices twice in the last few months - in October and January .
He 's noticed other pizzerias cutting down on the weight of the pizza crust , which he says he 's unwilling to do .
" I 've heard customers complain about ( the prices ) , but we have an excuse - the price of wheat , the minimum wage increase , and gas is high .
It 's not like we 've done this for no reason , " Gemignani said .
Not everyone seems bothered , however .
Some bakery and restaurant owners say their customers seem oblivious to climbing bread prices , and argue that , all things considered , bread is pretty cheap .
Still , for a food long associated with affordability , not to mention with San Francisco 's history and collective palate , people may no longer be able to take sourdough - and the Bay Area 's other artisan breads - for granted .
Said Boudin's Giraudo : " I think the higher prices are here to stay for a while . "

While the New World Mine proposal ( once a very serious proposal ) above Cooke City was pretty much defeated in 1996 - 7 , there are a group of outstanding patented mining claims that could potentially cause trouble .
These will be purchased by the Trust for Public Land , ending forever the development threat they pose .

After a pricing spat with Apple led NBC to pull its video content from iTunes , the broadcaster has struck a deal with Microsoft 's Zune online store .
On Tuesday , as part of an announcement about new Zune features , Microsoft planned to say that it will start selling television programs at the Zune store for viewing on its portable music player .
NBC is among the broadcasters supplying videos for the service .
The videos , which also come from Comedy Central , MTV , Nickelodeon , Turner Broadcasting and VH1 , will cost $ 1.99 each .
Users will be able to choose from 800 episodes .
The price is significant because it is the same that Apple charges for most TV programs in iTunes .
However , at the time of the dispute between Apple and NBC last year , Apple said NBC wanted to increase its wholesale price of each episode by so much that Apple would have to charge $ 4.99 per episode .
Apple said it would n't agree to that price change .
At the time , NBC disputed Apple 's version of events and said that NBC wanted to offer customers a variety of pricing options , including bundles of programs for set fees .
When NBC 's contract with Apple expired in December last year , it was not renewed .
Microsoft 's flexibility over price was one reason NBC wanted to sell its content through the Zune store , according to Microsoft .
" We have worked closely with them around flexibility and protection of IP , " said Julio Estrada , general manager for Zune Social .
" Zune will control the price of the episodes , but we 're open to understanding which episodes can be priced lower and how we may introduce premium content which may be priced higher than $ 1.99 , " he said .
Estrada also hinted at potential future services to be offered through the Xbox .
For now , he would only say that when customers buy any of the TV programs , they 'll be able to watch them on their TVs through their Xbox , connected to the Zune .
NBC did not respond to a request for comment late Monday .
Microsoft 's announcement includes a quote from JB Perrette , president of NBC Universal Digital Distribution , saying the deal with Zune offers NBC flexible packaging and pricing options .
ITunes currently offers packages that include a whole season of a TV show for a discounted rate .
In addition to the new video offerings , Microsoft is updating the Zune software on the device , the software for the PC and the online store .
The updates revolve around an effort to make it easier for people to discover new music and an attempt to offer new social - networking opportunities , Estrada said .
Users of the Zune Card will be able to share and update cards on their Zune devices .
A Zune Card is an electronic snapshot that lists favorite tracks and recently played songs .
While users could previously view and share Zune Cards on the Web , they 'll now be able to drag and drop friends ' cards onto their Zune and receive updates of songs that their friends are listening to each time they sync their Zune .
The software update includes many other minor changes , such as one that lets users browse their video collections by genre and an editing change that lets users edit track and album information more easily .
Zune users will be notified that there is a new version of the software available for download .
Microsoft launched the Zune in late 2006 , joining a market that had been picking up steam since Apple launched the iPod in 2001 .
Microsoft has sold more than 2 million Zunes .
That compares to more than 10 million iPods sold in the first three months of this year .
When Robb Topolski made the initial discovery that Comcast was interfering with BitTorrent traffic , he could n't have imagined that it would lead to an FCC hearing or , more importantly , to apparent reconciliation this week between Comcast and the rest of the world .
Thing is , Robb does n't believe a word of it .
Ever since the news broke that Comcast had been using ‘ hacker - like ’ techniques to hamper BitTorrent traffic , Comcast ’s name has been dragged through the mud , with claim after claim of dirty tricks , lies , half - truths and strategic omission .
It seems that nothing could go right for the company .
Until this week , that is .
Apparently , everything in the Comcast garden is rosy these days , with previous arch-rival BitTorrent now working things out together over afternoon tea .
However , not everyone is celebrating .
In 2007 , Robb Topolski discovered and documented the Comcast interference , informed TorrentFreak and we published an article which ignited the whole debate .
It ’s safe to say , he ’s been following this one closely .
Here are his thoughts on the Comcast / BitTorrent reconciliation :
— –
I ’m probably a key figure as to why we ’re all talking about Network Neutrality again .
I was having a problem uploading on Gnutella in early 2007 .
I tracked it down to Comcast using Sandvine - injected RST packets .
Blog stories led to press stories which led to independent confirmation .
And here we are today .
Peace and harmony ?
Probably not .
Today Comcast and BitTorrent seems to have solved world hunger — and I ’d love nothing more than to be optimistic about it .
But I can not be .
As they say on Slashdot — show video , or it did n’t happen .
This deal is treachery , relies on how much we can trust the word of Comcast , and leaves the public interests out in the cold .
I think it ’s strange that anyone believes a word that Comcast says .
This is the Comcast that :
1 . Told the FCC in 2005 that they would not degrade traffic in order to convince the FCC that network neutrality regulations were not needed .
2. Started degrading P2P traffic the very next year , and failed to tell anyone what they were doing .
3 . Used a system that utilized forgery , and successfully placed blame on the other peer instead of Comcast .
4. Denied it when caught .
5 . Then changed their story when the denials were not believed , but still never came out and said what they were doing .
6 . Then they justified their actions by throwing their other Cable - Internet brothers and sisters under the bus with their “ they do it too ! ” defense
7 . Then stealthily changed the AUP days before an FCC filing where they referred to the new provisions .
8 . When the changed AUP started getting press attention , they stated that a prominent story on Comcast .
net alerted millions of visitors of the change and accused Marvin Ammori of crying wolf .
( Google cache proved that nothing alerted users to the changed AUP until the day after the press started asking questions . )
9 . Then they packed the Harvard FCC hearing .
This company has not demonstrated that you can trust its promises , nor can you believe its assertions .
Comcast just used BitTorrent Inc. as a tool to try and defang the FCC .
BitTorrent Inc. is a content provider .
Vuze , who actually DID make a complaint and petition to the FCC , is a competitor .
Neither BitTorrent , Vuze , nor Comcast represents the interests of 12 million Comcast users nor the The Internet Society nor the public .
And this middle - of - the - night deal was made without their input .
Nothing has changed .
The RST interference continues .
It was a wrongful act .
BitTorrent Inc. has no right making a deal with Comcast allowing it to continue to commit wrongful acts until it finally decides it is ready to stop .
The correct relief is to stop the interference immediately and to FULLY DISCLOSE what it did and to accept responsibility for those actions .
( Even today , Comcast ’s Policy VP refused to answer questions about the interference . )
Their word is worthless .
Until the interference stops , I have no reason to believe it will .
Until either meaningful competition returns to broadband , or until sufficient government regulation enforces Network Neutrality , we have no reason to think that this agreement will last through the night .
Robb Topolski

TorrentFreak confronted Ashwin Navin of BitTorrent Inc. with Robb ’s comments , and he told us : “ We decided to collaborate with Comcast because they agreed to stop using RSTs , increase upload capacity , and evaluate network hardware that accelerates media delivery and file transfers .
We ’re at the beginning of the formal collaboration , but Robb ’s work was instrumental to identify the offending practice .
We need him and the community to keep an eye on ISPs across the world . ”
“ Our work with Comcast will benefit all P2P development because Comcast has agreed to manage traffic at Layer 3 ( the network layer ) rather than Layers 4 - 7 ( the protocol / application layers ) .
This is a core component of the neutrality debate , ” he added .
As always , time will tell …
A Mexican donkey has landed itself in jail after biting and kicking two men .
The animal was locked up in a holding pen normally used for keeping drunks off the streets after it lashed out at the pair at a ranch in Chiapas state , local police revealed yesterday .
The owner of the angry ass , Mauro Gutierrez , has been told that he will have to pay the injured men's medical bills before the creature is released from custody .
Genaro Vazquez , 63 , told police that the unnamed donkey bit him in the chest on Sunday and then kicked 52 - year - old Andres Hernandez as he tried to come to the rescue , fracturing his ankle .
" All of a sudden , the animal was on top of us like it was rabid , " Hernandez said .
It took six men to restrain the enraged beast , police said .
Throwing non-humans in is nothing new in Chiapas .
Previous animal inmates include a bull that devoured corn crops and destroyed two wooden vending stands in March .
In 2006 a dog was locked up for 12 days after biting someone .
His owners were fined US$ 18 .
Yesterday , a Chiapas police officer Sinar Gomez said the donkey would remain behind bars until its owner agreed to pay the men's $ 420 ( £ 215 ) medical bills .
" Around here , if someone commits a crime they are jailed no matter who they are , " said Gomez .
Big Brown trainer Rick Dutrow Jr. and 11 others close to horse racing have been asked to appear before Congress on June 19 , the House Subcommittee on Commerce , Trade , and Consumer Protection announced on Wednesday .
" Recent high - profile deaths , including Eight Belles at this year 's Kentucky Derby , Barbaro after his 2006 Preakness injury , and George Washington in last year 's Breeder 's Cup Classic , point to a persistent and widespread problem , raising significant questions about the sport and its governance , " Chairman Bobby L. Rush , D - Ill . and ranking member Ed Whitfield , R - Ky. , said in the joint release .
California Horse Racing Board Chairman Richard Shapiro , National Thoroughbred Racing Association President and CEO Alex Waldrop and four veterinarians have also been asked to appear in letters sent out last month .
Whitfield has been a proponent of a national governing body that would standardize horse racing rules when it comes to steroids , jockey weight , approved medicines and insurance .
" Each state is its own island , " said Shapiro , whose state will begin enforcing a steroids ban on July 1 .
" That 's part of the problem . …
We need one set of rules . "

It 's all lies I tell you !
The theoretical underpinnings of monads in Haskell can be tricky to grasp .
If you simply want to read some input and write some output , and you do n't want to waste time with nonsense like the " monad laws " , you 've come to the right place .
Many programming languages make a distinction between expressions and commands .
For example , in BASIC you could n't sayand in C you can't say .
Haskell is no different .
Like other languages it makes the distinction , and like other languages it has its own slightly idiosyncratic notion of what the difference is .
The IO monad is just a device to help make this distinction .
And that 's the last time I 'll mention the word ' monad ' for a while .
Here 's an example of a Haskell function :
The right hand side is an expression .
Expressions are made of subexpressions and the value of an expression is determined by the value of its subexpressions .
There is no room for anything like acommand here because a print command does n't return a value , it produces output as a side - effect .
So in order to do I / O we need something different : thekeyword .
It 's easy to use : you just writeand then follow it by an indented list of commands .
Here 's a complete Haskell program : Note the .
It 's just like the old days of BASIC programming where you can useto assign a name to a value .
Note also that commands take arguments that can be expressions .
Sois a command , butis an expression .
Again , little different from a language like Python .
But what about input ?
Haskell has a command calledthat reads input from the user .
So here 's an interesting feature of Haskell : commands can return values .
But a command that returns a value is different from an expression with a value .
The difference means we have to write code like this :
We have to useinstead ofto get a returned value out of a command .
It 's a pretty simple rule , the only hassle is you have to remember what 's a command and what 's a function .
You can also write your own commands .
Here 's a simple example that returns a pair of lines entered by the user : Note how we usedinstead ofto get the result of .
We also did the same to get the result of .
But notice one extra feature : we had to useto return a value out of ablock .
So that 's pretty much it .
Here are the rules :
So how do you know what 's a command and what 's an expression ?
If it has any chance of doing I / O it must be a command , otherwise it 's probably an expression .
But you can do silly things like : so occasionally there will be commands that do n't do any IO .
But not the other way round .
Everything in Haskell has a type , even commands .
In general , if a command returns a value of typethen the command itself is of type .
It just has anwrapped around the return type .
For example , is of typeandabove is of type .
Apart from that extrait 's like ordinary expression types .
But note that if you have a bit of code likeyou get a type error .
This is because you must useto extract the input string from thecommand .
Becausehas typeinstead of typethe compiler can catch these kinds of mistakes .
Giving commands and expressions different types means we can't accidentally mix them up .
At this point you might have realised that ifis legal , then this might be legal too :
It is .is simply a function of typethat converts a value of typeto a command of type
You can also rewrite thiswithIn the first version we extractedfromand then converted this value back into another command with .
In the second version we took a shortcut and simply ended with .
So we probably ought to add one more rulealready has the type of a command that returns a string so we can just make it the last line .
But use the former version if you find this confusing , and then you only need four rules .
There 's one last thing that confuses people .
The type of anstatement is the type of its branches .
So if you want anstatement inside ablock , it needs to be a command , and so its branches need to be commands also .
So it 'snot Oh and a little tip .
If theblock has just one command , you can drop the .
So this compiles : You do n't care , or you would n't be reading this .
But suppose you did .
Then I 'd say : Firstly , let 's state clearly what this distinction is .
If something is of typethen it's a command returning an value of type .
Otherwise it's an expression .
That 's the rule .
So here 's the important bit : following the rules above it 's completely impossible to put an executed command inside an expression .
As the only way to do I/O is with commands , that means you have no way to find out what Haskell is doing inside expressions .
And that 's the whole point !
Haskell likes to keep its evaluation secret from you and does n't want you outputting information that might give away what 's going on .
For example , ifwere legal Haskell , and it printed 1 , followed by 2 , then you 'd know that it evaluated the left argument tofirst , and then the second .
Haskell does n't want to reveal this because it wants the freedom to rearrange your code internally without changing its behaviour .
And this makes things easier for you too .
When you seeyou know its exactly the same as , whereas in C++ , say , you have to worry about whetherandhave side effects .
If the type is n't , then you can sleep at night in the confidence that there are no side effects .
( Do you see why you can't sneak a command into an expression ?
It 's quite neat .
To make an expression out of a command you 'd need to do something like extract a return value out of a command .
But to do that you need to useto extract the value of the command .
But you can only useinside ablock .
So the result has to be a command .
Once you 're in a command , there 's no way out ! )
One last thing .
Much of what I 've said above is false .
But what I hope I have done is describe a subset of Haskell in which you can start some I/ O programming without having a clue what a monad is .
Once you 're successfully bootstrapped , then you 'll be ready for the truth .
No more of that " monads are too hard " defense .
PS
You can think of the above as using taint as a way to sequester commands from other expressions .

Recently forced out as president of the World Bank , Paul Wolfowitz , one of the primary architects of U.S. President George W. Bush 's Iraq war , is heading back to familiar surroundings .
And the Washington - based American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , one of the United States ' premier conservative think - tanks , is more than pleased to welcome him back .
Earlier this month , AEI President Christopher DeMuth announced that Wolfowitz would be coming on board as a visiting scholar to work on such issues as international economic development , Africa , and public - private partnerships .
Wolfowitz told the Financial Times that he would be " explor[ing ] some ways to help advance development in Africa , both through the private sector and through foundation work . "
Prior to joining the Pentagon in 2001 , Wolfowitz served as a member of AEI 's Council of Academic Advisers .
After leaving his post as deputy secretary of defense with the Bush administration , the World Bank position appeared to be the perfect fit for Wolfowitz ; a place to rehabilitate a reputation badly damaged by his serial misjudgments over developments in Iraq .
However , nearly midway through his term at the World Bank , things started to unravel as evidence mounted about Wolfowitz 's ethical lapses .
His efforts to get his girlfriend ( a bank employee ) promoted , charges that he was a poor manager , and a growing concern among member countries that he was using the bank to advance U.S. interests fueled the fire .
As Graydon Carter , editor of Vanity Fair magazine , pointed out in his June " Editor 's Letter " ( written prior to Wolfowitz 's World Bank exit strategy ) , things had gotten so bad for Wolfowitz that he had become " a source of ridicule within the international organization that employees have published a satirical monograph called ' La Banca Swirlla ' ( ' Bank Swirled ' ) . "
According to RightWeb , a project of the International Relations Center , Wolfowitz received mixed reviews for his work at the World Bank .
On the plus side , " He badgered the United States and other wealthy countries to cut subsidies to aid development in poorer countries , fervently pursued anti-corruption policies , and announced moves aimed at strengthening the bank 's internal watchdog , the Department of Institutional Integrity . "
Critics , however , were quick to point to the fact that Wolfowitz , a controversial choice to begin with because of his involvement with the Iraq War , exacerbated the controversy by choosing to bring on board " close associates and supporters " of the Bush administration 's " war on terror . "
The case for dumping Wolfowitz was likely sealed earlier this year when it was revealed that he was deeply involved in getting a pay raise and a new job at the State Department for his girlfriend , Shaha Riza , a career bank staffer .
Wolfowitz is familiar with the world of conservative think tanks and public policy institutes .
In addition to his previous AEI work , he was a paid speaker for the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute .
He was also an original signatory with William Kristol 's Project for the New American Century .
Despite his dismal performance within the administration and his questionable activities at the World Bank , Wolfowitz has been welcomed back into the fold .
And , unlike other Bush administration employees â€ “ such as FEMA 's Michael Brown , who was forced to resign after his incompetent handling of Hurricane Katrina ; or Vice President Dick Cheney 's top aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who will be forever linked with the outing of a CIA operative , a subsequent conviction for perjury and obstructing justice , and a presidential commutation ; or former Interior Deputy Secretary J. Steven Griles , who was convicted , and recently sentenced to jail time , for withholding information from the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005 about his meeting with Republican Party Ã¼ber - lobbyist , now imprisoned , Jack Abramoff â€ “ Wolfowitz is once again in a position to influence public policy .
During the early part of its more than 30 - year existence , the conservative AEI was seen as " a mainstream economic policy and political science think tank . "
A number of respected centrist analysts still at the institute , such as William Schneider and Norman Ornstein , still " embody that old style , " Benjamin Wallace - Wells wrote in a December 2003 piece in the Washington Monthly .
In the early 1980s , AEI was no match for the Heritage Foundation , a younger , Washington - based think tank steeped in hard - core conservative politics .
The Heritage Foundation combined a capacity to raise significant amounts of money from other conservative foundations with a voracious appetite for publicity .
It was able to raise its institutional profile through its unceasing communications with both right - wing and mainstream media sources .
After DeMuth took over the AEI 's reins in 1986 , the organization " put in place an astonishingly successful formula for attracting money and garnering influence , which has matched the increasingly aggressive style of Washington 's conservative community , " Wallace - Wells pointed out .
DeMuth hired the godfather of neoconservatism , Irving Kristol , and the late Jeane Kirkpatrick , who was Ronald Reagan 's foreign policy adviser in his 1980 campaign and who had become the first woman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
From her position as an AEI fellow , Kirkpatrick promoted the policies pushed by the Project for the New American Century , described by RightWeb as " a letterhead group " based in the same office building as AEI and headed by several neoconservative notables , including Irving Kristol 's son William .
Both before and after the 9/11 attacks , PNAC played an aggressive role encouraging the Bush administration to invade Iraq .
Several other Iraq war architects have also been connected to AEI , including Richard Perle , Cheney , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton , and former undersecretary of defense for policy Douglas Feith .
In February 2003 , President Bush delivered a major policy speech to AEI , mapping out his war plan , " thanking them [ AEI ] for their service " and support for the invasion .
It is not , however , a question of that was then and this is now .
AEI 's influence within the administration persists to this day .
According to Think Progress , a project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund , Bush 's escalation plan is largely based on a November 2006 paper by AEI analyst Frederick Kagan , who argued that the U.S. should " reenter [ Iraq ] in large numbers . "
In his interview with the Financial Times , Wolfowitz indicated that he did not think he was through with public service .
" Twenty years ago I was American ambassador to Indonesia , and I have to freely acknowledge , because it is pretty much an open secret , that I fell in love with that country , " he said .
He added that he " would n't mind working on some countries like Indonesia and Turkey that I 've had a long association with . "
Given his miscalculations on Iraq and his sullied performance at the World Bank , another Bush appointment would be a political resurrection for the ages .

With ingredients like bloodroot , shark cartilage and Cat ’s Claw and assertions like “ causes cancer cells to commit suicide , ” it ’s no wonder the Food and Drug Administration is taking notice .
On Tuesday , the agency warned 23 American companies and 2 foreign ones to stop claiming to prevent or cure cancer with their various “ tablets , teas , tonics , black salves , and creams . ”
Here are a few of the claims the agency cited :
— “ Treats all forms of cancer ”
— “ 80 percent more effective than the world ’s number one cancer drug ”
— “ Skin cancers disappear ”
— “ Target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone ”
— “ Shrinks malignant tumors ”
— “ Avoid painful surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , or other conventional treatments ”
All told , 125 products were identified on the agency ’s web site , www.fda.gov.
Legal notices were sent to the companies urging prompt corrective action , which were also posted on the Web .
In the agency ’s letter to Herbs for Cancer , an Arizona company that markets teas for more than a dozen cancers — from bladder and bone to malignant lymphoma — the agency shreds the company ’s claims one by one .
It also scolded that firm and others for deceptively spreading word about their products on the Web :
These claims are supplemented by use of the word “ cancer ” in most of your product names , as well as in the URL address for your website .
Furthermore , the metatags used to bring consumers to your website include “ cancer , ” “ herbs for cancer ” and “ fight - cancer . ”
The site , herbsforcancer.com , has apparently been shut down , for unstated reasons .
In a matter of hours , the F.D.A. ’s warnings have invaded Google search results , providing clear expressions of caution for anyone seeking more information on individual products like “ C - Cell 4 Destroyer ” and subjects like “ herbs for cancer . ”
Indeed , the effort was a strong sign that the agency was moving even more aggressively to counter fraud in the booming market for health advice and treatments on the Web .
“ Although promotions of bogus cancer ‘ cures ’ have always been a problem , ” Margaret Glavin , the agency ’s regulatory chief , said , “ the Internet has provided a mechanism for them to flourish . ”
Just two days ago I switched back to DSL after a brief foray into the world of really slow apartment cable internet , which made it nearly impossible to download the 12.59 GB Age of Conan beta installer .
I finally got the file downloaded yesterday with speedy DSL goodness , just in time for the whole thing to end .
In my desperation , I ran out to GameStop to snag a preorder so I could at least get into the early start of the retail version .

No dice .
Sold out .
Funcom had to cut things off because of the logistics involved with having too many people trying to download a 12.59 GB file all at once .
It might tick some folks off , especially those that preordered the game and did n't get the code , but look at it this way ... you saved $ 5 .
Needless to say , if you have n't preordered your copy of Age of Conan yet , you are n't going to be playing until the game launches in the middle of next week , so you can spend your entire weekend wondering how far those damn early birds are getting in the game while you ... I dunno , log in to World of Warcraft and halfheartedly stab at murlocs .

The Federal Reserve ’s aggressive rate - cutting campaign may be at an end .
In the minutes of the Fed ’s last meeting , released on Wednesday , central bankers sent the strongest signals yet that they planned to hold interest rates steady barring “ a significant weakening ” in the economy .
The hawkish tone cast a cloud over Wall Street , where major stock indexes entered a free fall just after the report ’s release .
The Dow Jones industrials lost more than 220 points , closing at 12,601.19 , and the broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index slid 1.6 percent as investors digested warnings from Fed officials that sky - high prices for food and fuel could cause inflation to spike in coming months .
The comments were made at a meeting in late April .
But their public release capped a week of bleak economic news that underlined the bankers ’ concerns .
A few thoughts : that red phone ad is working .
It 's not that Clinton would make better decisions on national security .
She has scant experience in foreign policy , and is guided primarily by what will be least vulnerable to Republican demagoguery ( it 's the only common thread over the years when you look closely ) .
It 's also going her way because she 's familiar to people - and blue - collar voters in Ohio associate familiarity with security .
( One reason they narrowly backed an untested governor from Texas was his last name . )
The anti-Muslim smears may also have worked , and Clinton delicately managed to keep them alive last night .
And the press has gotten cold feet - caving to the Clintons ' preposterous idea that somehow the field is tilted against them .
Howie Kurtz gets to regurgitate Hannity 's smears as if they were legitimate matters for press inquiry , while the press essentially gives the Clintons a pass on their continued refusal to do the most basic act of transparency : providing their tax returns .
Clinton has also dominated every news cycle in the past week .
And there 's some anecdotal evidence that Republicans are planning to vote for Clinton to kill off the Obama candidacy before it destroys them in the fall .
On the other hand , it 's important to remember that the delegate math is still heavily stacked against Clinton .
She has to win all four states tomorrow by very healthy margins just to stay viable .
Her husband and co-candidate for president , Bill Clinton , has openly said that she has to win both Ohio and Texas for the two of them to stay in the race .
What matters tomorrow night will be delegates .
If Obama maintains or increases his delegate lead , she should withdraw .
But , of course , she will never withdraw of her own volition .
And that 's part of her strategy .
She will gladly hold her party hostage to her own narcissism .
She did it with her husband for much of their last second term .
I get the feeling that if she ekes out a win or two , she will insist on pursuing the full Monty : a scorched earth effort to seat Michigan and Florida delegates ; suing Texas if the delegates do n't go her way ; a full court press on any super - delegates who balk ; and a gut - wrenching struggle for power up to the convention .
If she can not be stopped , she can still be slowed .
If you 're in Ohio , Rhose Island , Vermont and Texas , you know what to do .

WASHINGTON - Last fall , Blackwater Worldwide was in deep peril .
Guards for the security company were involved in a shooting in September that left at least 17 Iraqis dead at a Baghdad intersection .
Outrage over the killings prompted the Iraqi government to demand Blackwater 's ouster from the country , a criminal investigation by the FBI , a series of internal investigations by the State Department and the Pentagon , and high - profile congressional hearings .
But after an intense public and private lobbying campaign , Blackwater appears to be back to business as usual .
The State Department has renewed its contract to provide security for American diplomats in Iraq for at least another year .
Threats by the Iraqi government to strip western contractors of their immunity from Iraqi law have gone nowhere .
No charges have been brought in the United States against any Blackwater guards in the September shooting , either , and the FBI agents in Baghdad charged with investigating whether Blackwater guards committed any crimes under United States law are sometimes protected as they travel through Baghdad by Blackwater guards .
State Department officials said yesterday they did not believe they had any alternative to Blackwater , which supplies about 800 guards to the department to guard diplomats in Baghdad .
Officials say only three companies in the world currently meet their requirements for protective services in Iraq , and the other two do not have the capability to take on Blackwater 's role in Baghdad .
The State Department did not even open talks with the other two firms , DynCorp International and Triple Canopy , to see if they could take over from the North Carolina - based contractor after the shooting in September .
" We cannot operate without private security firms in Iraq , " said Patrick F. Kennedy , the undersecretary of state for management .
" If the contractors were removed , we would have to leave Iraq . "
Still , serious risks remain for Blackwater and at least some of its current and former personnel .
A federal grand jury continues to consider evidence in the Baghdad shooting .
Although the company is not likely to face any criminal charges , people involved in the case say that some Blackwater guards involved in the shooting are cooperating with the FBI as it pursues evidence against other guards .
Separately , a former Blackwater guard is under criminal investigation for the December 2006 shooting death of an Iraqi guard for the vice president of Iraq , and may soon face federal charges .
In a third case , two former Blackwater personnel have pleaded guilty to weapons - related charges , but earlier this year both received sentences that included no jail time in return for their cooperation in a broader investigation .
A House committee has also asked the Internal Revenue Service to launch an inquiry into whether Blackwater has designated its guards as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid paying federal taxes .
The State Department renewed the security contract for one year - just long enough to take the company into the start of the next administration .
And Blackwater 's political connections to the Bush administration may not serve it well if the Democrats take the White House in November .
Given the furor that surrounded Blackwater after September , critics say the decision to renew the company 's contract in Iraq is a sign of the Bush administration 's inability to curb its reliance on outside contractors in the war .

The 10 Most Expensive Doubles Ever : Fans Who Have Paid Bank To Look Like Celebs
Posted on Sep 25 , 2020 @ 9:00 am
Which fan has paid the most money to look like their favorite star ?
BRUSSELS ( AP ) 
The European Union on Thursday agreed to lift its diplomatic sanctions against Cuba , but imposed tough conditions on the communist island to maintain sanction - free relations , officials said .
The U.S. , which has maintained a decades - long trade embargo against Cuba , criticized the move , saying there were no significant signs the communist island was easing a dictatorship .
EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner said the bloc felt it had to encourage changes in Cuba after Raul Castro took over as the head of the country 's government from his ailing brother Fidel .
" There will be very clear language also on what the Cubans still have to do ... releasing prisoners , really working on human rights questions , " she told reporters at an EU summit .
" There will be a sort of review to see whether indeed something will have happened . "
The largely symbolic decision takes effect Monday .
The diplomatic sanctions , which banned high - level visits to EU nations by Cuban officials , have not been in force since 2005 .
They were imposed in 2003 following the arrests of dozens of dissidents but suspended two years later .
As part of its action , the EU approved a set of conditions on Cuba in return for sanction - free relations .
They include the release of all political prisoners ; access for Cubans to the Internet ; and a double - track approach for all EU delegations arriving in Cuba , allowing them to meet both opposition figures and members of the Cuban government .
Officials said the bloc will evaluate Cuba 's progress in a year 's time and could take new measures if human rights do not improve .
The U.S. expressed its opposition before the EU 's final decision .
State Department Deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States would " like to see a real transition occur in Cuba , one that would allow for the release of political prisoners , for democratic opening , and ultimately for free and fair elections in which the Cuban people could choose their own leadership . "
Casey said the U.S. has recently seen " some very minor cosmetic changes " in Cuba .
" We certainly do n't see any kind of fundamental break with the Castro dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions or otherwise fundamentally alter our policies , " he said .
Asked if lifting EU sanctions would weaken U.S. sanctions , Casey said simply , " We 'll see , " but offered no assessment .
Peter De Shazo , Americas Program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said the " decision will not affect the U.S. position toward Cuba " because the policy is largely fixed by legislation with key changes conditioned on a transition to democracy .
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said it was well known that certain circles in the United States wanted the EU sanctions to be maintained , but he said " we felt the need to find our own solution . "
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said the lifting of sanctions in no way means the EU was getting weak on Cuba .
" We have n't softened our approach , " Bildt said .
" It 's a repressive regime .
... Now we are very explicit on what we want .
We want democratic changes . "
He said the EU would push strongly for Cuban authorities to open up their economy , liberate Internet access , and release political prisoners .
The EU sanctions were introduced after Cuba 's government rounded up 75 dissidents in 2003 .

The world 's biggest carbon offset market , the Kyoto Protocol 's clean development mechanism ( CDM ) , is run by the UN , administered by the World Bank , and is intended to reduce emissions by rewarding developing countries that invest in clean technologies .
In fact , evidence is accumulating that it is increasing greenhouse gas emissions behind the guise of promoting sustainable development .
The misguided mechanism is handing out billions of dollars to chemical , coal and oil corporations and the developers of destructive dams - in many cases for projects they would have built anyway .
According to David Victor , a leading carbon trading analyst at Stanford University in the US , as many as two - thirds of the supposed " emission reduction " credits being produced by the CDM from projects in developing countries are not backed by real reductions in pollution .
Those pollution cuts that have been generated by the CDM , he argues , have often been achieved at a stunningly high cost : billions of pounds could have been saved by cutting the emissions through international funds , rather than through the CDM 's supposedly efficient market mechanism .
And when a CDM credit does represent an " emission reduction " , there is no global benefit because offsetting is a " zero sum " game .
If a Chinese mine cuts its methane emissions under the CDM , there will be no global climate benefit because the polluter that buys the offset avoids the obligation to reduce its own emissions .
A CDM credit is known as a certified emission reduction ( CER ) , and is supposed to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide not emitted to the atmosphere .
Industrialised countries ' governments buy the CERs and use them to prove to the UN that they have met their obligations under Kyoto to " reduce " their emissions .
Companies can also buy CERs to comply with national - level legislation or with the EU 's emissions trading scheme .
Analysts estimate that two - thirds of the emission reduction obligations of the key developed countries that ratified Kyoto may be met through buying offsets rather than by decarbonising their economies .
Almost all the demand for CERs has so far come from Europe and Japan .
In the next few years , Australia and Canada could become significant CER buyers .
In the longer term , the US could become the largest single market for CDM offsets under legislation being debated .
The climate plan by Republican presidential hopeful John McCain would allow supposed emission reductions in the US to be met through domestic and CDM offsets .
Around 2bn CERs are expected to be generated by the end of this phase of Kyoto in 2012 .
At their current price , project developers will sell around £ 18 bn - worth of CDM credits over the next five years .
The CDM approved its 1,000th project on April 15 .
More than twice as many are making their way through the approvals process .
Marginal improvement
Any type of technology other than nuclear power can apply for credits .
Even new coal plants , if these can be shown to be even a marginal improvement upon existing plants , can receive offset income .
A massive 4,000 MW coal plant on the coast of Gujarat , India , is expected soon to apply for CERs .
The plant will spew into the atmosphere 26 m tonnes of CO2 per year for at least 25 years .
It will be India 's third - and the world 's 16th - largest source of CO2 emissions .
Many observers had hoped that the CDM would promote renewables and energy efficiency .
Yet if all projects now in the pipeline generated the CERs they are claiming up to 2012 , non - hydro renewables would attract only 16 % of CDM funds , and demand - side energy efficiency projects just 1 % .
Only 16 solar power projects - less than 0.5 % of the project pipeline - have applied for CDM approval .
For a project to be eligible to sell offsets , it is supposed to prove that it is " additional " .
" Additionality " is key to the design of the CDM .
If projects would happen anyway , regardless of CDM benefits , then their offsets would not represent any reduction in emissions .
But judging additionality has turned out to be unknowable and unworkable .
It can never be definitively proved that if a developer or factory owner did not get offset income they would not build their project or switch to a cleaner fuel supply - and would not do so over the decade for which projects can sell offsets .
The documents written by carbon consultants to justify why their clients ' projects should be approved for CDM offsets contain enough lies to make a sub - prime mortgage pusher blush .
One commonly used " scam " is to make a proposed project look like an economic loser on its own , but a profitable earner once offset income is factored in .
Examples include the Indian wind developers who failed to tell the CDM about the lucrative tax credits their projects were earning .
Off - the - record , industry insiders will admit that deceitful claims in CDM applications are standard practice .
The carbon trading industry lobby group , the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) , has stated that proving the intent of developers applying for the CDM " is an almost impossible task " .
Industry representatives have complained that " good storytellers " can get a project approved , " while bad storytellers may fail even if the project is really additional " .
One glaring signal that many of the projects being approved by the CDM 's executive board are non-additional is that almost three - quarters of projects were already complete at the time of approval .
It would seem clear that a project that is already built cannot need extra income in order to be built .
Michael Wara , a law professor and carbon trade analyst from Stanford University , and Victor show in a recent paper that " essentially all " new hydro , wind and natural gas fired projects being built in China are now applying for CDM offsets .
If the developers are being truthful that their projects are additional , this implies that without the CDM virtually no hydro , wind or gas projects would be under construction in China .
Given the boom in construction of power projects in China , the fact that it is government policy to promote these project types , and the fact that thousands of hydro projects have been built in China without any help from the CDM , this is simply not credible .
Additionality also creates perverse incentives for developing country governments not to bring in , or enforce , climate - friendly legislation .
Why should a government voluntarily act to cap methane from its landfills or encourage energy efficiency if in doing so it makes these activities " business - as- usual " , and so not additional and not eligible for CDM income ?
Waste gases
The project type slated to generate the most CERs is the destruction of a gas called trifluoromethane , or HFC - 23 , one of the most potent greenhouse gases , and a waste product from the manufacture of a refrigerant gas .
Every molecule of HFC - 23 causes 11,700 times more global warming than that of CO2 .
Because of this massive " global warming potential " , chemical companies can earn almost twice as much from selling CERs as from selling refrigerant gases .
This has spurred concern that refrigerant producers may be increasing their output solely so that they can produce , and then destroy , more waste gases .
A rapidly growing industry of carbon brokers and consultants is lobbying for the CDM to be expanded and its rules to be weakened further .
If we want to sustain public support for effective global action on climate change , we cannot risk one of its central planks being a programme that is so fundamentally flawed .
In the short term , the CDM must be radically reformed .
In the long term it must be replaced .

Many people let others know on Twitter what they 're listening to as they work through their day , but what if you could also include the actual MP3 for people to join in and listen along ?
This is the idea behind Blip , a new service from Fuzz .
that allows you to microblog ala Twitter , but with the added feature of using an MP3 search to embed the song you are currently listening to into the post so that others can check it out .
Unlike SeeqPod , which has run afoul of legal questions , Blip is " legal and it's covered by the DMCA , " according to Fuzz CEO , Jeff Yasuda .
One of the most amazing things about Blip is they have done something that everyone has cried out for Twitter to do : a self - refreshing feed page !
What a novel concept !
It 's true , the page updates itself without hitting refresh ... it 's obviously demonic magic .
We sat down with Gavin Hayes , lead singer of Dredg , to get his thoughts on what Blip brings to the music industry , as well as what he , as a musician , would like to see change in the dynamics of the industry .
I have to say I was quite intrigued by his thoughts on pre-sales of albums , and how that might be a way to bring the artist and fans closer together .

The devastating personal impact of denying people the right to vote because they can't get hard - to - get photo ID and birth certificates is best illustrated by a heart - breaking story I reported earlier in the week .
I spoke to 97 - year - old Shirley Preiss about her efforts to vote in Arizona after having voted for every Democratic Presidential candidate since FDR in 1932 .
I quote an ACORN organizer about the use of immigrant - bashing as a lever to block American citizens from voting , then I went on to tell Shirley 's story .
It bears repeating , because what happened to Shirley could happen to every poor person , disabled person , elderly person and minority who does n't have the ready access to the funds , time and ability to navigate bureaucratic hurdles to obtain government - issued embossed birth certificates and other ID :
Perhaps no one knows that as well as 97 - year - old Shirley Freeda Preiss .
She was born at home in Clinton , Kentucky in 1910 , before women had the right to vote , and never had a birth certificate .
Shirley has voted in every presidential election since FDR first ran in 1932 , and proudly describes herself as a " died - in - the - wool Democrat . "
After living in Arizona for two years , she was eagerly looking forward to casting her ballot in the February primary for the first major woman candidate for President , Hillary Clinton .
But lacking a birth certificate or even elementary school records to prove she 's a native - born American citizen , the state of Arizona 's bureaucrats determined that this former school - teacher who taught generations of Americans should n't be allowed to vote .
" I have a constitutional right to vote , do n't I ? " she asks with her soft Southern drawl .
" I did n't get to vote because of a birth certificate .
What am I going to do now ? "
Her strong - willed 78 - year - old son , Nathan " Joey " Nemnich , a World War II veteran , is infuriated .
" I 'm pissed .
She 's an American citizen who worked her whole life and I want her to vote , " he says .
He went down to the local Motor Vehicle Division to get her an Arizona ID and register her to vote , armed with copies of his mother 's three drivers ' licenses from her previous home in Texas , along with copies of her Social Security and Medicare cards .
All that was n't good enough for the state of Arizona .
" The sons of bitches are taking away our Constitution , " Nemnich says .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sexual reproduction may be nearly as old as animal life itself , according to researchers who discovered a new species of organism that lived 540 million years ago .
The tube - like creatures called Funisia dorothea anchored themselves in abundant flocks onto the shallow , sandy seabed of what is now the Australian outback .
Nothing appears to have evolved yet to eat them , so they lived peaceful lives , reproducing sexually at times and by asexual methods such as budding at other times , Mary Droser of the University of California Riverside and colleagues reported in the journal Science .
They behaved very much like modern corals , sponges and other multicellular animals , Droser said in a telephone interview .
“ They would have been hitting you mid-calf as you walked in these very dense clusters , ” she said .
“ Almost always , organisms that do this do it as a result of sexual reproduction . ”
Dense clusters allow eggs and sperm floated in the water to meet up safely .
The fossilized remains also show the creatures formed buds that grew into full - sized animals , something that coral and sponges do today .
“ They were complicated enough to have different modes of reproduction and a fairly complex ecosystem in general , ” Droser said .
They lived in dense groups of similar size and aged animals , like mussels and oysters do .
“ It is common modern ecological strategy , and these guys were doing it in the earliest animal ecosystems on this planet , ” she said .
“ We think of these strategies as having been in response to competition and in response to predation . ”
But there is no evidence of predators .
Nothing had yet evolved with teeth or even bones .
Multicellular animal life is believed to have arisen around 600 million years ago .
Funisia dorothea ’s name comes from the word for rope in Latin and dorothea after Dorothy , Droser ’s mother .
“ She ’s come with me on digs and done all the cooking and taken care of the kids , ” Droser said .
“ It seemed the right thing to do . ”
Other than taking obvious influences from the Tumbler from Batman Begins , this Israeli Guardium unmanned patrol shares more in common with the iRobot PackBot than Batman 's roof - hopping car .
The Guardium can either be self - controlled or steered by an operator miles away , and is loaded with cameras , night - vision sensors and machine guns .
Unlike the PackBot , which demands that a human be in the loop at all times , the Guardium can be autonomous if the need arises .
Let 's just hope its programming is really , really good and it does n't go off killing because it thought it saw a ghost .

From the Associated Press on May 1 , 2008 :
“ OMG Im scard , ” Lauren said in a text message to her mother , Margo Roby , 53 , who was working at a car dealership about 15 minutes away .
“ I think were being robd Im hiding help me ! ”
Roby called 911 and raced home from work , ramming her vehicle into the back of the suspects ’ car parked in the driveway , authorities said .
Rowr .
She got there faster than the cops , too :
One of the suspects , Jenna Marie Burns , came out of the house and Roby wrestled with her just as sheriff ’s deputies and the police chief arrived , said Fairfield County Sheriff Dave Phalen .
some background :
As two intruders began ransacking her house , a teenager home alone climbed into bed , hid under the covers and text messaged her mother , who called 911 .
The thieves , who were both arrested , even sat on the girl ’s bed at one point , unaware she was home .
Lauren Durnbaugh , 13 , was home sick from school Tuesday when she heard someone open a rear door her mother forgot to lock .
She hid as the suspects went from room to room .
The CIA launched a secret program in 2005 designed to degrade Iran ’s nuclear weapons program by persuading key officials to defect , an effort that has prompted a “ handful ” of significant departures , current and former U.S. intelligence officials familiar with the operation say .
The previously undisclosed program , which CIA officials dubbed “ the Brain Drain , ” is part of a major intelligence push against Iran ordered by the White House two years ago .
Intelligence gathered as part of that campaign provided much of the basis for a U.S. report released last week that concluded the Islamic Republic had halted its nuclear weapons work in 2003 .
Officials declined to say how much of that intelligence could be attributed to the CIA program to recruit defectors .
Although the CIA effort on defections has been aimed in part at gaining information about Tehran ’s nuclear capabilities , its goal has been to undermine Iran ’s emerging capabilities by plucking key scientists , military officers and other personnel from its nuclear roster .

Encouraging scientists and military officers to defect has been a hallmark of CIA efforts against an array of targets since the height of the Cold War .
But officials said those programs did not generally seek to degrade the target ’s capabilities , suggesting that U.S. officials believe Iran ’s nuclear know - how is still thin enough that it can be depleted .
The program has had limited success .
Officials said that fewer than six well - placed Iranians have defected , and that none has been in a position to provide comprehensive information on Tehran ’s nuclear program .
The CIA effort reflects the urgency with which the U.S. government has sought to slow down Iran ’s nuclear advances , as well as the importance Washington attaches to finding human sources who can help fill intelligence gaps left by high - tech collection methods such as satellites and electronic eavesdropping equipment .
The program was described by officials on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the effort .
The White House ordered the stepped - up effort in hopes of gathering stronger evidence that Tehran was making progress toward building a nuclear bomb .
The Bush administration “ wanted better information ” on Iran ’s nuclear programs , said a U.S. official briefed on the expanded collection efforts .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t imagine that they would have ever guessed that the information they got would show that the program was shut down , ” the official said .
That was the central finding of the comprehensive intelligence report released last week .
The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran contradicted previous intelligence assessments and undercut assertions by the Bush administration .
The new report , which represents the consensus view of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , also concluded that Tehran “ at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons ” and continuing to pursue civilian nuclear energy technologies that could help it make a bomb .
A CIA spokesman declined to comment on the effort to cultivate defectors , saying “ the agency does not comment on these kinds of allegations as a matter of course . ”

White House reversal
The administration ’s decision to step up intelligence collection on Iran in 2005 was a reversal from a position the White House took after President Bush was first elected .
Former CIA officials said that the agency had built up a large Iran Task Force , made up of nearly 100 officers and analysts at headquarters , by the end of the Clinton administration .
But that office shrank to fewer than a dozen officers early in the Bush administration , when the White House ordered resources shifted to other targets .
“ When Bush came in , they were totally disinterested in Iran , ” said a former CIA official who held a senior position at the time .
“ It went from being a main focus to everything being switched to Iraq . ”
Asked about decisions to reduce the size of the Iran Task Force , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said : “ Iran has been an issue of priority to the United States for a long time .
You should n’t assume that a single unit of any size reflects the complete level of effort .
That would be a mistake . ”
Advertisement
Even as the task force shrank , officials said , other CIA units , including its counter - proliferation division , continued to track Iran ’s procurement networks and other targets .
Some of that reduced task force capacity has been restored , former CIA officials said .
Two years ago , the agency created an Iran division within its overseas spying operations , applying to a single country resources and emphasis usually reserved for multinational regions .
The stepped - up effort went beyond the CIA , and has also involved the National Security Agency , which eavesdrops on other countries ’ communications , and the National Reconnaissance Office , which operates spy satellites .
The defector program was put in place under CIA Director Porter J. Goss , who has since left .
The agency compiled a list of dozens of people to target as potential defectors based on a single criterion , according to a former official involved in the operation : “ Who , if removed from the program , would have the biggest impact on slowing or stopping their progress ? ”

The rewards for defectors can be substantial , including relocation to another country and lifetime financial support .
In the two years since it was launched , the program has led to carefully orchestrated extractions of a small group of Iranian officials who operated in the mid- to upper tiers of the Islamic Republic ’s nuclear programs .
None of those who defected was considered essential to the nuclear program , nor were they able to provide comprehensive descriptions of Iran ’s efforts , officials said .
“ Did they have replacements for these people ?
Any country would have , ” the former official involved in the operation said .
“ But we did slow the program . ”
Advertisement
The identities of the defectors have been carefully protected .
However , there was speculation this year of CIA involvement in the apparent defection of a former Iranian deputy defense minister , Ali Reza Asgari , who went missing in February during a visit to Turkey .
At the time , Iran ’s top police chief was quoted in the official news agency as saying that Asgari probably had been kidnapped by operatives working for Western intelligence services .
Asgari was believed to have extensive knowledge of Iran ’s conventional weapons program as well as its ties to the militant Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah in Lebanon .
But Asgari was not thought to be involved in Iran ’s nuclear program , and the CIA , when pressed by congressional officials about the matter , adamantly denied involvement in the Iranian general ’s disappearance .
Officials declined to discuss the whereabouts of the defectors , or details regarding the methods used to approach them .
The former senior U.S. intelligence official said that potential defectors had not been approached directly by the CIA , but through other contacts the agency has cultivated inside the country .
Advertisement
Often , the former official said , there are as many as “ three degrees of separation ” between agency personnel and those targeted for approach , and that each of those interim contacts had to be thoroughly vetted before a planned approach was approved .
Those who have left Iran have been debriefed and relocated either by the CIA or with the help of allied intelligence services , the former official said .
The CIA program was implemented after significant debate between the White House and the agency over its size and scope , officials said .
National Security Council officials urged the CIA to make the program as broad as possible , and to spread word through Iranian networks that the United States was prepared to help officials leave the country and relocate .
But CIA officials fought to keep the program narrowly targeted to avoid catching the attention of Iran ’s intelligence service .
Even at that , CIA officials assumed that Iran ’s service was keeping close watch on key officials in the nuclear program , and that potential defectors could be decoys .
The “ Brain Drain ” program is among the latest in a long series of efforts to shore up U.S. intelligence on Iran .
It was launched at a time when a presidential commission was preparing a scathing report on the inadequacies of U.S. intelligence on Iran and other nations suspected of having nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
Advertisement
U.S. intelligence officials said the information that surfaced this summer prompting the reevaluation of Tehran ’s nuclear weapons program centered on intercepts of Iranian government officials ’ conversations and the seizure of a journal that contained notes documenting the country ’s decision to shut down its weapons research .
During a briefing with reporters last week , a senior U.S. intelligence official said that Iran was “ the hardest intelligence target there is . ”
“ I mean , by comparison , North Korea is an open and transparent society , ” the official said .
History of setbacks
Advertisement
U.S. intelligence on Iran has been beset by setbacks stretching back more than two decades .
The CIA has had no permanent presence in the country since the United States broke diplomatic ties with the country -- and removed embassy personnel , as well as CIA officials who operated under diplomatic cover -- after the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Afterward , the agency began recruiting sources in Europe and elsewhere , in cities where there are large populations of Iranian expatriates who travel to and from the country .
But the effort has been marked by failures .
In 1989 , Iran ’s intelligence services broke up a network of agents in the country that was being directed by a CIA station in Germany known as “ Tefran , ” for Tehran - Frankfurt .
When that station was shut down , much of the collection work was shifted to Los Angeles , where there is a large population of Iranian immigrants , many of whom visit their home country .

This huge tangle of wires and metal is the kind of machine scientists have been dreaming of for generations : one that will take them back 13 billion years to the dawn of time and the Big Bang .
Known as the Atlas detector , it sits in the world 's largest particle physics laboratory , where physicists plan to recreate the conditions that existed after the cataclysmic cosmic event they believe made our universe .
Atlas is about 150ft long , more than 75 ft high and weighs about 7,000 tons .
Scroll down for more ...
Awe - inspiring : Atlas is about 150ft long , more than 75 ft high and weighs about 7,000 tons
It is about half as big as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and weighs the same as the Eiffel Tower .
It 's just part of a facility known as the Large Hadron Collider , which is a huge circular tube buried 300ft under the Swiss / French border in a tunnel 16.7 miles long - that 's longer than London Underground 's Circle line .
The scientists involved in the project - 1,800 of them from 160 universities in 34 countries - plan to fire two beams of protons ( fragments of an atom ) in opposite directions around the tunnel and make them collide head - on at nearly the speed of light .
The Atlas detector - really a giant ultra-sensitive camera - will be positioned at the point of impact to record what happens .
It is hoped the data collected will help scientists understand the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces that shaped our universe . . . and could eventually determine its fate .
Bacteria lurking in soil in the 1960s and 70s resist an antibiotic that did n’t exist until decades later .
Three strains of what amount to future - predicting bacteria showed extreme resistance to six common antibiotics , including ciprofloxacin , which was first sold in 1989 .
“ You can pretty safely say that there is no way these bacteria have seen them before , ” says Cristiane San Miguel , a microbiologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey , US .
She presented the findings this week at the American Society for Microbiology ‘s annual meeting in Boston , US .
One strain of soil bacteria was even able to fend off a dose of ciprofloxacin that would be lethal to humans .
Dirt seems to be a rich source of antibiotic - resistant bacteria , which probably developed such defences as part of the evolutionary arms race that has been going on for billions of years between soil - dwelling microbes .

Many antibiotics drugs come from naturally occurring molecules produced by soil bacteria and fungi , though some drugs , such as Cipro ( the brand name of ciprofloxacin ) , have been developed in the lab .
Bacteria to the future
To determine whether resistance to new drugs can be found in soil , San Miguel and her colleague Robert Tate turned to a company that stocks thousands of strains of frozen bacteria .
Her team revived three strains : two of them opportunistic pathogens called Klebsiella pneuomoniae that were isolated from dirt in 1973 and 1974 , then frozen ; the third , a bug called Alcaligenes , last tasted agar in 1963 .
All the strains flourished when San Miguel exposed them to a range of antibiotics , many still used to battle infections .
Perplexingly , all the bacteria fended off a lethal dose of rifampicin , an antibiotic introduced in 1967 , and Cipro , a 19 - year - old drug that resembles nothing seen in nature .
“ I was certainly expecting the Cipro to have an impact and it did not , ” she says .
Ancient genes
Next San Miguel plans to determine the genes responsible for the resistance .
Gerry Wright , a microbiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada , says soil bacteria are probably a trove of antibiotic resistance that finds its way to human pathogens .
“ The origins of many of the antibiotic resistance genes that are floating around in the clinic are out in the environment and have probably been out there for thousands and millions of years , ” he says .
Bacteria need n’t be exposed to a specific antibiotic to develop resistance , and he suggests that natural variation or prior exposure to undiscovered Cipro - like molecules could explain the bacteria ’s retroactive resistance .

BEIRUT , Lebanon ( CNN ) -- A Hezbollah commander suspected in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the last 25 years and a reputed role model for Osama bin Laden has been killed in Syria , Hezbollah TV said Wednesday .
Hezbollah released this undated photograph of Imad Mughniyeh .
Imad Mughniyeh died in an explosion in a residential section of the Syrian capital , Damascus , said Hezbollah 's television station , Al - Manar .
Hezbollah blamed Israel for the killing , but Israeli officials denied involvement .
" Israel rejects the attempt by terrorist elements to ascribe to it any involvement whatsoever in this incident , " Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in a statement .
The FBI said it was awaiting official confirmation of Mughniyeh 's death and the details .
" If this information proves true , it would be good news in the ongoing fight against terrorism as one major terrorist will no longer be around to commit additional acts of terror against Americans and others in the world , " FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko said .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called Mughniyeh " a cold - blooded killer , a mass murderer and a terrorist who was responsible for [ ending ] countless lives . "
Watch the possible repercussions of Mughniyeh 's death »
" The world is a better place " without the Hezbollah commander , McCormack said .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement : " We welcome the news that Imad Mughniyeh 's life of terror has finally come to an end .
From Beirut to Dhahran , he orchestrated bombings , kidnappings and hijackings in which hundreds of American service members were killed .
Hopefully , his demise will bring some measure of comfort to the families of all those military men he murdered . "
Intelligence sources described Mughniyeh as one of the craftiest and deadliest terrorists in the world who managed to elude capture for decades by changing his appearance and covering his footsteps .
Western intelligence agencies long suspected Mughniyeh in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon , that killed 63 people .
He also is suspected in the truck bombing that year of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut , an attack that killed 241 people and preceded the U.S. military withdrawal from Lebanon .
Before the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , U.S. officials blamed Mughniyeh for the deaths of more Americans around the world than any other terror suspect , CNN reported in 2001 .
A month after the attacks in the United States , the FBI debuted its Most Wanted Terrorists list with Mughniyeh on it .
Mughniyeh was not suspected of involvement in 9/11 , but he was a role model for bin Laden , who used the 1983 Marine barracks bombing as a standard , CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said .
" Because if you think about the attack , pretty much immediately afterwards President Reagan ordered the United States out of Lebanon , and so that 's the model bin Laden wanted to implement everywhere , attack the United States in places like Yemen or in Kenya , or in Tanzania , or even the United States itself and it will pull out of the Middle East . "
Mughniyeh had been involved in training both terrorists in Iraq and some of the Shiite militia there , including elements of Moqtada al Sadr 's army , two U.S. intelligence officials told CNN .
The officials were not authorized to speak for attribution .
Mughniyeh also had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers just prior to the outbreak of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon , one of the officials said , and was involved in planning Hezbollah 's military operations during that conflict .
Mughniyeh was involved in providing 50 tons of weapons to Palestinian terrorists in 2002 , that official said .
Authorities blame Mughniyeh for the June 14 , 1985 , hijacking of TWA Flight 847 , which gripped the attention of TV viewers around the world for more than two weeks .
Hijackers seized the plane as it traveled from Athens , Greece , to Rome , Italy , forcing it to land at the Beirut airport .
U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem was shot and killed during the 17 - day ordeal .
Kurt Carlson , a TWA 847 passenger who was badly beaten , recalled that Mughniyeh " looked like really a fanatic . "
" As he talked about Israel , the tone of his voice kept rising , until finally he was just screaming and his eyes were glassy , and we did n't know what he was going to do , " Carlson said .
" I mean , I thought he was just going to pull out a gun and start shooting . "
Flight 847 may have been the one careless move that the man in the shadows made .
Mughniyeh reportedly left a fingerprint on the plane , gaining him a place on the FBI 's most wanted terrorist list with a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
Western intelligence agencies also suspect Mughniyeh in the early '90s bombings of the Israeli Embassy and a Jewish cultural center in Argentina that killed 119 people ; and the kidnapping of Western hostages -- two of whom were killed -- in Lebanon in the 1980s .
Israel had come close to finding Mughniyeh before and killing him , said Yossi Melman , an intelligence reporter for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz .
In 1992 , intelligence agents tracked him and his brother to a Beirut garage .
" They shadowed his brother and planted the bomb in the garage , knowing that Imad Mughniyeh would arrive there , but he was late and the bomb exploded and the brother was killed .
Probably they missed him by a few minutes , " Melman said .
A former head of Israel 's intelligence agency said Mughniyeh 's unseen hand apparently struck the first blow in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah , a militant group based in Lebanon that seeks to establish a fundamentalist Muslim state .
Former Mossad chief Danny Yaton said Mughniyeh appeared to be responsible for the attack that killed eight Israeli soldiers and the abduction of two others , triggering Israel Defense Forces operations in Lebanon .
U.S. authorities tried to seize Mughniyeh on at least two occasions -- in France in 1986 and in Saudi Arabia in 1995 , CNN reported .
Former CIA officer Robert Baer said Mughniyeh was " head and shoulders above any other terrorist in the world . "
Mughniyeh reportedly destroyed all records and documents describing his past .
He was believed to have been born in 1962 , growing up in the Shiite neighborhoods of Beirut .
Palestinian militants recruited him as a teenager , and he eventually was in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's elite guard .
The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon apparently further inflamed Mughniyeh 's hatred for the Jewish state .

BlackBerry vs. iPhone
1 : Wherein Neither ‘ RIM ’ Nor ‘ BlackBerry ’ Are Even Mentioned , but Rather the Stage Is Set for Showing Why They Might Be Seriously Screwed
Along the lines of can ’t - really - be- answered - but - gosh - they ’re - fun - to - ponder questions like , say , “ Who ’d win in a fight , Batman or Spider - Man ? ” or “ Star Destroyer vs. U.S.S. Enterprise ? ” , 1 here ’s one regarding the iPhone :
What historical Mac is a current iPhone most analogous to , spec-wise ?
I.e , complete this sentence : “ An iPhone is like having a tiny ____ in your pocket ? ”
Now of course the comparison ca n’t be precise .
Different software , different use cases , different purposes .
But there ’s no denying that an iPhone is a computer .
And unless you ’re really young , it ’s faster — a lot faster — than the computers you owned not so long ago .
So , seriously , stop here for a moment and think about it .
My first answer , pulled simply from recollection of how fast machines felt to use , was the original iMac .
But that machine — announced 10 years ago this week — had a 233 MHz G3 and , by default , a paltry 32 MB of RAM .
Apple has never officially released the CPU specs of the iPhone , but Craig Hockenberry poked around with undocumented system APIs which indicated the iPhone ’s CPU runs at 400 MHz with a bus speed of 100 MHz , and that there ’s 128 MB of RAM .
As we all recall from the PowerPC era , MHz is not a precise metric for comparing the performance of CPUs across different architectures ; I would n’t be surprised in the least to find out that a 400 MHz PowerPC G3 is a faster chip than the 400 MHz ARMwhatever that ’s in the iPhone , if only because of the power constraints .
But , still , it ’s something .
So , my answer to the question : the original “ Pismo ” G3 PowerBook .
The numbers match up pretty closely : 400 MHz CPU , 100 MHz bus speed , 64 MB of RAM .
( The higher - end Pismo had a 500 MHz CPU and 128 MB of RAM . )
Even storage sizes are similar : hard drive options for the Pismo were 6 , 12 , or 18 GB .
Another possible answer : the original blue - and - white Power Mac G3 — again , 400 MHz CPU , 100 MHz bus speed , 64 - 128 MB of RAM , and 6 - 12 GB hard drives .
Think about that — in just nine years , the specs that then described Apple ’s top - of - the - line desktop computer now describe their phone .
One thing that makes this comparison hard is that there ’s not much software in common .
You ca n’t use most of the real - world tasks commonly used for ballpark benchmarking , like , say , Photoshop image processing or ripping MP3s from AIFFs , because the iPhone does n’t do them .
But there is one processor intensive task we can compare : web page rendering .
In the early days of the web , it took a while for even moderately large web pages to render in a browser , even when you were loading them from HTML files right on your hard drive .
If you were to plop yourself down in front of one of these vintage 1999 - 2000 Macs for an afternoon of web browsing , even with a decent Ethernet connection to the Internet you ’d find the experience pretty damn slow by current standards .
For all the incessant chatter about the demand for and purported certainty of 3G wireless networking in the next generation of iPhone hardware , the truth is that current iPhones are held back , web - surfing - wise , by more than just the speed of EDGE ( which admittedly , is indeed pretty slow ) .
Recall this video pitting a 3G Nokia E61i against an iPhone on EDGE — total rendering time was more or less the same , and in a few cases , the iPhone came out ahead .
You can see that browsing speed — which is what matters — depends on more than just networking speed simply by comparing how long it takes to render a web page on the iPhone using Wi -Fi : a lot longer than it takes to load the same page using Safari on a Mac .
For example , it takes about two or three seconds for Safari to load the Daring Fireball home page on my new MacBook Pro .
Using the same Wi -Fi network , it takes my iPhone about 15 seconds .
( Using EDGE , it takes about 60 seconds to completely load , although you can start reading much sooner than that . )
Point being that even if 3G wireless networking were as fast as Wi-Fi — which it ’s not — browsing on an iPhone would still be pretty slow compared to browsing on a modern desktop or laptop .
If you frequently use Wi-Fi on your iPhone , a faster processor in the next - generation hardware would make a bigger difference to the overall experience than faster phone - carrier networking .
And so here ’s the point I ’m driving at .
If a 2007 iPhone is loosely equivalent in terms of computing power to a 2000 PowerBook or 1999 Power Mac , that puts the spread at around seven or eight years .
Extrapolate forward , and it ’s therefore not at all unreasonable to think that a 2014 iPhone will pack the computing power of today ’s MacBook Pro .
Or , nearer term , that an iPhone introduced two years from now might pack the punch of a 2003 Aluminum PowerBook G4 — quite a difference from the Pismo .
Even if your estimate of the iPhone ’s equivalent - horsepower Mac is further back in time than mine , there ’s no denying that Moore ’s Law applies to handhelds , too .
Eventually there will be a computer that fits in your pocket that is more powerful than today ’s Mac Pros .
But the path from here to there is riddled with difficult engineering problems — heat dissipation , battery life , and OS integration chief among them .
There is marketing .
There most certainly is design .
But at the core of this market — by which I mean the market for handheld multitasking web - surfing networked - everywhere “ phones ” which are really computers — is engineering .
Apple is the best handheld computer engineering company in the world today , hands down .
They ’re also the best handheld computer user experience design company .
And they ’re not sharing .
2 : Why RIM Is Screwed
When the iPhone was announced , I saw Apple as staking out ground far afield from the territory RIM occupies with the BlackBerry .
Last year , I did n’t see Apple implementing Exchange support in the iPhone OS , and clearly that was , well , completely wrong .
The “ enterprise ” features Apple has announced for the imminent 2.0 release of the iPhone OS — remote wipe , push email , automatic calendar and contact synching — pretty much encompass every single feature that ’s been held up as a reason the iPhone would n’t sell to enterprise users .
It remains to be seen how well these new iPhone features will actually work , but if the answer is “ as well as promised ” , and if the iPhone ’s Mail app is improved in ways targeting people who receive a high number of messages , it ’s hard to see a single software advantage in the BlackBerry ’s favor .
Which leaves hardware , which leaves the keyboard .
Two Sundays ago , the New York Times ran a lengthy business - section piece by Brad Stone , titled “ BlackBerry ’s Quest : Fend Off the iPhone ” .
Regarding the upcoming BlackBerry 9000 , the focus turned to the keyboard :
Photographs of the device , leaked to gadget news sites , also indicate that the new BlackBerry will have elegant curves suggestive of the iPhone .
It will also have a physical keyboard like previous R.I.M. devices , as opposed to the glass touch screen found on the iPhone .
There ’s a reason that R.I.M. is averse to the iPhone ’s glass pad .
“ I could n’t type on it and I still ca n’t type on it , and a lot of my friends ca n’t type on it , ” says Mike Lazaridis , R.I.M. ’s co-chief executive and technological visionary .
“ It ’s hard to type on a piece of glass . ” Mr. Lazaridis thinks that e-mail - dependent BlackBerry owners demand the reliability and tactile feedback of a keyboard .
But , despite his critique of the iPhone , he does not dismiss the possibility that R.I.M. may itself one day sell a touch - screen phone , aimed specifically at consumers without the e-mail demands of BlackBerry ’s core users .
Translation : “ We ’ll emphasize the physical keyboard as a differentiating factor as long as it seems to work , at which point we ’ll try a touch - screen keyboard too . ”
The only other angle RIM seems to be hanging its hat on is “ security ” :
RIM is also betting on security , which hinges on the fact that its handsets and e-mail systems are relatively impervious to hackers .
Mr. Lazaridis predicts that corporations will not give iPhones to their workers because they have already proved vulnerable to hackers eager to pry iPhones off AT&T ’s system and make them work on other wireless networks .
“ It ’s not that simple for an I.T. manager to give up security , ” he said .
The idea that iPhone carrier unlocking is a “ security problem ” is a conflation between what an attacker can do to your phone , against your will and / or unbeknownst to you , versus what a phone ’s owner can do to their own phone .
It ’s not like these “ hackers ” are attacking happy AT&T - subscribed iPhone owners and switching them over to T - Mobile against their will .
To understand why Apple is making a concerted effort to appeal to BlackBerry users , consider an analogy to the board game Risk .
RIM has a large army ( read : users ) , but they ’re all massed together in one spot on the map .
They care about email , they care about exactly the sort of enterprise features Apple has announced for the iPhone , and they are known to be willing to pay several hundred dollars for a handset .
A lucrative target that can be attacked all at once .
And the BlackBerry is weakest where the iPhone is strongest : web browsing , music , and video .
Compare and contrast with , say , a software platform like Windows Mobile , or a hardware maker like Nokia — their users are spread across a wide variety of phones and platforms .
It was far easier to turn the iPhone into something almost every BlackBerry customer might at least consider than it would have been to make a lineup of iPhones that appeal to every Nokia customer .
RIM does n’t really have any lock - in other than user habits .
The BlackBerry gimmick is that it works with the email system your company bought from Microsoft .
Replace a BlackBerry with an iPhone ( 2.0 ) and the messages , contacts , and calendar events that sync over the network will be the same as the ones on the BlackBerry you just tossed into a desk drawer .
In broad terms , BlackBerrys are optimized first for email ; the iPhone for the web .
What ’s more important , an email client or a web browser ?
For most people , and perhaps even most current BlackBerry users , the answer is clearly the web .
Many people in fact read their email entirely through the web .
Unless you ’re Richard Stallman , you probably do n’t read the web through your email client .
The iPhone would be a credible , useful device with just two apps : Phone and Safari .
But it does n’t just have those two apps .
It has a slew , and they ’re all better on the iPhone than the BlackBerry and the difference with regard to anything other than email is only going to get more stark once the iTunes App Store opens its doors .
If nothing else , consider games , games , and games .
As I wrote when the iPhone ’s upcoming enterprise features were announced , the iPhone can do more BlackBerry - ish things than the BlackBerry can do iPhone - ish things .
Apple does n’t wait for someone else to knock one of their hit products off its throne or slowly run it into the ground ( cf. the Motorola Razr ) — they do it themselves .
For six years pundits have been declaring that competitors would “ soon ” catch up to the iPod , but the iPod has never been a static target — over the same six years Apple has released significant new iPods every year .
There are no signs that RIM has the engineering chops on either side of the ball — hardware or software — to compete with where the iPhone is now , let alone where it ’s going to be .
We know that Apple has an OS that can scale to take advantage of faster ( and multi- core ) processors , because OS X is doing that already .
If a two - years - away 2010 iPhone might be like having a 2003 PowerBook G4 in your pocket , for RIM ’s sake a 2010 BlackBerry had better be something more than a BlackBerry with a brighter screen .
