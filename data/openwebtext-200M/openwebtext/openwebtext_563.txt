LONDON  Early this month , Gibson Square publishers here announced that it would publish “ The Jewel of Medina , ” a novel about the early life of A’isha , one of the wives of the Prophet Muhammad .
It was a bold decision : the book ’s United States publisher , Ballantine Books , an imprint of Random House , had canceled its publication in August amid fears that it would offend and inflame Muslim extremists .
( It has since been bought by another American publisher , Beaufort Books . )
For his part , Martin Rynja , Gibson Square ’s publisher , said that it was “ imperative ” that the book be published .
“ In an open society there has to be open access to literary works , regardless of fear , ” he said .
“ As an independent publishing company , we feel strongly that we should not be afraid of the consequences of debate . ”
Early Saturday morning , Mr. Rynja ’s house in North London , which doubles as Gibson Square ’s headquarters , was set on fire .
Three men were arrested on suspicion “ of the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism , ” the police said .
No one was injured in the arson , in which a small fire bomb was apparently pushed through the house ’s mail slot .
The police were already on the scene as the result of what they described as “ a preplanned intelligence - led operation , ” and , helped by firefighters , broke down the door and put out the fire .

Can Gen David Petraeus make an impact in Afghanistan ?
The Taleban is planning for a 20 - year war in Afghanistan - and the US and its allies are now having to develop policies to match .
The problem is that the policies carried out up till now - a combination of military operations and civilian development in the hope that in due course the Afghan government will be strong enough on its own - have led to a deteriorating security situation .
The issue beyond that though is whether the strategy is right .
The former European Union envoy to Afghanistan Francesc Vedrell thinks not .
He told the BBC that the current strategy would not bring success and that President Bush 's administration was misleading itself on the issue .
He said that many mistakes had been made .
In the meantime , reinforcements are now needed and a gradual shake - up in security planning is underway .
The new head of US Central Command , which oversees military operations across the Middle East and Afghanistan , is to be David Petraeus , the general who is credited with turning the war in Iraq around .
Can a " mini surge " work in Afghanistan ?
President Bush is announcing that a drawdown of troops from Iraq will enable the US to send an extra combat brigade to Afghanistan early next year .
Presidential candidates , the successful one of which will face difficult decisions in the years ahead if the war continues to be hard , are weighing in .
Senator John McCain is promising three extra brigades , Senator Barack Obama two .
The US is sending a senior counterinsurgency expert , Gen John Nicholson , to the south to invigorate operations there .
It is interesting to note that one of his forebears was a British brigadier who raised the siege of Delhi in 1857 - with a deserved reputation for great brutality that the current Nicholson will want to avoid .
Gen Nicholson 's mission might herald a greater role for the US military in the south .
There is also to be streamlining of the command arrangements between the Nato - led Isaf forces and the separate US forces operating under the banner of " Enduring Freedom " .
Military tactics are also under question , especially the widespread use of air power , which is needed to make up for the lack of troops on the ground .
This has led to numerous disasters among the civilian population .
Few Western diplomats have any faith that the Pakistani army is in a position to stop the Taleban crossing the border .
Some military figures believe that Pakistani elements still favour the Taleban and there is now a lowered expectation that , at best , Pakistan can play a role in targeting individuals .
Taleban resilient
The basic situation is that the Taleban itself is proving to be resilient .
A journalist held by the Taleban recently said he had been told by a senior commander that , unlike the 1990s , the Taleban now knew it could not win the war in a few months , or indeed a few years .
Command of US troops will be streamlined with the Nato - led Isaf
It was expecting to take 20 years to evict the foreign forces .
The renewed concentration on Afghanistan comes at a time of political weakness in the Afghan government .
President Hamid Karzai is seen by Western leaders as well - meaning but weak .
Efforts are underway to encourage him to assert himself .
And not all Nato allies seem to have the stomach for the fight .
Nato planners in Afghanistan now assume that the Dutch and Canadians will withdraw from combat operations by 2010 / 11 , concentrating instead on training the Afghan army .
This itself is to double in size to 120,000 and some expectations are being placed on it for the long term .
The Dutch and Canadian transition might put pressure on Britain ( and a new election has to be held by 2010 ) to reconsider , or at least justify , its level of commitment .
For the moment , British planners seem quite pleased that in Helmand province there are signs , they say , of improvement in some areas .
This is put down to counter insurgency tactics that stress the need for better civilian rule ( the British are great supporters of Helmand Governor Gulab Mangal , an ex-communist , who is seen as an efficient administrator ) as well as military pressure .
But it is going to be a long haul at best .

Small business startups go through a typical life cycle of three stages .
I ’ve observed this startup lifecycle time and again .
In fact , I have gone through it myself .
If we recognize the three stages , it ’s the first step to getting through them successfully .
Before I go further , let me say I ’m not talking about the standard development stages of a high growth startup .
Venture capitalists and entrepreneurship professors often talk about this .
But they are thinking about the Facebooks , Googles and Ubers of the world .
I ’m referring to small business startups — the ones you and I and millions of the rest of us start .
Our small businesses have a life cycle , too .
And while the first and last stages are great , the middle stage is not always pretty .
Defining the Startup Life Cycle
It helps to understand a small business life cycle by reflecting on a law of physics : the first law of motion .
The first law of motion is a principle identified by Sir Issac Newton centuries ago .
You ’ve probably heard of Newton ’s first law , paraphrased as :
“ A body at rest tends to remain at rest .
A body in motion tends to remain in motion . “
Sound familiar ?
This is describing inertia and momentum .
In the simplest terms , when it comes to business :
Momentum = good Inertia = bad
Inertia is a major obstacle to success in a small business startup .
It ’s not helpful in any business .
But it impacts startups and small businesses to a greater degree .
Why ?
It ’s because we have fewer resources available to combat it .
After the initial rush of starting the business , we reach a point where we max out our resources .
We ’ve dug deep .
We ’ve squeezed out every last ounce of energy and resources .
And suddenly we have no more to give .
We have no more money , no more people , no more time to put into our businesses .
Yes , we ’ve used it all up .
Simply put , we get stuck .
After the initial excitement of getting the business off the ground , we ca n’t seem to make forward progress .
We ca n’t seem to get big things moving again .
Our businesses become like boulders chained to our ankles .
We push and we pull .
That boulder budges a few feet but it does n’t roll along the way we want .
If you are a hard charger or Type A personality , it gets frustrating .
Oh , we ’re busy — we ’re slammed .
We may be profitable and able to make payroll .
That ’s not the issue .
Rather , everything starts to feel hard .
Growth does n’t come as easily as we want it to .
We struggle to make forward progress in our business growth , profitability and success .
We feel mired down , like wading through mud .
That ’s inertia we ’re battling .
In fact , inertia is a natural part of the startup life cycle .
As I said at the beginning of this article , most of us as entrepreneurs go through these three stages in starting and operating a small business .
Let ’s walk through the three stages , so you know what to expect .
And if you are in one of the stages currently , see if the experience sounds familiar .
Startup Stage 1 : Launch
We start out with grand plans .
We entrepreneurs have big ideas and we ’re bursting with energy at first .
After all , we ’ve created something from nothing .
We ’ve done more than most people will ever do .
We took a leap , started a business and got it off the ground .
When I first started my business , I had so much energy I had difficulty channeling it .
I loved my business so much !
I was ready to take on the world .
And if I was gone from my business , I could n’t wait to get back .
I probably spent too many hours on it .
But it was a labor of love .
Other entrepreneurs I ’ve talked with describe a similar experience .
We ’re all filled with excitement when we first start a business .
It ’s almost like going through a manic episode ( but in a positive way ) .
We ’re focused and we ’re on fire .
We ’re all Davids ready to trounce Goliath !
Startup Stage 2 : Trough of Reality
While the launch phase is exciting , at some point we fall into … the Trough of Reality .
To describe this stage , I have to give a nod to the Gartner Hype Cycle .
The Hype Cycle is famous in business circles for describing the growth of new technologies .
After the initial peak of excitement and high expectations , at some point the new technology hits the “ trough of disillusionment . ”
That ’s the point when :
Interest in the new technology starts to wane .
Expectations get scaled back .
Some producers of the technology fail .
It ’s quite similar in a small business .
But in the case of business owners , it ’s not so much disillusionment .
It ’s that we come face to face with reality .
The Trough of Reality is the point where we start to get customers .
By this point we probably have employees or outsourced workers and services .
All our energy gets caught up in day - to - day work .
We are buried in minutiae .
We have bills to pay ; a payroll to meet .
In short , we ’re no longer just dreaming about a business .
Now we have to operate it .
Yikes !!!
Owners end up with a classic case of working IN the business when they should be working ON it .
My own business went through the Trough of Reality .
There were several years where it seemed like we merely existed .
Yes , we squeezed out a profit .
But as I look back , those years were a struggle .
I did a lot of freelance writing and consulting work on the side to subsidize growing my digital publishing company .
Twelve hour days – heck 14 hour days — were nothing .
We survived , of course .
After 15 years we ’re still here — and thriving .
But back then I worried a lot .
I was n’t having fun .
And it took all my energy .
Some businesses wallow in the Trough of Reality for years .
They manage to pay the bills , but growth is slow .
But even if you do n’t want growth — let ’s say you are a self - employed freelancer content to stay at a steady pace of work — your quality of life suffers .
You may personally feel beaten down by business pressures .
Call it burnout , call it exhaustion , call it lack of motivation .
You long to spend more time with family , or on hobbies or outside interests .
Yet you just ca n’t work up much extra energy for your business or your life .
As owners , our businesses start to feel like that boulder chained to our ankle .
And the boulder is barely moving .
It ’s hard to get that boulder rolling along steadily again .
Startup Stage 3 : Momentum !
The good news is , there comes a stage where things turn around .
It is when you feel like everything “ clicks . ”
Your business starts firing on all cylinders .
Amazing things happen .
Business picks up .
Sales roll in faster and more consistently .
Revenue seems to take less effort to generate .
If you have a team , they are able to operate on their own .
They start coming up with new ideas you never would have thought of .
Your people make more of the decisions .
They achieve things without you being involved in every detail .
If you are a solo owner or freelancer , you develop systems that enable you to manage it all better .
That word of mouth you developed through the first two stages of your business ?
It now starts to generate sales steadily .
You learn how to say no and focus your time to get the highest psychological and financial rewards .
At this stage of the small business life cycle , the owner can start taking longer vacations and holidays .
Your days feel more rewarding — less of a drag .
You have more energy , or so it seems .
Your creativity peeks through once again .
You experience renewed interest in a hobby or activity you used to love .
In short , you ’ve broken through inertia .
The boulder ( i.e. , the business you ’ve built ) now starts moving along of its own momentum .
How did you you do it ?
By sticking with it .
By continuing to come to work everyday .
You did it by making daily decisions .
Perhaps you hired the right person here or there to help .
You discovered new tools to drive efficiency .
You put systems and processes in place in your business .
Your offerings are now proven .
And you ’ve built up a customer base .
Most of all , you ’ve learned valuable lessons .
You know what to do and what not to do — the lessons of experience .
That makes things easier and more rewarding .
The combined force of all these things helps break through inertia .
The momentum is back .
And it ’s a wonderful feeling !
The Startup Lifecycle Makes You Stronger !
If you are currently in the Trough of Reality , you are not alone .
Others are at that stage with you .
That ’s important to recognize .
It ’s easier to get through a challenging time if you know it ’s not unique to you .
Millions of your peers got through that phase of the startup lifecycle .
They survived and thrived .
You too can get through it .
And when you do , you and your small business will emerge all the stronger for it .
Like the old saying by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , “ That which does not kill us , makes us stronger . ”

Mike Ash :
I ’ve come to realize that the iPhone platform is really pretty crappy in a lot of ways .
And these ways are mostly not due to hardware limitations , but rather artificial limitations put in place by Apple .
And mostly these are limitations which have been put in place For Our Own Protection , and which have been , shockingly , praised from many quarters .
Well , there was also a crowd who praised the announcement that developers would only be able to write Web applications and ridiculed those who wanted native ones .
Apple ’s focus and attention seems to be on the iPhone , and the sentiment coming out of Cupertino is one that the iPhone is good , all of the stupid , crippling restrictions on how it works are good , and Apple always knows best .
… This is the same keynote , let ’s remember , where high - up Apple people ridiculed the idea that anyone would ever have a legitimate reason to run applications in the background .
Unless that application is made by Apple , of course .
And then they came up with their brilliant idea of push notifications , which totally replace the need for background processes , unless you ’re writing a music player , or a Web browser , or GPS logger , or a terminal emulator , or file downloader , or… .
I think most of what Apple has done is defensible .
With a new platform and limited engineering resources , a case can be made for a conservative approach that starts with a very closed platform and slowly opens it up .
You do n’t maximize the device ’s potential , but you prevent any bad surprises from occurring .
Theoretically , by controlling everything , you can keep the quality of the experience high while you build market share .
You can get away with this for a while because there are no significant competitors .
This is not the approach I would have taken — I like Ash ’s idea of third - party developers stepping in to do what Apple wo n’t or has n’t yet — but I can easily believe that Apple thinks it ’s a good idea , and they may be right .
What ’s not so defensible is what Apple has been saying these past few years .
It ’s been spinning like crazy .
They introduced the iPhone as a platform that included Cocoa and lots of great developer technologies , but soon it became clear that these were only for Apple ’s use .
First there was , “ Cingular does n’t want to see their West Coast network go down because some application messed up . ”
As far as I can tell this was just FUD .
Then : “ You can write amazing Web 2.0 and AJAX apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone .
And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services . ”
Turns out there were significant look and behavior differences compared with native applications , and nearly all of the phone ’s data and services were off limits .
It was reasonable for Apple not to have an SDK ready at that time .
It was not reasonable to suggest that Web applications , which we already knew would be supported , were something new and “ innovative ” and “ a very sweet solution . ”
Since Steve Jobs said that this was something Apple had just “ come up with , ” some people assumed that there would be a JavaScript API or perhaps a widget environment .
In fact , there was nothing .
The touted integration ended up being that Google Maps and YouTube URLs would open in those applications rather than in Safari .
Then , finally , the SDK was announced , and developers saw that far more was missing from the OS than the Mac desktop patterns and sounds .
How would iPhone applications be developed and deployed ?
With music , Apple had given the appearance of being against DRM , but for applications it delivered one that was even more restrictive .
On the Mac side , Apple encouraged developers to write 64 - bit Carbon applications , but then quietly removed this option .
Developers would have been better off following the conventional wisdom , that Carbon was a transitional API and Cocoa was the future , than listening to Apple ’s explicit statements to the contrary .
At WWDC 2006 , Steve Jobs declined to demonstrate Leopard ’s top secret features because “ We do n't want our friends to start their photocopiers any sooner than they have to . ”
Once Leopard shipped , we saw that there were no such features .
At WWDC 2008 , Jobs looked sickly and Apple PR claimed that he just had a “ common bug , ” though he eventually admitted off the record that this was n’t true .
Ash now worries about what Apple has planned for the future of the Mac .
It could be bleak .
It seems like a crazy idea , but Apple is known for betting ( often successfully ) on crazy ideas .
I do n’t think Apple would go that far , but it ’s frightening that it would be possible .
I think the bottom line is that , because of the way Apple has behaved , people do n’t trust it as much .
This makes them less willing to give it the benefit of the doubt .
And it increases uncertainty , which makes it difficult to plan .
Mac developers were encouraged to learn how to write Web applications when a Cocoa - based SDK was just around the corner .
It ended up being better to act based on supposition ( that there would be an SDK ) and experiment with a jailbroken phone , than to do what Apple had recommended .
I ’m not suggesting that Apple should reveal all the details or make commitments prematurely , but in most cases I think the spinning is counterproductive .
I would prefer candor .
If the reality does n’t match the rhetoric , people will find out .
They could be unhappy that they were talked down to and misled , or they could appreciate being told the straight story , even if it ’s less than insanely great .

FINLAND'S government is introducing tougher regulations on handguns following a mass shooting at a school on Tuesday September 23rd , the second in under a year .
The country had been among the most lenient in the world , allowing 15 - year - olds to keep a handgun under parental supervision , requiring no medical or psychological tests and no minimum wait for those buying weapons .
The gun -death rate ( whether murder , accident or suicide ) in rich countries is highest where there are more guns : America , Switzerland and Finland are in the top four countries for gun ownership per person .
The death rate in Britain , which banned handguns following a school shooting in 1996 , is 0.1 for every 100,000 people .

Ok , now I 'm mad at McCain
Posted on by pctech
I was just listening to Foxnews .
They had a short blurp from McCain talking about the vote yesterday to bailout the financial crisis .
He said , and I quote , " Yesterday the world looked to Washington for leadership , and Congress let them down . "
TOPICS :
KEYWORDS :
Call me ignorant , call me naive , but did n't Congress do exactly what McCain accused them of not doing ?
The GOP DID provide leadership in helping to strike down this bloated piece of legislation and thereby send a signal that Washington WON'T bail out the crooks that perpetrating this crime upon us ?
I 'm getting tired of , what appears to be , McCain continuing to shoot himself in the foot in what could be the most important election to date .
What do you all think ?
Am I getting upset for a reason or am I just not looking at this mess correctly ?
I really need some help with this issue .

There are no words to adequately express my profound disappointment with McCain right now .
No I agree with you completely .
All the renewed enthusiasm I had for this election after the Palin announcement is .
There are no words to adequately express my profound disappointment with McCain right now .
I guess this country deserves to suffer through 4 years of Obama .

Blah , blah , blah .
More whiney vanity posts .
You will be impressed by McCain by the time the election is held .
To : pctech
He could have positioned himself well by stating that the DEM leadership let down the country .
Instead , this appears to also be a shot at the GOP leadership .
To : screaminsunshine
The Party has lost its way under Bush .
McCain will finish it unless Palin can somehow save it .
I ’m not optimistic .

Put him on mute and vote for him anyway - if he gets elected at least we can listen to Sarah for the next 4 years .

Not sure we want a congress with a nine percent approval rating passing anything .

He never took the initiative during the debate to really challenge Obama , and now he 's making statements like this .
It 's really frustrating to see and hear him do this to the GOP .
I 'm honestly looking at the real possibility that Obama wins the election and in two years the Rats suffer another GOP take over in the House and Senate .
This scenario is jus so sickening but I 'm to see that it could happen .

Privacy Concerns Over Google Chrome ’s " Omnibox "
From CNet :
The auto - suggest feature of Google ’s new Chrome browser does more than just help users get where they are going .
It will also give Google a wealth of information on what people are doing on the Internet besides searching .
Provided that users leave Chrome ’s auto - suggest feature on and have Google as their default search provider , Google will have access to any keystrokes that are typed into the browser ’s Omnibox , even before a user hits enter .
What ’s more , Google has every intention of retaining some of that data even after it provides the promised suggestions .
A Google representative told CNET
News that the company plans to store about 2 percent of that data – and plans to store it along with the Internet Protocol address of the computer that typed it .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s Peter Eckersley said he ’s concerned about this feature , CNet reports in another article .
If you like to use Chrome but want to turn off this feature , right - click the Chrome address bar , select “ Edit search engines ” , and uncheck the “ Use a suggestion service ... ” box .
Also , Google ’s Matt Cutts mentions other ways Chrome talks to Google .

Fox host on Code Pink protesters : ' Where 's the taser ? '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Members of Code Pink repeatedly interrupted John McCain 's acceptance speech on Thursday with calls of " We want a peace president ! " but were quickly drowned out by delegates being directed to chant " USA , USA " and removed by security .
The hosts of Fox & Friends were naturally outraged by the interruptions .
" I do n't get how these people got in there , " fretted Steve Doocy .
" It was really hard to get any sort of credential for us professional media . "
However , Brian Kilmeade appeared disappointed that the women had not been handled more aggressively .
" Why did she knock a Secret Service agent off of her ? " he wanted to know .
" That is a reason where they -- did n't the other guy ' tase him bro ' because of that ?
Where is the taser ?
They tased the guy at Florida State , but with maybe a future president feet away this woman 's allowed to get up and scream ?
She could have had a gun . "
Kilmeade 's co-hosts did not directly respond to his suggestion , but Gretchen Carlson jumped in to suggest diplomatically , " Neither candidate is helped by this . "
" Code Pink 's leader is a major fundraiser for Barack Obama , " Kilmeade grumbled .

We ’re at lucky number 13 — the thirteenth article in the Enumerating Enumerable series , which covers the methods of Ruby ’s Enumerable module .
I started this series after being disappointed with the documentation at Ruby - Doc.org .
In this article , I ’m covering the find_all — a .k.a. select — method .
In case you missed any of the previous articles , they ’re listed and linked below :
Enumerable #find_all / Enumerable #select Quick Summary
In the simplest possible terms
Which items in the collection meet the given criteria ?
Ruby version 1.8 and 1.9 Expects
A block containing the criteria .
Returns
An array containing the items in the collection that meet the given criteria .
If no items in the collection meet the given criteria , this is an empty array .
RubyDoc.org ’s entry Enumerable #find_all / Enumerable #select
Enumerable # find_all / Enumerable #select and Arrays
When used on an array , find_all and its synonym select passes each item from the array to the block , returning an array containing only those elements in the original array for which the block returns a value that does n’t evaluate to false .
If no item in the array causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , find_all / select returns an empty array .
In the examples that follow ( which are based on my examples for the detect / find method ) , I ’ll be using the find_all method .
select does exactly the same thing ; it ’s just that I prefer find_all .

Enumerable # find_all / Enumerable #select and Hashes
When used on a hash , find_all / select passes each key / value pair in the hash to the block , which you can “ catch ” as either :
A two - element array , with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1 , or Two separate items , with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item .
As with arrays , find_all / select passes each item from the hash to the block , returning an array containing only those items in the original array for which the block returns a value that does n’t evaluate to false .
Note that each item in the result array is a two - element array corresponding to an item from the original hash .
In this array , element 0 contains the key and element 1 contains the corresponding value .
If no item in the hash causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , find_all / select returns an empty array .

For many years people knew that wind can be used to generate energy , but no one was aware of the quantity of energy it could actually produce .
In 2005 two scientists at Stanford University , Cristina Archer and Mark Jacobson , performed a detailed estimation based on already known models of air movement .
However , they calculated the energy that could only be produced from winds blowing at an altitude of 80 meters .
Their results showed that under perfect conditions the total energy would be around 72 trillion watts .
It is worth mentioning that last year the full electrical generating capacity of the U.S. was slightly above 1 trillion watts .
Scientists came to a conclusion that this number is way below the potential .
The speed of wind increases with the altitude .
The power increases at the cube of wind speed , which means that the electrical generating capacity could reach at least 72 trillion watts .
If a turbine blade was located a few miles up , it could produce up to 250 times the energy that the turbine generates on the ground .
Bryan Roberts , who works as an engineering professor at the University of Technology in Sydney , Australia , proposed an idea on generating energy from wind .
His project is currently developed by Sky WindPower , an American company with headquarters in San - Diego .
The project features kites with rotors that fly like a helicopter to altitudes of over a mile where winds are stronger .
When the device arrives to the destination point in the sky , rotors switch to generating mode and transmit electricity down their tethers .
In case the winds change their direction the flying electric generators ( FEGs ) follow them .
This project , which looks rather simple , is really not like anything that the energy infrastructure creates .
A team of scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts worked on a similar project - inexpensive energy kites that fly on low altitudes .
These kites are somewhat different from the FEGs because the do not carry generators into the sky and then send current down the string .
Instead they move up and down several hundreds of feet in the air , producing pulses in the tether that provides power to the generator stored on the ground .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
As Congress wrestles with another bailout bill to try to contain the financial contagion , there 's a potential killer bug out there whose next movement can't be predicted : the Credit Default Swap .
In just over a decade these privately traded derivatives contracts have ballooned from nothing into a $ 54.6 trillion market .
CDS are the fastest - growing major type of financial derivatives .
More important , they 've played a critical role in the unfolding financial crisis .
First , by ostensibly providing " insurance " on risky mortgage bonds , they encouraged and enabled reckless behavior during the housing bubble .
" If CDS had been taken out of play , companies would 've said , ' I ca n't get this [ risk ] off my books , ' " says Michael Greenberger , a University of Maryland law professor and former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
" If they could n't keep passing the risk down the line , those guys would 've been stopped in their tracks .
The ultimate assurance for issuing all this stuff was , ' It 's insured . ' "
Second , terror at the potential for a financial Ebola virus radiating out from a failing institution and infecting dozens or hundreds of other companies - all linked to one another by CDS and other instruments - was a major reason that regulators stepped in to bail out Bear Stearns and buy out AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , whose calamitous descent itself was triggered by losses on its CDS contracts ( see " Hank 's Last Stand " ) .
And the fear of a CDS catastrophe still haunts the markets .
For starters , nobody knows how federal intervention might ripple through this chain of contracts .
And meanwhile , as we 'll see , two fundamental aspects of the CDS market - that it is unregulated , and that almost nothing is disclosed publicly - may be about to change .
That adds even more uncertainty to the equation .
" The big problem is that here are all these public companies - banks and corporations - and no one really knows what exposure they 've got from the CDS contracts , " says Frank Partnoy , a law professor at the University of San Diego and former Morgan Stanley derivatives salesman who has been writing about the dangers of CDS and their ilk for a decade .
" The really scary part is that we do n't have a clue . "
Chris Wolf , a co-manager of Cogo Wolf , a hedge fund of funds , compares them to one of the great mysteries of astrophysics : " This has become essentially the dark matter of the financial universe . "
***
AT FIRST GLANCE , credit default swaps do n't look all that scary .
A CDS is just a contract :
The " buyer " plunks down something that resembles a premium , and the " seller " agrees to make a specific payment if a particular event , such as a bond default , occurs .
Used soberly , CDS offer concrete benefits :
If you 're holding bonds and you 're worried that the issuer wo n't be able to pay , buying CDS should cover your loss .
" CDS serve a very useful function of allowing financial markets to efficiently transfer credit risk , " argues Sunil Hirani , the CEO of Creditex , one of a handful of marketplaces that trade the contracts .
Because they 're contracts rather than securities or insurance , CDS are easy to create :
Often deals are done in a one - minute phone conversation or an instant message .
Many technical aspects of CDS , such as the typical five - year term , have been standardized by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) .
That only accelerates the process .
You strike your deal , fill out some forms , and you 've got yourself a $ 5 million - or a $ 100 million - contract .
And as long as someone is willing to take the other side of the proposition , a CDS can cover just about anything , making it the Wall Street equivalent of those notorious Lloyds of London policies covering Liberace 's hands and other esoterica .
It has even become possible to purchase a CDS that would pay out if the U.S. government defaults .
( Trust us when we say that if the government goes under , trying to collect will be the least of your worries . )
You can guess how Wall Street cowboys responded to the opportunity to make deals that ( 1 ) can be struck in a minute , ( 2 ) require little or no cash upfront , and ( 3 ) can cover anything .
Yee -haw !
You can almost picture Slim Pickens in Dr. Strangelove climbing onto the H - bomb before it 's released from the B - 52 .
And indeed , the volume of CDS has exploded with nuclear force , nearly doubling every year since 2001 to reach a recent peak of $ 62 trillion at the end of 2007 , before receding to $ 54.6 trillion as of June 30 , according to ISDA .
Take that gargantuan number with a grain of salt .
It refers to the face value of all outstanding contracts .
But many players in the market hold offsetting positions .
So if , in theory , every entity that owns CDS had to settle its contracts tomorrow and " netted " all its positions against each other , a much smaller amount of money would change hands .
But even a tiny fraction of that $ 54.6 trillion would still be a daunting sum .
The credit freeze and then the Bear disaster explain the drop in outstanding CDS contracts during the first half of the year - and the market has only worsened since .
CDS contracts on widely held debt , such as General Motors ' ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , continue to be actively bought and sold .
But traders say almost no new contracts are being written on any but the most liquid debt issues right now , in part because nobody wants to put money at risk and because nobody knows what Washington will do and how that will affect the market .
( " There 's nothing to do but watch Bernanke on TV , " one trader told Fortune during the week when the Fed chairman was going before Congress to push the mortgage bailout . )
So , after nearly a decade of exponential growth , the CDS market is poised for its first sustained contraction .
***
ONE REASON THE MARKET TOOK OFF is that you do n't have to own a bond to buy a CDS on it - anyone can place a bet on whether a bond will fail .
Indeed the majority of CDS now consists of bets on other people 's debt .
That 's why it 's possible for the market to be so big :
The $ 54.6 trillion in CDS contracts completely dwarfs total corporate debt , which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association puts at $ 6.2 trillion , and the $ 10 trillion it counts in all forms of asset - backed debt .
" It 's sort of like I think you 're a bad driver and you 're going to crash your car , " says Greenberger , formerly of the CFTC .
" So I go to an insurance company and get collision insurance on your car because I think it 'll crash and I 'll collect on it . "
That 's precisely what the biggest winners in the subprime debacle did .
Hedge fund star John Paulson of Paulson & Co. , for example , made $ 15 billion in 2007 , largely by using CDS to bet that other investors ' subprime mortgage bonds would default .
So what started out as a vehicle for hedging ended up giving investors a cheap , easy way to wager on almost any event in the credit markets .
In effect , credit default swaps became the world 's largest casino .
As Christopher Whalen , a managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics , observes , " To be generous , you could call it an unregulated , uncapitalized insurance market .
But really , you would call it a gaming contract . "
There is at least one key difference between casino gambling and CDS trading : Gambling has strict government regulation .
The federal government has long shied away from any oversight of CDS .
The CFTC floated the idea of taking an oversight role in the late ' 90s , only to find itself opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and others .
Then , in 2000 , Congress , with the support of Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , passed a bill prohibiting all federal and most state regulation of CDS and other derivatives .
In a press release at the time , co-sponsor Senator Phil Gramm - most recently in the news when he stepped down as John McCain 's campaign co-chair this summer after calling people who talk about a recession " whiners " - crowed that the new law " protects financial institutions from over - regulation ... and it guarantees that the United States will maintain its global dominance of financial markets . "
( The authors of the legislation were so bent on warding off regulation that they had the bill specify that it would " supersede and preempt the application of any state or local law that prohibits gaming ... " )
Not everyone was as sanguine as Gramm .
In 2003 Warren Buffett famously called derivatives " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
***
THERE'S ANOTHER BIG difference between trading CDS and casino gambling .
When you put $ 10 on black 22 , you 're pretty sure the casino will pay off if you win .
The CDS market offers no such assurance .
One reason the market grew so quickly was that hedge funds poured in , sensing easy money .
And not just big , well - established hedge funds but a lot of upstarts .
So in some cases , giant financial institutions were counting on collecting money from institutions only slightly more solvent than your average minimart .
The danger , of course , is that if a hedge fund suddenly has to pay off on a lot of CDS , it will simply go out of business .
" People have been insuring risks that they can't insure , " says Peter Schiff , the president of Euro Pacific Capital and author of Crash Proof , which predicted doom for Fannie and Freddie , among other things .
" Let 's say you 're writing fire insurance policies , and every time you get the [ premium ] , you spend it .
You just assume that no houses are going to burn down .
And all of a sudden there 's a huge fire and they all burn down .
What do you do ?
You just close up shop . "

Regions of some European nations cannot currently get broadband Brussels is considering making broadband access available for all .
The fast growth of broadband has led the European Commission to bring forward a review of the basic telecoms services Europeans can expect .
Current statistics suggest about 36 % of households in EU member nations have high - speed net access .
When a majority of EU citizens are using a telecoms service , EC rules dictate that it becomes one every European should be able to enjoy .
Basic access " High - speed internet is the passport to the Information Society and an essential condition for economic growth , " said Viviane Reding , EU Telecoms Commissioner in a statement announcing the review .
" This is why it is this Commission 's policy to make broadband internet for all Europeans happen by 2010 . "
The EC's Universal Service Obligations ( USO ) demand that all citizens who want them should be able to get access to basic telephone services .
It covers the production of a telephone directory , availability of payphones , specific measures for people with disabilities or those on low incomes and fixed phone access for local , national and international voice calls .
The obligations also include a clause demanding that the fixed line be of sufficient quality to " permit functional internet access " .
In the UK this has been interpreted to mean a line that can support a dial - up speed of 28.8 kilobits per second .
Broadband speeds around the world The EC reviews the USO every three years and in its report kicking off the latest overhaul , it said broadband was growing at a pace that would mean more Europeans were using it than not .
Figures from the EC suggest that from 2003 - 2007 broadband use in member nations tripled to 36 % of households and had an annual growth rate of 20 % .
Despite this , said the EC , there were " striking gaps " among member states and the coverage their citizens enjoyed .
In nations such as Denmark , Luxembourg and Belgium , 100 % of the population can get broadband if they want it .
By contrast , 60 % of Romanians cannot get broadband access .
Even in nations such as Germany and Italy , which have booming broadband sectors , about 12 % of the population is not covered by high - speed access .
The review aims to find out if the USO needs to be re-written to force telecoms firms to extend broadband to those areas competition will leave bereft of it .
It will also find out if a narrow - band access , aka dial - up , is sufficient to " permit functional internet access " or if the pace of change online means higher speeds are the minimum needed .
The EC is inviting submissions from telecoms firms , governments and citizens with the aim of producing a communique in 2009 and perhaps legislation in 2010 .

A drug-crazed man runs up behind a woman in San Francisco 's Marina district and pulls her to the street as he tries to wrestle her purse away .
A group of young men surrounds a commuter on a Muni bus at Fifth and Market streets ; they point a gun at him and demand his iPod .
A hooded man yells at customers in a pizzeria in Oakland 's Oakmont neighborhood to put their wallets on their tables , as his partner waves a revolver .
More than 40 robberies occur every day in the Bay Area - and they are happening far more often than just a few years ago .
While recent high - profile restaurant robberies have citizens calling for police to crack down on commercial holdups , the total number of robberies in the nine - county region was up nearly 40 percent in 2007 compared with 2004 , according to the FBI 's most recent figures .
Some of the worst spots are busy hubs for commuters and shoppers , including the areas around the 12th Street BART Station in downtown Oakland , and San Francisco shopping districts at Fifth and Market streets and the Metreon at Fourth and Mission streets , according to a Chronicle analysis .
" Robberies are the soup du jour of crime , " said David Kozicki , deputy police chief of Oakland , which has been hit hardest by the recent takeover robberies , in which armed thieves force customers and employees of restaurants to hand over their money .
" I 've heard from cities around the nation : Robberies are getting worse . "
The Bay Area violence follows a national surge that some experts fear signals the end of a long downturn that began in the 1990s and has allowed once - crime - ridden areas to grow into trendy neighborhoods .
Now some of those areas are starting to see old crime problems returning .
The Chronicle examined location records of more than 30,000 robberies in San Francisco and Oakland since 2004 , as well as statistics for other Bay Area cities , and found a gloomy outlook :
-- Between 2004 and 2006 , robberies spiked in the region , going from 11,264 a year to 15,698 , then leveling off in 2007 at 15,646 .
Bay Area - wide statistics from the FBI are n't available for 2008 .
But , running counts in San Francisco and Oakland show both cities ' numbers are higher this year .
-- Strong - arm robberies , in which the assailants used only bodily force , are the most prevalent .
But in both San Francisco and Oakland , the percentage of robberies involving guns has crept up since 2005 - from 30 to 39 percent .
-- IPods , laptop computers and fancy cell phones are such hot items for robbers that some investigators suggest the increasing prevalence of these expensive , easy - to - sell accessories in public places may be a driving force behind the robbery surge .
-- Some of the areas that have seen the biggest increases in robberies are up - and - coming neighborhoods that had seemed to have risen above historical crime problems .
These include Oakland 's Rockridge district and neighborhoods in the lower hills , such as Oakmont and Glenview near Park Boulevard , and San Francisco 's Glen Park .
Criminologists warn that the faltering economy probably will make matters worse .
Economic downturn
" The steep economic downturn of 2007 and 2008 portends a crime rise that may dwarf ( recent ) increases , " wrote University of Missouri - St. Louis criminologists Richard Rosenfeld and Brian Oliver , in a paper presented at a national criminal justice conference in July .
" Local communities should plan for new crime increases in the years ahead . "
San Francisco 's biggest hot spot is the intersection of 16th and Mission streets , where police say drug - dealing activity and the heavy traffic coming in and out of the BART station combine to offer a perfect opportunity for muggings .
There were 58 robberies reported there during 2007 and the first half of 2008 .
More than 70 percent of these were strong - arm robberies .
But , block for block , there is no denser concentration of robberies than in San Francisco 's Tenderloin .
The area of halfway houses and residence hotels is plagued with drug dealing , prostitution and drunkenness - and police say robberies go hand in hand .
The Tenderloin has six of San Francisco 's 15 worst intersections for robbery and typically experiences about a robbery a day .
People involved in the drug scene are often both the perpetrators and victims of robberies there , police say .
But others get hit as well , including residents from Southeast Asia and Central American whose numbers have recently increased in the neighborhood .
Some mornings , police say , robbers set up at bus stops along Hyde Street to hit commuters .
In Oakland , the rough neighborhoods around the Eastmont Mall and the Fruitvale district are favored hunting grounds .
In the Fruitvale area , police say day laborers are major targets of robbers looking for cash .
But other hot spots are transit or shopping hubs , where crowds mingle and , police say , robbers have lots of potential targets and getaway options .
In Oakland , the single worst hot spot is the intersection of Broadway and 13th Street near the 12th Street BART Station .
In San Francisco , Halladie Plaza , the shopping area on Market Street near Fifth Street and a busy corner at Third and Market streets have similar characteristics .
San Francisco Robbery Lt. William
Canning said these are locations where shoppers , tourists and commuters inevitably end up rubbing elbows with gang members , drug users and homeless people .
The result can be volatile .
" These are transit corridors , " said Canning .
" You have a crossroads where all kinds of people come together .
Unfortunately , that can be a useful environment to the criminal element . "
Robbery Sgt. Shaughn Ryan said many of these spots - particularly the corner of Fourth and Mission streets , at the Metreon - are weekend hangouts for youths , who often form rat packs that target other youths .
Oakmore neighborhood
Yet some of the neighborhoods that have seen the biggest increases in robberies are places that once seemed to have largely overcome crime .
Oakland 's Oakmore neighborhood , where Joseph Radwan and his family decided to open the Red Boy Pizzeria earlier this year , seems a world away from the violence in many nearby East Oakland neighborhoods .
Nestled in the lower hills among winding streets and oak trees , it and the neighboring Glenview district have seen business boom with trendy new restaurants and cafes moving in along Park and Leimert Boulevards - during a time when crime was on the wane in both Oakland and the nation .
Yet on March 31 , eight days after the restaurant opened , two juveniles wearing dark hoodies walked in just as the last two tables of customers were getting ready to leave before closing time .
" One guy went around the tables to the customers and said , ' Get all your cash and put it on the table . '
The other guy just sort of swung his gun around , " said Radwan , who manages the restaurant that is co-owned by his parents .
" It was terrifying . "
Crime doubles in lower hills
In Oakland as a whole , robberies increased by 23 percent between 2005 and 2007 , but robberies in the lower hills police beats that encompass Oakmore , Glenview , Lakeshore and the Dimond district nearly doubled - going from 34 to 63 .
Similarly , the upscale Rockridge neighborhood in North Oakland saw robberies jump from 36 in 2005 to 68 last year .
( Oakland 's crime numbers at the neighborhood level are not available for 2004 because of a change in the police department computer system . )
" The crooks have realized we 're easy marks , " said Vivek Bhatia , a management consultant who moved to Rockridge in 2001 and has since become the neighborhood 's self - appointed crime expert .
After the huge surge in muggings there a couple years ago , he started a neighborhood Web site with monthly crime statistics and installed seven video cameras to guard his home .
His records show the number of violent crimes in the neighborhood have nearly tripled since 2005 .
Bhatia said residents often open themselves to becoming victims by failing to take basic precautions , such as locking doors and keeping valuables out of sight .
" Nobody wants to admit there 's crime here , because it's hard to say , ' I just spent big money to live in a neighborhood with crime problems . ' "
" If I 'm a robber , how am I going to grow my business ?
This was an untapped market . "
Similarly , crime figures in San Francisco 's Glen Park and Diamond Heights neighborhoods risen far faster this year than the city overall .
The two neighboring areas in the Ingleside police district had 20 robberies in the first half of this year , compared with 16 in all of 2005 .
Starting in late 2005 , police began to notice that robbers were more prevalent and younger - and they had their eyes on high - tech gadgets .
Groups of youths as young as 13 or 14 would surround someone and grab the victim 's iPod .
" We noticed a significant rise in juvenile crime , " said San Francisco Police Capt .
John Loftus , who headed the robbery division when the rise in crime started .
" I 'm not sure if there were more kids or whether they just were n't behaving . "
In fact , researchers say the number of teenagers in the population is relatively level .
San Francisco's Canning , who now heads the robbery unit , said there have been cases where young girls were the robbers .
Loftus and other officers speculated that a new generation of gadgetry hitting the streets at the same time might have increased the temptation .
" The iPods came out around this time and wireless became popular .
You'd have people sitting in cafes pecking away at $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 pieces of equipment .
That 's a very desirous piece of equipment for a kid to have . "
Since the beginning of the year , Canning said his department has recorded robberies involving thefts of 37 iPhones , 122 other cell phones , 100 portable music players and 56 laptops .
The robbers " either keep them or sell them for quick cash , " said Canning .
" If I steal your $ 2,000 laptop and get $ 100 for it , I 'm happy . "
Armed robbery statistics up
Statistics show the percentage of robberies involving guns also increased since 2005 .
In Oakland , armed robberies are far more prevalent than in San Francisco .
In the first five months of 2008 , guns were involved in 55 percent of Oakland 's robberies , up from 41 percent in 2005 .
In San Francisco , robberies involving guns climbed from 21 to 25 percent , according to The Chronicle 's analysis .
The robbery on a Muni bus at Fifth and Market streets on Aug. 13 was the kind of holdup police report again and again .
Six 17 - and - 18 - year - olds surrounded a man in his 20s as he was preparing to get off the 71 - Haight bus at 8:30 in the evening .
One of the robbers pulled a gun and demanded his iPod .
The man jumped off the bus and reported the robbery to police at the nearby Powell Street BART station , and the robbers continued riding the bus .
BART Police called the San Francisco Police Department , which teamed up with Muni to track down the bus as it headed toward Haight Street .
San Francisco officers caught up with the bus on Haight Street , arrested three suspects and detained three others .
The 24 hours beginning at 7:30 p.m. on July 30 show the kind of mayhem facing police on an almost daily basis .
In rapid succession , two purse snatchers violently attacked three women walking separately in the early evening in the Marina in San Francisco .
In the first attack , the robbers grabbed a woman 's purse and then forced her to the ground .
Eight minutes and two blocks later , the robbers did the same thing to another woman , pushing her to the ground in the middle of a street .
In the third incident , the robbers ' getaway vehicle hit their victim , leaving her with serious head injuries .
Police quickly nabbed two suspects - one of whom admitted committing the crimes , saying he and his accomplice needed money to buy crack cocaine .
Two hours later , near Harrison and 20th streets in the Mission District , two men were shot when they resisted a robbery attempt by another male .
One sustained life - threatening injuries - the robber got away .
In the East Bay 6:15 the next morning , two men went on a robbery spree that included five street muggings in Oakland and Emeryville .
In one of the robberies , at the Wells Fargo bank on Piedmont Avenue , the assailants allegedly targeted a woman who was eight months pregnant and punched her in the stomach to get her cash .
The robbers were nabbed in Berkeley after a witness reported them trying to use a stolen credit card at a gas station .
In addition to these high - profile cases during the 24 hours , there was a taco truck holdup in San Francisco 's Mission District , an armed holdup in downtown Oakland at 11th Street and Broadway and two other strong - arm robberies in Oakland .
" We get so many of these cases , we just get buried , " said Police Sgt. Larry Krupp , who heads Oakland 's robbery unit .
But for the robbery victims , the experience can be life - shattering .
Terri , one of the women accosted by the purse snatchers in the Marina on July 30 , said the most frightening thing was that this happened in broad daylight in one of the safest neighborhoods in San Francisco .
Yet no one came to her aid as she screamed and struggled with her attacker .
" As a single woman living in the city , I always thought if I screamed loud enough somebody would come and help me , " said Terri , who asked that her last name not be used because she fears retribution from the two suspects who are facing robbery charges .
" But the reality is nobody is going to come .
It made me see the city in a whole different light . "

M. M. Professor Hobsbawm , two decades after 1989 , when he was too hastily consigned to oblivion , Karl Marx has returned to the limelight .
Freed from the role of instrumentum regni to which he was assigned in the Soviet Union , and from the shackles of ``Marxism - Leninism ' ' , he has in the last few years not only received intellectual attention through new publication of his work , but also been the focus of more widespread interest .
Indeed in 2003 , the French magazine Nouvel Observateur dedicated a special issue to Karl Marx -- le penseur du troisième millénaire ?
( Karl Marx -- the thinker of the third millennium ? ) .
A year later , in Germany , in an opinion poll sponsored by the television company ZDF to establish who were the most important Germans of all time , more than 500,000 viewers voted for Marx ; he came third in the general classification and first in the ``current relevance '' category .
Then , in 2005 , the weekly Der Spiegel portrayed him on the cover under the title ``Ein Gespenst kehrt zurück '' ( A spectre is back ) , while listeners to the BBC Radio 4 program In Our Time voted for Marx as their ``greatest philosopher ''
In a recent public conversation with Jacques Attalì , you said that paradoxically " it is the capitalists more than others who have been rediscovering Marx " , and you talked of your astonishment when the businessman and liberal politician George Soros said to you " I 've just been reading Marx and there is an awful lot in what he says . "
Although weak and rather vague , what are the reasons for this revival ?
Is his work likely to be of interest only to specialists and intellectuals , being presented in university courses as a great classic of modern thought that should never be forgotten ?
Or could a new " demand for Marx " come in the future from the political side as well ?
E. H. There is an undoubted revival of public interest in Marx in the capitalist world , though probably not as yet in the new East European members of the European Union .
It was probably accelerated by the fact that the 150th anniversary of the publication of the Manifesto of the Communist Party coincided with a particularly dramatic international economic crisis in the midst of a period of ultra-rapid free market globalisation .
Marx had predicted the nature of the early 21st century world economy a hundred and fifty years earlier , on the basis of his analysis of " bourgeois society " .
It is not surprising that intelligent capitalists , especially in the globalised financial sector , were impressed by Marx , since they were necessarily more aware than others of the nature and instabilities of the capitalist economy in which they operated .
Most of the intellectual left no longer knew what to do with Marx .
It had been demoralised by the collapse of the social - democratic project in most North Atlantic states in the 1980s and the mass conversion of national governments to free market ideology , as well as by the collapse of the political and economic systems that claimed to be inspired by Marx and Lenin .
The so - called " new social movements " like feminism either had no logical connection with anti-capitalism ( though as individuals their members might be aligned with it ) or they challenged the belief in endless progress in human control over nature , which both capitalism and traditional socialism had shared .
At the same time the " proletariat " , divided and diminished , ceased to be credible as Marx 's historical agent of social transformation .
It is also the case that since 1968 the most prominent radical movements have preferred direct action not necessarily based on much reading and theoretical analysis .
Of course this does not mean that Marx will cease to be regarded as a great and classical thinker , although for political reasons , especially in countries like France and Italy with once powerful Communist parties , there has been a passionate intellectual offensive against Marx and Marxist analyses , which was probably at its height in the 1980s and 1990s .
There are signs that it has now run its course .
M. M. Throughout his life Marx was a shrewd and tireless researcher , who sensed and analysed better than anyone else in his time the development of capitalism on a world scale .
He understood that the birth of a globalised international economy was inherent in the capitalist mode of production and predicted that this process would generate not only the growth and prosperity flaunted by liberal theorists and politicians but also violent conflicts , economic crises and widespread social injustice .
In the last decade we have seen the East Asian financial crisis , which started in the summer of 1997 , the Argentinian economic crisis of 1999 - 2002 and , above all , the subprime mortgage crisis , which started in the United States in 2006 and has now become the biggest post - war financial crisis .
Is it right to say , therefore , that the return of interest in Marx is also based on the crisis of capitalist society and on his enduring capacity to explain the profound contradictions of today 's world ?
E. H. Whether the future politics of the left will once again be inspired by Marx 's analysis , as the old socialist and communist movements were , will depend on what happens to world capitalism .
But this applies not only to Marx but to the left as a coherent political ideology and project .
Since , as you say correctly , the return of interest in Marx is largely -- I would say mainly -- based on the current crisis of capitalist society , the outlook is more promising than it was in the 1990s .
The present world financial crisis , which may well become a major economic depression in the USA , dramatises the failure of the theology of the uncontrolled global free market , and forces even the US government to consider taking public actions forgotten since the 1930s .
Political pressures are already weakening the commitment of economic neoliberal governments to uncontrolled , unlimited and unregulated globalisation .
In some cases ( China ) the vast inequalities and injustices caused by a wholesale transition to a free market economy already raise major problems for social stability and raise doubts even at the higher levels of government .
It is clear that any " return to Marx " will be essentially a return to Marx 's analysis of capitalism and its place in the historical evolution of humanity -- including , above all , his analysis of the central instability of capitalist development , which proceeds through self - generated periodic economic crises , with political and social dimensions .
No Marxist could believe for a moment that , as neoliberal ideologists argued in 1989 , liberal capitalism had established itself forever , that history had come to an end , or indeed that any system of human relations could ever be final and definitive .
M. M. Do you not think that if the political and intellectual forces of the international left , who are questioning themselves with regard to socialism in the new century , were to foreswear the ideas of Marx , they would lose a fundamental guide for the examination and transformation of today 's reality ?
E. H. No socialist can foreswear the ideas of Marx , since his belief that capitalism must be succeeded by another form of society is based not on hope or will but on a serious analysis of historical development , particularly in the capitalist era .
His actual prediction that capitalism would be replaced by a socially managed or planned system still seems reasonable , though he certainly underestimated the market elements which would survive in any post - capitalist system (s ) .
Since he deliberately abstained from speculation about the future , he cannot be made responsible for the specific ways in which " socialist " economies were organised under " really existing socialism " .
As to the objectives of socialism , Marx was not the only thinker who wanted a society without exploitation and alienation , in which all human beings could fully realise their potentialities , but he expressed this aspiration more powerfully than anyone else , and his words retain the power to inspire .
However , Marx will not return as a political inspiration to the left until it is understood that his writings should not be treated as political programs , authoritative or otherwise , nor as descriptions of the actual situation of world capitalism today , but rather as guides to his way of understanding the nature of capitalist development .
Nor can or should we forget that he did not achieve a coherent and fully thought out presentation of his ideas , in spite of attempts by Engels and others to construct a volume II and III of Capital out of Marx 's manuscripts .
As the Grundrisse show , even a completed Capital would have formed only part of Marx 's own , perhaps excessively ambitious , original plan .
On the other hand , Marx will not return to the left until the current tendency among radical activists to turn anti-capitalism into anti-globalism is abandoned .
Globalisation exists , and , short of a collapse of human society , is irreversible .
Indeed , Marx recognised it as a fact and , as an internationalist , welcomed it , in principle .
What he criticised , and what we must criticise , was the kind of globalisation produced by capitalism .
M. M. One of Marx 's writings which has provoked the greatest interest amongst new readers and commentators is the Grundrisse .
Written between 1857 and 1858 , the Grundrisse is the first draft of Marx 's critique of political economy and , thus , also the initial preparatory work on Capital ; it contains numerous reflections on matters that Marx did not develop elsewhere in his incomplete oeuvre .
Why , in your opinion , are these manuscripts one of Marx 's writings which continue to provoke more debate than any other , in spite of the fact that he wrote them only to summarise the foundations of his critique of political economy ?
What is the reason for their persistent appeal ?
E. H. In my view the Grundrisse have made so large an international impact on the Marxian intellectual scene for two connected reasons .
They were virtually unpublished before the 1950s , and , as you say , contained a mass of reflections on matters that Marx did not develop elsewhere .
They were not part of the largely dogmatised corpus of orthodox Marxism in the world of Soviet socialism , yet Soviet socialism could not simply dismiss them .
They could therefore be used by Marxists who wanted to criticise orthodoxy or widen the scope of Marxist analysis by an appeal to a text which could not be accused of being heretical or anti-Marxist .
Hence the editions of the 1970s and 1980s ( well before the fall of the Berlin Wall ) continued to provoke debate largely because in these manuscripts
Marx raised important problems which were not considered in Capital , for instance , the questions raised in my preface to the volume of essays you collected [ Karl Marx 's Grundrisse .
Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy 150 Years Later , edited by M. Musto , London — New York : Routledge 2008 ; http://www.routledgeeconomics.com/books/Karl-Marxs-Grundrisse-isbn9780415437493].
M. M. In the preface to this book , written by various international experts to mark the 150th anniversary of its composition , you have written : " Perhaps this is the right moment to return to a study of the Grundrisse less constricted by the temporary considerations of leftwing politics between Nikita Khrushchev 's denunciation of Stalin and the fall of Mikhail Gorbachev " .
Moreover , to underline the enormous value of this text , you stated that the Grundrisse " contains analyses and insights , for instance about technology , that take Marx 's treatment of capitalism far beyond the nineteenth century , into the era of a society where production no longer requires mass labour , of automation , the potential of leisure , and the transformations of alienation in such circumstances .
It is the only text that goes some way beyond Marx 's own hints of the communist future in the German Ideology .
In a few words , it has been rightly described as Marx 's thought at its richest . "
Therefore , what might be the result of re-reading the Grundrisse today ?
E. H. There are probably not more than a handful of editors and translators who have full knowledge of this large and notoriously difficult mass of texts .
But a re-rereading , or rather reading , of them today could help us to rethink Marx : to distinguish what is general in Marx 's analysis of capitalism from what was specific to the situation of mid-nineteenth - century " bourgeois society " .
We cannot predict what conclusions from this analysis are possible and likely , only that they will certainly not command unanimous agreement .
M. M. To finish , one final question .
Why is it important today to read Marx ?
E. H . To anyone interested in ideas , whether a university student or not , it is patently clear that Marx is and will remain one of the great philosophical minds and economic analysts of the nineteenth century and , at his best , a master of passionate prose .
It is also important to read Marx because the world in which we live today cannot be understood without the influence that the writings of this man had on the twentieth century .
And finally , he should be read because , as he himself wrote , the world cannot be effectively changed unless it is understood -- and Marx remains a superb guide to understanding the world and the problems we must confront .

About the Book
Written between 1857 and 1858 , the Grundrisse is the first draft of Marx ’s critique of political economy and , thus , also the initial preparatory work on Capital .
Despite its editorial vicissitudes and late publication , Grundrisse contains numerous reflections on matters that Marx did not develop elsewhere in his oeuvre and is therefore extremely important for an overall interpretation of his thought .
In this collection , various international experts in the field , analysing the Grundrisse on the 150th anniversary of its composition , present a Marx in many ways radically different from the one who figures in the dominant currents of twentieth - century Marxism .
The book demonstrates the relevance of the Grundrisse to an understanding of Capital and of Marx ’s theoretical project as a whole , which , as is well known , remained uncompleted .
It also highlights the continuing explanatory power of Marxian categories for contemporary society and its present contradictions .
With contributions from such scholars as Eric Hobsbawm and Terrell Carver , and covering subject areas such as political economy , philosophy and Marxism , this book is likely to become required reading for serious scholars of Marx across the world .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- America 's out of control , drowning in debt , gorging : $ 75 trillion and getting worse .
Now we 're dumping Fannie and Freddie on America 's balance sheet .
Every year we pile trillions more on future generations .
Ca n't trust McCain ?
Obama ?
Time for new leadership !
The best qualified for president is the same great American hero we picked as our favorite write - in candidate for the 2006 elections : David Walker , former comptroller general , chief auditor of the U.S. Government Accounting Office for a decade before resigning last spring .
He is ready .
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Walker was the " voice of reason " in Washington while Congress and the White House kept wasting trillions like out - of - control drunks , digging America deeper into debt .
Nobody listened .
Politicians ignored Walker 's warnings , making matters worse as we went from a surplus of $ 5 trillion in 2000 to crushing debt that 's now $ 9.6 trillion .
Washington tuned out , so Walker went on the road , on the " campaign trail " so to speak , taking his fiscal - conservative message directly to the people in town - hall meetings with his " Fiscal Wake - up Tours , " where he spoke of a " fiscal cancer , " comparing America to Rome .
Now his message is a new film : " I.O.U.S.A. : One Nation .
Under Stress .
In Debt . "
Unfortunately , the film 's not a major Hollywood studio release .
Why ?
Even with co-stars like Warren Buffett and a " Saturday Night Live " skit with Steve Martin , it 'll bomb at the box office , go to video fast .
The 16 reviews I read will scare people away , not draw them in .
Movie - goers would rather see a horror film classic like " Halloween , " " Friday the 13th " or " Night of the Living Dead . "
Why ?
Because horror films are emotionally cathartic experiences .
When you leave the theater , the horror stays behind .
But with " I.O.U.S.A . "
America 's debt will haunt you for years .
It already totals about $ 150,000 for every single household .
Worse yet , it 's metastasizing $ 1.9 billion each and every day on the National Debt Clock .
So who will go see the film ?
Few :
Liberals .
Maybe a small contingent of lefties .
But they already know the story about America 's lethal addiction to living on borrowed money .
Maybe a small contingent of lefties .
But they already know the story about America 's lethal addiction to living on borrowed money .
Conservatives .
No way .
They actually love big deficits and big federal debt .
That money comes out of taxpayers ' wallets , pays for their wars and all the profitable deals with China and oil producers that make neocons personally rich .
No way .
They actually love big deficits and big federal debt .
That money comes out of taxpayers ' wallets , pays for their wars and all the profitable deals with China and oil producers that make neocons personally rich .
Main Street .
The other 95 % of Americans are too focused on their own personal problems ; gas , food , rent , foreclosures , inflation , teen pregnancies , credit - card fees , outsourced jobs , and so much more .
They 'll go to the new Bond film , or stay home and watch the new fall shows , like " Terminator , " " Prison Break " and " Fringe . "
Sorry folks , but while I recommend this new film starring Walker , it 's no " Dark Knight , " " Tropic Thunder " or " Ironman . "
If Congress turned a deaf ear to Walker 's " Fiscal Wake - up Tours , " this film wo n't work either .
Great message but doomed to the art - theater circuit .
So what will wake up America ?
Only one thing : A major disaster .
Another 9/11 attack ?
More likely another , bigger financial meltdown during the next presidential term , crippling an already weakened U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , set up by more leadership failures in Washington , driving America deeper into debt hell .
So here 's my adaptation of the 8 most " megahorror " debts to focus on : A format for a film festival highlighting the " The Megahorror Hits of American Debt : "
1. Horrors of Endless Massive War Debt
Vote for the war films symbolizing the horrors of America 's addiction to war debt : Think " Apocalypse Now " and " Platoon " or write in your choice .
Remember , Americans love war !
We love starting wars , spending 54 % of our tax money on war .
Iraq and Afghanistan wars cost about $ 12 billion a month .
Warning :
If we can't find bin Laden in hell or Pakistan , the odds are the Pentagon and neocons will bomb Iran to stimulate our war economy .
2. Horrors of Gluttonous , Addictive Oil Debt
My favorite horror film on our oil addiction is " Mad Max . "
In a post - apocalyptic world people are killing each other for a few gallons of gas .
America is just 5 % of the world , yet burns 25 % of the oil .
By 2050 the planet 's population will explode by 68 % , from 6.6 billion today to 9.6 billion , all competing with us , demanding more .
Peterson says global warming is the " first cousin " of energy addiction .
So the best horror film pick here is loosely based on Pentagon war studies : " The Day After Tomorrow , " a coming Ice Age .
3. Horrors of Trillions in Trade Deficits and Foreign Debt
Neocon dreams of globalization and free trade have become a nightmare .
America 's a new third - world debtor nation .
China and oil - producing countries own over half our debt , buy 70 % of new debt .
Foreigners own us .
Now we 're forced to sell them our best assets .
Expect re-regulation , nationalization pressures and more wars .
Best horror flick picks : Think Darth Vader commanding the Death Star in " Star Wars , " " Invasion of the Body Snatchers , " " The Alien . "
4. Horrors of Killer Social Security and Medicare Debt
The Social Security Trust Fund " is n't funded " and " ca n't be trusted . "
It 's a government - run Ponzi scheme .
You put in cash .
Washington puts in a paper IOU , then wastes your retirement cash to cover their current out - of - control deficits .
A scam .
Entitlements total about $ 75 trillion .
When 78 million baby boomers try to retire over the next few decades , no cash !
Watch out , the next generation will balk at paying boomers .
Best films revealing the horrors of government corruption : " All the President 's Men , " " The Bourne Ultimatum . "
5. Horrors of Cheap Money , Self - indulgent Consumerism , Zero Savings
Top films targeting this horror : " Barbarians at the Gate , " " Other People 's Money " and , of course , Oliver Stone 's " Wall Street , " where " greed is [ always ] good ! "
Give us cheap money , so we can indulge in our most immediate gratifications at the mall .
Unfortunately Main Street 's also trapped in this delusional get - rich - quick mindset that narrowly focuses on the next paycheck , quarterly earnings and annual bonus , never saving for an iffy future .
6. Horrors of Skyrocketing Health - care Debt
Best horror films here : " Thank You for Not Smoking , " " Sicko , " " Flatline , " " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . "
With 45 million uninsured , this is a disgrace , a total moral failure : Greed consumes Big Pharma and our insurers .
They steal from taxpayers with no -bid contracts .
While America 's health - care costs are over twice per capita of other developed countries , our longevity and health are no better , and getting worse with rising obesity rates .
7. Horror of a Failing Educational System Debting America 's Future
Here the biggest horrors are exposed on television :
The illiterates on Leno's Jay Walking , " Jeopardy " and " Are You Smarter Than a Fifth - Grader ? "
Asia awards more graduate degrees in critical technology areas , while half our kids in urban areas , a third overall , never graduate high school .
Our kids are unprepared to compete for fast - food jobs let alone with Asia .
8. Horrors of Failed Leaders Triggering Catastrophic Debt Meltdown
Best film : Hopefully a crisis will trigger a revival of " It 's a Wonderful Life , " wake us to what 's killing us from within , without totally destroying us .
As Nobel economist Milton Friedman put it in " Capitalism and Freedom , " his 1962 classic on conservative economics , that may be impossible : " Only a crisis -- actual or perceived -- produces real change " because in the aftermath of a crisis " the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable . "
But that 's high - risk :
In that worst - case scenario , our fate parallels the Rome of Caligula , decadent , vulnerable , ripe for a " Fiscal Armageddon , " and eventually overrun by foreigners .
Perhaps a better film to highlight the horrors of debt piled up by Washington 's current leaders : " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . "

In today ’s marketplace , having a college degree can make one more competitive for jobs and serve as a key to upward mobility .
The value of a college education goes beyond dollars and cents and building competency in a chosen discipline : there is an intrinsic value as well .
Perhaps this partially explains why millions of Americans forego common sense when picking college .
New Study Says Cost of College Is Not a Factor
According to a recent study by Sallie Mae , the country ’s leading education lender , cost is often not a factor when picking college .
“ 40 percent of families do not limit their search based on total expense . ”
Now , this would be fine if 40 % of families were financially solvent enough to truly bear the costs of any school their students chose .
However , students are increasingly being burdened with record levels of debts .
In fact , two - thirds of students graduate with some debt , with the average debt being $ 19,237 .
One - fourth of students will graduate with nearly $ 25,000 , and 10 % will graduate with greater than 35,000 .
The primary reason attending school has become so much more expensive over the last decade is that school - related expenses ( including tuition and fees ) rise at rates that far outpace inflation .
According to the College Board , tuition and fees have risen in 2007 at more than double the rate of inflation for both public and private schools .
Notwithstanding the fact that the inflation estimate is based on the consumer price index , which historically underestimates inflation by excluding gas and energy ( too volatile ) , the cost of going to school can still be staggering .
While the annual costs for a public school ( including tuition , room , and board ) averages $ 13,589 , the costs for a private school averages $ 32,307 .

An Emotional Decision With Financial Implications
Although it is true that selecting a college is at least partly an emotional decision , to not do a cost - benefit analysis for one of life ’s biggest expenses is not only careless , it can have tremendous financial implications for the family and the student .
Because of student loan debt , graduates sometimes delay starting families , have depression , fail to adequately contribute to investments , and unfortunately go bankrupt , etc .
Young adults account for the second fastest growing group filing for bankruptcy .
Moreover , the debt makes setting a good financial foundation all the more difficult for graduates in careers with low incomes , such as teachers and social workers .
To “ cope ” with the higher costs of schools , more students placing tuition and school - related expenses onto credit cards .
Currently , credit cards account for about 18 % of tuition payments .
Unfortunately , due the student loan crunch , this is only expected to increase as more private lenders get out of the market .
Do Your Own Cost - Benefit Analysis When Selecting A School
College can be a fabulous investment , but like any investment , one should make sure that he or she is getting a good deal .
Just because a student can go to a private school that costs 3 - 4 times more than the local public university does not mean that it ’s 3 - 4 times better than the public school nor does it mean that the career and income will be 3 - 4 times better for the privately - educated graduate .
Some schools , such as the University of Arizona , have designed programs teaching students about the costs and benefits of taking out student loans and the long - term impact borrowing has on life decisions .
However , if one ’s school does not and he or she is one of the two - thirds of students without enough money to cover school , help him or her make a wise choice .
Carefully consider the financial impact of school selection .
An excessive debt burden may change the course of one ’s life just as much as the anticipated degree .

I 'm sorry to tell you that it was not former president Clinton " who made up the whole ' ownership society ' thing which Bush agreed with . "
Writings from the Cato Institute , in this case , tell us that " The concept of " ownership society " has been embraced since the time of Aristotle and has found adherents among such thinkers as Thomas Aquinas , John Locke , and most pertinent to today 's debate , the American Founders .
The central tenet of the ownership society is that we tend to take best care of the things we own , and through which we exercise our liberty ; property rights inspire people to act responsibly , to treat one another with dignity and respect , and to create wealth for themselves and others .
In today 's political debate , the concept of the " ownership society " is most applicable in three areas of public policy : Social Security , health care , and education . "
It is a strong and philosophically sound concept and most certainly not one that George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush could have conceived .

They have not taken away the chapter 7 rights of an individual to clean the slate , as it were , under certain circumstances .
As to my overall view of George W. Bush I can only say that the weapons of mass destruction lie within him and not in Iraq as we all now know .
He blamed his faulty intelligence people for that one which only serves to cement my belief in the trickle down theory .
He lied over and over again to get us into a war we fell for because of 9/11 and what do we have to show for it all ?

PUT the pedal to the metal in the XH - 150 — a souped - up Saturn Vue — and watch the instruments .
Sure enough , the speedometer shoots up in a satisfactory way .
But an adjacent dial shows something else : the amount of charge in the car 's capacitors is decreasing .
Ease off the accelerator and as the speedo winds down the capacitors charge up again .
Such a capacitor gauge could become a common sight on the dashboards of the future .
A capacitor can discharge and recharge far faster than a battery , making it ideal both for generating bursts of speed and for soaking up the energy collected by regenerative braking .
AFS Trinity , a company based in Washington state , has turned that insight into a piece of equipment that it has fitted into an otherwise standard production model as an experiment .
The result — the XH - 150 — was unveiled at this year 's Detroit motor show .
In fact the XH - 150 is a three - way hybrid , employing a petrol engine and conventional lithium - ion batteries as well as its special capacitors .
An overnight charge gives it an all - electric range of 40 miles ( 60 km ) , after which the petrol engine needs to come into play .
AFS Trinity says the vehicle is capable of more than 80 mph and returns the equivalent of 150 miles per gallon ( more than 60 km / litre ) in normal use .
Edward Furia , the firm 's chief executive , reckons the extra kit would add around $ 8,700 to the price of a petrol - only vehicle were it put into mass production .
This , however , may be only the start .
Eventually , the so - called ultracapacitors on which the XH - 150 is based may supplant rather than merely supplement a car 's batteries .
And if that happens , a lot of other batteries may be for the chop , too .
For it is possible that the long and expensive search for a better battery to power the brave , new , emission - free electrical world has been following the wrong trail .
Full capacity
A traditional capacitor stores electricity as static charges , positive and negative , on two electrodes that are separated by an insulator .
This works best when the electrodes are parallel with each other , which means they need to have smooth surfaces .
The amount of charge that can be stored depends on the surface area of the electrodes , the strength and composition of the insulation between them , and how close they are together .
If the electrodes are then connected by a wire , a current will flow from one to the other .
A battery , by contrast , stores what is known as an electrochemical potential .
Its two electrodes are made of different chemicals — ones that will release energy when they react .
But because the electrodes are physically separated from one another their chemical constituents can react only by remote control .
This is able to happen because the space between the electrodes is filled with a material called an electrolyte which allows ions ( electrically charged atoms , or groups of atoms ) to pass from one electrode to the other and thus combine with their chemical complements .
To compensate for this movement of ions , electrons have to move in the opposite direction — and if the electrodes are connected by a conducting wire running through a useful circuit , that is the route they will take .
Chemical electrodes of this sort can store a lot more energy than the static electricity of a capacitor .
But the whole process of ion movement and chemical reaction is slower than the movement of electrons in a capacitor .
Hence the different advantages of the two storage systems : capacitors give speed ; batteries , endurance .
The reason ultracapacitors may be able to bridge the gap between speed and endurance is that , like batteries , they use ions and an electrolyte rather than simply relying on the static charges .
In an ultracapacitor , positively charged ions gather on the surface of the negatively charged electrode and negative ions on the surface of the positive electrode .
Since the ions do not actually combine with the atoms of the electrodes , no chemical reaction is involved .
The ionic layers are also very close indeed to the surfaces of the electrodes , and obviously run parallel with them whatever their shape .
This , in turn , means clever engineering can increase the surface area ( and thus the storage capacity ) without increasing the volume .
And that gives endurance without sacrificing speed .
Existing ultracapacitors get their extra surface area by using electrodes coated with carbon and etched to produce holes , rather like a sponge .
This gives about 5 % of the storage capacity of a battery .
But Joel Schindall and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology think they can do better than that using nanoengineering .
Instead of digging holes in the electrodes , they are coating them with a forest of carbon nanotubes , each five nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) wide .
This , they hope , will push capacitors to 50 % of a battery 's storage capacity .
A different approach has been taken by EEStor , a Texan firm that has developed a capacitor it claims can store “ very high ” levels of energy using a special insulator called barium titanate rather than an electrolyte .
Its “ Electrical Energy Storage Units ” will go into production later this year .
EEStor recently signed a deal to supply Lockheed Martin , a big defence contractor , which wants to use the storage units in rugged packs that will power a variety of military and security equipment .
EEStor also envisages employing its devices to build an “ energy bank ” to store off - peak power and release it when demand is high .
One use of such a bank , the firm suggests , could be the rapid charging of electric cars — which would , of course , also be fitted with capacitors .
That would remove a big obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles in general — that it takes so long to refuel them .
If a driver could pull into an electrical filling station and top up his capacitors as rapidly as he can now replenish his petrol tank it would both increase the effective range of all - electric vehicles and decrease resistance to buying them in the first place .
At least one firm is backing the logic of this argument in its showrooms rather than just in prototypes .
Ian Clifford , the chief executive of the Zenn Motor Company in Toronto , has done a deal with EEStor to replace the lead - acid batteries in the small , low - speed electric cars that his firm sells for urban use .
Mr Clifford reckons that ultracapacitors will transform his vehicles and enable them to be used on motorways as well as city streets .
Whether ultracapacitors really will take over the market now dominated by batteries , rather than merely supplementing them in it , remains to be seen — for batteries themselves are also getting better .
They do have a chance , though , of being one of the 21st century 's disruptive technologies .
And even if they do not replace batteries entirely , the world will surely be seeing more of them in applications which need that little bit of extra oomph from time to time .
After all , as Dr Schindall points out , animals use two types of muscle fibre : one for endurance and one for rapid movements .
So it could make sense for machines to do the same .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Five Republican state legislators filed a lawsuit in Alaska state court on Tuesday seeking to block Democrats from investigating whether vice - presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power in firing a state trooper feuding with her family .

The lawsuit claims the probe into Palin ’s July firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan is unconstitutional and politically tainted because it is being managed by Democrats trying to undermine Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Palin , his running mate .
Monegan contends he was dismissed because he failed to fire a state trooper who had been involved in a contentious divorce from Palin ’s sister .
The investigation was authorized unanimously in July by a bipartisan legislative committee .
Palin , through McCain campaign officials , contends that Monegan was fired for insubordination .
If the investigation is not halted , the attorney representing the five lawmakers said , at the least the two Democrats and Obama supporters on the committee and special investigator Steve Branchflower should be removed from the case .
Branchflower , a former state prosecutor , would have a conflict of interest , the suit argues , because he has worked with Monegan when he was a police chief in Anchorage .
The suit calls for the investigation to be delayed until at least after the November election .
“ The only reason to complete this investigation before November 4 is to try to impact the outcome of the election , ” said Kevin Clarkson , an attorney representing the lawmakers .
An attorney who pursued a similar case 30 years ago predicted the lawsuit will be unsuccessful .
“ If there ’s an issue about who should be in charge , the court ’s not going to get involved .
It ’s a political question .
It ’s not a legal question , ” said Doug Pope , who argued unsuccessfully on behalf of a former state House speaker who was ousted in a 1970s legislative coup .
The legislature has the right to investigate the executive branch at any time , so the argument that the body lacks authority is “ a red herring , ” according to Pope .

I attended Aaron Boodman ’s session on Google Gears , here at Developer Day in London .
Boodman is an engineer on the Gears team .
He gave us a quick tour of the main features , most of which was already familiar to me , but I picked up a couple of interesting things .
He told us that Google hopes Gears will eventually become a standard part of HTML , implemented by every browser .
Some parts of Gears just implement things that browsers should do already , such as the ability to upload multiple files in one operation .
Boodman would also like to see Gears enabled by default for all sites , rather than being enabled per-site as it is at the moment .
Or is it ?
What I had not realised is most of the Gears API is already accessible to any site , even if it is not in your “ Gears enabled ” list .
It is only certain features , such as the ability to create a local database , which require specific consent .
That raises the question of security .
I asked about risks like sites creating malicious desktop shortcuts disguised as good ones .
Boodman says that creating a shortcut always raises a dialog so the user should spot this .
What about reputable sites infected with malicious code ?
Boodman figures that if you are browsing such a site you are in trouble anyway .
Gears is built into Chrome and part of a consistent Google theme : upgrading the browser to make it a better platform for applications .

What does it say about Sarah Palin that in her first big appearance before a national audience - her introduction as McCain 's running mate - she decided to flat out lie about her accomplishments ?
I told Congress -- I told Congress , " Thanks , but no thanks , " on that bridge to nowhere .
If our state wanted a bridge , I said we 'd build it ourselves .
Well , it 's always , though , safer in politics to avoid risk , to just kind of go along with the status quo .
But I did n't get into government to do the safe and easy things .
A ship in harbor is safe , but that 's not why the ship is built .
Politics is n't just a game of competing interests and clashing parties .
The people of America expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons .
She did that ?
Well , no .
When told that Congress had stripped funding for the bridge , she said she was still in favor of Congressional assistance for that and other Alaskan projects .
And when that assistance did n't materialize , she got all sour - grapes about it .
When she finally canceled the $ 400 million project , Palin lamented the fact that Congress was not more forthcoming with federal funding .
She said in a statement at the time : Despite the work of our congressional delegation , we are about $ 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project , and it ’s clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island .
Despite her claims to be a reformer and " govern with integrity " , Palin has kept up her relationship with indicted Seanator Ted Stevens , the father of the bridge to nowhere .
He endorsed her for Governor in 2006 and , on July 2 , 2008 , Stevens and Palin held a joint press conference on energy issues .
As Steven 's hugged Palin she said " I have great respect for the Senator ...
He needs to be heard across America .
His voice , his experience , his passion needs to be heard across America -- so that Alaska can contribute more . "
Contribute more to what ?
America 's prison population ?
Republican coffers ?
What ?
Now , both John McCain and Lindsay Graham are repeating Palin 's claims .
In response to Graham , George Stephanopoulos told him " But Senator , she turned against that , only she campaigned for it in her 2006 race , and turned against it in 2007 only after it became a national joke . "
Then there 's the shadow governor , Todd Palin .
He sits in on legislative meetings dealing with oil company negotiations while he 's still working for BP .
He took a very short hiatus back when Palin was first elected Governor but returned quickly to work citing the need for the " extra income " .
The Governor of Alaska pulls down a six figure salary and the Palin 's own three houses - one residential and two recreational .
Oh , I get it now - contribute more to lying to the American public .
To serve for the wrong reasons .
Oops .
Bad timing for one of McCain ’s top economic advisers to be penning an op ed in the Washington Post lecturing Americans to suck it up and stop exaggerating ( rhymes with whining ) about how bad the economy is .
This guy looks like an idiot .
And he makes McCain look like an idiot .
I sure hope tomorrow is economy day in Obama land .
Just as importantly , consider the fact that McCain ’s top economic advisers are clearly divorced from the reality of what ’s really happening to our economy .
Does that sound familiar to anyone ?
John McCain trying to call black white .
Trying to peddle lies as truth .
Whether he ’s attacking Obama , praising Palin , or trying to convince Americans that the economy is just swell and they ’re nuts to think otherwise , John McCain has decided that lying to you is the best way to win the election .
Either that , or McCain has lost his mind .
And let ’s not forget , McCain already admitted that he knows nothing about the economy .
An inexperienced economic novice who only cares about fighting ( and starting ) wars .
What a great man to pick as our president with the economy on the brink .
( Chris wrote more about McCain ’s idiotic economics adviser earlier today , as did Joe about the exploding financial crisis . )
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Washington
Mutual ’s plans for another big write - down , along with its declaration that it has enough capital to survive , soothed some investors and analysts who feared the housing crisis might cripple the lender .

The largest U.S. savings and loan institution said late on Thursday it expected to set aside $ 4.5 billion for credit losses this quarter , down from the second quarter ’s $ 5.9 billion , and write off $ 2.7 billion for bad loans .
WaMu WM.N made its unusual disclosure six weeks before it planned to report earnings to calm investor fears following a 34 percent in its shares in the four days since it named Alan Fishman as its new chief executive .
The outlook suggested that Fishman will report the thrift ’s fourth straight quarterly loss .
Analysts on average expect a loss of $ 1.22 per share , or roughly $ 1.24 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Washington Mutual has said home loan losses could reach $ 19 billion through 2011 , and many analysts believe the thrift might eventually be forced to find a buyer or raise more capital .
WaMu raised $ 7 billion this year from investors led by private equity firm TPG Inc TPG .UL .
At least four analysts cut their share price targets for Washington Mutual .
But Howard Shapiro of Fox - Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia
Waller said the thrift ’s disclosures on credit , deposits , liquidity and fee income “ should calm some of the hysteria surrounding the stock and the company ’s future . ”
And Goldman Sachs & Co ’s Brian Foran , who also cut his price target , upgraded the thrift to “ neutral ” from “ sell , ” saying the projections “ provide a glimmer of a silver lining that the worst may be seen .
The main risk remains that deposits begin to be withdrawn quickly . ”
Meanwhile , there were conflicting reports on Friday as to whether Washington Mutual had revived talks to be acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , the third - largest U.S. bank .
The American Banker trade paper first reported that JPMorgan was in advanced talks to acquire WaMu .
An industry source later told Reuters : “ They are in advanced talks . ”
But business channel CNBC reported that no talks were being held , while two other sources familiar with the situation later told Reuters that talks were not ongoing .
Shares of Washington Mutual closed down 10 cents at $ 2.73 on the New York Stock Exchange , after trading in a range of $ 2.43 to $ 3.29 .
The shares fell 36 percent this week , and have slid 92 percent in the last year .
On Thursday , they dropped below $ 2 for the first time since 1990 .
“ RELIABLE ” FUNDING
In its outlook , WaMu said retail deposits as of August 31 were “ essentially unchanged ” from $ 143.6 billion at the start of the year .
This , however , suggested a decline from $ 148.3 billion as of June 30 , though the thrift is offering yields as high as 5 percent on one - year certificates of deposit .
Washington Mutual also said it had $ 50 billion of liquidity from “ reliable funding sources . ”
This language was reminiscent of language that Countrywide Financial Corp , then the largest U.S. mortgage lender , used in August 2007 when it said it could access $ 46.2 billion of “ highly reliable ” short - term financing .
Less than two weeks later , it drew down an $ 11.5 billion credit line .
Countrywide was bought in July by Bank of America Corp BAC.N .
In its downgrade , Moody ’s said Washington Mutual was suffering from “ reduced financial flexibility , deteriorating asset quality , and expected franchise erosion . ”
Fitch Ratings also downgraded the thrift .
“ The company is suffering form a lack of confidence in the debt markets , ” said Craig Emrick , a Moody ’s senior credit officer , on a conference call .
He nevertheless added : “ I see no reason why this entity ca n’t operate over the medium term with its current rating . ”
Fishman succeeded Kerry Killinger , who was ousted last weekend after 18 years at the bank ’s helm .

Pirating games may get you in as much legal trouble as exchanging music on peer - to - peer networks .
Two gaming sites have uncovered evidence that Activision is going around suing pirates , taking an aggressive , case - by - case approach much like the RIAA and MPAA .
According to a report by Edge Online , Activision has sued a New York resident for allegedly copying Call of Duty 3 for the Xbox 360 and other , unnamed games .
Activision seeks $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 in damages " for each infringement of each copyrighted videogame . "
After looking into the issue , GamePolitics uncovered six other instances of piracy - related Activision lawsuits .
Settlements in those cases ranged from $ 1,000 to $ 100,000 , the site says , adding that five of the six defendants lacked representation .
Why have n’t more tongues been wagging about these cases ?
Apparently , the settlements forbid defendants from making " any public statements that are inconsistent with any term of this Stipulation to Judgment and Permanent Injunction . "
GamePolitics points out that the clause " would make anyone think twice about discussing the case . "
Of course , we ’re not entirely surprised to see members of the gaming industry getting litigious .
Since last year , several high - profile game studios like Epic Games , id Software , Crytek , and Infinity Ward have sounded off about game piracy on the PC .
Strangely , however , all of the aforementioned lawsuits seem to have been about console games .
( Thanks to Shacknews for the tip . )
Update :
The lawsuits may not be related to file sharing .
GamePolitics has received a message from one of Activision ’s attorneys , who says his law firm has " never filed any litigation against a file - sharer on behalf of Activision . "

The magical money machine in Washington has produced yet another wonder of fiduciary slight of hand .
This time it was Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson taking his turn in front of the crowd , inspiring awe as he pulled close to a trillion dollars out of his hat .
Like alchemists and sorcerers of old , Paulson wishes to conjure value from nothing .
The aim is to transform tottering mortgage holdings into secure assets by merely changing what name appears at the top of the balance sheet unfortunate enough to have them as a constituent part .
If the risk of mortgage defaults was there before , it does n't disappear because the pea has turned up under another cup .
The risks now reside with the U.S. taxpayers , and the true magnitude will only become apparent over the next several years .
But the show does n't end there .
The massive amount of new debt required to pay for the bailout has effects of its own .
At any given time , a limited amount of capital is available for investment .
Private firms and governments at all levels vie for those scarce resources .
Because people tend to believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that the United States government is not apt to default on its obligations , U.S. debt securities will often find buyers at the expense of other entities ' offerings .
This crowding - out effect reduces the funds firms could use for expansion , research , or other productive activities .
With recessionary pressures building , anything that would hamper business is likely to create a protracted downturn .
The audience wants to be thrilled , but not like that .
So how will Paulson the Great avoid the crowding - out calamity ?
He 'll avoid it by turning to his compatriot , Ben Bernanke .
Bernanke is the chief swami at the Federal Reserve , or the Fed , for short .
The Fed is an institution shrouded in mystery .
From its paranormal inception in 1913 to today , it has been the man behind the curtain through ups and downs .
Bernanke can help reduce crowding out by making it appear there is more capital to be had than really exists .
He 'll accomplish this by pumping new money into the economy .
Like pixie dust , this added liquidity will send signals indicating economic activity can soar as if the savings were really there to bolster it .
Unfortunately , it will be an illusion .
Absent the real savings necessary for economic growth , much of any induced growth will be short - lived .
Monetary inflation sends false signals to the market , which cluster and manifest in the boom - bust cycle the Fed has been causing for years .
The very bust Paulson and Bernanke are trying to avert now is the result of the extended boom inflation wrought .
Attempts to delay the downturn , which is a readjustment to reality , will heighten the severity of the inevitable slump .
Furthermore , foreigners may not be as smitten by the prestidigitating pair .
Monetary inflation is , by definition , a weakening of the currency .
Rising prices in our country are but one effect .
Increased pressures to avoid holding dollars or dollar - denominated assets are another .
The U.S. dollar has acted as the reserve exchange medium for half a century .
That preeminence masked the full effects of prior inflation because excess dollars were absorbed into overseas accounts and held .
Confidence in the United States kept the status quo .
If that confidence lapses and dollar positions are liquidated , then the house of cards will fall .
The great unknown is how much U.S. government debt it will take to shake the faith .
Officially , the debt will exceed $ 11 trillion by next year .
That does n't take into account potential mortgage defaults and present unfunded obligations .
Once confidence evaporates , no amount of hypnotic prowess will be able to rekindle it .
Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke are summoning the two most frequently used spirits governments call upon to bend reality : debt and inflation .
Neither option is singly beneficial .
Together they are toxic .
The antidote is not more smoke and mirrors ; it is instead a return to sound money and fiscal responsibility .
Concerns about a slowing economy and rising inflation pushed oil prices down sharply for a second day on Wednesday , an unusual dip in the oil price rally that began more than six years ago .
The two - day decline totaled more than $ 10.50 a barrel , but analysts cautioned that it was still unclear how far prices would fall and that the respite may be temporary .
The drop in oil price contributed to a jump on Wall Street , with most major markets rising more than 2.5 percent .
Investors were also buoyed by news that Wells Fargo planned to increase its dividend , easing some concerns about the stability of banks .
The drop in oil was also caused by new evidence that Americans were driving less because of gas prices , which hit a record of $ 4.11 a gallon , according to a nationwide survey by the motorist group AAA .

A year after taking power , in June 1934 , Adolf Hitler made his first visit abroad — to his idol Benito Mussolini in Venice .
Babbling on incessantly about Mein Kampf and the Negroid strain in Mediterranean peoples , the Fhrer made a dismal impression .
“ What a clown this Hitler is , ” Mussolini told an aide .
Two weeks later , Hitler executed the Roehm purge and murdered scores of old Stormtrooper comrades .
In late July , Austrian Nazis , attempting a coup , assassinated Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss , a friend of Mussolini whose wife and child were then his guests .
Il Duce ordered four divisions to the Brenner Pass and flew to Vienna to vent his rage and disgust with Hitler .
He called a summit at Stresa with Britain and France to agree on military action should Hitler make any new move in violation of Versailles .
At the time , however , Il Duce was also plotting revenge on Abyssinia for a bloody border clash with Italian Somaliland .
Mussolini thought his Allies would understand if he invaded the Ogaden to add an African colony to his new Roman Empire , just as the British and French had so often done in previous decades .
Mussolini miscalculated .
Morally outraged , Britain and France went before the League of Nations and had sanctions imposed on Italy that were too weak to defeat her but punitive enough to insult her .
Friendless , isolated and condemned as an aggressor by Europe , Italy and Mussolini had nowhere to turn now but Hitler ’s Germany .
Thus , over the fate of an Abyssinian slave empire , Britain drove her faithful World War I ally into the arms of a Nazi dictator Mussolini loathed and had wished to confront beside Britain .
And Abyssinia was overrun .
Are we making the same mistake in the Caucasus ?
Mikheil Saakashvili started this war with his barrage attack and occupation of South Ossetia .
Russia ’s war of retribution was far less violent or excessive than the U.S. bombing of Serbia for 78 days over Kosovo , or our unprovoked war on Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , which has brought death to scores of thousands , or Israel ’s 35 days of bombing of Lebanon for a border skirmish with Hezbollah .
Yet , declared John McCain of Russia , “ In the 21st century , nations do n’t invade other nations . ”
Even Dick Cheney must have guffawed .
Russia must get out now , adds Bush , for South Ossetia and Abkhazia belong to a sovereign Georgia .
But when did Bush demand that Israel get off the Golan Heights or withdraw from the birthplace of Jesus , which Israelis have occupied for 41 years , as he demands that Russia get out of the birthplace of Joseph Stalin , which Russia has occupied for two weeks ?
As Israel was provoked in 1967 , so , too , was Russia provoked .
Russians died in Saakashvili ’s attack , as American died in Pancho Villa ’s raid on New Mexico in 1916 .
We sent “ Black Jack ” Pershing , future Gen. George Patton and a U.S. army 300 miles into Mexico to kill Villa .
Was this proportionate ?
If we proceed on a course of isolating Russia from the West , keeping her out of the World Trade Organization , throwing her out of the G - 8 and ending cooperation with NATO , where do we think Russia will go ?
Where did Il Duce go , when he was excommunicated from the West ?
Condi Rice compares Vladimir Putin ’s action in Georgia to Leonid Brezhnev ’s crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 .
She raced to Warsaw to ink a deal to put 10 anti-missile missiles and U.S. Patriot missiles manned by Americans into Poland .
Does the Stanford provost have any idea where the end of this road lies , upon which she and Bush have started the United States ?
What do we do if Russia responds to our Patriots in Poland with the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft system in Iran and Syria ?
If the United States intends to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO and arm them to fight Russia , why should Russia not dissolve the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe and move her tank armies into Belarus and up to the borders of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania ?
Would we send U.S. troops into the Baltic republics to signal that we will fight Russia to honor our NATO war guarantees ?
Which NATO allies would fight alongside us against a nuclear - armed Russia ?
If we bring Ukraine into NATO , what do we do if Russified east Ukraine secedes and Russia sends troops to back the rebels ?
Do we send warships into Russia ’s bathtub , the Black Sea , and commit to fight as long as it takes to restore Ukraine ’s territorial integrity ?
In March 1939 , Britain pledged to declare war and fight Germany to the death to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Poland .
How did that one turn out for Britain and Poland ?
Before we start down the road of isolating and encircling Russia with weak NATO allies , let us think through Gen. Petraeus ’ question in 2003 about Iraq , “ Tell me , how does this thing end ? ”
But , then , these folks never seem to think anything through .

The Best of Patrick J. Buchanan
Nearly 40 percent of fish species in North American streams , rivers and lakes are now in jeopardy , according to the most detailed evaluation of the conservation status of freshwater fishes in the last 20 years .
The 700 fishes now listed represent a staggering 92 percent increase over the 364 listed as " imperiled " in the previous 1989 study published by the American Fisheries Society .
Researchers classified each of the 700 fishes listed as either vulnerable ( 230 ) , threatened ( 190 ) , or endangered ( 280 ) .
In addition , 61 fishes are presumed extinct .
The new report , published in Fisheries , was conducted by a U.S. Geological Survey - led team of scientists from the United States , Canada and Mexico , who examined the status of continental freshwater and diadromous ( those that migrate between rivers and oceans ) fish .
" Freshwater fish have continued to decline since the late 1970s , with the primary causes being habitat loss , dwindling range and introduction of non-native species , " said Mark Myers , director of the USGS .
" In addition , climate change may further affect these fish . "
Most Vulnerable Groups
The groups of fish most at risk are the highly valuable salmon and trout of the Pacific Coast and western mountain regions ; minnows , suckers and catfishes throughout the continent ; darters in the Southeastern United States ; and pupfish , livebearers , and goodeids , a large , native fish family in Mexico and the Southwestern United States .
Nearly half of the carp and minnow family and the Percidae ( family of darters , perches and their relatives ) are in jeopardy .
Fish families important for sport or commercial fisheries also had many populations at risk .
More than 60 percent of the salmon and trout had at least one population or subspecies in trouble , while 22 percent of sunfishes — which includes the well - known species such as black bass , bluegill and rock bass — were listed .
Even one of the most popular game species in the United States , striped bass , has populations on the list .

Regions with the Most Troubled Fish
Regions with especially notable numbers of troubled fish include the Southeastern United States , the mid-Pacific coast , the lower Rio Grande and basins in Mexico that do not drain to the sea .
Hotspots of regional biodiversity and greatest levels of endangerment are the Tennessee ( 58 fishes ) , Mobile ( 57 ) , and the southeastern Atlantic Slope river systems ( 34 ) .
The Pacific central valley , western Great Basin , Rio Grande and rivers of central Mexico also have high diversity and numbers of fish in peril , according to the report .
Many of the troubled fish are restricted to only a single drainage .
" Human populations have greatly expanded in many of these watersheds , compounding negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems , " noted Howard Jelks , a USGS researcher and the senior author of the paper .
Degree of Trouble
Of fish on the 1989 imperiled list , 89 percent are either still listed with the same conservation status or have become even more at risk .
Only 11 percent improved in status or were delisted .
The authors emphasized that improved public awareness and proactive management strategies are needed to protect and recover these aquatic treasures .
" Fish are not the only aquatic organisms undergoing precipitous declines , " said USGS researcher Noel Burkhead , a lead author on the report and the chair of the AFS Endangered Species Committee .
" Freshwater crayfishes , snails and mussels are exhibiting similar or even greater levels of decline and extinction . "
The authors noted that the list was based on the best biological information available .
" We believe this report will provide national and international resource managers , scientists and the conservation community with reliable information to establish conservation , management and recovery priorities , " said Stephen Walsh , another lead author and USGS researcher .
This is the third compilation of imperiled , freshwater and diadromous fishes of North America prepared by the American Fisheries Society 's Endangered Species Committee .

TIRDZNISI , Georgia ( Reuters ) - Russia accused Georgia on Saturday of seeking bloody adventures by trying to retake its breakaway region of South Ossetia and defended its own military campaign to stop it .
Pro-western Georgia earlier called for a ceasefire after Moscow ’s bombers widened an offensive to force Tbilisi ’s troops back out of the region in the Caucasus mountains .
“ Russia ’s actions in South Ossetia are totally legitimate , ” Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said , visiting an adjacent region of Russia to which thousands of refugees have fled .
U.S. President George W. Bush urged Moscow to stop bombing immediately , saying it marked a dangerous escalation .
Russian officials said the death toll in fighting that began on Thursday stood at 2,000 .
Georgian officials said that on their side , 129 people had been killed and 748 injured .
Russia said it had seized the rebel capital Tskhinvali but Georgia denied this .
The Moscow - backed rebels contradicted each other , one leader saying Georgians had been beaten back , but another that “ The city has been lost .
We have been betrayed . ”
Russian state TV reported a five - hour battle outside Tskhinvali but said the outcome was uncertain .
Current European Union president France urged Russia to accept Georgia ’s truce offer .
“ It ( the EU presidency ) demands an immediate ceasefire .
It welcomes the offer of the ceasefire from Georgia and expects from Russia that it will immediately accept such a ceasefire . ”
A senior U.S. official echoed that call , saying Russia had used disproportionate force in the conflict .
Britain said an EU - U.S. delegation would head to Georgia to try to broker a truce .
The fighting threatens oil and gas pipelines seen as crucial in the West in a volatile region where instability could well spread .
Georgia said Russian planes had targeted a vital pipeline that carries oil to the West from Asia via neighboring Turkey but had missed .
Russia ’s military action dramatically intensified its long - running stand - off with Georgia that has sparked alarm in the West and led to angry exchanges reminiscent of the Cold War .
NATO ASPIRATIONS RANKLE
Putin said Georgia ’s bid to join the Western alliance NATO -- anathema to Moscow -- was part of the problem .
“ Georgia ’s aspiration to join NATO ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures , ” he said , demanding Tbilisi halt its “ aggression ” .
Russian troops poured into South Ossetia on Friday , hours after Georgia launched a major offensive aimed at restoring control over the province .
Russia is the main backer of South Ossetian separatists and the majority of the population , ethnically distinct from Georgians , have been given Russian passports .
“ I call for an immediate ceasefire , ” Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said earlier in Tbilisi .
“ Russia has launched a full - scale military invasion of Georgia . ”
He accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians .
Putin said more than 30,000 refugees from South Ossetia had fled over the border in the past 36 hours .
Russian officials said two of Moscow ’s warplanes had been shot down , 13 soldiers killed and 70 wounded .

Abkhazia , another pro-Russian enclave on Georgia ’s Black Sea coast which , like South Ossetia , has rejected Tbilisi ’s rule for many years , said its forces had begun an operation to drive out Georgian forces , possibly opening a second front .
U.N. officials said Abkhazia had asked the world body to withdraw military observers from a disputed gorge where the Georgians are .
Russian jets carried out up to five raids on mostly military targets around the Georgian town of Gori , close to the conflict zone in South Ossetia , a Reuters reporter at the scene said .
At least one bomb hit an apartment block , killing five people .
A woman knelt in the street and screamed over the body of a dead man as the bombed apartment block burned nearby .
Another old woman covered in blood stared into the distance and a man knelt by the road , his head in his hands .
“ The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia .
They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis , ” Bush said at the Olympics in Beijing .

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told Bush by phone the only solution was for Georgian troops to quit the conflict zone .
“ We have not received through any channels any appeal from the Georgian leadership to the president of Russia , ” a Kremlin official said .
STATE OF WAR
Georgia ’s parliament approved a state of war across the country for the next 15 days , while Russia accused the West of contributing to the violence by supplying Georgia with arms .
Russian accused Ukraine -- like Georgia a former Soviet republic now seeking NATO and EU membership -- of encouraging Tbilisi to carry out “ ethnic cleansing ” in South Ossetia .
Russia , which sent in tanks to back the South Ossetians , said its forces had “ liberated ” the enclave ’s capital , but Georgia said Tskhinvali was under its complete control .
The city could be seen shrouded in valley mist from the higher - up village of Tirdznisi , in the Georgian - controlled part of South Ossetia around 10 km ( six miles ) away .
“ The town is destroyed .
There are many casualties , many wounded , ” Russian journalist Zaid Tsarnayev told Reuters from Tskhinvali .
In Tbilisi , people were nervous but defiant .
Most supported Saakashvili but had been shocked by the Russian reaction .
“ To fight Russia is crazy , ” said music studio owner Giga Kvenetadze , 30 .
“ But I do support Saakashvili ...
And what Russia is doing is wrong .
They must stop . ”
Georgia was planning to bring its Iraq contingent of 2,000 soldiers home as soon as possible .
The U.N. Security Council met on Saturday to discuss the conflict for the third time in three days but , with Russia a veto - wielding member , was again too split to issue a unanimous call for a ceasefire , diplomats said .
European countries once in the Soviet sphere condemned Russia in language that also harked back to the Cold War .
“ The European Union and NATO must take up the initiative and oppose the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of Europe , ” the presidents of Poland , Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia said in a joint statement .
Mr Glass grabbed a grinning Gordon Brown by his sleeve A campaigner against Heathrow Airport 's third runway has attempted to glue himself to Gordon Brown at a Downing Street reception .
Dan Glass , a member of Plane Stupid , was about to receive an award from the prime minister when he stuck out his superglued hand and touched his sleeve .
Plane Stupid says Mr Glass , from north London , then " glued his hand " to Mr Brown 's jacket as he shook his hand .
But Downing Street said there had been " no stickiness of any significance " .
' Stick to promises ' Plane Stupid recently gained publicity by mounting a protest on the roof of Parliament .
Spokesman Graham Thompson said Mr Glass - a 24 - year - old post - graduate student at Strathclyde University - had smuggled a small amount of glue through Downing Street security checks in his underwear at about 1700 BST .
He met the prime minister during the reception at about 1830 BST .
He was just grinning about it .
He did n't seem to take me seriously
Dan Glass , protester Mr Thompson said his organisation was attempting to make Mr Brown " stick to his environmental promises " .
Downing Street confirmed an exchange had taken place but denied that Mr Glass had glued himself to the prime minister .
" There may have been something sticky on his hands but it was only for a few seconds that he touched the prime minister , " a spokesman said .
" There was no stickiness of any significance . "
He added : " This was certainly not seen as a serious protest .
It was very light - hearted .
This was not a serious incident . "
' It really hurt '
Speaking afterwards , Mr Glass said : " My left hand was covered in superglue and I stuck it to his sleeve .
" I just glued myself to him and after 20 seconds he tore my hand off - it really hurt .
He had to give it a couple of tugs before it came away .
" He was just grinning about it .
He did n't seem to take me seriously . "
After the incident Mr Glass was allowed to stay Number 10 for 40 minutes .
When he left the building he tried to glue himself to the gates of Downing Street but was prevented from doing so by a police officer .
" I did n't have much glue left by that point , " he said .
Mr Glass was invited to Downing Street to receive an award from the Sheila McKechnie Foundation for his protesting work with Plane Stupid .
The Metropolitan Police said there had been no breach of security .

Sarah Palin can't participate in federal meetings on the crisis .
Palin may also suspend campaign
NEW YORK , N.Y . – John McCain 's campaign has floated the possibility that Sarah Palin may also suspend her campaign , matching McCain ’s announcement that he would cease campaigning for president to return to Washington to try to hammer out a fix for the nation ’s financial meltdown .
As the governor of Alaska , Palin cannot participate in the high - level federal government deliberations on the economy that McCain gave as his reason for suspending his campaign .

Yet , after McCain ’s dramatic announcement , his campaign chief Steve Schmidt suggested Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , would also suspend her campaign .
“ We 're going to take the ads down .
They wo n't be traveling .
There wo n’t be rallies , ” Schmidt said when asked about Palin ’s campaign , according to a rough transcription provided to reporters .
Democrats have blasted McCain ’s move , which includes a call to reschedule his planned Friday debate with Democratic rival Barack Obama , as political posturing , rather than a genuine effort to address the economic crisis .
Asked about Schmidt ’s comment , given Palin ’s inability to participate in congressional deliberations , spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt told reporters on a Wednesday evening conference call “ We are part of the McCain - Palin campaign .
It is one ticket . ”
But she demurred when asked specifically whether Palin , too , would be suspending her campaign .
“ I think Sen. McCain was clear about what it meant that he was suspending his campaign , ” Schmitt said , “ So , if we have any announcements , any updates about her schedule , we will certainly let you know . ”
Schmitt pointed out that Palin ’s schedule has only been released through Friday and said that she has no public events planned after she attends a Thursday morning speech McCain is slated to deliver here to the Clinton Global Initiative .
McCain ’s announcement puts Palin in a tricky spot .
If Palin continues campaigning , even at a less - than - full schedule , she will be in the mostly unaccustomed position of doing so without McCain by her side and would likely face more criticism if she continued evading the press on the campaign trail .
But if she suspends her campaign , Democrats are sure to pounce on the move as more evidence that the suspension is political .
Even before McCain ’s announcement , Palin ’s campaign schedule was far from rigorous .
Since Palin was selected as McCain ’s running mate in late August , she ’s appeared at 21 rallies , most of which were at McCain ’s side , has yet to hold a press conference , has conducted less than a handful of national media interviews and has pulled out of several fundraising appearances .
Google often says that it likes to take the long - term view of things .
But Google ’s idea of long term does not appear to be long enough for some librarians , who tend to equate long term with forever , at least when it comes to preserving books .
On Monday , a group of major libraries that are participating in Google ’s Library Project , said they are working together to create what amounts to a publicly accessible backup of the digital library that Google is creating .
The project , which is called HathiTrust , includes libraries at 12 Midwestern universities like the University of Michigan , the University of Iowa and the University of Illinois , plus the 11 libraries of the University of California system .
( Hathi is Hindi for “ elephant , ” an animal that is said to never forget . )
In the Google Books Library Project , the Internet giant has been scanning the collections of several large libraries .
The company gives users access to the complete text of books that are in the public domain , and to snippets of books that are protected by copyrights .
Google also gives each library a copy of the books it digitized from that library .
“ Google is an excellent partner , ” Paul Courant , university librarian and dean of libraries at the University of Michigan , said in an interview .
“ They are a corporation with a responsibility to its stockholders .
Google could last 50 years , 100 years , 1,000 years .
We are academic institutions with a commitment to the preservation and use of scholarship and the scholarship record for the indefinite future . ”
Mr. Courant said that the majority of the 2 million or so volumes already in HathiTrust were digitized by Google .
HathiTrust also includes fragile and hard - to - find books that the libraries have digitized on their own , he said .
HathiTrust is an agreement by several of those libraries — but not all of them — to pool their digital copies into one giant database that will be accessible online .
It will not make snippets of copyrighted works available , as some authors and book publishers said that amounts to copyright violations , but will allow users to search those texts .
“ I am hoping others will join , and I am hoping that we will be a destination for hundreds of thousands of people on the Web , ” Mr. Courant said .
“ Google will probably be better than we are at large - scale consumer applications . ”
But Mr. Courant said that for some services aimed at scholars “ we ’ll be as good or better than them at that . ”
Hagel : McCain attacks ' treading on thin ground '
David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday July 27 , 2008
Print This Email This
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel took John McCain to task Sunday morning for recent tactics aimed at demeaning Barack Obama 's Iraq policy .
On CBS ' Face the Nation , Hagel criticized both McCain 's recent statements regarding Obama 's proposed timetable and new advertisements released by the McCain campaign suggesting that Obama ignored injured troops .
" I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into ' you 're less patriotic than me , I 'm more patriotic , ' " Hagel said .
McCain said that Obama 's decision for a 16 - month withdrawal was based on political expediency and that " he chose a political path that would get him the nomination . "
" I admire and respect John McCain very much , " Hagel said .
" I have a good relationship .
To this day we do .
We talk often .
I talked to him right before I went to Iraq , as a matter of fact .
Johns better than that . "
Bob Schieffer asked Hagel what he thought about a McCain ad that claimed Obama " made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops .
Seems the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . "
A McCain ad attacking Obama for canceling a troop visit in Germany was not appropriate , Hagel said .
" That is a completely distorted and , I think , inappropriate advertisement . "
The Nebraska senator also said he agreed with Obama 's decision not to visit the hospital of wounded veterans .
" I think it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props .
So I think he probably , based on what I know , he did the right thing . "
Hagel , who accompanied Obama for part of his tour in Europe , tops most lists of potential cross -over vice presidential candidates for the senator , according to an article in The Nation

SAN DIEGO -- Search has become so pervasive on the Web as part of our regular activities that it 's tempting to assume it will be central to any future Web advances .
Prabhakar Raghavan , head of research at Yahoo , did n't get the memo .
" It 's very limiting to think of the Web as merely a mechanism for retrieving data , " Raghavan said in a panel discussion here Tuesday wrapping up the two - day DEMO conference .
" The next step is divining the intent of what people are doing and fulfilling their tasks .
I 've always believed people intrinsically do n't want to search , they come to work to do what the boss wants ....
We have to get further on achievement than the notion of the retrieval engine as the ultimate target . "
One example Raghavan gave of where search is limited is trying to plan a vacation .
" You spend hours or days from start to end with repeated search engine queries .
At the end there 's a glaring inequity , you the human being spent all that time , while the combined CPUs spent five seconds on your task . "
He suggested , in this case , the Web , or software being used , should understand an individual 's preferences ahead of time , like , a preference for sunny climates , site - seeing options but not too many museums , etc .
How do we get to these new tools and approaches ?
Raghavan said it 's important the industry remember what spawned the explosive growth of the Internet .
" How it came about was openness .
The system would n't crash just because someone put up a bad HTML page .
That principle has worked and openness must persist , " he said .
He also made a plug for Yahoo's Build Your Own Search Service ( BOSS ) initiative that basically makes Yahoo's vast search infrastructure available as a platform for developers to innovate on to create new services .
The Web as a ' Giant Brain '
Nova Spivack , founder and CEO of Semantic Web company Radar Networks , said he 's been seeing a shift he describes as the World Wide Web becoming the Wide World Web .
" With things like geo - tagging and flexible displays that bring Web access outside the office or home , we 're seeing augmented reality become reality , " he said .
" The Web is becoming more contextually aware . "
Spivack , who served as moderator of the panel , said the Web is moving from cloud computing to a more pervasive " ground computing " and asked if this trend is leading the Web to become more like a " giant brain " that thinks and extends human minds .
" And if so , is that giant brain going to be Google ? "
Peter Norvig , director of research at Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , scoffed at the idea .
" I think we already have human brains .
We do n't want to limit the Web to what a brain can do , but augment what a brain can't do . "
Norvig conceded that currently users have to do most of the thinking to get what they want from the Web .
" I think we have to do a better job of having a conversation with the user , " he said .
Google advanced that idea a bit years ago when it introduced the ' Did you mean ...? ' feature in search results where the search engine suggests the correct spelling for commonly misspelled entries .
" But we need to go much farther to both where there is a clear intent and in cases where it 's more exploratory , " he said .
As an example , he noted someone seeking help for a medical problem might start out a search by entering a symptom like " funny red splotch " which would lead to many ambiguous results and repeated queries .
" We have to accelerate the process and not make the user do all the work , " he said .

Hypocrites Unite !
At least we have some ideals to fall short of .
By George Monbiot .
Published on the Guardian ’s Comment is Free site , 6th August 2008
In her new book , Not In My Name , Julie Burchill reserves her grandest fury about hypocrites for environmentalists .
We are , she says , pious , sexless and contemptuous of humankind .
All of us are posh and rich , and have found in environmentalism a new excuse for lecturing the poor .
We tell other people to live by rules we do n’t apply to ourselves .
Like all stereotypes , these claims are lazy , familiar and sometimes true .
Burchill knows nothing about environmentalism and , almost as a point of pride , has n’t bothered to find out , but when you use grapeshot you are bound to hit someone .
Yes , many prominent greens are posh gits like me .
The same can be said of journalists , politicians , artists , academics , business leaders : in fact of just about anyone in public life .
But it is always the greens who are singled out .
In truth , while the upper middle classes are , as always , over - represented in the media , the movement cuts across the classes .
A recent ICM poll found that more people in social classes D and E thought the government should prioritise the environment over the economy ( 56 % ) than in classes A and B ( 47 % ) ( 1 ) .
Environmentalism is the most politically diverse movement in history .
Here in the climate camp I have met anarchists , communists , socialists , liberals , conservatives and – mostly – pragmatists .
I remember sitting in a campaign meeting during the Newbury bypass protests and marvelling at the weirdness of our coalition .
In the front row sat the local squirearchy : brigadiers in tweeds and enormous moustaches , titled women in twinsets and headscarves .
In the middle were local burghers of all shapes and sizes .
At the back sat the scuzziest collection of grunge - skunks I have ever laid eyes on .
The audience disagreed about every other subject under the sun – if someone had asked us to decide what day of the week it was , the meeting would have descended into fisticuffs – but everyone there recognised that our quality of life depends on the quality of our surroundings .
The environment is inseperable from social justice .
Climate change , for example , is primarily about food and water .
It threatens the freshwater supplies required to support human life .
As continental interiors dry out and the glaciers feeding many of the rivers used for irrigation disappear , climate change presents the greatest of all threats to the future prospects of the poor .
The rich will survive for a few decades at least , as they can use their money to insulate themselves from the effects .
The poor are being hammered already .
Sure we are hypocrites .
Every one of us , almost by definition .
Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions .
Greens have high aspirations – they want to live more ethically – and they will always fall short .
But the alternative to hypocrisy is n’t moral purity ( no one manages that ) but cynicism .
In reality it is people like Julie Burchell – who is incidentally far richer than almost any green I ’ve met – who treat the poor with contempt .
So that she can revel in what she calls “ reckless , romantic modernism ” , other people must die .
But at least you ca n’t accuse her of hypocrisy : she cannot fail to live by her moral code , because she does n’t have one .
Give me hypocrisy any day .

A true - life testimony by Crystal Kupper ,
“ Today might be an I - hate - the - military day , ” my husband of three months said uneasily .
I snapped to attention , temporarily forgetting the vegetables I was chopping .
“ Why ?
Switching shifts ? ” I asked , knowing he was n’t .
Nick opened the fridge and stared at the milk .
“ No. I ’m deploying . ” I practically pureed the onion , saying nothing .
Then came the tears and venom , realizing it was n’t his fault but not caring .
He was leaving me .
This scene failed to cross my mind when I initially fell for Nick .
He was the first military man I knew , and the romance swept me away .
I had envisioned worldwide adventures with my groom .
Instead , we were stuck in the ugly Idaho desert , an hour away from the closest town and hundreds of miles from home .
We had no friends and were just settling into a church .
And now Nick was deploying to Asia and unsure of his return date , but positive he would miss our first anniversary .
A year earlier , Nick gave me a grey Air Force sweatshirt .
Bursting with pride for my military man , I wore it everywhere and treasured that garment like a gold medal .
Now , I peeled it off my body and stuffed it in the closet .
I did n’t want anything to do with the dumb Air Force .
Those feelings only intensified as his departure date drew near .
I cried over everything , bewildering my poor husband .
Even though his job as a fighter jet electrician nearly guaranteed his safety , I remained unsatisfied .
Terrifying nightmares convinced me that he was n’t coming home .
“ I just do n’t understand , ” he said one afternoon .
“ I ’m not going to die .
What ’s wrong ? ”
“ I do n’t trust the Air Force with you , ” I finally spit out .
He was mine , and they were taking him away .
Nick pulled me close and spoke softly .
“ Crystal , please understand where I ’m coming from .
Not only am I deploying , but I ’m worrying about you , too .
I ca n’t take care of myself because I ’m taking care of you .
I ’m not allowed to cry because you ’re doing it all for me . ”
I instantly felt convicted ; I had n’t really considered how he felt .
My husband had been hiding his anxieties to protect me , but now I knew my selfish actions had left him without a support system .
All of my energies were going toward me instead of us .
Despite that realization , I still felt bitter when Nick left .
Depression – something I had never experienced before – engulfed me .
I had been a Christian my entire life , practically born and raised in a pew .
But now , I could n’t even fake a smile , especially in church .
I hated the sickly - sweet people who greeted me with a smile but never called me during the week .
Most of all , I despised the God who gave me this man .
Did n’t
He realize how much I had given up to be Nick ’s wife ?
Deeper and deeper into the depths of my closet went the Air Force sweatshirt .
A steaming - hot August morning found me in church again , lonely and tired .
I was taking 18 college credits , trying to stay busy , but the schedule was exhausting .
The choir sang out : “ All of you is more than enough for all of me / For every thirst and every need . ”
Inwardly blushing , I realized my problem : I did n’t think God could satisfy my needs completely .
I had been substituting my husband for my Savior , and the results had been near - disastrous .
If I trusted God to save my soul , should n’t I trust Him to plan my life and marriage ?
I reluctantly answered yes .
Shedding my pride , I called some other Air Force wives .
Over tea , I confessed my feelings of anger and anxiety , and to my surprise , they smiled in knowing recognition .
From then after , we met regularly to discuss our marriages .
Once my attention switched from my needs to others ’ – after all , they were hurting , too – I felt energized and valuable .
I also worked toward a personal goal by training for a competitive 10 K race .
As a result , my phone conversations with Nick grew more upbeat as my friendships deepened and interests widened , freeing him to concentrate on staying healthy and safe .
Nick eventually returned with a sunburn and souvenirs .
And though I hate the thought of more deployments , I know they will come .
Even when he ’s home , I struggle with giving him up to God .
I have to forfeit the right to organize our lives my way .
It ’s still scary .
But I think I ’m making progress – that sweatshirt now has its own hanger .
This Russian guy is fond of making photos of the ‘ slime molds ’ – micro mushrooms that grow on the plants .

Chillingham Castle , Northumberland , England
Chillingham Castle has been used as a monastery , a military stronghold , an army barracks , and a private residence .
During the days of William Wallace , it played a crucial role in England ’s defense and was the site of untold amounts of unspeakably gruesome torture .
It ’s said that you can still feel the presence of those who were tortured and killed here , and Chillingham Castle is often referred to as one of the most haunted places in Britain .

Stanley Hotel , Estes Park , Colorado
The Stanley Hotel may seem familiar , especially if you ’re a Stephen King fan .
King was staying here when he developed the idea for his book The Shining .
Later , the television miniseries based on the book was filmed at the Stanley .
Even more interesting than its connection to Hollywood is the Stanley Hotel ’s multitude of ghosts .
Guests have seen the ghosts of the hotel ’s original owner and his wife , along with various other apparitions .
Employees and guests have often reported hearing strange noises from unoccupied rooms or seeing the piano in the parlor play by itself .

The Crenshaw House , Gallatin County , Illinois
The Crenshaw House , built in 1838 , is most often referred to as the “ Old Slave House . ”
This home was the residence of John Crenshaw , who committed shocking acts of cruelty within its walls and without .
As a landowner and salt mine owner , Crenshaw was in need of cheap labor to keep his businesses running .
His solution was to kidnap black men , women and children – mostly freed slaves – and force them to work for him .
They were kept in the third floor of the Crenshaw house in tiny , cramped cells .
They were bolted to the floor and beaten mercilessly .
After the Crenshaws moved out of the house , the new owners began to experience paranormal activity .
The souls said to occupy the house are those of the brutally tortured slaves once held captive within .
Almost everyone who has tried to spend a night in the attic has run terrified from the house before morning .
The house was once open for tours , but is now owned by the state of Illinois and closed to all visitors .

The Winchester House , San Jose , California
The Winchester Mystery House story begins and ends with ghosts .
In 1881 , William Wirt Winchester , founder of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company , passed away .
He left behind his wife , Sarah , who had never quite been the same since her only child died 15 years earlier .
Shortly after his death , Sarah visited a medium to contact her dead husband .
Reportedly , William Winchester told his wife that there was a curse on their family .
William ’s inventions had taken countless lives , and the ghosts of the dead were coming for Sarah .
William ’s ghost informed Sarah that in order to stay alive , she had to go West , find a spot , and start building a home .
If she ever stopped building , William warned , she would die .
Sarah settled in San Jose and began building on a 162 - acre parcel of land .
She kept carpenters and architects at work every single day .
From 1884 to her death in 1922 , Sarah built constantly .
Eventually the house grew to approximately 160 rooms and is referred to as a “ labyrinth . ”
There are useless features , such as stairs that go up to the ceiling , and it has been said that it ’s nearly impossible to find your way around .
Some say that the ghosts who followed Sarah Winchester to the home can still be seen there today .
The house is now a California landmark and guided tours are offered .

Loftus Hall , County Wexford , Ireland
Loftus Hall has a long and fascinating history of hauntings .
The first home to stand on this side was Redmond Hall , built in 1350 .
The original Loftus Hall was built on its ruins , then demolished in 1870 and the building that stands today was built .
Legend has it that when a stranger came riding through in the mid-18th Century and asked for shelter for the night , the family living in the home agreed .
When one of the ladies dropped a playing card during a game , she bent over to retrieve it and noticed that the stranger had a cloven foot .
The stranger immediately disappeared , leaving a hole in the ceiling that is said to still exist today .
After that encounter , the young lady who noticed the cloven foot , Anne Tottenham , fell very ill and eventually died .
The house continued to be plagued by supernatural occurrences and poltergeist activity .
The family asked a priest to perform and exorcism , and presumably the poltergeist activity stopped .
However , it is said that the ghost of Anne Tottenham still roams the house .
Due to constant vandalism , the vacant house is now closed off and the windows and doors are boarded over .

Historic Anchorage Hotel , Anchorage , Alaska
The Historic Anchorage Hotel may not look like a haunting hotspot , but employees and former guests say that seeing a ghost there is not at all unusual .
Most notable is the ghost of an abandoned bride , who hung herself in the hotel , in her wedding dress , when her intended husband failed to show up for their wedding .
Guests have also reported seeing pictures fly off of walls , shower curtains ruffle unexpectedly , and various specters appearing in the rooms and the halls .
The hotel ’s employees are so used to these reports that they keep a “ ghost log ” to track the sightings .
Beauregard House , New Orleans , Louisiana
New Orleans is widely regarded as the most haunted city in the United States .
People in the Big Easy talk about ghost sightings the way people in other cities talk about going to the grocery store .
There are many haunted houses and other attractions in the city that promise to put you up close and personal with spirits .
One of the lesser - known haunted houses in New Orleans is the Beauregard house .
It was once the home of General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard , an important general of the Confederate Army in the Civil War .
After his death in 1893 , the house was quiet for many years .
It was purchased in 1909 by the Giacona family and later was the scene of a mob-related shooting that left three men dead .
The Giaconas moved out in the 1920s , and two decades later the first reports of supernatural activity began .
Oddly enough , the reported hauntings have nothing to do with the Giaconas , but rather with the General .
Various people claimed to have heard Civil War-era weapons being discharged in the house .
This story is especially odd since no battles ever took place anywhere near the house .
The only ties it has to the Civil War are the General ’s occupancy and the Civil War museum that now fills the house .
Tour guides for the house claim that no supernatural activity has ever taken place there and that the Civil War sounds are simply urban legends .
These are just a few of the famously haunted houses and hotels that dot the landscape of the entire world .
Which other haunted houses scare you silly ?

George W. Bush and his father share more than a last name .
Reports show that August ’s unemployment rate increased past the level initially forecast , rising to 6.1 percent .
But even more disturbing is the fact that the misery index — unemployment aggregated with inflation — also soared to its highest level since 1991 , when George H.W. Bush was in office .
Bloomberg :
The U.S. lost more jobs than forecast in August and the unemployment rate climbed to a five - year high of 6.1 percent , a sign that the economic slowdown is worsening two months before Americans elect their next president .
Payrolls fell by 84,000 in August , and revisions added another 58,000 to job losses for the prior two months , the Labor Department said today in Washington .
The increase in the jobless rate sent the misery index , which adds unemployment to inflation , to 11.7 percent , the highest level since 1991 .
Treasuries gained as some traders bet the Federal Reserve ’s next move will be to cut interest rates , rather than raise them , and stocks sank .
Today ’s figures increase the risk that President George W. Bush will become the first president since Richard Nixon to oversee two recessions , and may hurt fellow Republican John McCain ’s campaign to succeed him .

The bathroom often seems to be a great source of amusement .
Different signs around the world are usually poorly translated , with pretty hilarious results .
Other signs are just plain weird , or have been defaced by folks with a healthy combination of humor and boredom .
I have collected 10 signs that grabbed my attention .
We can not allow you to use the bathroom !
Ca n’t find anywhere to pee ?
Blame the terrorists .

Good old Engrish bathroom sign
It has separated !
Do n’t mistake !
Presented without comment …
Really , what could I possibly add to describe this fantastic Chinese bathroom sign ?
Even Lego minifigs need to relieve themselves !
From the bathroom door at the Legoland Discovery Center
Wash those genitals !
Sure , it is probably ( hopefully ) a joke sign , but it made me chuckle .
Please use butt to flush !
Ahhhh … .
Nothing says “ fun ” like some juvenile humor and a black marker ….
Girl ’s what ?
Bad grammar is everywhere , but this sign is on the bathroom wall at a school !
Aliens do number 1 and 2 , just like us !
This sign is found at the Science Fiction Museum in Seattle , Washington .
It took me some time to figure this one out …
This sign is from a bathroom in Turkey , and no matter how often I look at it , I ca n’t figure out exactly what they are trying to tell me .
It appears they are just trying to say that this is the way to the male and female bathrooms .
A lesson in hand washing
No offense , but if you work at this company and need a 6 step lesson on how to wash your hands , you might want to ask yourself whether you made the right career move .
I 'm a sixth - generation Arizona conservative who tends to vote for moderates on both sides of the political spectrum .
Sen .
John McCain was my presidential choice until he decided in 2004 to embrace George Bush 's presidency to up his chances for 2008 .
When he beat the presidential field to become the presumptive nominee , I hoped Mitt Romney would be tapped for vice president .
I feel in my bones McCain will not live out his first term , and so I 'd sure like to have a business savant in the White House .
Gov. Palin's " true grit " is impressive , but I sure do n't want her one heartbeat away from the presidency .
So despite my Obama / Biden leanings , McCain 's " fight with me " acceptance speech deeply moved me .
Then I remembered a McCain / Palin vote means four more years of the Republican corporate machine that has controlled our economy and foreign affairs for the past 10 years , beginning with Newt Gingrich 's " Contract With America " victory .
McCain 's rhetoric moved me to tears .
But the mere thought that his party would continue its hold on the Bush / Cheney model of the imperial executive for another four years gives me the willies .
I just can't contemplate enduring more of the same .

I confess .
I believe there is a ruling class that sustains the two - party plutocracy running the nation for the benefit of the rich and corporate class .
Their broad strategy is deception and delusion .
Tactically , they use government , the mainstream media , the financial services sector , funding of politicians and the two major parties , and many other parts of the culture and economy to maintain their power and control .
Elections do not threaten elites .
To the contrary , political debate and elections are important to maintain the illusion and delusion of a real democracy .
They are key to prevent outright revolution , marginalize dissidents and political reform efforts , and suppress third parties .
Would power plutocrats allow election of a president that threatened their control ?
Of course not .
And no Democratic or Republican presidential candidate ever poses a real threat despite cloaking themselves with labels like maverick , reformer or change agent .
If you accept my worldview , then you know that the ruling class would prefer John McCain over Barack Obama , though they can live with Obama , which is why many , many wealthy people and corporations have poured money into Obama 's campaign and the recent Democratic convention .
The chief disadvantage of Obama and Sarah Palin , from the rulers ' perspective , is their relative brief stints as politicians .
It takes time to corrupt politicians and cement their dependency on and membership in the ruling class .
In contrast , McCain and Joe Biden clearly have shown themselves reliable in protecting the status quo two - party plutocracy .
Why does deception and delusion work so effectively ?
When it comes to politics , current events and history , the vast majority of citizens are uninformed , stupid and dumb , regardless of their educational level .
As distracted and compulsive consumers , they fall head over hills for political lies and slick campaign rhetoric .
First , consider younger voters .
There 's been so much about the increased interest in this presidential campaign by younger people , especially evident in the Ron Paul and Obama campaigns .
But consider these facts , as reported by Rick Shenkman in the Washington Post :
For those aged 18 to 29 just 20 percent read newspapers and just 11 percent regularly surf the Internet for news .
Most of what people know about candidates ' positions on the issues comes from what they learn from unreliable and all too often misleading 30 - second commercials .
Despite far more widespread and extensive schooling , people today possess no more political knowledge than their parents and grandparents .
And do n't think that those addicted to The Daily Show and its irreverent view of politics are a lot smarter than those favoring the conservative O'Reilly Factor .
In both groups , only about 54 percent of the shows ' politicized viewers scored in the high knowledge category .
Propaganda and misinformation really work .
Just prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq some 60 percent of Americans believed that Iraq was behind the 9/11 attack .
But here is the kicker : A year later there was a wealth of information , including the 9/11 Commission report , saying that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attack .
Yet an amazing 50 percent of Americans still believed that Iraq was to blame , and may still think so .
As Rick Shenkman , author of Just How Stupid Are We? : Facing the Truth About the American Voter , concluded : " By every measure social scientists have devised , voters are spectacularly uninformed . "
Guess who takes advantage of the stupidity of voters , especially younger ones .
If people can believe Obama when he says that the election is not about him but about them , then they can also believe McCain when he says he is a proven change agent and reformer .
The only real difference between Obama and McCain is exactly how they will screw the public and benefit the rich and powerful if elected , not whether they will .
If the electorate were really intelligent , they would understand and focus on the similarity between the two , rather than their professed differences .
It is what they share — obedience and loyalty to the two - party plutocracy — that matters the most .
As long as voters do not understand this , the oppression and destruction of the middle class will continue , despite people thinking they are free and live in a democracy .
Mostly , Americans are free to remain vulnerable to deception and delusion .
Democracy for dummies is what we have and what the majority deserves .
For the rest of us the difficult challenge is to find ways to fight the political system that are not marginalized and only satisfy our egos .
As long as you are an enthusiastic supporter of any Democrat or Republican you are a willing participant in our fake democracy .
Most voters persist in believing in the myth that some Democrat or Republican can and will reform the political system , fix the economy , and restore American democracy .
They refuse to face the painful truth that this is simply not true .
They rather keep embracing the delusional myth .
Consider these wise words of John F. Kennedy : " The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie — deliberate , contrived , and dishonest , but the myth — persistent , persuasive , and unrealistic .
Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought . "
And so millions of Americans suffering from habitual stupidity will cast their votes confident that they have discovered the truth .
Like the march of the penguins diving into icy water without thinking they have any other choice , they succumb to the big myth that this year cost about $ 1 billion to keep alive .
These voters are dummies for democracy .
The rest of us will vote for Ralph Nader or some other third party candidate , or refuse to vote at all , and seek ways to ignite the Second American Revolution .
Politicians and media people often praise the smart public and smart voters as if they inevitably make the best , most intelligent and informed electoral decisions .
This is sheer hype designed to maintain the political status quo .
There is only one smart fact : Every single Democrat and Republican candidate lies .
Why do they keep lying ?
It works .
Phen375 is one of the most popular weight loss products available today .
It was introduced into the market in 2009 and since then , it has won the hearts of thousands of users across the United States .
It is one of those few weight loss products that approach the issue of obesity from a different angle to provide meaningful results .
Why Is It Possible To Lose Weight Using Phen375
The manufacturers of Phen375 have been aware of the fact that most people are overweight because of their unhealthy diets and lack of routine exercise .
This product has therefore been manufactured to control the user 's appetite and increase their metabolic rate , which eventually leads to quicker weight loss .
It has unique appetite - suppression capabilities that make the users feel full most of the time , and avoid eating anything they come across .
The increased metabolic rate also makes it possible for the body to burn fat faster and effectively .
The product contains natural energizing ingredients that make the user feel energetic most of the time even as they lose weight .
Some weight loss products are well - known for successfully helping their consumers lose weight but usually leave them look tired , dull and weak unlike Phen 375 .
Analyzing The Safety Standards
The manufacturing process of such a weight loss product is what determines how safe it is for human consumption .
For that reason , these weight loss diet pills have been manufactured in laboratories that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US .
This has been done to ensure that the product is of the highest quality and does not contain any harmful ingredients .
Some people lose weight using other products and end up looking shapeless especially when fat is lost at unintended places .
Phen375 manufacturers have noted such issues and used this product to provide the ultimate solution .
It replaces the lost fat with muscle for the user to maintain a great physique .
The Possible Side Effects And Risks
The majority of Phen375 reviews suggest that this product does not have body - damaging side effects .
In fact , weight loss is the only risk and side effect .
The users are always advised to follow all instructions provided by the manufacturer if they wish to realize the benefits of Phen375 .
However , just like other diet pills on the market , phen375 is not meant for everyone .
Pregnant women , for example , are not allowed to use the product unless they consult their doctors for further advice .
The same case applies to people with allergic reactions .
They need to talk to their doctors and find out whether they are safe to use it or not , after going through some medical tests .
Phen 375 is not popular by mistake ; this the kind of weight loss product that assures its users that they will not have to spend additional money in form of medical bills due to devastating side effects .
It is safe , reliable and affordable for everyone who wants to lose weight fast .
The best part about it is that , the user does not require any prescription to purchase it .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
There ’s something about hundreds of billions of dollars vanishing overnight that begs a comparison to the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression .
A trader relaxes on after the closing bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , September 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
Almost -- but not yet .
The United States has seen the destruction of some of its biggest names in finance , thousands of lost jobs and threats to the stability of the world banking system .
All in one week .
The losses are staggering , more than $ 1 trillion in taxpayer dollars pledged by the U.S. government to mop up bad mortgage debt and prop up the financial system .
The final tab could be far greater .
To put it in perspective for Wall Street and the world outside , news outlets have latched onto the 1929 crash and the subsequent Great Depression as their historical benchmarks .
Michelle Caruso - Cabrera , a reporter at business news cable network CNBC , told viewers it was “ one of the most historic weeks in financial and American history . ”
Hold on a minute , market veterans and scholars say .
It ’s serious , because it has been preceded by a 13 - month credit crisis that has gotten worse despite government efforts to solve it .
But it has yet to reach the cataclysmic scale of the Depression .
“ I ’ve lived through plenty of debacles .
Each time you go through it , it seems like the worst since 1929 , ” said Theodore Weisberg , a New York Stock Exchange member for some 40 years .
" The nomenclature of the word ' crisis ' has cheapened , " said Roy Smith , a professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business and former partner at Goldman Sachs GS.N .
No one disputes that it is a profound crisis , but Depression - level may be overdoing it , said Allan Sloan , Washington Post and Fortune magazine columnist .
“ I do n’t think so , considering that the Great Depression had thousands of banks failing and people losing their life savings , 25 percent unemployment and social unrest and tent cities of the poor , ” Sloan said .
BLACK MONDAY , TUESDAY , THURSDAY
Financial earthquakes that have prompted fearful murmurings of the bad old days include the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and the dot - com bust early in this decade that wiped trillions of dollars of paper wealth off the Nasdaq market .
Then there was October 1987 , when stock markets around the world crashed .
History books are spotted with numerous references to Black Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays .
It is clear that the current financial meltdown that killed Lehman Brothers LEH .
NLEHMQ.PK , sold off Merrill Lynch MER.N and forced the U.S. government to take over insurance provider American International Group AIG.
N could radically change nearly a century 's worth of financial policy .
Each faltered on debt and other interrelated , complex financial instruments that ensured a more rapid collapse than Wall Street and regulators could handle .
That is a key similarity to the crash 79 years ago , said Maury Klein , professor emeritus at the University of Rhode Island and author of “ Rainbow ’s End : The Crash of 1929 . ”
“ What ’s similar in each case is you have a situation where you ’re starting to play in ever - larger stakes with things that you do n’t understand , ” he said .
But today ’s overall U.S. economic picture is quite different .
“ With just 6 percent unemployment , we are having a debate as to whether we are even in a recession , ” said Richard Sylla , professor of the history of financial institutions and markets at New York University .
WHERE WILL IT STOP ?
Prominent economic columnist Robert Samuelson wrote a piece in the Washington Post in July titled “ A Depression ?
Hardly . ”
He said he would write the same column now , but “ with less conviction . ”
That is because there is no telling where the erosion will stop .
The bad - bet loans made on homeowners during the recent U.S. housing boom and shady trades could burrow deeper into the financial nervous system than anyone anticipated .
This can hurt regular people too .
It may destroy their investments , further degrade home values and cost them their jobs .
It may be hard , but not as hard as eating a loaf of bread as their sole daily meal before sleeping under the stars .
“ The only question is whether the crisis is so deep that you ca n’t get at it at all , ” said Columbia University professor and Council on Foreign Relations Senior Fellow Jagdish Bhagwati .
“ We have instruments like the Federal Reserve coming in .
Only the United States could do it in such a big way . ”
The fear at the back of everyone ’s mind is that the turmoil could spill into the real economy -- “ the factories where they actually make things and retail establishments and transportation providers , ” said Robert Bruner , dean of the University of Virginia ’s Darden School of Business .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are determined to avoid the mistakes of 1929 , said Brad DeLong , economics professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ They want to make their own , new mistakes . ”
Amid the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic , L.A. Comic
Con says it is planning to hold an in- person convention at the L.A. Convention Center in December .
But as of now , state guidance does not allow for large gatherings .

SYDNEY , Sept. 7 ( UPI ) -- Police in Australia have set what they describe as " very generous limits " for an upcoming auto race weekend -- no more than a case of beer a day for adults .
The Bathurst 1000 is scheduled for the weekend of Oct. 9 through Oct. 12 .

" These restrictions are very generous , " Chief Superintendent Steve Cullen of the New South Wales Police said in a news release .
" Anyone who needs to drink more than 24 cans of beer in a day to have a good time is not welcome . "
Racing fans who do not like full - strength beer have other choices .
They can bring in 36 cans of beer with alcohol content of 3.5 percent or less , a case of pre-mixed cocktails or up to 4 liters ( about 8 quarts ) of wine .
They cannot mix and match their drinks , and no glass containers are allowed .
" This is a sporting event unlike any other with 30,000 people living in campsites around the ( Mount ) Panorama circuit for up to a week prior to the actual race , " Cullen said .

If the bailout accomplishes nothing else , it may expose the charade of the " two - party " system to a few more eyes .
The Democrats ' excuse for supporting so much atrocious Bush legislation ( Patriot Act , use of force , Military Commissions Act , warrantless wiretapping , etc. ) has traditionally been that if they dared to oppose these horrible measures , they 'd get slaughtered at the polls .
Well , guess what : the bailout is a horrible measure , and the voters -- Democrat and Republican -- oppose it by an almost 2 to 1 ratio .
Commentators on the left and the right are denouncing this measure .
( When was the last time George Will and Paul Krugman were on the same side ? )
People are writing , calling , and emailing their congresscritters in droves , demanding " no bailout . "
Yet the Democratic leadership is pushing the bailout , and trying to line up enough Congressional votes to pass it .
It 's time to recognize a truth : the dividing line on this legislation -- like so much other legislation -- is n't Democratic vs. Republican .
It 's " inside the Beltway " vs. " outside the Beltway . "
The only constituency for this bailout legislation is the Wall Street tycoons who stand to gain enormously , the Washington insiders who have profited handsomely from Wall Street campaign contributions , and those insiders who will amass great personal power by this legislation .
And there are no " outsiders " in Congress .
McCain and Obama may take the cowardly way out and duck the vote -- but you can be sure they wo n't be voting " no " .
If either one were a real " outsider " , he would be standing up now against this lavish giveaway , and would denounce those who support it .
Not gonna happen .
Because they 're both on the same side -- the side of the rulers .
And that 's not your side .
There are a number of technologies whose origins could be found in NASA ’s history books .
But microblogging most definitely is not one of them .
Still , the space agency has developed its own little fascination with Twitter , and Veronica McGregor , the news services manager at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , is spending her evenings channeling the Phoenix Mars lander to speak to 10,565 - plus followers , 140 characters at a time , according to Kenneth Chang of The New York Times .
What does she - ahem , Phoenix - speak of , you ask ?
Stuff .
Facts .
Humorous notes .
Anything short and simple , really .
Just a few minutes ago this message was delivered :
" Descent thrusters moved the topsoil during landing , uncovering the ice table .
The pic was taken for engineers to check my legs , and voila ! "
While NASA covers its missions to quite a detailed degree , sharing photos , videos , logs , educational materials for the perusal of just about anyone outside Mission Control , it has n’t been known to take up “ the tweet ” in any official or semi-official capacity .
Alas , there ’s a first time for everything .
@MarsPhoenix has been actively chatting with Twitter folk for some weeks now , well before touchdown on the red planet .
Yet , in that time it ’s amassed a five - figure following .
More interesting , perhaps , it follows nobody and no thing .
Zero. Nada .
Is this a play at the age - old “ lead , do n’t follow ” mantra ?
Or is it Phoenix ’s polar solitude amid ice , sand , and dust ?
But hey , distance should n’t stop the lander from making friends .
We ’re a wireless people now .
At the very least , the solar - powered sampler should add a little one - two for its fellow Earth - born inhabitants , Spirit and Opportunity .

Sarah Palin gave a really good speech .
Why go beyond that , asks Simon .
Why the media should apologize
ST . PAUL , Minn . —
On behalf of the media , I would like to say we are sorry .
On behalf of the elite media , I would like to say we are very sorry .
Advertisement
We have asked questions this week that we should never have asked .
We have asked pathetic questions like : Who is Sarah Palin ?
What is her record ?
Where does she stand on the issues ?
And is she is qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency ?
We have asked mean questions like : How well did John McCain know her before he selected her ?
How well did his campaign vet her ?
And was she his first choice ?
Bad questions .
Bad media .
Bad .
It is not our job to ask questions .
Or it should n’t be .
To hear from the pols at the Republican National Convention this week , our job is to endorse and support the decisions of the pols .
Sarah Palin hit the nail on the head Wednesday night ( and several in the audience wish she had hit some reporters on the head instead ) when she said : “ I ’m not a member of the permanent political establishment .
And I ’ve learned quickly , these past few days , that if you ’re not a member in good standing of the Washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone . ”
But where did we go wrong with Sarah Palin ?
Let me count the ways :
First , we should have stuck to the warm , human interest stuff like how she likes mooseburgers and hit an important free throw at her high school basketball tournament even though she had a stress fracture .
Second , we should have stuck to the press release stuff like how she opposed the Bridge to Nowhere ( after she supported it ) .
Third , we should never have strayed into the other stuff .
Like when The Washington Post recently wrote : “ Palin is under investigation by a bipartisan state legislative body .
…
Palin had promised to cooperate with the legislative inquiry , but this week she hired a lawyer to fight to move the case to the jurisdiction of the state personnel board , which Palin appoints . ”
Why go there ?
What trees does that plant ?
Fourth , we should stop making with all the questions already .
She gave a really good speech .
And why go beyond that ?
As we all know , speeches cannot be written by others and rehearsed for days .
They are true windows to the soul .
Unless they are delivered by Barack Obama , that is .
In which case , as Palin said Wednesday , speeches are just a “ cloud of rhetoric . ”
Fifth , we should stop reporting on the families of the candidates .
Unless the candidates want us to .
Sarah Palin wanted the media to report on her teenage son , Track , who enlisted in the Army on Sept. 11 , 2007 , and soon will deploy to Iraq .
Sarah Palin did not want the media to report on her teenage daughter , Bristol , who is pregnant and unmarried .
Sarah Palin thinks that one is good for her campaign and one is not , and that the media should report only on what is good for her campaign .
That is our job , and that is our duty .
If that is not actually in the Constitution , it should be .
( And someday may be . )
The official theme of the convention ’s third day was “ prosperity , ” but the unofficial theme was “ the media are really , really awful . ”
Even Mike Huckabee , who campaigned for president this year by saying “ I am a conservative , but I am not mad at anybody , ” discovered Wednesday night that he is mad at somebody .
“ I ’d like to thank the elite media for doing something , ” Huckabee said , “ that , quite frankly , I did n’t think could be done : unify the Republican Party and all of America in support of John McCain and Sarah Palin . ”
And could that be the real point of the attacks on the media ?
To unify the Republican Party ?
No , that is simply the cynical , media view .
Though as Lily Tomlin says , “ No matter how cynical I get , it ’s just never enough to keep up . ”
I could n’t resist that .
For which I am sorry .
Obama raises the ' Dead '
The four surviving members of the Grateful Dead will play a Pennsylvania fundraiser for Barack Obama October 13 .
The Penn State " Change Rocks " concert will feature Bob Weir , Phil Lesh , Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart , along with Gregg Allman and other rockers .
A well - informed friend tells me it's " a big deal for Deadheads " and the first full reunion of the band 's surviving members since 2004 , though there was a " Deadheads for Obama " event in February featuring three of the four .
The music magazine Relix reports that " given the event ’s political slant , the various musicians are being billed under their own names instead of The Dead and the Allman Brothers Band . "

Part of the reason that chocolate is so irresistible is the way that it is made up of a variety of fats , both from the cocoa bean and in many cases milk or even vegetable .
These fats happen to melt at just below body temperature so the chocolate melts in your mouth .
This is why chocolate is so obviously a bad material for making teapots , hence the phrase " as useless as a chocolate teapot " !
However , James called in to the show to ask how thick the walls of a chocolate teapot would need to be to be able to brew tea in it , so in the best tradition of Kitchen Science , we set out to find out the answer to this critical question .
The obvious way to find out how thick you would have to make a chocolate teapot is to make a series of chocolate teapots with walls of various thicknesses and test them by brewing tea .
However this would take rather a long time and involve truly stupendous amounts of chocolate ( as opposed to just ridiculous amounts ) .
We decided to do a series of tests on a small amount of chocolate in order to find out roughly how much we would need for the teapot .
Chocolate is a very complex substance and it does n't melt in a simple way - it goes through a series of stages where it becomes gradually more fluid .
The teapot could melt enough to become flexible and then the pressure of the tea could cause it to distort and empty its contents onto the floor , without actually melting through the walls .
This means that just finding out whether it melts or not is n't very useful .
So we needed an experiment that modelled being part of a chocolate teapot wall as closely as possible , while using a sane amount of chocolate .
' We 're fighting against prejudice ' ... Dominique Moreau .
Photograph : Alain Jocard / AFP
Dominique Moreau is a trailblazing freedom fighter , a man battling for equality and recognition in a world of prejudice and gender - based stereotypes .
At least , that is what his supporters say .
To others who may be less aware of the socio-political implications of his sartorial habits , however , Moreau 's heroism is less apparent .
To them , he is just a bloke in a skirt .
" Today , millions of men around the world wear skirts , like the sarong in Asia or the djellaba in Africa , without being bothered , " he insists .
" Why not us ? "
Moreau is the president of Hommes en Jupe ( Men in Skirts ) , an association of about 30 men in Poitiers , western France , who don skirts to go about their everyday lives .
For them , getting dressed in the morning is less about style and more about political substance : they are fighting to reclaim an item of clothing last worn by Frenchmen more than 500 years ago .
" We 're fighting against prejudice and cliches , " says Moreau , a 39 - year - old civil servant who quotes Virginia Woolf as a gender - bending inspiration .
" Women fought for trousers ; we 're doing the same with the skirt . "
The self - proclaimed militants of Poitiers know it will be hard to change attitudes , even if they are grateful to David Beckham for having stepped out in a sarong .
For now , they must content themselves with buying their skirts online .
Prices for a male design ( and , yes , there are crucial differences : wider waist , narrower hips , absolutely no floral pattern ) range from € 100 ( £ 79 ) to €400 on specialist websites in Europe and the US .
For the male skirt movement is not restricted to France .
The bible of New York style , the Sartorialist , recently snapped men all over Europe wearing multicoloured kilt - like clobber .
One British representative , Tim Stannard , wears skirts most days .
He admits the " hostile " reactions of his friends and family were hard to cope with at first : " My little world is not ready for a man in a skirt , whatever style it is . "
But , after suffering a heart attack last year , Stannard is throwing caution to the wind .
" If I do n't do it now , " he remarks , " there probably wo n't be another chance . "

The October release date of Ubuntu 8.10 is fast approaching , yet until now , we do n’t know exactly what the finished product will look like .
I do n’t want to make any guesses , instead , I decided to collect 10 beautiful existing GTK 2.x themes that I think can be further improved or altered and be used as the default desktop theme for Intrepid Ibex .
Enjoy !
The upcoming release of Ubuntu 8.10 ( Intrepid Ibex ) is highly anticipated not only for the system enhancements it will likely get , but also for its new default theme .
The visual refresh is a long time coming , so I expect the Ubuntu artwork team is cooking something good for all of us .

“ Drill Baby Drill : ” Scary words from Sarah Palin , the “ Energy Expert ”
You might have paused a moment last month when John McCain said that Sarah Palin knows “ more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America . ”
Really ?
More than T. Boone Pickens ?
More than Brian Schweitzer ?
Research into that claim reveals that Sarah Palin was not entirely misleading when she stated that energy policy is her “ area of expertise . ”
She is the only candidate with bona fide energy experience .
Her understanding of domestic energy policy , however , has been vastly overstated .
Furthermore , following her prescription for energy “ independence , ” given her bias towards oil , would inevitably result in an even greater dependence on the dwindling resource .
Palin served as Chairwoman for 11 months on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , a board that regulates oil - field production in Alaska .
She is often credited with changing the rules on “ Big Oil ” in Alaska , which garnered high approval ratings and a proud “ maverick ” designation .
For decades , large oil companies have sat on vast natural gas reserves in northern Alaska .
Oil is more profitable than gas , however , so the companies are not in any hurry to tap into their gas resources and build necessary transport infrastructure .
Alaskans , on the other hand , are eager to see a natural gas pipeline built .
During Palin ’s gubernatorial campaign , she championed an “ all - Alaska ” pipeline , which would have opened opportunities to build the pipeline without having to wait for oil companies to act .
After her election , pragmatic changes in the project had to be made .
TransCanada is exploring building the pipeline , planning to eventually complete the project in about 10 years .
The company would charge producers a tariff .
Several problems have arisen since guaranteeing $ 500 million in public money to TransCanada for the project , the largest of which is that no clients have signed on to use the pipeline .
In fact , the three largest oil producers in the state – BP , ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil – have already said they will not use the pipeline , preferring instead to invest in their own .
While the pipeline project won Palin popularity , being the Governor of Alaska does not qualify her as an “ energy expert . ”
Yes , Alaska is an oil - rich state and a major contributor to US oil resources , but oil is just one energy source powering the US .
A few weeks ago Palin told Charlie Gibson :
Let me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to this table , Charlie , and that 's with the energy independence that I 've been working on for these years as the governor of this state that produces nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy , that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , overseeing the oil and gas development in our state to produce more for the United States .
According to factcheck.org , Alaska produced just 3.5 % of US domestic energy last year .
But even if Palin had said “ oil ” rather than “ energy , ” her statement would still have been misleading – Alaska produced roughly 14 % of US oil production , with just 4.8 % of the crude oil and petroleum supplied to the US in the last few years .
Although she has been widely criticized for factual inaccuracies , Palin is not intentionally trying to mislead the public with distorted numbers and delusions of grandeur .
She is unknowingly prejudiced towards oil because of her experience in Alaska .
It is her energy experience , in fact , that makes her unfit to create or advise our country ’s energy policies .
Alaska is wholly dependent on money generated by the state ’s energy industry .
Energy finances annual payouts which every Alaskan receives .
It provides the primary source of jobs and property taxes in the state , particularly in native villages and the Arctic .
Alaskans have not diversified their economy and the state has consequently failed to develop human capital and ingenuity .
Exclusive reliance on the “ easy ” money generated by fossil - fuel deposits has made Alaskans more dependent than ever on the money created by the energy industry .
With all of her attention going to oil and gas , Palin has n’t taken the time to learn much about alternative energy sources .
In a striking contradiction to what modern scientists have predicted and what T. Boone Pickens ’ wind energy project has proven , Palin said :
Alternative energy solutions are far from imminent and would require more than 10 years to develop .
More frightening still is her complete lack of long - term energy solutions :
I beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we can’t drill our way out of our problem .
Palin ’s over - touted energy “ experience ” is the wrong kind of knowledge for any leader who will be charged with securing a safe and prosperous future for our nation .
Between her desire to “ drill drill drill ” and McCain ’s misguided determination to rely heavily on nuclear energy as a means of energy independence , the GOP ticket ’s stance on energy is frightening .
There is no shortage of innovative and brilliant energy independence models proposed by people like Brian Schweitzer and T. Boone Pickens .
And Sarah Palin ’s limited experience with energy misses the point of energy independence entirely : we must find a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels and efficiently plan for a future with renewable energy sources .
I just saw McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds on CNN with a new line on Gov. Palin ’s foreign policy experience : McCain and Palin have more combined military command experience than Obama and Biden put together .
( ed.note :
We ’re actually getting a flood of emails from readers noting the whole interview in which CNN ’s Campbell Brown performed what amounted to a live vivisection of Bounds on live television .
It was pretty rough . )
Late Update : Okay , when we went back to the tape .
And the whole thing was so brutal , we decided to bring you the entire foreign policy segment of the interview .
The portion noted above comes at the end .
This one ’s really must - see …
On July 25 , 2008 , Governor Schwarzenegger made it official — California would be the first state to ban trans fat .
Food providers have been given a year after which the law requires them to replace hydrogenated oils with healthier , naturally occurring oils such as soya , palm , and vegetable oils .
The ban was prompted after the link between consumption of trans fat and diseases such as obesity , diabetes , and high levels of cholesterol was confirmed .
A similar , but less publicized dietary villain exists — High Fructose Corn Syrup ( HFCS ) .
The name may be slightly misleading to some -– the word corn may lead the consumer to believe that it is a naturally occurring substance , and fructose may lead one to confuse the compound HFCS with the fructose that occurs naturally in fruits .
On the contrary , it is an artificial substance that uses extract from corn merely as a base .
Corn extract is milled to form cornstarch , processed to form corn syrup ( mainly glucose ) and then modified by the addition of enzymes ( alpha - and gluco - amylase , and isomerases ) ; that convert glucose to fructose .
The production of this chemical also involves other complex steps , including genetic modification of the enzymes used to make them more stable at higher temperatures .
Despite the highly synthetic nature of HFCS , many manufacturers are allowed to use “ All Natural ” or “ 100 % Natural ” labeling in products that contain HFCS .
Published literature has suggested a significant correlation between the consumption of foods containing HFCS and obesity , diabetes and high cholesterol .
Fructose also interferes with the absorption of essential minerals like Copper , magnesium and iodine .
After fructose is absorbed in the intestine , it metabolized in the liver .
When the liver processes large amounts of fructose , byproducts such as triglycerides , carbon molecules and other precursors to lipid formation are released .
These freely circulating triglycerides and lipid molecules aggregate over time and are ultimately converted to fat — which leads to weight gain and obesity .
The by products of fructose metabolism also increase the risk of blood clots , high cholesterol and heart disease .
Fructose ( when consumed in high concentration ) also limits the cells ’ capability to absorb glucose by interfering with the insulin receptors .
This causes high blood glucose levels , which may convert to diabetes .
Scientists agree that the evidence is not conclusive , and further research is necessary .
However , it is also true that the consumption of HFCS has increased greater than 1000 % from 1970 to 2007 .
The large consumption amount ( USDA approximates 40 lbs per capita in 2007 ) is certainly alarming .
Another disturbing aspect is the unexpected places where HFCS shows up .
It is fairly common knowledge that juices and sodas are sweetened with it instead of sugar , but not everyone expects HCFS to be present in breads , soups and salad dressings !
Despite the indications that HFCS is potentially detrimental to health and may be responsible for obesity and heart disease , a ban is unlikely ( read impossible ) to come by anytime soon .
HFCS is cheaper and easier to transport than sugar , may be used in solid or liquid form — so it can be used in a variety of food products .
High tariff placed on sugar exported from other countries and active lobbying by the corn industry magnates will sustain and encourage the large - scale production of HFCS .
Ultimately , it is up to us to control our personal health by choosing to eat healthier and by making informed choices .
We can stay in touch with the literature and expert opinion , and then decide what we want to include in our diet .

Believe it or not , this beautiful Gorenje fridge is an official Apple - licensed Made for iPod refrigerator .
And believe it or not , it 's not just a speaker and a dock glued to a glossy black fridge :
You can control the fridge itself using your iPod touch or iPhone using an application called iGorenj , which in fact can control all kinds of Gorenje appliances - from the washing machine to the oven - as you can see in the user interface gallery .

The application is not built for iPhone / iPod touch , however , but is served from a home server that controls the appliances directly .
This allows you to not only use the iPod touch , but also any other web device in your home Wi -Fi network .
The program allows you to program the devices using a very easy to use graphical user interface .
Click to viewFor example , you can set your oven to cook a type of cake by just visually selecting a recipe and clicking start .
In fact , you can even get recipes straight from the server itself .
The only bad thing : the iPod dock thingie is taking the place of the built - in draught beer system , which in my book is quite - 20 points .

The backbone of the Defcon network consists of a Cisco fiber switch ( second box from top ) .
The firewall ( bottom server ) is a quad - core Xeon running OpenBSD and employing pf to filter and shape traffic .
LAS VEGAS – Over 9,000 hackers , freaks , feds and geeks are gathered in Las Vegas for Defcon , the world 's largest computer security convention .
The temporary wireless network that serves the Defcon attendees is the most hostile on the planet .
Defcon 's network is put together and run by a group of dedicated volunteers , known as Goons .
These red badge - sporting Network Goons work hard to make the network robust enough to handle the endless stream of dangerous traffic .
Threat Level got the first ever photo tour of the Defcon Network Operations Center .
Here are the photos for your viewing pleasure .
Defcon 's 20 megabit internet connection runs over a point - to - point wireless link to another hotel that has a point - of - presence in the basement .
This year 's connection was the fastest so far , twice as fast as Defcon 15 .
Defcon uses around 40 of these Aruba AP - 70 wireless access points .
The AP - 70s have very little network functionality other than being a radio .
When powered on they connect to the main management system to pull their configuration .
This makes them very easy to update remotely .
The router and firewall is kept physically secure by a combination of a locked chain - link fence and an armed guard posted 24 hours a day .
Network Goon David Bryan watches over his systems in the demarcation point .
Like all other Defcon Goons he volunteers his time and energy to keep Defcon running smoothly .
* A Cacti traffic graph shows the 20 megabit internet link being saturated multiple times each day .
At the time this photo was taken the Defcon network had transfered over 57 gigabytes in from the internet . *
A heat map shows the estimated wireless coverage at Defcon .
Each access point assigns a user to one of 50 virtual LANs .
As the user moves from one coverage area to another , they remain on the same virtual LAN .
Heather and David Bryan along with their dog Tomoe , an 18 - month - old live scent rescue dog in training , stand in front of a larger - than - life sized cutout of Derek Anderson , the creator of Defcon TV .
Anderson was unable to make it to Defcon this year due to his current battle with cancer .
Heather is co-chair of NOC management and helps run the wireless network , David runs the firewall and Tomoe runs the NOC .

tree -> generator in Common Lisp with cl-cont 2008-09-01
I ’ve decided to try Slava Akhmechet ’s cl-cont , a continuations library for Common Lisp .
My little example for this purpose was to port the tree -> generator function from Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days to Common Lisp .
This function takes a tree and returns a function that will successively yield the leaves of the tree .
Here ’s the code :
( defun / cc tree -> generator ( tree ) ( let ( generate - leaves ) ( setf generate - leaves ( lambda ( caller ) ( labels ( ( recur ( tree ) ( cond ( ( null tree ) ) ; empty leaf : continue ( ( consp tree ) ; recurse into branches ( recur ( car tree ) ) ( recur ( cdr tree ) ) ) ( ' otherwise ; leaf with a value : ( call / cc ( lambda ( rest - of - tree ) ;; update generator ( setf generate - leaves ( lambda ( new - caller ) ( setf caller new - caller ) ( funcall rest - of - tree ) ) ) ;; return the value ( funcall caller tree ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( recur tree ) ) ( funcall caller nil ) ) ) ; return value after exhaustion ( lambda ( ) ( call / cc generate - leaves ) ) ) )
The comments are my own , so I could understand how this function works .
I did also add the explicit caller argument to generate - leaves , keeping variables as local as possible is generally a good thing ( and I did n’t like those dummy values ) .
These changes are n’t specific to CL , I did a Scheme version with those too .
There was one problem that took me quite some time to solve : ( SETF SYMBOL-FUNCTION ) will always operate on the global binding , so I could n’t use LABELS to define generate - leaves .
Therefore , I had to use this trick of splitting the definition into a LET and a SETF to get a local function definition that could modify its own binding .
In contrast , porting the continuations stuff was easy : that worked just like in Scheme .
Here ’s a little usage example :
CL - USER > ( defparameter * g* ( tree-> generator '( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 ( 4 5 ) ) ) ) ) * G* CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) 1 CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) 2 CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) 3 CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) 4 CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) 5 CL - USER > ( funcall * g*) NIL
Henrietta Moraes was a friend of artist Francis Bacon
Enlarge Image
A Francis Bacon portrait is expected to fetch £ 7.5 m when it is sold at Christie 's auction house in London .
The 1969 work is of socialite Henrietta Moraes , who sat for several artists , was one of a small number of women that Bacon painted .
Christie 's Pilar Ordovas said the " wonderful " portrait " offers a fascinating insight into life and the characters of 1960s Soho " .
The post -war and contemporary art sale takes place on 19 October .
Ordovas became a close friend and Soho drinking partner of Bacon during the 1950s , before he found fame .
The model , who died in 1998 , inscribed the reverse of the canvas which is being sold .
She was also painted by Lucian Freud .
The work has been owned by Garech Browne , a member of the Guinness brewing dynasty , since 1970 .
Mr Browne went on to become a patron of the arts .
In May Bacon 's Triptych masterpiece broke the artist 's record at auction after selling for $ 86.3 m ( £ 43 m ) in New York .
Bacon , who died in 1992 , is currently the subject of a retrospective at Tate Britain .
Contrary to stereotypes about sexual performance and masculinity , men interviewed in a large international study reported that being seen as honorable , self - reliant and respected was more important to their idea of masculinity than being seen as attractive , sexually active or successful with women .
The study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine included interviews with more than 27,000 randomly selected men from eight countries ( Germany , U.S. , U.K. , Spain , Brazil , Mexico , Italy and France ) , with about 16 percent of the men reporting erectile problems .
Regardless of age or nationality , the men more frequently ranked good health , harmonious family life and good relationships with their wife or partner as more important to their quality of life than material , self - fulfilling or purely sexual concerns .
There was no significant difference in rankings of masculinity and quality of life characteristics between men who experienced erectile dysfunction and those who did not .
The study , part of the Men's Attitudes to Life Events and Sexuality ( MALES ) project , aimed to determine characteristics of masculinity and quality of life in men with and without self - reported erectile dysfunction , and how those ideas of masculinity might affect seeking help and treatment .
" Many meanings , positive and negative , are attached to the term , ' masculinity , ' " said Julia Heiman , director of The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and an author of this study .
" To ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research .
These results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know . "
Findings of the study include :
Overall , being seen as honorable was considered the most important quality in the construct of masculinity .
Compared to men without erectile dysfunction , the experience of erectile dysfunction neither increased nor decreased the importance men placed on having an active sex life or having success with women , although men with erectile dysfunction reported less satisfaction with their sex lives .
Men who seek treatment for erectile dysfunction do not differ in their views of masculinity from those who do not seek help .
" Being seen as a man of honor " was cited as the most important attribute of masculine identity in Spain , Brazil , Mexico , United States and France , while " being in control of your own life " was the most important in Germany , the United Kingdom and Italy .
The findings emphasize that men across cultures and ages value couple relationships over purely sexual pleasure and indicate that men are particularly concerned about their partnered relationships , whether or not they report erectile dysfunction .

I was reading this post at OpenLeft about Senator Obama attack on McCain for caring more about foreign countries then American jobs , Obama Asks Whether McCain Is Putting “ Country First ”
“ Just ask the machinists in Pennsylvania who build Harley - Davidsons , ” Obama said of McCain ’s record .
“ Because John McCain did n’t just oppose the requirement that the government buy American - made motorcycles , he called Buy American provisions ‘ disgraceful . ’
Just ask the workers across this country who have seen their jobs outsourced .
The very companies that shipped their jobs overseas have been rewarded with billions of dollars in tax breaks that John McCain supports and plans to continue .
“ So , when American workers hear John McCain talking about putting ‘ Country First , ' ” Obama said , “ it ’s fair to ask — which country ? ”
Besides thinking it is about time a Democratic leader started pointing out how Republicans are frequently all talk about America first and usually come up short on actually putting America first , it reminded me of Bush and McCain plan to outsource American port management to the United Arab Emirates .
Mr. McFreedom had this to say , McCain : Port Sale Overblown Since UAE is ‘ Freer Than China ’
According to the Freedom House ’s 2006 Global Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties , China scores the worst rating ( 7 ) for political rights and a 6 for civil liberties .
Overall , it receives a rating of “ Not Free . ”
It ’s actually a feat to be less free than China — only 7 countries of 192 do it .
The UAE is also rated “ Not Free , ” scoring a 6 for both political rights and civil liberties .
Some other human rights bastions who are “ freer than China ” : Iran , the Congo , Cote d’Iviore , and Rwanda .
Also reported during this controversy was that the UAE was n’t very cooperative after 9 - 11 with Treasury Department efforts to track down Bin Laden ’s bank accounts and the UAE was one of the few countries to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan ’s official governing body .
Why do Republicans hate America ?
I do n’t know .
Obama - Biden have also been running an ad about how out of touch with modern business and technology McCain is .
The Right in another mouth foaming episode of false outrage is claiming Obama owes McCain an apology .
According to an old article McCain is unable to use a keyboard because of his disabilities .
Maybe he can’t and that is certainly unfortunate , but that should n’t keep him from being more in touch with a major portion of the U.S. economy and communications .
Matter of fact PCs / MACs and the net have been a boon to the disabled , McCain Computer Ignorance Raises New Questions : Can His Injured Hands Type ?
Whether McCain ’s physical limitations are part of what is keeping him from using computers remains to be seen , but if so , there are a lot of assistive devices out there for using computers for people who have injuries or disabilities : certain types of mice , voice activation software , special keyboards , keyboard usage training , etc . [ ]
… As Sarah Lai Stirland of Wired News noted , Rahm Emanuel explained in Friday ’s media conference call about the ad , “ There ’s a whole economic revolution going on that has fundamentally changed the economy and fundamentally changed people ’s lives , and he ’s removed from that . ”
British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking suffers from Lou Gehrig ’s Disease , uses a computer and has his own web site .
The Right ’s relentless attempts to exploit everything from lipstick to disabilities to milk public sympathy is getting tiresome .
It is all clearly a way of deflecting attention away from their abysmal record of governance and McCain ’s desire to govern in that tradition .
It does n’t occur to the Right that Obama is simply pointing out a lack of knowledge , while McCain supporters are claiming that John is a helpless old man .
What is the Right ’s version of McCain going to do if he gets in the White House , cry to Jonah Goldberg when Putin says “ e- mail me ” to McCain , make him stop .
Update : John Cole has a photo of McCain using a Blackberry .
So he can find ways to use technology if he wants to .
H/T to a commenter over at TBogg who remembers that McCain did return to active duty after Nam and this photo shows the instrument panel of the kind of plane McCain worked with , the A - 7 Corsair .
The rightie blogs are having a real hissy fit .
They should know by now not to march blindly to the likes of Jonah Goldberg and Glenn Reynolds .
Palin ’s economics talk was awful , but the real point is that McCain , calling on his experience and best judgment picked her .
Having done so , the McC Squad prepared her for this interview and that ’s the best McCain prepers could do .
Experience is n’t the absolute end all as far as qualifications go , McCain has proved his experience gap by letting One Heart Beat Away Palin be an example of how he ’ll conduct his presidency , Maverick Budgeting
But it is telling that the woman John McCain chose as his running mate does n’t seem to understand what “ entitlements ” are .
Clearly , just as most citizens do n’t know what the Bush Doctrine is , most people probably are n’t all that familiar with the meaning of the entitlement / discretionary distinction in federal budgeting .
But it ’s a big deal for people who actually pay attention to political and policy issues in the United States .
Matt is right of course .
Many voters could care less about the actual details of governing and policy .
They care about phony arguments over quaint analogies and manufactured outrage .

McCain Campaign Officials Lobbied For Companies At Center of Sex - For-Oil Scandal
The office of Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner on Monday afternoon said that it is limiting the functionality of its web site after its tech department had detected a security breach .
“ Due to security concerns experienced by the Secretary of State ’s website , full functionality of the website has been suspended to protect the integrity of state records and data .
Full functionality will be restored when we are assured that all data has been protected to acceptable levels of security , ” Brunner said in a statement issued Monday afternoon .
“ Our focus is and has always been to protect the vote of every eligible Ohio voter from any kind of fraud , be it voter registration fraud , illegal voting or vote suppression .
This action has been taken to detect and prosecute any illegal breach of our voting infrastructure to maintain voter confidence . "
" What we know is our IT department detected a situation with our Web site where there was somehow suspicious activity where someone could have gotten into our site and tried to move things around , " a spokesman told The Cleveland Plain Dealer Monday afternoon .
The office 's statement noted that " this is not the first instance of direct assault on the operations of the Secretary of State 's office . "
The office has been barraged with phone calls and e-mails " with menacing messages and even threats of harm or death , " according to the statement .
The Ohio SOS ' office says that it recently received a suspicious unidentified powder , and that all of these incidents are under investigation .
Brunner , a Democrat , and her office are embroiled in a bitter dispute with the state Republican Party , which filed a lawsuit earlier this year demanding that her office release a list of new voter registrations that do n't match state and federal database records .
The U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled last Tuesday that
Brunner had to provide election boards with the lists of voter information that did n't match state databases of drivers ' license information or social security databases .
But Brunner argued in an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court that mismatches could appear because of trivial reasons such as typos , and that the last minute challenges at the polls could increase tension , the potential for confusion , and long lines .
Moreover , the
Republican party had two years to challenge the screening process , but had n't moved to do so until now , she argued .
The high court on Friday stayed the lower court decision reasoning that the Republican Party was n't likely to prevail in its lawsuit .
The state Republican party then turned around and filed another lawsuit to achieve a similar goal of verification in state court .
Briefs from both sides are due this Friday .
Ohio has 20 electoral votes , and is a battleground state .
President
Bush won Ohio in 2004 by 118,457 votes out of 5.6 million cast amid a chaotic scene of long lines , and voting machine shortages and malfunctions .
Voter registration records this year in Ohio show record levels of registrations .
The state reported last week that it has registered more than eight million voters .
The state registered just under eight million voters last November 2004 .
The office did not return a follow - up phone call with questions about why a web site hack would affect the office 's records and data .
__Update : __The state lawsuit has been dropped .
But The Next Right 's Soren Dayton writes in to note that Brunner has actually lost two other disputes with the Republicans .
As reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer :
On Oct. 2 , Ohio Republicans won a separate court fight with Brunner over absentee ballots cast by McCain supporters .
The state 's Supreme
Court countermanded Brunner 's order that local election boards reject the ballots if the applicant had n't checked a box indicating he or she was a " qualified voter " when submitting the absentee ballot .
And from * The Columbus Dispatch * :
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner must order counties to allow observers at sites where early absentee voting is taking place , the Ohio Supreme Court ruled today in a 4 - 3 opinion .
Brunner , a Democrat , had advised county boards of elections not to allow observers where in - person absentee ballots were being cast .

We launched Project Kenai very quietly last Friday .
It ’s a developer hub with SCM and issue tracking and forums and all the other stuff you ’d expect .
We built it because we needed it , but it ’s open for use by the world for free .
For a newborn infant , it looks pretty good .
Anyone can visit , but to create a project requires an invitation , which I have some of ; contact me if you want one .
There are lots of interesting things about Kenai ; among other things , it ’s a Rails app .
Herewith the details .
[ Update : Nick Sieger responds to heat over “ control ” . ]
Disclosure · I was in on some of the project planning at the beginning , and have been on some of the mailing lists , but really can’t claim any credit .
On the other hand , I think I was the first person to suggest , back when this was getting started , that we do it in Rails .
Once the shock wore off , there was little pushback .
Nick ’s
Take · I went and pestered the engineers to blog about the actual technology but they claimed they were busy .
So I tracked down Nick Sieger , one of the ringleaders , and got him to spill the beans in an interview format .
Tim :
My understanding is that Kenai is competition for GoogleCode and GitHub and so on .
Is that right ?
Nick :
You could look at it that way , and at face value that ’s certainly true , however it ’s not our goal to directly compete with those services .
Kenai is a recognition by Sun that , as the largest open source company in the world , we need to take control of our own destiny .
We need a place to nurture and grow our open source communities that we ourselves can control ; we need to demonstrate credibility in building on top of more traditional LAMP / SAMP web stacks ( not just Java EE ) ; and we need to show viability of Sun technologies and hardware for next - generation web applications .
By launching , I think we ’re well on the way toward showing progress toward those goals .
Where we go from here is going to be a blend of what the community asks of us and our own ideas for what we think would be cool new features to build on top of a collaboration portal that no one else has done yet .
Tim :
What ’s your role ?
Nick : I ’m the lead developer .
Some might accuse me of being the architect as well , however I believe that the project ’s architecture is a shared responsibility for which I serve as ringleader .
We ’re learning a lot as we go , myself included of course .
Tim :
The sound - bite is , it ’s a reasonably conventional Rails app with a stew of OSS components and Sun- flavored technology behind and underneath .
Want to give us a tour ?
Nick :
We ’re using Sun T2000 servers along with an X4500 for storage .
OpenSolaris Nevada 70b is the OS .
( We have n’t been able to upgrade to OpenSolaris with IPS yet because there is no SPARC port of IPS .
We ’re eagerly awaiting it though . )
Apache runs in front , using mod_proxy_balancer to connect to multiple redundant Glass Fish V2 instances talking to a single MySQL database .
The main site is a Rails application running on JRuby , deployed in Glass Fish as a war file built with Warbler .
Perl , Python , and other various bits of Apache - based bailing wire help integrate Mercurial , Subversion , Sympa ( mailing list software ) and Bugzilla into the mix as well .
Also , my teammate Fernando Castano just gave a great overview of our system at RailsConf Europe last week .
His slides are available if you missed the presentation .
Tim : How much Rails experience on the team , going in ?
Nick : I had a couple years of Rails experience , but not on any full - time projects .
Rails and Ruby were an entirely new thing for the rest of the team .
Tim :
What were the really hard parts ?
Nick : Not surprisingly , Rails is not one of them .
Beyond the initial learning curve of the “ magic ” that is Ruby and Rails , most of the difficulties were in making system configurations uniform and deployments repeatable .
We got the feeling of being one of the first to build this kind of application with this combination of Sun and other open source technologies .
We hope to help ensure that other people wo n’t have to feel the pain we went through to build on top of this stack , because now that we ’ve got it up and running , we think this could be a great base for building highly scalable web applications .
Tim :
If you were doing it again , what parts of the design would you change ?
Nick :
It ’s too early to give a definitive answer .
Application - wise , there will continue to be things in the user interface we want to change .
Deployment pains have been part of the problem , and having a rock - solid approach for that from day one would have been a big win .
Systems configuration and automation still seems to be the secret story that you do n’t hear much about .
Tim :
What are you guys working on now ?
Nick :
In the near term , we want to beef up the feature set to make it more usable for daily development by students and open source projects .
We want to add a files facility to host project binaries and downloads .
We want to add JIRA as an issue tracking option and Git as an SCM option .
An incremental refresh of the site navigation and layout is also in progress .
Finally , we want to establish a pattern of responding to community feedback by releasing frequently .
You can post feedback in the site forums or visit kenai.uservoice.com to vote for your pet feature or improvement that you ’d like added to the site .
What I ’m Doing · I transferred mod-atom to Kenai ; not much to report yet .
Setting up the project and dumping it into Subversion and checking it out again and adding another committer and making a couple of changes ; it all worked , and was snappy , big deal .
The world needs there to be a small number of developer hubs in active competition ; the state of the art is young and there are lots of low - hanging fruit , so I expect rapid progress from Kenai and its competitors .
Market Summary
At Close 5:06 PM ET : In Europe , the indexes closed down at the end of the day 's trading , with the DAX having fallen the most , by 100.00 % .

When we got Newsweek 's all - about - Sarah issue this week , the most intriguing part was one of the pictures .
In the old days , you flew the flag , and you respected it .
You did n't walk on it , burn it , or dress up in it .
Protesters tried to show disrespect in various ways during Vietnam , and conservatives felt especially strongly about it .
So , it was jarring to see this picture of Sarah Palin , wrapped in the flag , posing .
It seems to have been taken back when she was mayor of Wasilla .
Newsweek did n't comment on it .
We have n't really kept up with shifting views on the flag in pop culture .
Are conservatives looser about the flag now ?
Like , future vice - presidents can use it as a cloak when they pose for pix ?
When women say Palin is just like them -- do they dress up in American flags ?
Would it be ok for Obama to do that ?
Or would he be behaving like an unpatriotic celebrity ?
How do you print a picture like this without discussing it ?

“ In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man , brave , hated and scorned .
When his cause succeeds , the timid join him , for then it costs nothing to be a patriot . ” – Mark Twain
Sept. 4 , 2008  --
Nearly two dozen former judges and prosecutors urged Texas Gov. Rick Perry to grant a temporary reprieve to a death row inmate whose claim that the judge and prosecutor in his case had an affair was scheduled to be heard in court two days after his execution .
A state judge had scheduled a hearing to determine whether Verla Sue Holland , the judge in Charles Dean Hood 's death penalty trial , and former Collin County District Attorney Tom O'Connell must give depositions about their reported affair .
But the hearing was scheduled for Sept. 12 -- two days after Hood is scheduled to die for a 1989 double murder .
Robert Dry , the judge hearing the case , recused himself from the case Wednesday , citing a prior business relationship with Holland 's husband , throwing an already complicated case into uncertainty again .
Hood 's case will be reassigned to another judge , who will decide when to hold the hearing , said his lawyer Greg Wiercioch .
Wiercioch criticized
Dry for only recusing himself after he had made several important rulings in the case , including setting the hearing date after the scheduled execution .
" It 's disturbing that no one is touching this , " he said .
" It 's a hot potato that everyone 's passing around .
We 're a week away from execution and we do n't have a judge . "
Dry could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday .
In a letter sent to Hood 's attorneys last month , he said he knew Holland and O'Connell and said he would consider recusing himself if Hood 's lawyers asked .
They did n't take him up on the proposal .
Holland and O'Connell have not commented on the allegations .
Neither returned calls from ABC News .
In a letter sent today to the Texas governor , 22 former judges and prosecutors , including the former chief judge of the federal Third Circuit Court of Appeal and the former attorneys general of Maryland and Tennessee , called the setting of Hood 's hearing date " inexplicable . "
If the allegations of an affair are true , they said , Hood 's constitutional right to a fair trial was violated .
" It is an irrevocable wrong to send a man to his death without ever hearing this critical evidence , " the letter stated .
A Governor 's Office spokeswoman said Perry had received the letter but had not yet made a decision in the case .
Hood , 39 , was scheduled to be executed in June after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal rejected a bid to overturn his conviction , saying Hood had raised the issue of the reported affair too late in the appeals process for it to be considered .
After a flurry of last - minute legal filings , the execution was delayed in June because state prison officials said they had run out of time to carry out the execution by the midnight deadline .
His lawyers filed a request last month to question Holland and O'Connell under oath in a civil proceeding as a precursor to a possible civil lawsuit .
Dry scheduled a hearing to decide if Holland and O'Connell can be questioned , but refused to speed up the process to take into account pending Hood 's execution .
" It is unlikely that these depositions will lead to civil litigation that will be concluded before the execution of your client , " he wrote in a letter to Hood 's lawyers .
" In reality , you are exploring a civil lawsuit for the estate of Mr. Hood . "
Collin County Assistant District Attorney John Rolater said Hood 's lawyers " have n't established the right to derail this at this late hour .
They seem to be grossly abusing the system , filing improper motions in improper courts . "
A former Collin County assistant district attorney has said in a sworn statement filed earlier this year with Hood 's criminal appeal that it was " common knowledge " that Holland and O'Connell had a romantic relationship .
Holland , who is now retired , went on to serve on the Court of Criminal Appeals .
Legal experts have told ABC News that an affair between a trial court judge and prosecutor would be a clear violation of Hood 's constitutional right to a fair trial .
In a concurring opinion , four judges on the Court of Criminal Appeals said that information about the reported affair was available years ago , but that Hood 's lawyers never raised the issue .
They said the affidavit from the former assistant district attorney did n't add significant new information about the reported affair .
Hood was convicted of the 1989 fatal shooting of his boss Ronald Williamson and Williamson 's girlfriend , Traci Wallace .
Hood was arrested in Indiana a day after the killing .
He had Williamson 's car , jewelry , camera , wallet , credit cards and clothing on him at the time of the arrest , according to the Texas Attorney General 's Office .
In Chapter 8 of Programming Erlang , there is a short example that performs a rough measurement of the time it takes to spawn a given number of processes .
Check the book if you want to see the code that genereates the test , but I just wanted to share the results from two different architectures .
I first ran the test on an Intel Core2 Duo @ 2.40 GHz , 1.0 GB RAM with Windows XP SP2 .
I first spawned 5,000 processes , then 10,000 and finally 20,000 .
The results are not bad on this machine .
4 > processes : max ( 5000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =3.0 ( 3.2 ) microseconds 5 > processes : max ( 10000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =4.7 ( 4.7 ) microseconds 6 > processes : max ( 20000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =4.7 ( 4.7 ) microseconds
I then ran the same test on my Sun Blade 100 system .
The system runs Solaris 10 and the base architecture is a UltraSparc IIe processor with 512 MB of RAM .
The results are below .
2> processes : max ( 5000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =18.0 ( 28.2 ) microseconds 3 > processes : max ( 10000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =18.0 ( 26.0 ) microseconds 4 > processes : max ( 20000 ) .
Maximum allowed processes : 32768
Process spawn time =17.5 ( 25.75 ) microseconds
I was really impressed with performance .
Even though the Blade 100 is just a single CPU and it has half the memory , the performance was not bad at all compared with the Core 2 Duo .
[ sigh ]
One day I ’d love to write heavy duty server software running on one of these beasts :

BabyIDE – A New Interactive Development Environment 6 September , 2008
Trygve Reenskaug wrote to the Squeak dev mailing list to announce the release of BabyIDE , an IDE which which runs on Squeak Smalltalk , and is based on his exploration of a new development paradigm , called DCI .
The aim of the DCI ( Data - Context - Interaction ) paradigm is to minimise any gaps between the programmer ’s mental model of the program and the program that is actually stored and executed in the computer , by presenting system operations as networks of communicating objects .
Trygve , who is based at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo , has written a detailed overview ( pdf ) of the thinking behind his work on BabyIDE and BabyUML .
Large Chicago law firm Jones Day is suing a tiny Internet startup called BlockShopper over the use of the humble hyperlink .
But BlockShopper has picked up a pair of allies in the form of the EFF and Public Citizen , and the two groups jointly filed an amici curiae brief with the court that points out the obvious : " linking is what web sites do — that is , after all , why it is called the ' World Wide Web ' . "
BlockShopper 's transgression , such as it is , appears to be the posting of public information .
The site shows which partners , lawyers , philanthropists , and executives have purchased properties in specific city neighborhoods , and it incurred Jones Day 's legal wrath after showing the new purchases of two Jones Day lawyers .
The company sued on trademark grounds , claiming that the use of its name and web link on the site were illegal .
Last Friday , two public interest groups have stepped up to the plate and weighed in on the case because of its implications for the Web .
The BlockShopper case has " potentially significant implications for other online speakers , " says their filing , which is putting it mildly .
BlockShopper.com
Should the case go in Jones Day 's favor , the entire nature of the Web could be attacked by companies looking to harass bloggers or stifle criticism .
Creating a " permission - based " culture of linking would strike at the Web 's key feature .
As the filing notes , " if Jones Day 's trademark theory were correct , no news site or blog could use marks to identify markholders , or links to point to further information about the markholders , without risking a lawsuit .
" But , " the filing continues , " Jones Day is wrong . "
Fair use
For one thing , the brief disputes Jones Day 's claim that BlockShopper 's use of its trademark is " confusing . "
( " No reasonable consumers could look at the headline in the article ... and be confused about whether they were looking at a web site sponsored by Jones Day , " it says . )
But , more importantly , trademark law contains a long - standing limit known as " nominative fair use . "
As the name suggests , this allows writers , competitors , and people talking around the water cooler to use trademarked names ( " Apple , " " Xerox , " " Hoover " ) for the purpose of naming something accurately .
This is allowed so long as the use is truly needed to identify a service or product , it was only used enough to identify the product or service , and no endorsement from the trademark owner is implied .
It 's one of the key arguments that BlockShopper made in its own motion to dismiss the case , filed last Friday .
Oddly enough , the nominative fair use exception has roots in the boy band " New Kids on the Block , " which sued several newspapers back in 1992 for running a 900 - number poll that asked questions like , " Which one of the New Kids is the most popular ? "
A Ninth Circuit judge noted that " most useful social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement suit every time they made reference to a person , company or product by using its trademark . "
Piercing the veil
So is Jones Day just out to play a little hardball with a site that was making some public - yet - still - sorta - " private " financial information known ?
It 's impossible to judge motives , but the law firm has been aggressive in its filing , extending them to include personal liability for the two cofounders of BlockShopper , which is an LLC , simply because they run the site .
BlockShopper 's attack on this point is full of finely - honed outrage ( individuals who work for companies cannot be held personally liable for corporate actions except in extraordinary circumstances ) .
" Based on Jones Day 's paper - thin allegations against [ the cofounders of BlockShopper ] , " reads the motion , " there is no basis to pierce the corporate veil of BlockShopper LLC and attach any personal liability to these members of the LLC . "
The motion requests the entire case to be thrown out ; with both sides having filed and amici weighing in , it 's now up to a federal judge here in Chicago to determine if the case actually goes to trial .

On Saturday morning in Andover , Massachusetts , as about 120 activists , adademics , constitutional scholars , public officials and legal experts gathered in the Wyndham hotel , the building suddenly went dark .
Electricity had been cut off just prior to the start of a landmark war crimes conference , the goal of which was to plan the prosecution of Bush Administration officials .
The first of its kind conference , already featuring a laundry - list of notable speakers , was suddenly in flux …
If only for a few moments .
“ We were already so effective , the government tried to shut us down , ” said conference organizer Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , in an interview with RAW STORY .
“ Of course , when I said that at the conference opener , the power had been restored .
I was only joking , ” said Velvel with a slightly nervous laugh .
“ A fuse box fried , but the local electric company fixed it before we even began . ”
The ‘ Bush war crimes conference , ’ according to its organizers , is a “ throwback to the framers of the constitution , ” which aims to establish “ necessary organizational structures ” to pursue those guilty of war crimes “ to the ends of the Earth . ”
“ The framers did n’t trust the federal government either , ” said Velvel .
“ And oddly enough , over the years and decades , a strong distrust of government was once a Republican position .
It was , at least , in theory .
And then Bush came along and there ’s this , well , my country , love it or leave it in the GOP …
But now , you have people on the other side of the spectrum taking that very position .
“ This is a conservative idea , to hold conferences and then take action to take power .
Liberalism has been made fun of as mere self expression .
I was very impressed by the desire in this group to take action . ”
“ This is not a campaign event , ” said Professor Christopher Pyle of Mt. Holyoke College , during his speech to the conference .
“ It is a conference about how to restore governmental accountability in the wake of a criminal administration .
It addresses the most serious crisis in our nation ’s history — the claim that the president and his secret agents can get away with torture , kidnapping , and even manslaughter . ”
The two day affair was divided in half : Speakers on Saturday , and planning on Sunday .
Chief among the academics , legal experts and whistle - blowers speaking in Andover was Vincent Bugliosi , best known for successfully prosecuting Charles Manson and penning the subsequent novel , Helter Skelter .
His new book , The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , is currently available at retail .
Watch Bugliosi ’s opening statement to a July , 2008 House Judiciary Committee hearing on the limits of executive authority :
Other speakers included :
Phillippe Sands , Professor of Law and Director of the Centre of International Courts and Tribunals at University College , London .
He is the author of “ Torture Team : Rumsfeld ’s Memo and the Betrayal of American Values ” ( Penguin / Palgrave Macmillan ) , among other works .
Jordan Paust , Professor of Law at the University of Houston and author of “ Beyond The Law . ”
Ann Wright , a former U.S. Army colonel and U.S. Foreign Service official who holds a State Department Award for Heroism and who taught the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Land Warfare at the Special Warfare Center at Ft. Bragg , N.C.
She is the coauthor of “ Dissent : Voices of Conscience . ”
Peter Weiss , Vice President of the Center For Constitutional Rights , which was recently involved with war crimes complaints filed in Germany and France against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others .
Benjamin Davis , Associate Professor at the University of Toledo College of Law and former American Legal Counsel for the Secretariat of the International Court of Arbitration .
David Lindorff , journalist and co-author with Barbara Olshansky of “ The Case for Impeachment : Legal Arguments for Removing President George W. Bush from Office ” ( St. Martin ’s Press ) .
Colleen Costello of Human Rights USA .
Christopher Pyle , a professor at Mt. Holyoke and author of several books on international matters
“ We need to revers[ e ] a fifty - year trend towards unaccountable secret government , which can commit crimes with impunity , ” said Pyle in a release .
“ ‘ Sending a clear signal to future Cabinet - level officials that ours is still a government under law , and that they had better obey the criminal law , no matter what their president and his legal lackeys say , ’ is a matter of overwhelming importance . ”
While video of the conference was broadcast live via UStream.tv , the footage is currently unavailable on the Internet .
Conference organizers told RAW STORY that a series of DVD ’s will be offered for sale at cost to interested parties .
Online footage of the conference will also be made available Friday , Sept. 19 , at a Web site address yet to be announced .
“ Later this week we will establish a central committee which will decide which of the many ideas we came up with are practical , and we will begin asking people to undertake particular actions , ” said Velvel .
“ Once those first steps are carried out , as I hope it will be , that will be the first major accomplishment of this conference . ”
The plans , which will be released in a media advisory later this week , considered :
What international and domestic crimes were committed , which facts show crimes under which laws , and what punishments are possible .
Which high level Executive officials — and Federal judges and legislators as well , if any — are chargeable with crimes .
Which international tribunals , foreign tribunals and domestic tribunals ( if any ) can be used and how to begin cases and / or obtain prosecutions before them .
The possibility of establishing a Chief Prosecutor ’s Office such as the one at Nuremburg .
An examination of cases already brought and their outcomes .
Creating an umbrella Coordinating Committee with representatives from the increasing number of organizations involved in war crimes cases .
Creating a Center to keep track of and organize compilations of relevant briefs , articles , books , opinions , and facts , etc. , on war crimes and prosecutions of war criminals .
Velvel told RAW STORY that several groups have been established to force some universities to hold hearings on whether faculty members should have their jobs terminated for participating in Bush Administration crimes .
“ John Yoo , the author of the infamous ‘ torture memo ’ who now works at Berkeley , comes quickly to mind , ” he added .
“ The consensus of attendees is President Bush ’s attack on Iraq is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and that he is culpable for this as well as for torture and abuse of war prisoners held by the U.S. military and the CIA , ” stated a media advisory .
Other conference cell groups plan to raise up groundswells of support for district attorney candidates who would be willing to investigate or prosecute Bush Administration crimes .
Conference attendees also plan to begin seeking disbarment proceedings against lawyers who assisted the administration in war crimes .
Additional measures , details of which were not immediately forthcoming , include utilizing foreign and International courts , and focused actions on state and local levels .
“ The idea of using foreign and International courts is not so dissimilar to the time [ Donald ] Rumsfeld had to flee France to avoid arrest on war crimes charges , ” said Velvel .
“ Of course , that was a foreign court , and he just went into Germany and was fine .
We were talking more about going to a true International court . ”
The Bush war crimes conference is in the tradition of Justice Robert H. Jackson , who prosecuted war criminals after World War II , writes Sherwood Ross .
“ The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people , ” said Justice Jackson .
“ It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched . ”
“ Obviously , we want to go beyond self expression , ” concluded Velvel .

Most useful to consumers will probably be the section titled " latest safety information " -- especially the part that allows people to search for information about drugs by name .
Drugs that carry FDA safety alerts are highlighted .
Now comes a new effort to make it easier for consumers and health professionals to find information about the FDA 's drug safety efforts on the Web .
Instead of searching all over the agency 's site , people can go to http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugSafety.htm .
The federal agency has taken several steps to address concerns , including issuing alerts about potential problems with drug safety earlier than in the past .
But critics complain it still is n't doing enough .
During the past several years , the Food and Drug Adminstration has come under a steady drumbeat of criticism for failing to adequately monitor the safety of drugs sold in the U.S .
To see actions the agency has recently taken regarding drug safety , go to public health advisories .
The actions are listed by date .
If you want to report an adverse reaction to a drug to the FDA , click on the MedWatch section and instructions on what to do will come up .
You can also find recent drug safety notices from the MedWatch system here .
For those of you who want to check the extensive data and recommendations that appear on drug labels , you can find that online by clicking here .
This is only part of what 's available through the new FDA site .
Go take a look and see for yourself what 's available .
It may be useful , some day , when you have an issue with a medication you 're taking or when you read a news item about drug safety .
Some cautions are in order .
Critics continue to fault the FDA for not doing enough to investigate and monitor drugs that raise safety concerns .
Some of the information listed on parts of the site can be quite technical .
And it 's a good idea , always , to talk to your doctor if you 're worried about the safety of drugs you 're taking or are experiencing troubling side effects .
The FDA was required to create the new drug safety Web resource by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 .

The spectacular mural on the outside of the Arizona operations centre
The Mars Phoenix Lander is in a race against time and temperatures as it struggles to resolve some key questions about the Red Planet .
The onset of the harsh Martian winter means that there is now less Sun to charge Phoenix 's batteries .
Researchers at the University of Arizona who are in charge of the mission are also struggling with the soil conditions as they try to sift the dirt for evidence of organic chemicals .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But they hope soon to activate the lander 's microphone and record the sounds of Mars for the first time .
Housed in a building that could easily pass as a tax office or library , the mission headquarters in Tucson is carving out a little piece of history : Phoenix marks the first time that a Mars Lander has been controlled by a university scientist , not by the boys at Nasa .
That scientist is Professor Peter Smith , the principal investigator on the mission .
Peter Smith ( far right ) celebrates the successful landing of Phoenix on Mars
This giant of a man , with a wit as dry as the Arizona desert , is hopeful that Phoenix can tackle two remaining problems before its batteries peter out .
" We are still valiantly searching for organic molecules .
We 'd love to be able to claim that we had found organic materials in the northern plains of Mars .
And that 's a key and most important ingredient of our search .
" But it 's also the hardest thing to find .
We are pushed right down to the wire in our last samples to try to make that case .
So I do n't know if that will happen or not , I hope so .
That would be big . "
Indeed it would .
Organics can be considered the " feedstock " of biochemistry .
In its endeavour to try to show the northern plains could be " habitable " , these carbon - rich molecules would represent a big tick mark .
" We are also trying to find the isotopic clues that we can find in water in terms of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio , " added Professor Smith .
Soil samples are dug up and delivered to the onboard labs for analysis
That 's a real key signature in telling us a lot about the history of water .
So if we can get the ratio of the ice and the water vapour just above it , we can see what the connection is between the atmospheric water and the ice underneath the surface .
" We think they are in equilibrium and that 's why there is ice under the surface .
" It 's my fervent hope to solve these two questions .
Will it happen ?
I do n't know , I 'm going to have to live the life and find out . "
Since it landed on the 25 May , Phoenix has twice had its mission extended .
But while it was able to operate for eight or 10 hours a day during the summer , the decline of the Sun in the Martian sky means the lander will struggle to recharge its batteries .
" We 're pretty sure we can limp along through mid-November , " said Professor Smith .
" At some point towards the end of that month , we will not be able to heat our batteries - we will not have enough solar energy to heat them and as they get colder and colder they do n't work as well .
Pretty soon , you can't store any more energy in them ; when that happens you are in the death knells .
" It 's like going to the hospital with someone who is terribly sick and seeing their vital signs getting less and less every day .
" It 's the same for this spacecraft .
If we can make it to the end of the year that would be a great Christmas present ; it 's nip and tuck . "
Phoenix team photo :
The mission has been run differently to previous efforts
Even as the Sun sets on this mission , Phoenix is still sending back some amazing detail , recently detecting snow falling from the Martian skies .
The more we glean about the planet the more Earth - like it seems - and that inevitably raises the question of life on Mars .
A question that Peter Smith has grown a little tired of answering .
" Who do you think I am ?
I 'm not Nostradamus here , how do I know what 's going to happen in 10 years ... "
I ask him about the idea that life on Earth may have originated on Mars , or perhaps life on Mars might have started from here .
Professor Smith is disinclined to speculate , and becomes playful .
" You do n't ask any of the easy questions do you ?
How the hell do I know ... was God left - handed ?
How do I know ? "
The Arizona science team will also be hoping to mark another unique achievement for a mission to Mars .
The scientists intend to activate the microphone on the Lander and record the sounds of the planet for the first time .
The microphone was originally intended to record the descent of Phoenix but was switched off because of the risk that it could trip a critical landing system .
Engineers will now send computer code to the lander to try to activate it .
Peter Smith said he hoped it was still in working order .
" We 'll start slowly , just turn it on and make sure it records sound , and we 'll try and make some noise to make sure it 's working .
We 'll try scraping ice with our robotic arm blade and we can bang a few pots or something .
Then we 'll listen just for the Mars sounds by themselves . "
When I ask him what he thinks we 'll hear on Mars , he responds with tongue firmly planted in his cheek .
" I think it 's an interesting noise .
There may be music .
I do n't know . "

For a while , Republicans were defending their call for coastal drilling by claiming that the Chinese were drilling in Cuban waters .
This proved to be false ( though many on the right repeat the claim anyway ) .
So , conservatives have moved onto a new talking point : coastal drilling is safe for the environment , because recent hurricanes did n’t lead to oil spills .
It leads to rhetoric like this from Nancy Pfotenhauer , John McCain ’s senior energy adviser , who appeared on MSNBC the other day .
John McCain made the same claim a month ago : “ As for offshore drilling , it ’s safe enough these days that not even Hurricanes Katrina and Rita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts of New Orleans and Houston . ”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ken. ) said the same thing over the weekend : “ I think people are reassured that not a drop of oil was spilled during Katrina or Rita .
Those rigs in the Gulf , there was not a single incident of spillage that anyone reported . ”
Bill O’Reilly is sticking to the Republican script , telling his radio audience the other day , “ Remember when Katrina hit , none of the oil rigs spilled in Louisiana . ”
Even Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) , who presumably would know better , told Fox News a couple of weeks ago , “ [ T ] hat ’s one of the great unwritten success stories , after Katrina and Rita , these awful storms , no major spills . ”
George Will , Dick Morris , Robert Samuelson , and the Wall Street Journal editorial page have all repeated the claim .
And they ’re all wrong .
A group of lawyers have descended upon the commonwealth of Kentucky Thursday morning to block efforts by that state 's Governor , Governor Steve Beshear , in seizing up to 141 domain names .
Among those in attendance at a Thursday hearing , The Interactive Media Entertainment & Gaming Association President , Edward Leyden .
" In exercising this standing , iMEGA has assembled what may be one of the most talented , experienced , and certainly well - respected white - collar defense teams in the country , BAR NONE . , " Leyden reassured .
" In short , we provide individuals and companies that may be affected by this Kentucky action with the highest quality of legal representation that is second to none while , at the same time , the opportunity to remain anonymous by letting iMEGA be the face before the court -- which is precisely what associational standing is meant to accomplish . "
Dinsmore & Shohl LLP will be appearing on behalf of the industry .
Jon L. Fleischaker will be representing the matter .
iMEGA was previously working with another law firm but due to a conflict of interest , selected Dinsmore & Shohl , which is considered the most prestigious law firm in the commonwealth .
Fleischaker is Chair of the Communications and Media Law Practice Group .
Jon is the Managing Partner for the Louisville Office and he serves on the Management Council .
Jon has more than 30 years of experience in media law and First Amendment cases , actively involved in representation of newspapers and broadcasters dealing with publication issues .
He has been the most visible attorney in Kentucky in dealing with First Amendment concerns .
Jon also has extensive employment litigation experience , including class actions and individual cases .
In addition to numerous appellate cases , he also has participated in 99 cases in the U.S. District Courts .
The Poker Players Alliance - a million plus member strong organization representing online poker interests - also said it planned to have legal counsel present at Thursday 's hearing .
Kentucky received court permission to seize 141 gambling Web sites ' domain names as it tries to put them out of business there .
Gov. Steve Beshear ( D ) said at a press conference that the gambling - friendly state is taking " unprecedented action " against sites that " siphon off money from regulated and legal games , " such as the state lottery and thoroughbred racing .
Kentucky has lost " tens of millions " to unlicensed gambling , he said .
Franklin
County Judge Thomas Wingate ordered the domains transferred to Kentucky , " an important first step " in keeping Kentuckians from accessing the sites and forcing sites to pay damages , Beshear said .
The state 's Justice and Public Safety Cabinet had asked the court to force sites simply to bar access to Kentucky users , a practice common in Communist China , and if not , to hand over the domain names , according to a written statement .
Beshear has even made the outlandish claim that online gambling funds terrorism , something that has never remotely been proven .
A spokesperson for a spokeswoman for the state cabinet that filed the suit told the Washington Internet Daily that the court order has been served on domain registrars , but does n't require the registrars to pull the plug on the sites .
Kentucky does n't anticipate any challenges from registrars who say the state is circumventing ICANN policy , she said , since registrars must follow valid court orders under registration agreements .
But already this week a handful of the 141 online gambling domains were turning up under the administrative umbrella of Kentucky 's government .
Doleplex Holdings has lost two of its online casino domain names to the state of Kentucky in a seizure .
HighRollersLounge.com was transferred over to the commonwealth on Tuesday .
Earlier in the day , LuckyPyramidCasino.com was taken over as well .
Both are connected with Crystalisle Management Ltd and the more well known Crystal Palace Casino , which was also off line .
But it was unclear if those domain names were voluntarily handed over or otherwise seized .
Doleplex Holdings head , Warren Cloud , passed away suddenly from a heart attack this summer and his online casino group was said to have gone off line soon thereafter .

Nine witnesses testified against Mr. Davis at his trial in 1991 , but seven of the nine have since changed their stories .
One of the recanting witnesses , Dorothy Ferrell , said she was on parole when she testified and was afraid that she ’d be sent back to prison if she did n’t agree to finger Mr. Davis .
Image Bob Herbert
She said in an affidavit : “ I told the detective that Troy Davis was the shooter , even though the truth was that I did n’t know who shot the officer . ”
Another witness , Darrell Collins , a teenager at the time of the murder , said the police had “ scared ” him into falsely testifying by threatening to charge him as an accessory to the crime .
He said they told him that he might never get out of prison .
“ I did n’t want to go to jail because I did n’t do nothing wrong , ” he said .
At least three witnesses who testified against Mr. Davis ( and a number of others who were not part of the trial ) have since said that a man named Sylvester “ Redd ” Coles admitted that he was the one who had killed the officer .
Mr. Coles , who was at the scene , and who , according to authorities , later ditched a gun of the same caliber as the murder weapon , is one of the two witnesses who have not recanted .
The other is a man who initially told investigators that he could not identify the killer .
Nearly two years later , at the trial , he testified that the killer was Mr. Davis .
So we have here a mess that is difficult , perhaps impossible , to sort through in a way that will yield reliable answers .
( The jury also convicted Mr. Davis of a nonfatal shooting earlier that same evening on testimony that was even more dubious . )
A non-emergency meeting
The McCain campaign 's new urgency about the financial crisis did n't entirely clear his schedule this morning .
My colleague Amie Parnes reports that he made it to his scheduled morning meeting with Lady Lynn de Rothschild , a Clinton backer who recently came out in support of him .
All while Obama was waiting by the phone for a returned call .
You can and should refuse .
These " tests " have no scientific basis .
In the context of criminal investigations , they typically serve as little more than a pretext for interrogating a suspect without a lawyer present , as the suspect is falsely led to believe that ( s ) he is simply submitting to a scientific test for truth .
In this regard , it is worth noting that Charles Humble , the man behind the most commonly used voice stress analyzer -- like several poobahs of the polygraph community -- has falsely passed himself off as a Ph.D. in marketing his services .
The fact that police have asked you to submit to such a bogus test is a strong indication that you are considered a suspect in the case .
Sometimes , people who handle cash falsely report robberies and take the money themselves , or willingly hand cash to a partner who stages a robbery .
I think it would be prudent to seek legal counsel and not submit to further questioning without your lawyer present .
If you feel the need to explain your decision to refuse the " test , " you can state that you 've learned that it 's junk science .

In June , Time Warner Cable began a metering trial in one Texas city by offering various monthly plans and charging extra when consumers exceeded their bandwidth limit .
AT&T has said that it is considering a similar pricing plan .
The concept is not a foreign one ; consumers already pay by usage for water and electricity .
But broadband access has seemed unlimited , and any stifling of that is sure to concern some customers .
Until now , Comcast had not defined excessive use , but it had contacted customers who were using the heaviest amount of broadband and asked them to curb usage .
Most do so willingly , the company said .
The ones who do not curb their usage receive a second notice and risk having their accounts terminated .
Although the 250 gigabyte cap is now specified , users who exceed that amount will not have their access switched off immediately , nor will they be charged for excessive use .
Instead , the customers may be contacted by Comcast and notified of the cap .
The company did not say how 250 gigabytes was selected .
According to Comcast , a customer would have to download 62,500 songs or 125 standard - definition movies a month to exceed the caps .
But high - definition video and video gaming require a higher amount of bandwidth .
S. Derek Turner , the research director for the nonpartisan media policy group Free Press , said broadband caps could create a disincentive to view online video .
“ As media companies put content online , consumers can bypass the cable companies and get their content directly from the Internet , ” Mr. Turner said .
“ A 250 gigabyte cap may seem very high  and it is for today ’s Internet use .
But it ’s essentially the equivalent of four hours of HD television a day . ”
Critics have charged that Internet providers are trying to protect their cable TV and telephone businesses by stifling Internet access .
Comcast says Fancast , its online video
Web site , will count against the 250 gigabyte limit , but its digital voice service will not .
Comcast said there was no link between the caps , announced Thursday , and the Federal Communications Commission ’s finding on Aug. 1 that the company was improperly inhibiting customers who used BitTorrent , a popular file - sharing program .
But Andrew Jay Schwartzman , the president of the Media Access Project , said the caps appeared to be a direct result of that finding .
Mr. Schwartzman ’s group represented Free Press in its complaint against Comcast about the file - sharing controls .

Cable clutter is a major pain when it comes to home theater setups .
There is good news , as 3 companies are going to offer wireless HDMI and the ability to transport high quality audio and video signals without the need for unsightly cables also provides consumers with more options when it comes to where the related components can be located .
At least three companies where displaying wireless HDMI products on the CEDIA Expo show floor – all were in various states of readiness .
Given the variety of wireless chipsets and encoding technologies used by these first generation wireless HDMI products , cross-compatibility with other manufacturers ’ products appears unlikely , however , for single HDTV installations this limitation should be a relatively minor concern .
Monster Cable
At the Monster Cable booth , the company ’s Wireless Digital Express HD demo featured two products , a transmitter ( DX WHD TX1 ) and a receiver ( DX WHD RX1 ) .
Belkin
Belkin ’s CEDIA
Expo booth featured a fully - functioning demo of the company ’s FlyWire Wireless for HDTV product .
The FlyWire product will include a transmitter , receiver , remote , three HDMI cables , as well as an infrared receiver / repeater .
Gefen
Gefen had two wireless HDMI products at its CEDIA Expo booth – neither of which were operational .
The GefenTV Wireless for HDMI Extender ( GTV - WHDMI ) incorporates Amimon ’s WHDI 5GHz wireless technology that features a claimed transmission range of up to 90 feet with effectively lossless image quality .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Fueled by the needs of a growing elderly population , U.S. spending on long - term health care under the Medicaid program will soar in the next 20 years , a report released on Monday predicted .

Spending for long - term care for elderly and disabled people under the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor will total $ 3.7 trillion in the next two decades , according to the report by America ’s Health Insurance Plans , an industry group .
That includes $ 1.6 trillion projected to be spent by individual U.S. states and $ 2.1 trillion in federal money , according to the report .
Long - term care includes nursing homes and in - home care for people unable to live independently .
“ Medicaid ’s position as the payer of last resort for long - term care -- despite the presence of long - term care insurance available in the marketplace today -- will continue to create budgetary difficulties for states and the federal government over the next two decades , ” the report read .
Separately , a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation health policy organization showed that overall Medicaid enrollment nationwide grew 2.1 percent in fiscal 2008 , which ends on Tuesday , erasing a slight decline the prior year .
The report , based on a survey of state Medicaid officials , found that states saw spending growth of 5.3 percent during the fiscal year , higher than the previous two years .
With members of the post - World War II baby boom generation quickly reaching retirement age , experts have warned of growing medical costs .
The Medicare federal health insurance program for the elderly does not pay for long - term care .
Medicaid covers long - term care expenses for low - income people and people who previously were not classified as low income but have spent down their assets to the point of reaching Medicaid eligibility .
Medicaid spending for long - term care will expand at a faster rate than overall U.S. health care spending , Medicare expenditures and the overall economy , according to the report .
It forecast that under current trends , annual Medicaid expenditures for long - term care would grow from $ 51.5 billion in 2008 to $ 115.6 billion in 2027 .
In 2008 , 15 U.S. states are projected to spend $ 1 billion on long - term care services under Medicaid .
By 2027 , the number is forecast to reach 25 .
Economist Paul London , a former U.S. Commerce Department official who prepared the report along with Daniel Shostak of Maryland - based Strategic Affairs Forecasting , called the projected spending “ stunningly large . ”
The report said New York , California and Pennsylvania would have the highest expenditures .
Long - term care currently accounts for about 30 percent of total Medicaid expenditures .
Under Medicaid , states determine who is eligible and which services are covered , and the federal government reimburses a portion of state spending .
States generally cover about 43 percent and the federal government 57 percent .
The report is available on the Internethere .

Republican IT consultant subpoenaed in case alleging tampering with 2004 election
Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
COLUMBUS —
A high - level Republican consultant has been subpoenaed in a case regarding alleged tampering with the 2004 election .
Michael S. Connell was served with a subpoena in Ohio on Sept. 22 in a case alleging that vote - tampering during the 2004 presidential election resulted in civil rights violations .
Connell , president of GovTech Solutions and New Media Communications , is a website designer and IT professional who created a website for Ohio ’s secretary of state that presented the results of the 2004 election in real time as they were tabulated .
At the time , Ohio ’s Secretary of State , Kenneth J. Blackwell , was also chairman of Bush - Cheney 2004 reelection effort in Ohio .
Connell is refusing to testify or to produce documents relating to the system used in the 2004 and 2006 elections , lawyers say .
His motion to quash the subpoena asserts that the request for documents is burdensome because the information sought should be “ readily ascertainable through public records request ”  “ “ but also , paradoxically , because “ it seeks confidential , trade secrets , and / or proprietary information ”  that “ have independent economic value ”  and “ are not known to the public , or even to non-designated personnel within or working for Mr. Connell ’s business . ” 
According to sources close to the office of Clifford Arnebeck , one of the Ohio attorneys who brought the case , Arnebeck intends to ask the court to compel Connell to testify .
An emergency conference with the judge , originally scheduled for Monday , is to be rescheduled .
King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell
The case , known as King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell , was filed against Kenneth J. Blackwell on Aug. 31 , 2006 by Columbus attorneys Clifford Arnebeck , Robert Fitrakis and others .
It initially charged Blackwell with racially discriminatory practices — including the selective purging of voters from the election rolls and the unequal allocation of voting machines to various districts — and asked for measures to be taken to prevent similar problems during the November 2006 election .
On Oct. 9 , 2006 , an amended complaint added charges of various forms of ballot - rigging as also having the effect of “ depriving the Plaintiffs of their voting rights , including the right to have their votes successfully cast without intimidation , dilution , cancellation or reversal by voting machine or ballot tampering . ”
A motion to dismiss the case as moot was filed following the November 2006 election , but it was instead stayed to allow for settlement discussions .
The case took on fresh momentum earlier this year when Arnebeck announced in July that he was filing to “ lift the stay in the case [ and ] proceed with targeted discovery in order to help protect the integrity of the 2008 election . ”
The new filing was inspired in part by the coming forward as a whistleblower of GOP IT security expert Stephen Spoonamore , who said he was prepared to testify to the plausibility of electronic vote - rigging having been carried out in 2004 .
Arnebeck ’s hope was that in the course of the discovery procedure it would be possible to subpoena Michael Connell , former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove , and others to obtain additional information and improve the focus of the case .
The stay was lifted Sept. 19 , 2008 by an order from Magistrate Judge Terrence P. Kemp of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio , and a subpoena was served to Connell on the following Monday , Sept. 22 .
Allegations against Connell
The interest in Mike Connell stems from his association with a firm called GovTech , which he had spun off from his own New Media Communications under his wife Heather Connell ’s name .
GovTech was hired by Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell to set up an official election website at election .sos.state.oh.us to presented the 2004 presidential returns as they came in .
Connell is a long - time GOP operative , whose New Media Communications provided web services for the Bush - Cheney ’04 campaign , the US Chamber of Commerce , the Republican National Committee and many Republican candidates .
This in itself might have raised questions about his involvement in creating Ohio ’s official state election website .
The New Media building .
However , the alternative media group ePlubibus Media further discovered in November 2006 that election .
sos.state.oh.us was hosted on the servers of a company in Chattanooga , TN called SmarTech , which also provided hosting for a long list of Republican Internet domains .
“ Since early this decade , top Internet “ ˜gurus ’ in Ohio have been coordinating web services with their GOP counterparts in Chattanooga , wiring up a major hub that in 2004 , first served as a conduit for Ohio ’s live election night results , ”  researchers at ePluribus Media wrote .
A few months after this revelation , when a scandal erupted surrounding the firing of US Attorneys for reasons of White House policy , other researchers found that the gwb43 domain used by members of the White House staff to evade freedom of information laws by sending emails outside of official White House channels was hosted on those same SmarTech servers .
Given that the Bush White House used SmarTech servers to send and receive email , the use of one of those servers in tabulating Ohio ’s election returns has raised eyebrows .
Ohio gave Bush the decisive margin in the Electoral College to secure his reelection in 2004 .
IT expert Stephen Spoonamore says the SmartTech server could have functioned as a routing point for malicious activity and remains a weakness in electronic voting tabulation .
According to Spoonamore ’s Sept. 17 affidavit , the “ computer placement , in the middle of the network , is a defined type of attack . ” 
Spoonamore describes this as a “ Man in the Middle Attack ”  or MIM .
“ It is a common problem in the banking settlement space , ”  he writes .
“ A criminal gang will introduce a computer into the outgoing electronic systems of a major retail mall , or smaller branch office of a bank .
They will capture the legitimate transactions and then add fraudulent charges to the system for their benefit . ” 
“ Any time all information is directed to a single computer for consolidation , it is possible , and in fact likely , that single computer will exploit the information for some purpose , ”  he adds .
“ In the case of Ohio 2004 , the only purpose I can conceive for sending all county vote tabulations to a GOP managed Man - in - the - Middle site in Chattanooga before sending the results onward to the Sec. of State , would be to hack the vote at the MIM . ” 
Hold letters were sent out in July to parties in the case , informing them of their obligation not to destroy relevant documentation .
One such letter went to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , asking him to advise the federal government of its responsibility to preserve emails from Rove .
Arnebeck explained , “ We expressed concern about the reports that Mr. Rove destroyed his emails and suggested that we want the duplicates that should exist [ be put ] under the control of the Secret Service and be sure that those are retained , as well as those on the receiving end in the Justice Department and elsewhere , that those documents are retained for purposes of this litigation , in which we anticipate Mr. Rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt , ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in Ohio . ”
More recently , Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff has revealed that John McCain ’s presidential campaign paid nearly a million dollars for web services to a firm called 3eDC , created and partly owned by McCain campaign manager Rick Davis .
According to an archived version of a 3eDC webpage from 2007 , that firm ’s five “ strategic partners ”  included not only Connell ’s New Media Communications but also Campaign Solutions “ “ a firm run by Connell ’s sometimes - partner , Rebecca Donatelli “ “ and a component of SmarTech called AirNet .
The Origin of the Case
The roots of the King Lincoln Bronzeville case go back to the case of Moss v. Bush , which Arnebeck , Fitrakis and other attorneys filed immediately after the 2004 presidential election .
In that filing , they challenged the results of the Ohio voting on the basis of numerous irregularities and allegations of fraud and sought to depose President George W. Bush , Vice President , Dick Cheney , and then - White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove , as well as Secretary Blackwell .
That case was dropped by the plaintiffs in January 2005 , after the US Senate accepted the casting of Ohio ’s electoral votes for George W. Bush .
Two weeks later , Ohio ’s Republican Attorney General James Petro attempted to sanction and fine the attorneys for what he described as a “ frivolous filing , ” but they were supported by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) “ “ then the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee – who had already held a hearing at which Arnebeck and Jesse Jackson testified concerning the suppression of minority votes .
Those same concerns are now at the heart of King Lincoln Bronzeville .

What capitalism does to workers when it thinks it can get away with it
It is perhaps one of the defining myths of our civilization that capitalism creates a high standard of living for workers and capitalists alike .
Indeed to question this sacrosanct myth is generally considered about as polite as relieving oneself on the eldest child of whomever you are speaking to .
In reality though , not only is it rather easy to illustrate that it is not true that capitalism in and of itself creates high standards of living , but , paradoxically , it is also a relatively simple task to illustrate that most people with a sufficient grasp of history perhaps do n’t even genuinely believe in the myth itself .
People already have all the facts to refute this myth existing latently within themselves , but are never given the opportunity to connect the dots and formally recognize what they already know .
Consider that most people are well aware that capitalism came into existence in the late 18th Century and closely coincided with the industrial revolution and the creation of the first modern powerful unitary ( rather than feudal ) state in England .
Consider that most Canadians are well aware of the Winnipeg General Strike which occurred in 1919 and that most Americans are well aware of the various courageous workers ’ activities in the late nineteenth century in the United States ( and particularly in Massachusetts ) .
Moreover , most people are aware that the reasons for these actions were not young rabble rousing youngsters seeking a lark but rather were a result of the brutal existence under unfettered capitalism which had existed for nearly 150 years with little increase in the standard of living for most .
For example , the average wage in Winnipeg in 1919 was roughly on par with the average wages we see in Africa to this day ( with today , approximately 40 % living on less than $ 2 per day purchasing power parity )
Consider that most people therefore should be aware ( and would be intimately aware in a free society ) that the high standard of living we in the West enjoy today is an extremely new phenomenon that did not begin to accrue until we saw the development of class consciousness , unions , activism against capitalism and capitalists , the threat of revolution and the beginnings of demands for the democratization of the workplace .
In short , pure capitalism exploited workers untrammelled by pesky legislation and workers ’ demands for nearly 150 years .
Then , precisely at the historical moment when workers began to earn victories by moving away from capitalism , we began to see the increasing standard of living which today , according to popular shibboleth , is now attributed perversely to capitalism itself instead of the activism and agitation of workers seeking to move away from capitalism .
The reason this is significant , the reason why I bring this history up now , is that every once in a while we get a glimpse of this old - guard manner of capitalism lurking beneath the modern putatively tame breed of capitalism which we think of in the friendly , fuzzy terms outlined in the popular myth view .
Earlier this month , we got just such an example of what capitalism attempts to do to workers when it believes it can get away with it .
Of course , since we do not live in a free society , this news item was not reported by the press .
However , the University of Pittsburgh ’s legal research publication The Jurist had a fantastic piece on what seemingly friendly Wal - Mart attempted to do to its workers in Mexico when it thought it could get away with it .
When you strip away the hard - won victories of workers in the 20th Century as is the case in many quasi- industrial nations like Mexico , we can see very clearly what kind of world the capitalists would like to return to .
From The Jurist :
The Mexican Supreme Court of Justice [ official website ] on Thursday ruled [ press release , in Spanish ] that Wal - Mart de Mexico [ corporate website ; JURIST news archive ] may not pay employees in part with vouchers redeemable only at its stores .
The court nullified the employment contract of a worker who challenged the voucher payments , finding that they violated Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution [ PDF text ] , which guarantees the right to “ dignified and socially useful work . ”
The court likened the arrangement , which Wal - Mart called the Plan of Social Welfare , to a practice that prevailed during the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz [ profile ] , who ruled Mexico [ JURIST news archive ] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
If one wanted , one could easily find numerous historic examples of capitalists seeking a regression back to the days before workers rights and the hard - won victories which enable even the modicum of wealth we enjoy in the West today .
However , given that the press will remain the dutiful servant of capitalism , it is important to highlight ongoing abuses and that we never loose sight of the fact that even the various historical examples of capitalists seeking to claw back to a purer form of capitalism have not ended .
Rather , we are faced with these attempts — obscured and out of mind though they may be — and live with them daily .
It ’s just that the popular myth makes it impolite to bring these matters up in ‘ polite ’ conversation .
As long as people have engaged in private conversations , eavesdroppers have tried to listen in .
When important matters were discussed in parlors , people slipped in under the eaves — literally within the “ eaves­drop ” — to hear what was being said .
When conversations moved to telephones , the wires were tapped .
And now that so much human activity takes place in cyberspace , spies have infiltrated that realm as well .

Caracas , September 6 , 2008 -- The August 24 announcment by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to officially launch the social mission April 13 , and the decreeing of 26 new and reformed laws on July 29 , represent a further push to empower the poor communities .
Moreover , these moves represent a new offensive as part of Chavez ’s stated aim of building “ socialism of the 21st century ” and eradicating poverty by giving power to the people .
Among other things , the new mission and laws build upon the communal councils that have been established across the country with the goal of organising the Venezuelan people , in order to transfer responsibilities until now in the hands of the state bureaucracy inherited by the Bolivarian revolution .
Mission April 13 is named in honour of the successful struggle of the poor majority , who along with the majority of the armed forces , defeated the coup organised by Venezuela ’s business federation , Fedecamaras , on April 11 , 2002 .
The coup briefly removed Chavez from the power , but an uprising resorted him two days later .
Eradicating poverty
The mission ’s objective is “ eradicating poverty in all its manifestations ” , according to minister for participation and social protection , Erika Farias .
With the aim of expanding throughout the country , the mission has begun with pilot projects in 47 sectors across eight of the country ’s 24 states , with more than US $ 186 million already approved as initial funding .
The money will go directly to communal councils — grassroots bodies based on communities of 200- 400 families in urban areas and 20 - 50 families in rural areas — where 80 % of the projects will be directly carried out by the community and 20 % by the corresponding ministries .
Farias stated that mission would have three fundamental components : political , social and economic .
It will promote new forms of social organisations “ in the path towards the construction of socialism ” , such as the “ socialist commune ” .
Evoking the Paris Commune of 1871 , the world ’s first example of workers exercising political power , the communes will involve the participation of already existing communal councils , along with various social movements .
First elected in 1998 on the back of popular discontent with neoliberialism , Chavez moved quickly to promote the organisation of his social base among the poor people into a to advance his radical project of national liberation .
Both before , and more so after , his election , an explosion of numerous forms of local community organisation occurred in the form of neighbourhood associations , health committees , housing organisations and others .
Communal councils
The creation of communal councils , legally recognised in April 2006 , served to bring together these different sectoral organisations around discussing and acting upon a local development plan .
The idea behind the councils is that it be the communities themselves that diagnose the local problems , democratically decide on the tasks to be solved and , with funding from the national , regional and municipal budgets , begin to tackle these basic problems .
According to Farias , there are currently 36,000 communal councils .
Farias explained that Mission April 13 would aim to integrate all the other social missions in order to “ be able to opportunely respond to the necessities of the communities ” , such as water , electricity , roads , housing , schools and health .
Since 2003 , the Venezuelan government has established more than 30 social missions .
Confronted with the urgency of meeting the most pressing needs of the poor , and the inefficiency of the existing capitalist state institutions , the government established social missions in the area of health , education , food distribution and housing among others .
The missions have relied on bringing together existing local community organisations and promoting them in unorganised areas .
Cuba has also played a crucial role in the missions , providing doctors and teachers working as volunteers in poor areas .
The Venezuelan government has promoted further social missions in areas such as culture , tree - planting , energy saving , indigenous rights and tackling the problem of street kids and homelessness .
Farias explained that in the economic area , “ the community and government will promote organisational forms that facilitate the transformation from the capitalist model towards the socialist model … which is in the framework of the new [ popular ] economy law based on the promotion of socialist units of production ” .
The new popular economy law was one of the 26 decrees issued by Chavez on July 29 , the last day of the enabling law granted to him by the National Assembly that allowed the president to decree laws in relating to defined areas .
While the right - wing opposition have strongly attacked the newly decreed laws , in essence the new laws form part of the project that aims to open the way to the construction of socialism that Chavez presented to the Venezuelan people in 2006 , when he won with more than 63 % of the vote , and fall within the framework of the constitution voted upon by the Venezuelan people in 1999 .
Many of these laws are directly related to the expansion of community control over community affairs .
As a package , the laws aim to strengthen popular power .
For example , the law on public administration , along with enshrining the social missions in law , outlines a commitment for joint management of state institutions between public authorities and communal councils .
The law integrates communal councils into the public administration , facilitating the transfer of control over activities previous carried out by public administrative bodies to communities .
The housing law directly involves communal councils in national housing projects .
The councils will also play an important role in agriculture and food distribution , through the new law of food security and sovereignty .
The new law for the development of the popular economy , which states that “ the productive model needs to respond to the necessities of the community and be less subordinated to the reproduction of capital ” , points towards production controlled by communities through “ companies of social production ” , “ companies of social distribution ” and family - based production .
Four days before the decrees were announced Chavez had stressed the importance of building “ communes ” , arguing that without communes “ how do we transfer property ? ”
The day of the launch of Mission April 13 , Chavez said , “ a factory installed in a neighbourhood will belong [ to the community ] , because it is collective property ” .
“ In this way we are sowing the seed of Bolivarian socialism , which is not a copy of [ previous models ] but rather something we are creating .
This is real democracy . ”
Venezuela : Union movement rebuilds , industrial disputes grow
By Federico Fuentes
Caracas , September 7 , 2008 -- Addressing an assembly of petroleum workers in Zulia on September 5 , 2008 , Venezuelan labour minister Roberto Hernandez explained that the “ only way to guarantee the advance of the revolution is with the unity of the working class ” .
Hernandez emphasised that “ to defeat imperialism and the internal counter - revolution , we need to have a united working class at the national level ” .
This same message was delivered by Hernandez , former union activist , labour lawyer , and long - term Communist Party of Venezuela ( PCV ) leader who has since left to join the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , during his swearing in as minister in April — only weeks after the nationalisation of the Sidor steel works .
Sidor
The move to nationalise one of the largest steel factories in Latin America was the culmination of the most important industrial struggle in Venezuela since the December 2002 - February 2003 bosses ’ lock - out .
During the conflict , Sidor workers , as well as important sections of the union movement , accused the then - labour minister Jose Ramon Rivero of siding with Sidor ’s transnational owners against the workers .
Rivero was also accused of using his position to to help build his own union current , the Bolivarian Socialist Force of Workers ( FSBT ) , while undermining other struggles .
Only days before being sacked as labour minister , Jose Ramon Rivero and other FSBT leaders announced their intentions of creating a new union federation , making official their split with the National Union of Workers ( UNT ) — the biggest national union federation created to unite pro-revolution union forces .
Together with the small Alfredo Maniero current , they officially launched the new workers central in July .
With the momentum gained by the victory of the Sidor workers — whose demands were largely met following nationalisation — and changes in the labour ministry , signs of a potential reinvigoration of the union movement have begun to appear .
Given the near - absence , due to its weakness , of the organised working class in the revolutionary process , such signs are of great importance .
Increasing labour conflicts , scheduled union elections and moves towards greater unity between currents at the national level could all help to begin to turn this around .
After four years of delays , and with the collaboration of the labour ministry , Venezuela ’s public sector union federation , which unites over one million workers , will hold elections on October 1 .
Competition will be fierce between the slate aligned with the Alfredo Maneiro current and various forces aligned to the National Union of Workers ( UNT ) , the largest national federation that was formed to unite pro-revolution unions .
In the newly created federation of petroleum worker unions , tickets aligned to the FSBT , anti-Chavez forces and the Classist , Unitary , Revolutionary and Autonomous Current ( part of the UNT ) will go head to head in elections on November 5 .
However , the most immediate elections are in the United Steel Industry Workers ’ Union ( SUTISS ) .
The current SUTISS president , who has taken an ambiguous position towards the government and has been heavily criticised by sections of workers for attempting to sell out the struggle , in not standing in the September 9 - 11 elections .
His supporters , however , make up one of the strongest of the seven slates in the election .
The two other main contenders are the Union Alliance ticket , which involved militants from the Marea Socialista current within the UNT , and an anti-Chavez ticket .
While a victory for the latter would represent a grave headache for the government — forced to contend with a union run by forces linked to the counter - revolutionary opposition in a phase of transition towards a new state - owned Sidor — a victory for Union Alliance , whose campaign is focused on the issue of workers ’ control of Sidor , would have ramifications well beyond the factory gates .
If one of the largest unions in the country — historically , and even more so given recent events , a reference point for union militancy — fell into the hands of the Chavista forces in Union Alliance , it would not only shake up the union movement in the country ’s most important industrial belt , it would put winds in the sails of the UNT , which is currently relaunching itself .
Relaunching the UNT
The results of these elections will have an important impact on the fragmented national pro-revolution union movement , which only recently suffered an important split .
The five remaining currents in the UNT , together with the PCV - aligned union confederation , are seeking to relaunch the UNT following years divisions and infighting since it was first launched in 2003 .
Despite organisational hurdles , these currents are aiming to organise a national congress and hold the first internal elections for UNT leadership positions .
Forced to postpone the congress , originally planned for September , it is now set for October 17 - 19 .
Union currents aligned with the PSUV — the mass party headed by Chavez that unites much of the mass base that support the revolution — have been meeting with party leaders to discuss issues , such as labour conflicts , unity and the role of the working class .
While most of the UNT currents within the PSUV , along with the Alfredo Maneiro current , have been regularly participating , the FSBT has kept its distance .
As a result of these meetings , the PSUV - aligned union currents are planning a national event with 400 union leaders on September 19 - 21 to kick off the discussion on a PSUV program for the working class in the transition to socialism .
All the currents have also been regularly attending meetings with the labour ministry , whose open - door policy towards the various currents has enabled the establishment of a permanent labour conflict resolution working group to deal with the increasing labour disputes .
Disputes are being fuelled by rising inflation eating into workers ’ salaries and by employers conspiring to cause economic chaos to undermine the continued emergence of new militant unions backed by pro-worker laws .
The clearest example of this complex landscape is in the automotive industry , currently a key focal point for labour disputes .
While a number of the factory - based unions , who after two years have almost completed the formation of an industry - wide federation , are engaged in fierce struggles over collective contracts , employers are shutting down factories and locking out workers in order to pressure the government to receive more benefits .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Pimco ’s Bill Gross said on Sunday that a Lehman Brother ’s bankruptcy risks an “ immediate tsunami ” because of the unwinding of derivative and credit swap - related positions worldwide .
Talks to sell Lehman faltered Sunday , triggering concerns that the investment bank may be heading into bankruptcy by the end of the day and prompting banks to call an emergency trading session to unwind positions with the firm .
“ It appears that Lehman will file for bankruptcy and the risk of an immediate tsunami is related to the unwind of derivative and swap - related positions worldwide in the dealer , hedge fund , and buyside universe , ” Gross , the chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co ( Pimco ) , told Reuters .
Pimco oversees more than $ 812 billion in assets .
Indeed , a rare emergency trading session opened Sunday afternoon to allow Wall Street dealers in the $ 455 trillion derivatives market to reduce their exposure to a potential bankruptcy filing by Lehman .
U.S. regulators and bankers were making last - ditch efforts on Sunday to prevent toxic assets from ailing Lehman spilling into global markets and rupturing investor faith in the international financial system .
“ The extraordinary trading session held today to facilitate a partial unwind of these positions saw very little trading -- perhaps $ 1 billion total -- but at much wider spread levels for corporate bonds , ” Gross said .
Barclays Plc , which had appeared to be frontrunner to take over Lehman -- excluding its toxic mortgage - related assets -- said it pulled out of the bidding , as top bankers and regulators met for a third day to try to resolve the crisis .
The British bank withdrew because the U.S. government would n’t provide financial guarantees , according to a person familiar with the matter .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remains strongly opposed to using government money in any deal aimed at resolving the Lehman crisis , a source familiar with his thinking reiterated on Sunday .
There were some glimmer of good news on Sunday .
Bank of America Corp was in advanced talks to acquire Merrill Lynch & Co Inc for at least $ 38.25 billion in stock , the New York Times said on Sunday , citing people briefed on the negotiations .
John Thain , Merrill ’s chief executive , and Kenneth Lewis , chief executive of Bank of America , were present at discussions over the weekend regarding the fate of Lehman .
A transaction valuing Merrill at $ 25 to $ 30 per share could be announced as soon as Sunday night , the newspaper said .
Merrill shares closed at $ 17.05 on Friday .
Merrill has been hit hard by the credit crisis and has written down more than $ 40 billion over the last year .
“ To some extent , the rumored bid for Merrill by Bank of America lends some confidence to all markets , although I am skeptical that BofA would pay such a premium on such short notice , ” Gross added .

Iran says it has successfully launched a rocket capable of carrying its first domestically built satellite .
Officials said only the rocket had been fired , correcting state media reports that the communications satellite itself had been sent into orbit .
The White House voiced concern , saying the technology could also be used for launching weapons .
Tehran has pursued a space programme for years , despite international concern over its nuclear plans .
In February it sent a probe into space as part of preparations for the launch of the satellite .
Long - held ambition
Footage aired on Irinn ( Islamic Republic of Iran News Network ) showed the launch of the Safir rocket in darkness .
The presenter said that the satellite launch was a trial which was successful .
State and military officials confirmed the launch had taken place .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was at the event , said one report .
In October 2005 a Russian - made Iranian satellite named Sina - 1 was put into orbit by a Russian rocket .
Sunday 's launch comes amid a long - running dispute over Iran 's nuclear activities .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said : " The Iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions .
" This action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme are inconsistent with their UN Security Council obligations . "
The US and some European countries have demanded that Iran curtail uranium enrichment - but Iran protests that its purposes are peaceful and says it has a right to continue .
On September 19th , Keith Olbermann on MSNBC 's Countdown , showed a video of Sarah Palin with her former pastor that should send shivers down the spines of anyone with the I.Q. above a newt .
This was an old - time religion laying on of hands by a literal , and I mean literal , witch hunting man of God from Africa .
This is a must watch ... but where the hell is the media on this ?
My bride has called the Washington Post twice to alert them to this , and they still have n't written about it .
Compare the media silence to what Obama went through with his pastor !
Watch first ; then I 'll rant some more .
If McCain is elected , this woman will be closer to being president than any VP since Truman in FDR 's 4th term .
The media silence is inexplicable and indefensible .
This ain't some supermarket tabloid fabricated story -- this is video of a real event .
What the hell is going on ???

John McCain has officially run out of safe havens .
Following yesterday ’s brutal smackdown between McCain lackey Tucker Bounds and FOX News reporter Megyn Kelly , John McCain appeared on “ Morning Joe ” , an MSNBC morning show hosted by conservative commentator Joe Scarbrough .
McCain got pissy at several points in the interview , even going so far as accusing Joe ’s co-host of being in the tank for Obama .
The co-host , by the way , has a brother who works for John McCain ’s campaign , and even worked for George W. Bush for six years .
Conservative columnists in newspapers across the country have taken a shocking turn against McCain , although to be fair they all seem quite varied in their reasonings ; the most notable today came from the New York Times in which the author went on a long anti-Palin rant , but certainly did not endorse Obama .
Even the comedy front is becoming an issue for McCain .
Jon Stewart , who frequently invited McCain on his show over the years , has really outdone himself for this election season .
He followed up his destruction of McCain ’s acceptance speech as being literally “ more of the same ” , by showing hilarious clips of Sarah Palin and George Bush uniting in their claim that America “ must not blink ” .
While Stewart has never been afraid to make his opinions known , even going so far as begging Americans to “ make [ his ] job harder ” the day before the 2004 election , it is surprising to see him go after his friend so brutally … or at least it would be surprising if his friend did n’t deserve it .
Tough lovin ’ from Mr. Liebowitz .
The simple fact remains : John McCain is running out of places to spew his BS .
Americans are beginning to realize that he is running a campaign that could make even Karl Rove blush ( and has ; according to Rove , McCain ’s ads have gone too far ) .
Jon Stewart ’s annihilation of McCain ’s speech , and SNL ’s amazing skit showing how Palin has made a joke of everything Hillary did for women in America , have made a surprising impact as well .
In today ’s Gallup poll , McCain ’s once - solid lead has slipped to a single percentage point , thus a virtual tie when you consider the average margin of error .
Somewhere on the campaign trail , Barack Obama is smiling .

We have found a minor caching glitch with the Garmin Mobile GPS navigation software we run on our BlackBerry — along with a workaround .
For Labor Day weekend , we traveled up through Vermont across the Canadian border to Montreal , over to Quebec City , and down into Maine .
To do this without risking the loss of thousands of dollars in cell phone charges , we took the battery out of my BlackBerry before we crossed the border .
( If you set many cell phones to forward somewhere else , not only do you get charged international phone charges for a long distance call to your phone , but you also get billed international roaming charges from your phone to forward the call back home . )
Returning back to the States , the BlackBerry kept insisting we were in Vermont .
Clearly , there was a caching issue .
After a quick look around the Internet , we established that we could clear the cache using BlackBerry Maps .
There is n’t a ‘ clear ’ option in any other applications , that I ’m aware of .
( I do n’t know if clearing the cache in the browser will affect the GPS cache , but it would be worth a test . )
The fact that we had randomly just installed BBMaps came in handy .
How to clear your BlackBerry GPS cache with BlackBerry Maps

The Advanced Vehicle Research Center is converting Toyota Priuses into electric plug - in hybrids for a cost of $ 10,400 .
Image credit : The Advanced Vehicle Research Center .
Although many people would like to drive more fuel - efficient vehicles , most of us have to wait for the large vehicle manufacturers to mass - produce affordable cars that run on alternative power .
In the meantime , a handful of smaller companies have begun taking the energy crisis into their own hands .
By retrofitting hybrids like the Toyota Prius with a second battery pack , they ´re converting these cars into hybrid plug-ins that can recharge from a wall outlet and drive a short commute on all electric power .
A recent article in North Carolina´s The News & Observer has highlighted a Raleigh - based company , Advanced Vehicle Research Center ( AVRC ) , that has four employees and can retrofit a Prius in about four hours for a cost of $ 10,400 .
The AVRC is one of eight US companies authorized to install lithium ion batteries manufactured by 23 Systems , a Massachusetts company .
AVRC´s converted Priuses can get from anywhere between 60 and 100 mpg , depending on driving habits , which roughly doubles the gas mileage of a standard Prius .
Advanced Energy , a Raleigh nonprofit research organization and one of AVRC´s customers , has even exceeded 200 mpg in a test under optimal conditions .
The conversion process is relatively uncomplicated .
The mechanics remove the spare tire in the trunk , and replace it with a 170 - pound lithium ion battery pack , like a much larger version of a cell phone battery .
A plug from the back of the bumper can be inserted into a conventional wall outlet , where a full charge lasts about 3.5 hours and costs less than 75 cents .
The modified Prius draws from the new battery first , giving the car a range of about 35 miles on all - electric power , making gasoline optional on short commutes .
When the battery is depleted , the Prius runs like a standard hybrid , using its gas engine and regenerative braking to charge its nickel metal hydride battery .
According to the Plug - In Hybrid Coalition of the Carolinas , there are about 150 plug - in hybrids on US roads today .
Most of the AVRC´s customers have been corporations with large fleets , but they recently made their first conversion for an individual .
Their clients include Progress Energy , Duke Energy , the city of Raleigh , and North Carolina State University´s Advanced Transportation Energy Center .
These organizations are tracking and sending data on the cars to the Idaho National Laboratory , a federal research institute that is studying plug - in hybrids .
The plug - in modifications aren´t authorized or endorsed by Toyota , which plans to make its own Prius plug - in commercially available in 2010 in the US .
Also in 2010 , Chevrolet plans to release the Volt ( which runs on the same 23 lithium ion battery used by AVRC ) , which is expected to be more economical than AVRC´s conversions .
The AVRC acknowledges that $ 10,400 is a hefty price tag for the average driver - AVRC founder and president Richard Dell estimates that it could take 140,000 miles to recover the cost through fuel savings .
But the important thing is that they´ve demonstrated that the technology is viable and available right now .
" It ´s given us more confidence that it´s not a matter of if plug - in vehicles will happen , but when , " said Mike Rowand , Duke Energy´s director of advanced customer technologies .

All about the various PC power supply cables and connectors
The various power supply cables
General info
If you 'd like more technical data about ATX power connectors then you can find the current specifications and more at formfactors.org
Wires and connectors are not perfect conductors .
They have resistance .
When current passes through wires and connectors there is a voltage drop and that energy is lost as heat .
As long as you do n't overload them the voltage drop and extra heat do n't matter .
But the losses get worse as the current rises .
That 's why you see some power cables with more that one wire for the same voltage .
Having multiple wires reduces the losses .
If you seriously overload a line , the wire can get fairly warm .
The resistance of connectors tends to increase as they are plugged and unplugged so after enough uses they can overheat and even melt when passing a large current .
So a lot of changes in connectors over time has to do with adding more wires and connectors to make sure that none of these problems occur .
Some of the tables below provide the maximum wattage supported by a power cable and its associated power connector .
Some specifications clearly spell out the maximum allowed wattage .
Other specifications just provide the suggested connector and wire gauge and never specify a maximum wattage .
And there 's never really an absolute value to the maximum wattage anyway .
If you draw a little more wattage then the maximum , the hardware does n't immediately burst into flames .
The voltage drop and power dissipation increase as you increase the current so there is n't a clear maximum wattage at which it stops working .
Most of the specifications which spell out the maximum wattage provide a wide safety margin by defining a value which is far below the maximums supported by the connector and wire .
If the table below provides an " Official cable / connector maximum wattage " then that specification has spelled out the maximum wattage .
In most cases that wattage will be significantly below what can actually be handled by the suggested connector and wire .
If the table provides an " Unofficial cable / connector maximum wattage " then that specification does n't provide the maximum and the value in the table is a practical maximum wattage defined by the maximums for the connector and the suggested wire .
An unofficial wattage does n't have a wide safety margin built in because people differ on how much margin to provide .
Some people happily use connector and wire maximums and other people like to have a wide safety margin .
Original PC main power cables
The original PC debuted in 1981 and used two cables to connect the PSU ( power supply ) to the motherboard .
The two cables plug side by side into the motherboard connectors .
Sometimes they are keyed so they only plug in one way and sometimes they are n't .
Even if they 're keyed you can insert them the wrong way if you put a little effort into it .
You always have to remember to plug them in so the black wires are next to each other .
It 's either " black to black " or smoke and a shower of sparks .
Pinout Pin number
Wire color Description 1 orange power good 2 red + 5 volts or connector key 3 yellow +12 volts 4 blue - 12 volts 5 black ground 6 black ground 1 black ground 2 black ground 3 white - 5 volts 4 red +5 volts 5 red +5 volts 6 red +5 volts
Connector part numbers Motherboard connector Cable connector Terminals Maximum current per circuit Molex 15-48-0106 Molex 90331 Molex 08-50-0276 5 amps
Unofficial cable / connector maximum wattage delivery for main rails Voltage rail Number of lines Maximum current Maximum wattage +5 volts 3 or 4 15 or 20 amps 75 or 100 watts +12 volts 1 5 amps 60 watts
In old PCs , almost all of the chips ran directly off of the 5 volt rail .
As a result the PSU delivers most of its wattage at 5 volts .
There are three or four lines dedicated to the 5 volt rail .
The other main rail is 12 volts .
That was used primarily to run disk drives , motors , and fans .
The two negative rails are " bias " supplies which only have to provide small amounts of current .
Just for interest 's sake , here 's the specification for the PSU which came with the original IBM PC .
It provides a maximum of 63.5 watts .
Boy , those were the days .

4 pin peripheral power cable
The four pin peripheral power cable dates back to the original PC .
It was used for floppy drives and hard disks .
It 's still around and is now also used for all kinds of things including add - on fans , extra video card power , supplemental motherboard power , and case lighting .
It 's as old as the hills but is still very widely used .
The connector is shaped so that it only fits in one way .
You do n't have to worry about inserting it the wrong way .
People often use the term " 4 pin Molex power cable " or " 4 pin Molex " to refer to a four pin peripheral power cable .
It 's not a technically useful term because the 4 pin 12 volt cable is also a 4 pin Molex cable ( Molex makes lots of connectors ) but " 4 pin Molex " is commonly used to refer to peripheral cables anyway .

I do n't know of any official definition of the maximum current allowed in a peripheral cable .
The connector can handle 13 amps according to the manufacturer .
But you normally find 18 awg wire in the peripheral cables .
If you have an 18 inch cable ( about a half a meter ) and are running 13 amps through 18 gauge wire then you get a voltage drop of about 0.25 volts counting both the power wire and the ground ( it 's got to go both ways ) and the dissipation is about 3.3 watts .
That 's not good .
I 've just played it safe and listed the maximum current as 5 amps .

Current power supplies usually have at least two separate peripheral power cables , each of which has two or more peripheral connectors .
When you 're plugging in multiple high powered devices it 's a good idea to spread the load between all of your cables .
Do n't just plug all your devices into one cable unless they 're relatively low load devices .
Spreading the current between the cables reduces the voltage drops and power loss .
If they 're relatively low current devices like fans or it's just a disk drive or two then it does n't really matter .
But if you 're putting lots of hard disks into a computer ( some can draw almost 3 amps at 12 volts when doing some operations ) or connecting a video card 's auxiliary power , then spread the loads between the peripheral power cables .
It 's also helpful if you use a connector as close to the PSU as possible rather than sticking things at the end of the cable .
Extra wire just means more voltage drop .
And if you 're using a peripheral connector to PCI Express adapter then be sure to plug each of the adapter 's peripheral connectors into a separate PSU cable .
They gave you two peripheral connectors for a reason .
Plugging them both into the same PSU cable forces your video card to draw its 12 volt power through one 18 gauge wire .
That increases your voltage drop and power dissipation in the cable .
Some current high - end video cards can suck up more than 10 amps at 12 volts with most of it coming through the PCI Express connector so it pays to be careful .
It will probably work if you do n't spread the load but there 's no excuse for not doing it properly .
They gave you multiple cables .
You might as well use them .
Plus there 's just something creepy about having warm wires even if they 're not melting .
You will occasionally run into peripheral connectors which do n't have all four wires .
They are usually 12 volt only cables intended for fans .
Never plug one of those into a disk drive .
Drives expect both 5 and 12 volts to be provided .
Some of the two - wire peripheral connectors are for speed - controlled fans .
That means that the voltage changes depending on the desired fan speed .
The connector will only provide 12 volts when the fan is going full speed and the voltage decreases to slow the fan down .
Definitely do n't plug that one into anything but a fan !
Normally this kind of peripheral connector has " fan " printed on it to warn you .
As long as a peripheral connector has four wires : one yellow , two black , and one red and it does n't have some kind of printed warning attached then it's a standard peripheral cable and you can plug it into anything .
Floppy drive power cable
The four pin floppy drive cable showed up when PCs started including 3.5 inch floppy drives .
This kind of cable is also sometimes used as an auxiliary power cable for AGP video cards which use more power than can be drawn from the motherboard slot .
The connector is shaped so that it only fits in one way so you do n't have to worry about inserting it the wrong way .
Floppy cables are built with small connectors and 20 awg wire so they are limited to relatively low current uses .

6 pin auxiliary power cable
The aux power cable was added to provide extra wattage to motherboards for 3.3 and 5 volts .
This connector is rarely used anymore .
It 's most commonly found on older dual CPU AMD motherboards .
You 're more likely to sight Bigfoot than a motherboard which uses this connector .
It plugs into the 6 pin version of the motherboard connector used by the original PC main power cables .

SATA power cable
SATA was introduced to upgrade the ATA interface ( also called IDE ) to a more advanced design .
SATA includes both a data cable and a power cable .
The power cable replaces the old 4 pin peripheral cable and adds support for 3.3 volts ( if fully implemented ) .
The connector is shaped so it can only be plugged in the correct way .

You have to be careful about SATA power cables .
Some of them are missing the 3.3 volt wire .
People with older power supplies often use adapters which convert from 4 pin peripheral cables to SATA power cables .
But since 4 pin peripheral connectors only supply 5 and 12 volts , the SATA connector is missing 3.3 volts ( there 's no orange wire ) .
There are also a few older power supplies which inexplicably have SATA power cables which are missing the 3.3 volt wire .
Currently , SATA drives rarely use 3.3 volts .
That may be because there are too many people using adapters so the drive makers do n't want the headaches which come with using 3.3 volts .
But in the future , 3.3 volt drives may become common so you need to be careful when using SATA power cables which do n't implement 3.3 volts .
ATX 20 pin main power cable
In 1996 PC makers started switching to the ATX standard which defined a new 20 pin motherboard power connector .
It includes a 3.3 volt rail which is used to power newer chips which require a lower voltage than 5 volts .
It also has a standby 5 volt rail which is always on even when the power supply is turned off to provide standby power to the motherboard when the machine is sleeping .
The new connector also allows the motherboard to turn the power supply on and off rather than depend on the user to flip a power switch .
This connector is polarized so it can only be plugged in pointing in the correct direction .

Some of the voltage lines on the connector may have smaller sense wires which allow the power supply to sense what voltage is actually seen by the motherboard .
These are pretty common on the 3.3 volt line in pin 11 but are sometimes used for other voltages too .
The - 5 volt line on pin 18 was made optional in ATX12V 1.3 ( introduced in 2003 ) because - 5 had been rarely used for years .
Newer motherboards virtually never require - 5 volts but many older motherboards do .
Most newer power supplies do n't provide - 5 volts in which case the white wire is missing .

Dell used to ship many computers which used motherboards and power supplies which looked like plain old ATX but were not really ATX at all .
If you plugged a real ATX power supply into the motherboard then things went kaboom ( or frzzzzzap or ... ) .
Sadly , some large computer vendors like to lock customers into buying upgrades from them rather from a third party .
That 's nasty enough but Dell built their non-standard computers and motherboards with what looked like standard ATX components .
You only found out otherwise once sparks started flying .
The Dell PCs which were carrying this ticking time - bomb were made between 1996 and 2000 .
If you 're replacing a Dell power supply from this era then you should call Dell and make sure it 's not a proprietary design .
And if they say yes then be sure to voice your displeasure .
This is an evil business practice which should stop .
You can plug a 20 pin ATX power cable into a motherboard with a 24 pin ATX connector .
The image above shows the 20 pin power cable plugged into a 24 pin motherboard .
A 20 pin power cable only fits into one end of a 24 pin motherboard connector so you can't insert it incorrectly .
The 24 pin motherboard connector is actually just the 20 pin connector with 4 extra pins added on the end .
The original 20 pins were unchanged .
The extra 4 pins are not separate rails .
They 're just extra lines to provide more current to the same rails .
On every 24 pin motherboard I 've seen , the extra lines for ground , 3.3 , 5 , and 12 are just connected to the other lines on the same rail from the 20 pin connector .
I 've never heard of exceptions and it does n't make sense for motherboard makers to create any .
As a result , you can plug a 20 pin cable into a 24 pin motherboard and it will work just fine .
At least , it will for a while .
They added those extra 4 pins for a reason .
When you plug a 20 pin cable into a 24 pin connector you 're not providing the extra current carrying capacity which may be needed by the motherboard .
If your motherboard 's current requirements are low enough then it will work properly with only a 20 pin power cabled plugged in .
But if the motherboard draws enough current , then you can overheat the 20 pins you 're using on the 24 pin connector .
I 've seen enough pictures of burned ATX main connectors to assure you that this happens .
In adding the extra four pins , 3.3 volts went from 3 to 4 lines .
5 volts when from 4 to 5 lines .
12 volts went from 1 to 2 lines so its capacity doubled .
Connectors really do get hot if you overload them so the safest thing to do is use a real 24 pin power supply on a motherboard with a 24 pin connector .
Note that your 24 pin machine may work fine with a 20 pin power supply until you add a PCI Express card later on down the road .
PCI Express cards can draw up to 75 watts through the motherboard connector so adding an expansion card can substantially increase power draw through the main power cable .
Many PCI
Express video cards which have the 6 pin or 8 pin PCI Express power cable still draw a substantial portion of their 12 volt load through the PCI Express slot .
The extra 4 pins doubled the current capacity of the 12 volt rail so that one is easy to overload when only using a 20 pin main power cable .
The picture above shows an adapter which allows you to plug a 20 pin power supply into a 24 pin motherboard .
These do not solve the problems mentioned above .
In fact , they usually make things worse .
You still have only the same old 20 wires and pin&socket connectors that you would have if you plugged it directly into the motherboard .
But with the adapter you also have longer wires and another set of pins&sockets so you have a higher voltage drop and more things which can go wrong .
All the adapter does is remove the problem from the 24 pin motherboard connector and move it to the 20 pin connector on the adapter .
About the only good thing it does is to make sure the 20 pin connector on the adapter melts rather than the 24 pin connector on the motherboard .
You should n't underestimate the potential problems which come from adding another connector between the power supply and the motherboard .
The resistance of connectors can increase due to being plugged and unplugged .
Increasing the resistance makes the connector drop more voltage and dissipate more heat .
Any number of physical changes can also cause higher connector resistance which causes more problems .
You should n't put an extra connector in a high current path unless you 've got a good reason .
That 's a good rule for power cables in general but it goes doubly for the high current draws you sometimes find through motherboard main power cables .
The best practice is to avoid these 20 to 24 pin adapters and get a real 24 pin power supply .
ATX 24 pin main power cable
The 24 pin main power connector was added in ATX12V 2.0 to provide extra power needed by PCI Express slots .
The older 20 pin main power cable only has one 12 volt line .
The new 24 pin connector added one line apiece for ground , 3.3 , 5 , and 12 volts .
The extra pins made the auxiliary power cable unnecessary so most ATX12V 2.x power supplies do n't have them .
The 24 pin connector is polarized so it can only be plugged in pointing in the correct direction .

Some of the voltage lines on the connector may have smaller sense wires which allow the power supply to sense what voltage is actually seen by the motherboard .
These are pretty common on the 3.3 volt line in pin 13 but are sometimes used for other voltages too .
The - 5 volt line on pin 20 was made optional in ATX12V 1.3 ( introduced in 2003 ) because - 5 had been rarely used for years .

If you have an ATX power supply with a 24 pin main cable , it 's okay to plug it into a motherboard with a 20 pin connector .
It was designed to work that way .
You can see an example in the picture above .
The extra 4 pins on the cable just hang over the end of the motherboard connector .
The 24 pin cable only fits into a 20 pin socket at one end so you can't plug it in incorrectly .
The extra 4 pins were added to the 24 pin version of the cable to provide one extra wire for ground , 3.3 , 5 , and 12 volts .
But it 's okay to leave those 4 pins disconnected because a motherboard with a 20 pin connector does n't need them .
The only problem you can bump into ( literally ) is if there is something blocking the spot where the 24 pin cable hangs over the end .
Or sometimes the end of the 20 pin motherboard connector is too thick to fit between the pins of the 24 pin cable .
You can solve that problem by carefully shaving down one end of the 20 pin motherboard connector .
It 's just plastic .
You wo n't miss it .
If you can't get them to fit together then you can get an adapter cable which will make it work .
The 24 pin cable plugs into one end of the adapter and then the adapter plugs into the 20 pin motherboard .
But you should avoid using that kind of adapter if you can because the extra wire and connector are just more things which can go wrong .
Adapters also slightly increase the voltage drop which is something worth avoiding .
It 's better to first see if you can get a 24 pin cable to fit into a 20 pin motherboard before resorting to an adapter .
ATX 20+4 pin main power cable
Motherboards can come with either a 20 pin main power connector or a 24 pin main power connector .
Many power supplies come with a 20+4 cable which is compatible with both 20 and 24 pin motherboards .
A 20+4 power cable has two pieces : a 20 pin piece , and a 4 pin piece .
If you leave the two pieces separate then you can plug the 20 pin piece into a 20 pin motherboard and leave the 4 pin piece unplugged .
Be sure to leave the 4 pin piece unplugged even if it fits into another connector .
The 4 pin piece is not compatible with any other connectors .
If you plug the two pieces of a 20+4 power cable together then you have a 24 pin power cable which can be plugged into a 24 pin motherboard .
4 pin ATX +12 volt power cable
Older computers put most of their load on 3.3 and 5 volts .
As time passed , computers drew more and more of their load from 12 volts ( see here ) .
Before this power cable was introduced there was just one 12 volt line provided to the motherboard .
This cable added two more 12 volt lines so more of the load could be shifted to 12 volts .
The power coming from this connector is usually used to power the CPU but some motherboards use it for other things as well .
The presense of this connector on a motherboard means it's an ATX12V motherboard .
For dual 12 volt rail power supplies , this connector provides the voltage refered to as 12V2 .
The power cable which plugs into the 4 pin connector has two black wires and two yellow wires .
This cable is sometimes called an " ATX12V " cable or " P4 " cable although neither of those are technically accurate descriptions .
If you have one of these connectors on a motherboard then you must plug a power cable into it or your CPU wo n't get any power .
The one exception is that when this connector was new , some motherboards shipped with a socket into which you could plug a 4 pin peripheral power cable as an alternative .
That helped people who had older power supplies which did n't have the 4 pin 12 volt cable .
The 4 pin 12 volt cable is polarized so it can only be plugged into the 4 pin motherboard connector correctly .
If you look carefully at the picture above you can see that two of the pins are square and the other two have rounded corners .
The motherboard connectors also have the same square and rounded arrangement so the power cable only fits in one way .
At least that 's true unless you try really hard to force it into the connector .
With enough force you can sometimes get a cable with a small number of pins into a connector which does n't match .
If you look carefully you can also see that the square and rounded pattern matches various positions on other motherboard connectors like the 20 pin main power connector and 24 pin main power connector .
Do yourself a favor and only plug the 4 pin 12 volt cable into the motherboard connector where it belongs ( unless you enjoy smoke and fried components ) .
If your power supply does n't have a 4 pin 12 V cable then you can provide one with the adapter shown above .
It converts a 4 pin peripheral cable into a 4 pin 12 V cable .

You can plug a 4 pin 12 volt power cable into an 8 pin EPS motherboard connector but there 's no guarantee that it will work .
If the motherboard expects only one 12 volt rail then a 4 pin 12 volt cable may work .
If the motherboard expects two 12 volt rails ( many dual CPU motherboards require one 12 volt rail per CPU ) then it wo n't work .
Even if the motherboard works with a 4 pin 12 volt cable , you are still only providing half of the current carrying capacity which would be provided by an 8 pin EPS cable .
That can overheat both the motherboard connector and 4 pin cable .
Scorched or melted connectors can be a result .
A motherboard which has the 8 pin EPS connector expects a lot of current and you are taking a serious risk by plugging in a 4 pin cable .
The 4 pin cable only fits at one end of the 8 pin EPS motherboard connector so you can't plug it in improperly .
That is , it only fits into one end of the motherboard connector unless you force it .
If the cable does n't go into the socket easily then you 're probably trying to plug it into the wrong end .
But then again , it 's not a good idea to try to run with a 4 pin cable in an 8 pin motherboard anyway .
8 pin EPS +12 volt power cable
This cable was originally created for workstations to provide 12 volts to power multiple CPUs .
But as time has passed many CPUs require more 12 volt power and the 8 pin 12 volt cable is often used instead of a 4 pin 12 volt cable .
Depending on the power supply , the connector may contain one 12 volt rail in all 8 pins or two 12 volt rails taking up 4 pins apiece .
It is often refered to as an " EPS12V " cable .
The 8 pin 12 volt cable is polarized so it can only be plugged into the 8 pin motherboard connector correctly .
If you look carefully at the picture above you can see that four of the pins are square and the other four have rounded corners .
The motherboard connectors also have the same square and rounded arrangement so the power cable only fits in one way .
At least that 's true unless you try really hard to force it into the connector .
With enough force you can sometimes get a cable with a small number of pins into a connector which does n't match .
The 8 pin cable has enough pins that it 's pretty hard to insert it in the wrong direction but determined people might be able to do it .
If you look carefully you can also see that the square and rounded pattern matches various positions on other motherboard connectors like the 20 pin main power connector and 24 pin main power connector .
You should only plug the 8 pin 12 volt cable into the motherboard connector where it belongs unless you enjoy the smell of fried electronics .
You can also plug an 8 pin 12 volt cable into a 4 pin 12 volt motherboard connector .
I do n't have a picture of this one but it looks similar to this .
Four of the pins on the 8 pin cable fit into the motherboard connector and the other four pins hang off the end .
The 8 pin cable only fits into one end of the 4 pin motherboard connector unless you try hard to force it into the wrong position .
The 8 pin cable is electrically compatible but it may not fit into a 4 pin motherboard .
There is often a component which blocks the area where the 4 pins would hang off the end .
And sometimes the plastic end of the 4 pin connector is too thick to fit between the pins of the 8 pin cable .
Make sure that you do n't try to plug an 8 pin 12 volt cable into the 8 Pin PCI Express power connector on a video card .
The two cables look very similar so it 's easy to get the two confused .
8 Pin PCI
Express power cables are usually labeled to distinguish them from 8 pin 12 volt cables .
The PCI Express cable usually has " PCI - E " printed on the connector .
If there are no labels then you can usually use wire colors to tell the two kinds of cables apart .
An 8 pin 12 volt cable has yellow wires on the same side as the connector clip .
An 8 Pin PCI Express cable has black wires on the clip side .
The two power cables are also keyed differently so you can't plug one kind of power cable into the other kind of connector .
But as with this kind of connector , you can sometimes force the wrong kind of cable into a connector if you push hard enough .
Make sure you have the right kind of cable before plugging it in .
The two are definitely not compatible with each other .

If you do n't have an 8 pin 12 volt cable then you can use the adapter shown above .
It converts a couple of 4 pin peripheral power cables into an 8 pin 12 volt cable .
If you use one of these adapters then be sure to plug the 4 pin peripheral connectors into separate cables coming from the power supply .
If you plug them both into the same power supply cable then you are drawing all the power of the 8 pin 12 volt connector through a single 18 gauge wire .
You can often get away with that but there 's no reason to do it .
4+4 pin +12 volt power cable
Motherboards can come with either a 4 pin 12 volt connector or an 8 pin 12 volt connector .
Many power supplies come with a 4+4 pin 12 volt cable which is compatible with both 4 and 8 pin motherboards .
A 4+4 power cable has two separate 4 pin pieces .
If you plug the two pieces of a 4+4 power cable together then you have a 8 pin power cable which can be plugged into an 8 pin 12 volt connector .
If you leave the two pieces separate then you can plug one of the 4 pin pieces into a 4 pin 12 volt connector and leave the other 4 pin piece unplugged .
If you look carefully at the image above then you can see the polarization of the pins which prevents you from plugging the cable in improperly .
Some of the pins are square and some of them have rounded off corners .
The motherboard connectors have matching square and rounded off corners to prevent the cable from being plugged in the wrong way .
But if you look really carefully at the right half of this particular cable and then look at the 8 pin 12 volt cable pictured above you 'll notice that they do n't match .
A regular 8 pin cable has four square pins and four rounded ones but the 4+4 cable shown above has two square pins and 6 rounded ones .
The left half of the 4+4 matches the left half of an 8 pin cable but the right half is different .
Hmmmm ...
And this is n't some bizarre cable either .
I 've seen plenty of 4+4s which look like this one .
And then there are other 4+4 cables which look just like an 8 pin cable split in two ( which makes sense ) .
Since rounded pins fit into square holes in motherboard connectors , this particular cable will fit just fine into an 8 pin 12 volt motherboard connector .
But both halves of this 4+4 will fit into a 4 pin 12 volt motherboard connector .
You 're supposed to use the left half of the cable shown above when plugging it into a 4 pin motherboard connector but the right half will also fit .
As it happens , either half will work fine in a 4 pin motherboard because both halves of the 4+4 just provide 12 volts .
The pinouts are the same for both halves so either one will work .
I 'm not sure why they make cables like this one because you 'd figure a 4+4 cable would just be an 8 pin cable which splits in two .
And you only need one half of a 4+4 cable to plug into a 4 pin motherboard .
The other half is unused .
But the kind of 4+4 cable shown above is pretty common so do n't let it throw you .
6 pin PCI Express power cable
This cable is used to provide extra 12 volt power to PCI Express expansion cards .
PCI Express motherboard slots can provide a maximum of 75 watts .
Many video cards draw significantly more than 75 watts so the 6 pin PCI Express power cable was created .
These high - power cards draw most of their power from the 12 volt rail so this cable provides only 12 volts .
These are sometimes called " PCI Express cables " .
They are also occasionally called " PEG cables " where " PEG " stands for PCI Express Graphics .
If your power supply does n't have a 6 pin PCI Express cable then you can use the adapter shown above on the right to convert two 4 pin peripheral cables into a PCI Express cable .
If you use an adapter then be sure to plug the 4 pin peripheral connectors into separate cables coming from the power supply .
If you plug them both into the same power supply cable then you are drawing all the power of the PCI Express connector through a single 18 gauge wire .
You can usually get away with that but there 's no reason to do it .
The PCI Express 6 pin connector is polarized so it can only be plugged in pointing in the correct direction .
But as with connectors of this type , you can sometimes force them into the wrong kind of socket if you try hard enough .
If it does n't slide in easily then you 're probably plugging it into the wrong place .
Some video cards come with the 8 pin PCI Express power connector to support higher wattage than the 6 pin PCI Express connectors .
It 's okay to plug a 6 pin PCI Express power cable into an 8 pin PCI Express connector .
It 's designed to work that way but will be limited to the lower wattage provided by the 6 pin version of the cable .
The 6 pin cable only fits into one end of the 8 pin connector so you can't insert it incorrectly but you can sometimes force the 6 pin cable in the wrong way if you try hard enough .
Video cards can sense whether you have plugged a 6 pin or 8 pin cable into an 8 pin connector so the video card can impose some kind of restriction when running with only a 6 pin power cable .
Some cards will refuse to run with only a 6 pin cable in an 8 pin socket .
Others will work with a 6 pin cable at normal speeds but will not allow overclocking .
Check the video card documentation to get the rules .
But if you do n't have any other information then just assume that if your video card has an 8 pin connector then you must plug in an 8 pin cable .

The PCI Express specification is , unfortunately , not a free , public specification .
So most people have never seen it .
Including me .
ATX specification : freely available to all .
PCI Express specification : expensive so hardly anyone has seen it .
ATX : good .
PCI Express : bad .
It 's a shame when a widely used standard is n't freely available to the public .
Nonetheless , information leaks out from the specification and the 6 pin PCI Express power cable is actually rated at an extremely conservative 75 watts .
I have no idea why the wattage is rated so low because the specifications from Molex clearly allow substantially more power .
Part of the reason may be that pin 2 ( listed above as a 12 volt line ) may be listed as not connected in the specification .
I 've never seen a 6 pin PCI Express power cable with pin 2 not connected .
They 've all had a 12 volt line connected to pin 2 .
I 've also seen claims that there may be unimplemented sense lines in the specification .
Welcome to the uncertainty which happens when you do n't have freely available specifications .
Even with only two 12 volt lines the standard implementation of PCI Express power cables use large enough gauge wire and a good enough connector to provide much more than the three amps per wire required to provide 75 watts .
Nonetheless , the 6 pin PCI Express power cable officially provides only 75 watts .
In all likelihood , however , real implementations of this power cable can provide far more than 75 watts .
8 pin PCI Express power cable
The PCI Express 2.0 specification released in January 2007 added an 8 pin PCI Express power cable .
It 's just an 8 pin version of the 6 Pin PCI Express power cable .
Both are primarily used to provide supplemental power to video cards .
The older 6 pin version officially provides a maximum of 75 watts ( although unofficially it can usually provide much more ) whereas the new 8 pin version provides a maximum of 150 watts .
It is very easy to confuse the 8 pin version with the very similar - looking EPS 8 pin 12 volt cable .
The 8 pin PCI Express and the EPS 8 pin 12 volt connectors are polarized differently so you wo n't be able to plug one kind of cable into the other kind of connector .
That is , you wo n't be able to plug the wrong kind of cable in unless you try really hard .
Unfortunately , the Molex Mini - fit Jr. connectors used by both kinds of power cables can sometimes be forced into a differently - polarized connector if they only have a few pins and you push hard enough .
If the cable wo n't slide in easily then you 're probably trying to insert the wrong kind of cable .
The 8 pin PCI Express connector does have a small plastic bridge which prevents it from being plugged into an EPS 8 pin 12 volt motherboard connector .
You can see the bridge in the image above between the rightmost two pins in the top row of the connector .
But there 's no such protection to prevent EPS 8 pin 12 volt cables from being plugged into an 8 pin PCI Express connector on a video card .
That combination may fit if you shove hard enough .
And if you plug in the wrong kind of cable then expect fireworks .
Some of the grounds and 12 volts wires for an EPS 8 pin 12 volt are reversed compared to an 8 pin PCI Express .
Fortunately , most 8 pin PCI Express connectors are labeled " PCI - E " so people wo n't confuse them with EPS 8 pin 12 volt cables .
If the connectors are n't labeled then you can tell an 8 pin PCI Express power cable from an EPS 8 pin 12 volt cable by checking the color of the wires which plug into the clip side of the connector .
On the EPS 8 pin cable , the yellow wires ( the 12 volt wires ) go into the clip side of the connector .
On the 8 pin PCI Express cable , the wires on the clip side are all black ( grounds ) .
That 's the same as it is with the 6 Pin PCI Express power cable .
Of course , none of this helps you if your cable uses the trendy all - the - same - color - wires design which is popular with high - fashion power supplies .
In that case you 'll just have to be very careful or hope the connectors are labeled .

6+2 pin PCI
Express power cable
Some video cards have 6 Pin PCI Express power connectors and others have 8 Pin PCI Express power connectors .
Many power supplies come with a 6+2 PCI Express power cable which is compatible with both kinds of video cards .
The 6+2 PCI Express power cable is made up of two pieces : a 6 pin piece , and a 2 pin piece .
If you put the two pieces together then you have a full 8 pin PCI Express power cable .
But if you split the connector into two parts then you can plug the 6 pin part into the older 6 pin PCI Express connector and leave the 2 pin part unplugged .
That way , your power supply only needs to have one 6+2 cable to be compatible with both 6 pin and 8 pin PCI Express connectors .
To the Editor :
Re “ The Fleecing of America , ” by Roger Cohen ( column , The New York Times on the Web , Sept. 22 ) :
For those who still refer to history , it seems to me that in the 20th century , the United States was Rome to Britain ’s Athens .
In this century , it looks as if the United States will be Athens to China ’s Rome .
What I see in all this is that these developments were inescapable and will be so again .
There was nothing Athens ( or Britain ) could have done to avert the turning of the tide .
It was demographic , technological and cultural .
Our culture is now so fraught with divisions between the fundamentalist antigovernment voters and the social - minded ones that this country appears to be veering far from our mission as put forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution .
It was once said that when the United States catches a cold , the rest of the world sneezes .
Those days are rapidly disappearing , and our leaders ’ task in the future will be to make the best of it , with the humility to see that we are but one nation among others .
Thinking big , researchers in California are looking to upscale 3D printing techniques to construct entire houses , including internal wiring and plumbing .
The houses would be built at rapid speed and at around a fifth of the cost of current construction methods .
The system , called Contour Crafting , is not limited to boxy , utilitarian designs either .
The system can recreate just about anything designed using CAD software as long as it can support its own weight .
The folks at the USC Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies ( CRAFT ) are the brains behind the project and they have just teamed up with the construction giant , Caterpillar , for funding to make their plans a reality .
The USC team already have a working model that can create a six - foot concrete wall , all without any kind of human input .
Scaled up , the reduction in labor costs , injuries , waste and construction time will be enormous .
When you consider that annual U.S. construction - related expenditures come to around $ 1 trillion , this new production method could be extremely beneficial both to the industry and to society on the whole .
The team believe a full - scale , automated setup could produce a 2,000 - square - foot , two - story house in just 24 hours , costing around a fifth of the normal expense .
Apparently NASA is interested in the team ’s project too .
They ’re after a simple method for building bases on the Moon or Mars to save astronauts from hard manual labor ( and from getting their new whites all dirty ….. gotta look good for the cameras ) .

General Nikolai Makarov meets Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ( unseen ) in the Kremlin , June 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / RIA Novosti/Pool
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - U.S. and Russian military chiefs on Tuesday met for the first time since Russian forces crushed government troops of America ’s ally Georgia in a war that has strained relations between the two countries .
The U.S. embassy in Helsinki said Navy Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , met Russian General Nikolai Makarov , head of the Russian general staff .
An embassy spokesman described the tone of the meeting as “ cordial , but candid . ”
“ ( They ) discussed a wide range of issues of mutual concern , including the current security environment in Georgia , the future of the NATO alliance , and the current status of U.S. missile defense plans in Europe , ” the spokesman said .
In the aftermath of the five - day war in Georgia in August , in which Russian forces overran areas of the country , the Pentagon said it would review all aspects of its relationship with Moscow .
Washington shelved a deal on civil nuclear cooperation with Russia after the conflict , but the two countries have kept talking on issues such as North Korea ’s nuclear program and moves to press Iran to suspend its nuclear work .
Russia also strongly opposes U.S. plans for sitting parts of a missile shield in central Europe , saying it could start an new arms race .
The United States contends that the shield , elements of which are planned for Poland and the Czech Republic , is needed to protect against possible missile attacks from what it calls rogue states , specifically Iran .
What 's the first thing you will notice as you look through this anti-truther defence - of - the - official - version site ?
No comments enabled .
No forums .
Even the email @ddress is given in the FAQ with " conditions " .
This guy obviously has his mind so made up he is unwilling to consider the truth movement as anything but a Conspiracy THEORY .
There is a difference between conspiracy theory and transpiracy research .
Theory is conjecture .
You can connect a few dots and come up with a hypothesis that explains how an event took place and what this is to me is a Conspiracy Theory .
The better truth - movement folk ( Sander Hicks continues to come to mind ) are the ones who pay more attention to actual proven fact than to conjecture .
Owing to the flexible nature of reality in these times , let me clarify that , to me , " fact " means " consensus reality cannot and does not argue with it . "
Of course , the PNAC folks and their fan club who are WELL AWARE they can create reality with propaganda , and do so , regularly , argue with it plenty .
But they are n't stupid ( just very , very wrong ) and they know the difference between consensus reality and subjective reality , and their business is to turn one into the other .
So often it is ALSO true that the anti-Shrubbery will do the SAME THING - create consensus reality from subjective reality .
It becomes OUR business to do this because the enemy is doing it , but if we are to have more credibility than the enemy we have to be careful about how and when we do this .
I feel it is very important to not do this in the truth movement .
One does not NEED to do this to create a solid case for US involvement in 9/11 .
The behaviour of the top officials in this administration is the most telling evidence there is .
( That , and Able Danger .
It 's pretty difficult to go on believing the official story when one finds that the Pentagon 's own terrorist teams were held up investigating Atta and the NY jihadist cells ... this is info that did n't break until 2005 - 06 so it does n't get the attention it should .
It 's some of the most convincing material there is , especially to republicans , conservatives and patriots . )
The 9/11 timeline is VERY hard to dispute because everything on it is NOT conjecture .
It is agreed - upon .
There are people who regularly watch FOX NEWS that cannot argue with the timeline .
I find it very telling that this guy refuses to allow debate .
EVERY truther site out there allows debate .
What does that say for our debunker ?
It says to me we have a person who really , really WANTS to believe the official version .
Which , we should remember , is VERY understandable .
No one WANTS to believe the truth about 9/11 or even believe it could be POSSIBLE .
I never did .
I wanted very much to be proven wrong about this .
But the material on the site is unconvincing , and the attitude of avoidance of debate is even more so .
Well could a robot called Kota the Triceratops beat the Nintendo Wii in Christmas Sales this year ?
With a price tag of approx £ 300 here in the UK , and approx $ 300 in the US ( do n’t get me started on the price differences between us on practically everything !!)
I ’d say quite categorically that the dinosaur does n’t stand a chance .
But , would n’t it be cool if it came close , even pushed into the Top 10 toys for Christmas
So , what is Kota …
It is a children ’s life - sized interactive robotic dinosaur .
It is ride - able and looks quite life - like ( well , from what I imagine a Triceratops to look like ) .
With a comfy seat and secure ride handle hidden away behind the head , so that it ’s safe for the kids too .
Kota has interactive sensors on the body so that it can react to the touch of the kids , or the big kids ( like me ! ) that are playing with him / her .
Kota also talks , in dino - language of course and eats leaves that are bundled with the toy .
Stock of Kota the dinosaur seems to be available for Christmas in the UK from Amazon.co.uk , Play.com and from the specialist gadget retailers : iwantoneofthose.com and firebox.com .
Kota is also available for order for USA consumers from , for example Amazon.com .
UPDATE 30/11/08 - Amazon.co.uk and Play.com are having a price war and have both slashed £ 80 off the RRP , so Kota is now available for £ 219.99 !!
UK Retailer Description Price Link Kota the Triceratops £ 219.99 Kota the Triceratops £ 299.00 Kota the Triceratops £ 299.95 Kota the Triceratops £ 219.99
USA Retailer Description Price Link Kota the Triceratops $ 299.99

Nearly six weeks after Russia sent troops into neighboring Georgia , the Bush administration remains deeply divided over whether to retaliate against it -- and some officials fear the internal conflict is already undermining strategically important national security collaborations .
Some senior administration officials , including Vice President Dick Cheney and some hard - liners in the Pentagon , are advocating the continuation of what they confirm has been a White House - imposed communications blackout on most dealings with Russia and a halt to nearly all bilateral initiatives on security matters .
They want to send Russia a message that the United States wo n’t stand for its Aug. 7 incursion through two pro-Moscow breakaway republics and into Georgia , a staunch U.S. ally .
They say the sortie was only the latest in a series of hostile actions that require a wholesale recalibration of U.S. security policy , from an inclusive one that treats Moscow as an ally on global security matters to a sharply curtailed approach that considers it an untrustworthy potential enemy .
On the other side are officials at the State and Justice Departments and Pentagon , including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who have fought behind the scenes for a continuance and even a rededication of national security alliances with Russia .
They believe such ties , particularly on joint counter - terrorism and counter - proliferation efforts , are too important to jeopardize over the conflict in Georgia .
Advertisement
“ Those who want to scale back are winning , ” one State Department official said Wednesday , referring to those advocating the harder - line approach .
Policymakers “ across the board ” have been told to review U.S. - Russia alliances in response to an informal directive from President Bush “ that there have to be costs for this really terrible behavior by Russia , ” said a second State Department official .
Those officials and others spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing diplomatic sensitivities .
Already , many U.S. diplomatic , law enforcement and intelligence relationships with Russia have been suspended , along with at least one military exercise .
Some hard - liners are lobbying to downscale those alliances permanently , officials say .
Most officials at the level of deputy assistant secretary and above have been told to avoid engagement with Russian counterparts except in multilateral settings like the United Nations , according to White House and State Department officials .
That has effectively paralyzed the many political appointees assigned to foster existing bilateral relationships and develop new ones .

Some high - level meetings have been postponed indefinitely , including a trip to Russia by John Rood , the acting undersecretary of State for arms control and international security , to discuss various security issues and to negotiate a new pact to replace the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START .
And the congressionally appointed Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism has been asked to not go on its upcoming fact - finding visit to Moscow .
Many U.S. officials said the freeze could n’t come at a worse time .
They cite intelligence showing that the Caucasus region increasingly is becoming a crossroads for Islamic extremists , criminal mafias , black market traffickers and corrupt government officials .
“ What we have done is essentially put Russia on a ‘ do not communicate with , do not cooperate with ’ list across the entire spectrum of relations , ” said Donald Mahley , who recently retired after serving as one of the State Department ’s most senior international security and nonproliferation officials .
“ And that puts at risk a lot of things that are important to our own national security . ”
Advertisement
Some officials say such a hard - line posture could backfire because the reemerging superpower is key to most important U.S. security alliances .
And Russia ’s vast oil wealth and increasing political influence give it the ability to undermine U.S. interests globally , in part by supplying arms and nuclear assistance to unfriendly nations and blocking efforts to contain the rogue ambitions of Iran and North Korea , Mahley said .
Russia ’s cooperation is needed to secure its own nuclear and chemical weapons stockpiles and those of about 20 other countries , and to prevent WMD material , technology and know - how from getting into the hands of terrorists , Mahley and other officials said .
Administration officials downplayed the potential long - term damage from the current freeze , and said the United States risked even worse consequences if it failed to think through how it would respond to Russia in unison with European allies .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the administration wanted to work with Russia on “ important areas of cooperation ” such as counter - terrorism and counter - proliferation .
Advertisement
But , he added , “ We continue to review all our options as we assess the way forward in U.S. - Russia relations .
Russia ’s behavior certainly complicates diplomatic negotiations in a number of areas . ”
One senior State Department nonproliferation official said it was Moscow , not Washington , “ that is deciding to be uncooperative ” on many counter - terrorism , counter - proliferation and military issues , such as forging closer security ties with Venezuela .
Some officials and experts agree , and say the war of words between Washington and Moscow over Georgia has done irrevocable damage to security relationships that have helped the two countries weather previous political storms .
“ The environment for working relationships is being poisoned , ” said one international counter - terrorism official who is in contact with leaders in both countries .
Advertisement
In recent weeks , some administration officials -- nonpolitical career security officials in particular -- have scrambled to keep open the lines of communication and cooperation with Russian counterparts .
Rose Goettemoeller , who heads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ’s Moscow Center , said some ground - level “ threat reduction ” pacts between the two countries continued , but that she and other influential intermediaries feared that too could change .
“ People are mad at the Russians , and they should be , for good reason , ” said Goettemoeller , who was an assistant energy secretary for national security in the Clinton administration .
But , she added , “ Is it still in our national interest to pursue key agenda items like nonproliferation and counter - terrorism , or are we simply going to slam the door and turn out the lights ?
There are some people in Washington who would like to do that . ”
The few U.S. - Russia bilateral meetings these days are occurring only because they are “ below the radar ” of hard - line administration officials , the international counter - terrorism official said .
Advertisement
On Wednesday , Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Safonov met in Germany with the State Department ’s Coordinator for Counter - Terrorism , Dell L. Dailey , but the State Department considered it so sensitive that Dailey ’s office would not even confirm the meeting .
“ They do n’t want it to appear that they are cooperating with the Russians . . . because they are scared that if it comes out , it will become a rallying point by the hard - liners and that they could be overruled , ” he said .
Pavel Podvig , a Stanford University expert on Russia who spent a decade at the Moscow Center for Arms Control Studies , said hard - liners in Moscow were responding in kind .
“ In Russia , many people are spoiling for a fight , ” Podvig said .
“ You could easily see how these points of cooperation could die out , and that would be very unfortunate because we need to move in the other direction . ”

Sept. 2 , 2008  --
What if you could tell whether a man is husband material just by peering at his genes ?
There has been speculation about the role of the hormone vasopressin in humans ever since we discovered that variations in where receptors for the hormone are expressed makes prairie voles strictly monogamous but meadow voles promiscuous ; vasopressin is related to the " cuddle chemical " oxytocin .
Now it seems variations in a section of the gene coding for a vasopressin receptor in people help to determine whether men are serial commitment - phobes or devoted husbands .
Hasse Walum at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden , and colleagues looked at the various forms of the gene coding for a vasopressin receptor in 552 Swedish people , who were all in heterosexual partnerships .
The researchers also investigated the quality of their relationships .
They found that variation in a section of the gene called RS3 334 was linked to how men bond with their partners .
Men can have none , one or two copies of the RS3 334 section , and the higher the number of copies , the worse men scored on a measure of pair bonding .
Not only that , men with two copies of RS3 334 were more likely to be unmarried than men with one or none , and if they were married , they were twice as likely to have a marital crisis .
Commitment phobia
Given that everyone surveyed had been in their relationship for at least five years , the team suggests that having multiple copies somehow contributes to commitment problems in men .
Because the results were collected for a different study the team could n't quiz the men on whether they were faithful , says Wallum .
It is not clear exactly how multiple copies of RS3 334 affect expression of the vasopressin receptor , and our most intimate relationships .
And yet that 's the most interesting question , says Thomas Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland .
In some animals , the theory is that the brain has two " motivational " systems : one for reward , the other for social perception .
In prairie voles and marmosets , receptors for the two systems sit on adjacent cells , so social activity is highly rewarding , leading to monogamy .
To see if the same mechanism is at work in people will mean using tissue from post - mortems to map where vasopressin receptors lie , to see if variations are linked to the number of copies of RS3 334 .
RS3 334's social effects extend beyond bonding in couples .
Earlier this year , the same gene section was shown to affect signalling in people 's amygdalas , linked to trust .
Another study found that people with autism , which is characterised by unusual social behaviour , often have multiple copies of RS3 334 .
Walum 's colleague Paul Lichtenstein says the team 's next task is to test how a nasal vasopressin spray affects altruism and jealousy .
In many ways , I absolutely adore the candidacies of Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney , and Cindy Sheehan — plucky figures of opposition for the U.S. status quo .
I have long felt that the two - party system ( which is nowhere to be found in the U.S. Constitution ) has become “ the repressives versus the regressives . ”
( Which is to say , a bad thing versus a bad thing . )
I do n't believe in voting for the lesser of two evils , and that 's one reason why I became the independent teenager candidate for U.S. President , back when it was Reagan versus Mondale in 1984 .
So , all four of us have offered an alternative that “ gives 'em hell ” and allows Americans to vote for “ none of the above . ”
Cindy Sheehan uses a slogan , “ People Before Politics , ” and back in the day , my bumper stickers said , “ People Are Important . ”
Logically , there should be some affinity here .
Nader , McKinney , and Sheehan should be three of my favorite people , and they are .
I am also intrigued by the 2008 conventional tickets , because each of them has a forty - something candidate .
In politics , that counts as a fresh face or an untested , younger newcomer .
The Alaska Governor Sarah Palin who has now made it onto the McCain ticket is a Generation Xer ( born 1964 - 1981 ) .
It 's also true that Nader 's running mate , Matt Gonzales , and McKinney 's VP pick , Rosa Clemente , are GenXers .
So , 2008 is an intriguing year in U.S. politics , because my age group will appear in the elected offices of the U.S. executive branch .
However , nobody has won my vote yet — none of the foregoing candidates has closed the sale with me .
With my newly - popular internet column [ 1 ] , I want to ask “ a debate question ” that merits response from the mentioned candidates , and perhaps from the Obama ticket as well .
Conventional political pundits and analysts may also want to weigh in , because I will question the rules of thumb that they never question .
America has been running with fundamental assumptions which may be conceits .
The progressives see it clearly as a matter of empire versus integrity .
America has exercised hegemony , militarism , and frankly , imperialism around the world .
However , I am not a blanket pacifist , nor an isolationist .
I was largely okay with U.S. foreign policy of the 1980s , which held it to be important to wage the Cold War and to resist hegemony , militarism , and imperialism on the part of the Soviet Union .
I was a nucelar freeze candidate , but I said that I would shift funding from nuclear to conventional forces .
For the conventional side of the Pentagon , that meant even more money ; we can say that I bought into the Reagan line that America must have a strong defense .
Even during peacetime , I 'm okay with aerospace and defense spending at 4 % of GDP .
Progressives , on the other hand , decry the military - industrial complex as a monster , and seem like they want to do away with it .
Simply put , I do n't want the military - industrial complex ( MIC ) to rust away .
But , like the progressives , I decry any instances of over - feeding the MIC .
At 5 % of GDP , I would call it overfed , bloated , or fattened ; and at 3 % of GDP , I would call it thinly funded to a point that may hurt readiness .
Let 's face it , my “ politics of practical idealism ” believe in being strong on national security , even while I do n't believe all of the justifications for war , hegemony , militarism , and imperialism — justifications were revealed to be faulty during the Bush administration .
As an aside , the baldface manufacture of its pro-war propaganda is a valid reason to impeach the Bush administration — and that is a place where Nader , McKinney , and Sheehan have been standouts , calling for impeachment .
I second those calls .
When there is a corrupt and farcical America , stomping around the world , it is a natural reflex to think , “ cut off the funding . ”
And , if we talk about the Iraq war in particular , I well agree .
I was with the war at the outset , because I believe that Saddam Hussein was a menace who fights dirty , and that he should have been taken out in the first Gulf War , 12 years earlier .
( However , I expected that war would be the last step of an escalation sequence ; I expected that the inspectors would be heeded ; I expected that escalation would be prudent , and that intelligence would be solid . )
About funding the Iraq war , it should have taken $ 70 – $ 90 billion .
The masters of corruption have made it cost ten times that amount .
But , to get improvement , we must imagine a future America that is upright , upholds its principles , and has integrity .
In other words , imagine a Nader or McKinney administration .
Imagine a foreign policy that is free of lingering influence from Rockefeller , Kissinger , Brzezinski , and corrupt cabals .
In an upright U.S. foreign policy , I believe that the military - industrial complex should be healthy rather than emaciated .
Healthy , even if it is confined to the doghouse .
The doghouse makes for a good analogy , because my question here for Nader and McKinney ( and Sheehan ) is really , “ how long should be the leash of the U.S. military ? ”
An isolationist might say , “ let 's just defend ourselves , ” and I take it that that means largely keeping the U.S. military in the doghouse , with no length of leash .
Sometimes , I worry when it seems like this is really the ideal of progressives .
Others would say , “ we 'll defend ourselves and our military allies . ”
That means that a series of nations are protected , and I will nickname that “ the short leash ” theory of U.S. foreign policy .
Yet others would say , “ let 's defend the entire free world . ”
The strongest support for freedom would do so .
However , this is a gray area and we might find ourselves defending Georgia against Russia , although Freedom House rates Georgia as only “ partly free . ”
While Georgia made noises about joining NATO , it did not do so prior to the start of recent hostilities there .
So , to defend non-military allies of the ( partly ? ) free world would be “ the medium leash ” theory of U.S. foreign policy .
We are being tested at this time by the actions of Russia .
Then , there seems to be a George Bush attitude which does n't mind offending the entire world , whether free or unfree .
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was outside of the free world .
We transgressed some boundaries to go there .
It is “ the unleashed ” theory of U.S. foreign policy , indicating that the U.S. military may roll into to any place around the world .
But , to have aggression not governed by the rule of law invites the world 's contempt , or worse — Vladimir Putin and his man Dmitry Medvedev are now demonstrating a principle that “ two can play at that game . ”
To avoid a conflict with Russia , it is necessary to return to the short leash theory , in which we defend only ourselves and our military allies .
That is where I would go as a first step , but I also believe in helping other free world nations when they form military alliances and ask for our help .
Ultimately , I would like to see a “ United Free World Nations , ” to check the aggressions of tyranny and which could be a pan - free - world military alliance .
Imagine a U.N. that is not hobbled by the vetoes of authoritarian bullies such as China and Russia .
I believe that we need to go there , because the planet is not yet secured for freedom .
To join the club , Georgia would need to lift restrictions on opposition and free media , and deliver to justice those who ordered atrocities against civilians .
However , the foregoing are my answers to the question at hand .
I have not heard similar policies from Ralph Nader or Cynthia McKinney or Cindy Sheehan .
The questions that I would ask them seem evident now .
How long should be the leash of the U.S. military ?
Where do we draw the lines for American interests ?
How much funding , or how much of a diet , would you give to federal spending on the aerospace and defense sectors ?
Or , should onlooking voters like me simply take it that progressives are blanket pacifists and military isolationists ?

Note [ 1 ] : I referred to my newly - popular internet column .
Last week , readership exploded when I published my tract , ' CNN Caught In Genocidal Correctness . '
Over 70X my normal readership took in that column .
Imagine a stadium full of people , studying a John Kusumi political column .
It happened last week , much to the chagrin of CNN . 🙂
The government is in a great position to cut rates by about a point : Through Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration , it now controls nearly 90 percent of all mortgage originations .
These lower rates would apply to most home buyers who take out a loan under $ 729,750 for a house that they will live in .

Along with lower rates , the government should provide temporary down - payment assistance for buyers .
The government could , for example , match the amount of money that buyers use for a down payment , up to $ 15,000 .
Because the government now controls the bulk of all mortgage financing , this money could be provided directly at closing .
Homeowners who refinance their current mortgages could also receive assistance , allowing them to avoid foreclosure .
Programs like these would draw buyers into the housing market and reduce the backlog of unsold and vacant homes .
Investors and speculators would be ineligible and would face the full cost of their mistakes .
By stabilizing house prices , these programs would benefit the bulk of Americans , who own a home but did not get involved in the subprime mortgage market .
Price stability would more directly achieve the goals of the Wall Street bailout : increase the value of mortgage - backed securities ( by increasing the value of the underlying houses ) while injecting government capital into the financial system .
Some in Congress have suggested allowing homeowners to go to bankruptcy court to lower their mortgage payments .
But this would only make credit more expensive by reducing the willingness of companies to lend money .
It would also worsen the current problems by letting bankruptcy judges reduce mortgage balances — imposing even greater losses on the owners of the mortgages , whose problems are at the heart of the financial crisis .
Such a program would also be limited to only the most indebted and , in some cases , financially irresponsible homeowners .
People who do n't like sports can't do that .
It 's not so much that they can't identify the names -- they 've heard of Armstrong -- but they 've never bothered to follow the flow of debate .
I like sports -- and politics and tech and other topics -- so I like joining these debates .
On a wide range of other topics -- fashion , antique furniture , the world of restaurants and fine dining , or ( blush ) opera -- I have not been interested enough to learn anything I can add to the discussion .
So I embarrass myself if I have to express a view .
What Sarah Palin revealed is that she has not been interested enough in world affairs to become minimally conversant with the issues .
Many people in our great land might have difficulty defining the " Bush Doctrine " exactly .
But not to recognize the name , as obviously was the case for Palin , indicates not a failure of last - minute cramming but a lack of attention to any foreign - policy discussion whatsoever in the last seven years .
Two details in Charles Gibson 's posing of the question were particularly telling .
One was the potentially confusing way in which he first asked it .
On the page , " the Bush Doctrine " looks different from " the Bush doctrine . "
But when hearing the question Palin might not have known whether Gibson was referring to the general sweep of Administration policy -- doctrine with small d -- or the rationale that connected 9/11 with the need to invade Iraq , the capital - D Doctrine .
So initial confusion would be understandable -- as if a sports host asked about Favre 's chances and you were n't sure if he meant previously with the Packers or with the Jets .
Once Gibson clarified the question , a person familiar with the issue would have said , " Oh , if we 're talking about the strategy that the President and Condoleezza Rice began laying out in 2002 .... "
There was no such flash of recognition .
The other was Gibson 's own minor mis-statement .
American foreign policy has long recognized the concept of preemptive action : if you know somebody is just about to attack you , there 's no debate about the legitimacy of acting first .
( This is like " shooting in self - defense . " )
The more controversial part of The Bush Doctrine was the idea of preventive war : acting before a threat had fully emerged , on the theory that waiting until it was fully evident would mean acting too late .
Gibson used the word " preemptively " -- but if a knowledgeable person had pushed back on that point ( " Well , preemption was what John F. Kennedy had in mind in acting against the imminent threat of Soviet missiles in Cuba " ) , Gibson would certainly have come back to explain the novelty of the " preventive war " point .
Because he knows the issue , a minor mis-choice of words would n't get in the way of his real intent .
Sarah Palin did not know this issue , or any part of it .
The view she actually expressed -- an endorsement of " preemptive " action -- was fine on its own merits .
But it is not the stated doctrine of the Bush Administration , it is not the policy her running mate has endorsed , and it is not the concept under which her own son is going off to Iraq .

Editor , Wake Up To Money
Linux is not as cuddly as its original image suggests Gary Parkinson had a torrid time when he converted to Linux .
Here he shares his experiences with one of the alternatives to Microsoft 's ubiquitous operating system .
It 's Saturday afternoon and I should be lying on the sofa sipping sweet tea and watching Football Focus .
Instead , I 'm stamping loudly round the living room swearing like a sailor , looking for a cat to kick and cursing a Finnish computer programmer whose name meant nothing to me only days before .
The source of all this disquiet sits on the coffee table looking defiant yet lovely .
It 's £ 370 worth of brand spanking new laptop , sleek glossy black , 10 inches wide , give or take , and weighs about the same as a chunky hardback novel .
Hippy ideals
It 's not the machine itself that 's driving me to violence , but the operating system that controls its programs and hardware : Linux .
Linux is an alternative to operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Mac's OS X and has been around since the early 1990s .
Its creator Linus Torvalds - then a 21 - year - old University of Helsinki student - made the heart of his operating system absolutely free and open source , which means anyone can still download the code and tweak it as they see fit .
This kind of hippy philosophy behind Linux - that free access to software inspires development driven by need , not the need for cash - was the main attraction to me of choosing a Linux - fuelled machine over the Windows or Mac OS .
It 's a muscular system too .
The likes of Amazon and Google , and plenty of other household - name companies , are increasingly turning to Linux to run important parts of their businesses .
Look and feel More people are turning to Linux as alternative to Windows My requirements are more modest .
It needs to let me surf the web , word process and manage the music that I listen to on an iPod .
First impressions of Linux were positive .
The new machine , an Asus Eee , came pre-installed with a distribution , or flavour , of Linux called Xandros .
Because Linux is open source , different programmers have taken its kernel , or core , and written variations on the theme .
They may use the same base code , but the desktops look and feel very different .
Some will seem much more familiar to those used to Windows or OS X than others .
There 's half a dozen or so popular " distros " , including the likes of Fedora , Mandriva and the one I prefer , Ubuntu .
Xandros worked right out of the box .
Like most distros it includes Open Office , an open source copycat of Microsoft Office .
Word processing , spreadsheets and presentations are no problem .
Linux - based computers wo n't run the software that you may be used to on Windows or a Mac - but there are free , Linux - compatible versions of pretty much any program you may want that can be downloaded from the internet .
Xandros connected to the net through my home wireless network at the first time of asking .
And surfing was fast and easy .
Freedom to fiddle
There were a couple of things about Xandros which I did n't like .
The music management program - its " iTunes " , if you like - let me listen to music and podcasts on my new laptop but would n't sync anything I loaded on to my iPod .
Big problem for a music and podcast junkie .
Plus the desktop - the way the screen looks , the icons it uses to open programs - looks like it 's been designed by a four - year - old with a fat crayon .
It 's may be down to personal taste , but I just do n't like the way Xandros looks .
One of the ( many ) great things about Linux is that if you do n't like a particular distro you can just change it for one you do by downloading it from the internet and installing it on the machine .
If you do n't like that one either , just keep trying distros until you find one to your taste .
A quick trip to the local newsagent yielded a Linux magazine that included instructions on how to change distros and free CD with Mandriva and Ubuntu on it .
CD into disk drive , hit the escape key right after power up , boot up from the disk not the hard drive as usual , follow the simple instructions to install and 10 minutes later my computer screen looks completely different and much more like what I 'm used to .
A doddle .
Except now the internet wireless connection does n't work and the music management software still wo n't let me sync with my iPod. Mmmmmm ......
Like most journalists , I 've the attention span and patience of a gnat .
The air turns blue and I inform my wife loudly that Linus Torvalds has much to answer for ( I paraphrase slightly ) .
Another great thing about Linux is the plethora of internet forums that you can sign up to where users can share tips and experience .
My new machine may not be connected but luckily my wife 's computer is .
Couple of quick registrations later and I 'm picking through the discussion boards for answers .
Text - based
As someone used solely to double - clicking on pretty pictures to do most anything on a computer this is pretty hairy stuff .
Gary Parkinson
Trouble is , the people populating these forums seem much cleverer than I am .
On another planet , in fact .
I may not be a good bet to be one to discover the cure for cancer , but I pride myself that not a ( complete ) fool either .
But I 'm completely stumped by the instructions posted on these sites .
The level of assumed knowledge is way above my head .
I follow a couple of suggestions , try to connect to my router using an ethernet cable , download code that promises to set things right .
And fail .
Ubuntu 's own website is n't much help either .
It suggests that with this particular machine it can sometimes help to whip out the battery , give it a couple of minutes , whack it back in , plug in an ethernet cable and get on line first that way .
Nada .
Perhaps I am a complete fool after all .
It 's probably worth mentioning one other important point about Linux here .
It 's a text - based operating system , which means that a fair few of the things you may want to tell your computer to do - installing certain new software , for example - requires you to open up a " terminal window " and actually type text into the little window .
It 's a bit like the way all hackers in Hollywood movies furiously crash out lines of incomprehensible text on their laptops when they 're trying to bust into the Pentagon 's defence network .
As someone used solely to double - clicking on pretty pictures to do most anything on a computer this is pretty hairy stuff .
Tech support
True to form when I 'm too stupid to figure out how to do something in five minutes , I phone an expert .
Geek Squad , a tech support service partnered with the Carphone Warehouse , is more used to dealing with problems with broadband and e-mail but later that night , Agent Jamie Pedder walks me through it over the phone .
Download a couple of bits of code from one of the Linux help sites on to a memory stick .
Whack the memory stick into the offending laptop .
Bang a couple of lines of code into the terminal window to tell the machine to install what we 've downloaded .
Bingo , we 're cooking on gas .
Ubuntu 's running my wireless network and I 'm back on - line .
Easy when you know how .
The fly in the ointment remains the music management software .
I still ca n't sync an iPod and Agent Pedder reckons that I probably wo n't be able to - for now at least .
While Linux is founded on the philosophy of free and easy access to its code for anyone who 's interested , Apple is not .
That means no iTunes for Linux , and nor is Apple likely to release such a version .
The iPod out of action is a major irritation , but I 've not given up hope .
There 's software out there - free for Linux users as always - that promises to do what I want .
I just have n't got round to downloading and playing with it yet .
For the time being , it 's back to the trusty CD player .
All this talk of hippy ideals has put me right in the mood for a bit of Sgt Pepper's .

Sources : Bloomberg to flip on term limits view to stay in office Nick Cargo
Published : Tuesday September 30 , 2008
Print This Email
This A historical enemy of term limits will announce on Thursday that he has changed his stripes in an effort to keep himself in office , the New York Times reported .
Three people , who said they were told of his plans , said that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , 66 , will attempt to change the city 's 15 - year - old term limits law in order to remain in office in 2009 .
Two thirds of the City Council is set to be ejected at the same time , and a Times survey and interviews indicate that support for an amendment to the law is strong among council members .
Billionaire and Wall Street veteran Bloomberg , historically in support of the law and who once called efforts to revise it " disgusting , " will argue that the city needs him to remain in office , amid the crisis in the financial markets , to benefit from his " steady hand " and " proven business acumen . "
While the move has reportedly received support from News Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch and investor Steve Rattner , Bloomberg has been strongly advised against seeking a third term by top aides Edward Skyler , Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey , who have said according to sources that it could be interpreted as an " end run around voters . "

( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday he is recalling his own ambassador from Washington and expelling the U.S. ambassador from Venezuela .
" He has 72 hours , from this moment , the Yankee ambassador in Caracas , to leave Venezuela , " Chavez told a crowd of supporters .
The president said he was making the moves " in solidarity with Bolivia and the people of Bolivia . "
Bolivia 's Evo Morales accused the United States Thursday of fomenting a coup d'etat by rich eastern department landowners against him , the country 's first Indian president .
" We have seen reports about President Chavez 's remarks but have not received any official diplomatic communication , " said Gordon Duguid , a State Department spokesman .
" Our embassy in Caracas is looking into these reports . "
Also Thursday , Chavez accused the United States of having backed a coup plot against him .
" When there 's a new government in the United States , we 'll send an ambassador , " he said .
" A government that respects Latin America . "
Earlier Thursday , Chavez said he has uncovered a U.S. - backed plot to remove him from power .
" It 's the empire that 's behind this , " he told supporters in a nationally televised address .
" They go around looking for a way to stop our revolution and , with it , to strike all the processes of change that are occurring in our Americas , in the Caribbean , in Central America . "
Chavez then played a four - minute tape of what he said were conversations among current and retired members of the Venezuelan military discussing whom they could count on to support a movement against the presidential palace .
Chavez , who was briefly detained in a failed 2002 coup attempt , said the former plotters " are the same people involved in this coup attempt .
Behind them is the American empire . "
But he said the presence of two Russian warplanes on Venezuelan soil for a training exercise " is a warning " to the rest of the world that Venezuela 's allies include Russia and other countries .
Chavez added that , should any country in Latin America be overthrown , he would interpret that to be " the green light to undertake military operations of any sort in those countries , and restore power back to the people . "
And he had a message for President Bush , beseeching him , to " go wherever you have to go and leave the Latin - American people alone . "
He added , " If they kill me , my God , I do n't fear for me , but for what comes after . "
A U.S. State Department spokesman denied involvement in any coup attempts in Venezuela or Bolivia .

MUNICH ( Reuters ) - Young men who die suddenly after being arrested by the police may be victims of a new syndrome similar to one that kills some wild animals when they are captured , Spanish researchers said on Tuesday .

REUTERS / Steve Marcus
Manuel Martinez Selles of Madrid ’s Hospital Gregorio Maranon reached the conclusion after investigating 60 cases of sudden unexplained deaths in Spain following police detention .
In one third of the cases , death occurred at the point of arrest , while in the remainder death was within 24 hours , Selles told the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology .
All but one of the casualties were male and their average age was just 33 years , with no previous history of cardiovascular disease .
“ Something unusual is going on , ” Sells said .
Just why they died remains a mystery but he believes young men , in particular , may experience surges in blood levels of chemicals known as catecholamines when under severe stress .
Adrenaline is one of the most abundant catecholamines .
“ We know that when a wild animal is captured , sometimes the animal dies suddenly , ” he said .
“ Probably when these young males are captured it is very stressful and their level of catecholamines goes very high and that can finish their life by ventricular fibrillation ( cardiac arrest ) . ”
Selles compiled his study -- the first of its kind in any country -- by scouring Spanish newspapers for cases of unexplained death after police detention over the past 10 years .
Only sudden deaths with no clear causes were included and autopsy reports were checked to exclude the possibility of mistreatment or past serious medical conditions .
Twelve of the victims were drug users but Selles said this was not thought to have contributed to their deaths .
Jonathan Halperin of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York , who was not involved in the research , said the concept of a heart stress syndrome triggered by a flood of adrenaline or other chemicals was “ a reasonable hypothesis ” .
“ We all know stress is bad for you and this may be stress in the extreme , ” he said .
Mr Chavez said he wanted nuclear power for energy and medical uses
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he wants to develop a civilian nuclear power programme with Russia 's help .
Mr Chavez emphasised that he wanted nuclear power only for peaceful ends , citing energy and medical purposes .
His remarks follow last week 's comments by Russian PM Vladimir Putin that Moscow was ready to consider nuclear co-operation with Venezuela .
Such a move would be likely to increase US concerns at the growing ties between the two nations , correspondents say .
" We certainly are interested in developing nuclear energy , for peaceful ends of course , for medical purposes and to generate electricity , " Mr Chavez told a political rally in Caracas .
" Brazil has various nuclear reactors , as does Argentina .
We will have ours and Vladimir told the media : Russia is ready to help Venezuela develop nuclear energy for peaceful ends , " he said , adding that a commission was already working on the issue .
Naval exercise
President Chavez was speaking after a global tour last week that included a stop in Russia .
During his visit , Mr Chavez signed accords on energy co-operation with his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev .
Mr Putin also indicated that Russia " was ready to consider the possibility " of working with Venezuela to build nuclear power facilities .
Russia and Venezuela have been increasing their ties in recent months .
Russian warships are currently en route to the Caribbean Sea for joint exercises with the Venezuelan navy .
Venezuela is one of the best customers of the Russian defence industry , signing weapons contracts worth some $ 4.4bn ( £ 2.39bn ) .
A staunch critic of the US , Mr Chavez backed Russian intervention in Georgia and has accused Washington of being scared of Moscow 's " new world potential " .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The public backlash against the Bush administration 's proposal to use tax dollars to bailout Wall Street spilled into the streets Thursday .
" People all over the country are up in arms about this , " said David Elliot , a spokesman for grassroots advocacy group UsAction .
" Our members are livid , and they 're hitting the streets . "
TrueMajority.com , an online forum for activists , said its members had organized 251 events in more than 41 states to protest the bailout .
Several other grassroots organizations were involved in the protests , including Democracy for America , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( Acorn ) and labor unions .
A rally organized by the New York Central Labor Council took place this afternoon on Wall Street near the New York Stock Exchange .
That was followed by a more informal protest that began to take shape on Wall Street shortly after the financial markets closed .
" There is no agenda , no leaders , no organizing group , nothing to endorse other than we 're not going to pay ! , " read an anonymous e-mail message posted on the Web site of the New York City Independent Media Center .
The posting urged protestors to " take it to the heart of the financial district , " by gathering near the famous Wall Street bull statue at 4 p.m. ET .
" We have everything we need to create a large , peaceful , loud demonstration , " the e-mail said .
" By having it later in the day we can show these thieves , as they leave work , we 're not their suckers . "
Protests have been planned for Washington .
Events were scheduled to coincide with meeting at the White House between Bush administration officials , Congressional leaders and the presidential candidates to discuss the final details of the bailout plan .
" The people we entrusted to run our economy have failed us , " said Alan Charney , program director of UsAction .
" We can no longer trust them to get us out of this financial mess . "
Charney said the government should " put Main Street first " by ensuring that taxpayers have an ownership stake in the companies that benefit from the bailout plan .
It should also include provisions for increased oversight of the financial markets , limits on executive compensation and protection for homeowners facing foreclosure , he said .
Many of these issues have already been incorporated into alternative plans being circulated on Capitol Hill , something Charney said happened " because the American people are rising up and saying no , no , no . "
In addition to the protests in New York and Washington , activists prepared to gather in front of AIG company headquarters in Hartford , Conn .
AIG received a whopping $ 85 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve last week as the world 's largest insurance company floundered following the demise of Wall Street brokerage Lehman Brothers , which became the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history .
Government officials said at the time that allowing AIG to collapse would have put more strain on the financial system and could have caused even more damage to the economy .
LAUSANNE , Switzerland --
Track and field 's ruling body wants Ivan Ukhov to explain his conduct at the Athletissima meet in which rival high jumpers said the Russian had been drinking vodka and Red Bull during the competition .
Ukhov failed with each attempt to clear the bar Tuesday before being asked to stop competing at the Swiss meet .
Meet organizers refused to pay Ukhov 's expenses and have been asked to supply video evidence to the International Association of Athletics Federations .
" We will for sure ask for an explanation from the athlete about his behavior and ask that it is not repeated in the future , " IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said in a statement .
Alcohol is not classed as a performance - enhancing substance and is not formally prohibited in athletics competition .
Ukhov was European Junior Champion in 2005 .
Sirius ( SIRI ) CEO Mel Karmazin may not be good at bolstering his company 's sagging stock price , but he sure is good at alienating shareholders .
Karmazin , who has seen SIRI shares tumble more than 80 % under his tenure , added insult to injury this week .
NYT :
Unlike most companies — whose shareholder base is 80 percent big institutional investors and 20 percent personal , retail investors —
Sirus ’s shareholder base is turned upside - down .
As a result , many of the radio network ’s fans and customers are also its owners .
They fill chat rooms online and have made the stock a volatile one .
“ A lot of them are unsophisticated , but they have a passion for the company , ” he said .
We wonder if Karmazin is including himself in this category , since he just purchased another two million shares of SIRI stock .
Other nuggets from the interview :
“ If this does n’t resonate with every woman in America , I ’ll eat my hat , ” Bill Noll , an Alaska delegate whose daughter got pregnant at a young age and kept the baby , told The Times ’s Ashley Parker .
Even as they push Sarah Barracuda as the glamorous but tough hunting and fishing mom who can juggle it all  she ’s the only nominee , as Fred Thompson bragged in his convention speech , “ who knows how to properly field dress a moose ”  they rant at reporters who wonder how she will juggle it all and question some of her judgments .
At a Washington , Pa. , rally on Saturday , as her two other daughters stood with her , Ms. Palin left Bristol baby - sitting Trig , who has Down syndrome .
“ Then we have our daughter Bristol , ” the new conservative Republican star said .
“ She ’s on the bus with the newborn .
...
It ’s his naptime , so he is with his big sister on the bus .
But we thank them for being here . ”
And this while Bristol was still absorbing the shocking news that she was about to turn into tabloid roadkill  and oh , yeah , she ’s getting married sooner rather than later .
When you make a gimmicky pick of an unknown , without proper vetting , there ’s bound to be a sticky press conference sooner or later .
I watched it happen with Ferraro and Quayle , and I watched Mondale and Poppy Bush curdle with embarrassment but plow through .
The political unknowns , of course , want that tantalizing brass ring , so they ’re not always completely forthcoming about their skeletons , if they ’re lucky enough to be ineptly vetted .
This is ironic , since the nominee who gets blindsided with these crises 
Did McCain really know that this Palin reality show was about to pop and swallow his convention  is presenting them to voters as the most trustworthy people to inherit the nuclear codes .

But the distress over the bailout and its timing was hardly unique to Republicans as lawmakers in both parties seethed .
Here they were , six weeks to the day before already angry voters head to the polls , being told they had the choice to write a $ 700 billion check or risk dragging the economy down into bread - line , soup - kitchen territory .
At the same time , the lawmakers were under siege from angry constituents who had kept current with their own mortgage payments and now wondered why they were suddenly being stuck with the tab for a crisis set off by foreclosures .
“ Like my colleagues , my phones have been ringing off the hook , ” Senator Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio , told the two architects of the bailout 
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman , Ben S. Bernanke  at the banking committee session .
“ The sentiment from Ohioans about this proposal is universally negative .
I count myself among the Ohioans who are angry . ”
Even backers of the bailout were hardly enthusiastic .
“ Nobody wants to do this ; nobody wants to be involved in this , ” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the Republican leader .
“ But I am going to argue that if we do nothing , we are jeopardizing our economy , jobs , people ’s retirement security .
Congress has to act and we have to act quickly . ”
Given the circumstances and dire warnings of economic doom , the expectation remained that enough lawmakers would grit their teeth , hold their noses , screw up their courage and back some variation of the administration plan , a proposal Mr. Cheney privately told Republicans was a response to the worst economic situation he had seen .
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland , the House majority leader , said he expected that Congress would do the responsible thing and do it soon  though just how soon remained unclear .
“ Acting in the near term is important to stabilize the economy and to protect our taxpayers , ” Mr. Hoyer said .
Those same taxpayers were also pushed front and center by the authors of the proposal as they sought to make the case that the true beneficiaries of the plan were not greedy Wall Street executives but ordinary Americans and their pensions , savings and employers .

PickyDomains .
Com is a perfect example of how to turn one ’s talent into a profitable business .
With ever expanding Internet and tens of millions existing websites , finding an available domain name that ’s not already taken by cybersquatters can be a real nightmare .
But one man ’s problem is another man ’s solution .
Rather than to shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars for a domain name on the aftermarket , an increasing number of web entrepreneurs turn to professional “ domain namers " .
While most naming agencies charge a non-refundable fee that can be as high as $ 1500 for a corporate domain , one service that unites 17 professional domain namers from countries like United States , Russia , Australia and New Zealand , decided to offer a risk - free service that costs only 50 dollars per domain .
After 50 dollars are deposited , clients start getting a list of available domain names via e-mail for a period of 30 days .
If they see a domain they like , they register it and notify the service about domain acquired .
The individual , who came up with the name , gets $ 25 , the other half going to the service .
If no domain is registered , the money is refunded in full .
While the idea is brainlessly simple , it appears that PickyDomains .
Com has no competition with its risk - free business model .
But that is almost certain to change as more people find out that finding available domain names for other people can be a profitable business .

WASHINGTON  Despite his stated desire to close the American prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , President Bush has decided not to do so , and never considered proposals drafted in the State Department and the Pentagon that outlined options for transferring the detainees elsewhere , according to senior administration officials .
Mr. Bush ’s top advisers held a series of meetings at the White House this summer after a Supreme Court ruling in June cast doubt on the future of the American detention center .
But Mr. Bush adopted the view of his most hawkish advisers that closing Guantánamo would involve too many legal and political risks to be acceptable , now or any time soon , the officials said .
The administration is proceeding on the assumption that Guantánamo will remain open not only for the rest of Mr. Bush ’s presidency but also well beyond , the officials said , as the site for military tribunals of those facing terrorism - related charges and for the long prison sentences that could follow convictions .
The effect of Mr. Bush ’s stance is to leave in place a prison that has become a reviled symbol of the administration ’s fight against terrorism , and to leave another contentious foreign policy decision for the next president .

WHEN an electronic gun designed to immobilise but not kill emerged from the pages of science fiction and went into manufacture a decade ago , police forces around the world snapped it up .
Instead of shooting suspected criminals who posed a threat , they could now zap them with 50,000 volts of electricity and have them safely in handcuffs before they recovered enough to resist or flee .
But are stun guns really non-lethal ?
Canadians have been wondering since a Polish immigrant died last October at Vancouver airport after police subdued him with a Taser , the most popular brand of the electronic weapon .
An amateur video of the incident posted on YouTube sparked a public debate , and several official inquiries .
On July 22nd a 17 - year old youth in Winnipeg became the 21st person to die in Canada after being fired at with a Taser .
The gun ’s American manufacturer , Taser International , has sold 300,000 of them to police forces in 45 countries .
It contends that just because someone dies after receiving a jolt , it does not necessarily follow that the Taser was to blame .
It says — and some doctors agree — that pre-existing heart conditions , drug and alcohol abuse , and the agitation of having been pursued are all more likely causes of deaths in police custody .
Tom Smith , Taser ’s chairman , told a committee of Canada ’s Parliament earlier this year that although 50,000 volts sounds like a lot , a static charge from a doorknob is almost as high .
Such arguments have proved persuasive with juries .
Taser International has won or had dismissed 71 lawsuits for wrongful death or injury .
Most of these cases were in the United States , where just over 300 deaths following Taser use have been recorded .
( The company suffered a rare courtroom loss earlier this year when a Californian jury ordered it to pay $ 6.2 m to the parents of a man who died after being shocked .
It is appealing . )
A company spokesman points out that no medical examiner in Canada has pointed to the Taser as a contributing factor in any deaths .
Yet doubts persist .
In June the parliamentary committee urged the federal government to commission independent studies .
Amnesty International , a human - rights group , wants a temporary ban on Taser use until the research is complete .
None of the official reviews backs that , but they call for tighter rules on the use of Tasers and better training for officers who handle them .
The Saskatchewan Police Commission has reversed a plan to deploy more Tasers and is restricting their use to specialised teams .
By limiting the use of conventional guns by police the stun guns may indeed save lives .
But Canadians do not like their police to be trigger - happy , even with “ non-lethal ” weaponry .

The Federal Highway Administration has strongly recommended nine tools for decreasing road fatalities .
You can find them at the end of this article .
Most of these tools are fairly basic and simple to implement .
So why are n’t they already universally used ?
They ’re not universally used because they do n’t make money for anyone .
The government ( local , regional , and national ) has become more and more greedy .
Instead of federal grant money going to the programs below , it goes to holiday ticketing binges , congestion charging , toll roads , red - light cameras and speed cameras — none of which have shown any positive impact on key traffic safety metrics .
These kind of enforcement and fee - based programs do make plenty of money though .
Unfortunately , they do it by picking the pockets of motorists .
They get away with this blatant money grab by using powerful public relations tactics — and the implicit trust that many citizens still have in government organizations — to convince the average driver that it ’s for their own good .
Shameful .
FHWA ’s Nine Tools for Decreasing Road Fatalities
1 ) Roadway Safety Audits
State DOTs should formalize the use of these audits , which are comprehensive evaluations of existing or planned roads or intersections to identify potential safety improvements .
2 ) Rumble Strips and Rumble Stripes
Used in centerline and shoulders , these cost - effective devices have shown demonstrable improvement in warning drivers of lane departure , reducing by 14 percent head - on collisions and opposite - direction sideswipe crashes .
Shoulder rumble strips and stripes have shown a 38 percent reduction in run -off - road crashes on freeways , and between 13 - 18 percent on rural roads .
3 ) Median Barriers
Used to separate opposing traffic on divided highways , these barriers have a long track record of reducing cross-median collisions .
States are encouraged to consider using cable median barriers where appropriate to further heighten roadway safety .
4 ) Safety Edge
This paving technique , giving a 30 to 35 degree slope to the road ’s edge , reduces the risk to drivers if their tire inadvertently falls over an otherwise near - vertical road - edge leading to loss of vehicle control and rollover crashes .
Safety Edge makes such notoriously severe crashes far less likely .
5 ) Roundabouts
Roundabouts have demonstrated a 60 to 87 percent reduction in crashes .
6 ) Turning Lanes at Stop - Controlled Intersections
At intersections with significant turning volume , turning lanes for right and left turns on major road approaches can dramatically reduce crashes — in some cases , by as much as 55 percent .
7 ) Yellow Change Intervals
Red - light running crashes at intersections , which too frequently result in fatalities , can be reduced by properly setting yellow - light signals .
Studies show a one - second increase in the yellow signal interval can reduce red - light violations by as much as 50 percent .
8 ) Medians and Pedestrian Refuge Areas in Urban and Suburban Areas
Raised medians or pedestrian refuge areas at pedestrian crossings at marked crosswalks have shown a 46 percent reduction in pedestrian crashes .
FHWA recommends that medians be between 4 and 8 feet wide to improve pedestrian safety .
9 ) Walkways
Ensuring a sidewalk or pathway exists near a roadway can reduce pedestrian crashes by as much 88 percent .
FHWA recommends a pathway of at least 4 feet wide of stabilized or paved surface in areas routinely used by pedestrians .

You see them everywhere this time of year — little yellow flags emblazoned with a circle and a line through a couple of stick - figure children .
“ Pesticide Application , ” they warn , “ Please Keep Off . ”
So parents keep the kids playing inside on a warm afternoon , rather than outside on the grass .
Connecticut kids are luckier than most .
Last fall , the state became the first to ban the use of pesticides ( which includes herbicides , fungicides , and insecticides ) on the grounds of elementary and middle schools — a decision that has put it at the forefront of a nationwide movement , and also in the crosshairs of the multibillion dollar lawn - care industry .
For the rest of the country , it sends a clear message .
“ It says that aesthetic uses of chemicals are unacceptable especially when children are exposed , ” says Jay Feldman , executive director of Washington - based Beyond Pesticides .
One common herbicide in popular “ weed and feed ” lawn - care products , 2,4 - D , constituted about 50 percent of Agent Orange , and has been linked to birth defects , neurological problems , non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma , and liver and kidney damage .
In Canada , as many as 160 municipalities have banned the use of pesticides with 2,4 - D .
More than 78 million households in the US use home and garden pesticides , feeding pesticide sales that top $ 9.3 billion a year .
Part of the problem is the lawn - care industry ’s successful shaping of public perception , says Ted Steinberg , the author of American Green : The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn .
“ The PR machine coming out of Scotts is spending millions to convince the public that they need toxic chemicals to manage a home lawn , ” he says .
The lawn - industry lobby has also succeeded in prohibiting a municipality from having pesticide regulations that are stronger than the state’s .
To win the ban in Connecticut , a coalition of health care professionals and policy experts named Environment and Human Health , Inc. prepared several reports on lawn pesticides , one of which anti-pesticide groups nicknamed “ the bible . ”
Among other things , the group found pesticides in 6 out of 53 local wells .
They also discovered there were few laws covering the use of pesticides in schools .
But , because of the preemption laws , there was little the towns could do .
“ Anyone could spray with no training , ” says Nancy Alderman , founder and president of EHHI .
Lawn - care lobbyists have been fighting back .
Richard Tice , executive director of both the Connecticut Grounds Keepers Association and the Environmental Industry Council of Connecticut ( formerly named the Professional Pesticide Users of Connecticut ) , calls the bill “ asinine . ”
A better approach , he says , is integrated pest management , or IPM , a strategy that recommends pesticide use as a last resort .
Tice , for now , is not too worried about his industry ’s future .
“ The normal person just does n’t care , ” he says , “ Look at the amount of yellow signs you see out there .
If the concern was there amongst the general public , then no one would apply pesticides . ”

The art detail is also pretty amazing ( and reeks of authenticity ) , with body work and fake damage consistent with the landspeeder in the film .
And it should n't be huge shock that Deutsch has no intention of selling his magnum opus .
But when I see this thing , I have delusions of rounding up Han , Obi-Wan , Lando and a whole lotta Colt 45 , cruising past the Cantina , and looking for chicks with tentacles on their heads .
Hmmm ... that sounded a lot cooler in my head .

Santos v Vinick in The West Wing , photo courtesy of NBC
By Janette Ballard
BBC producer , President Hollywood
The Obama v McCain race for the White House has been run before - NBC's The West Wing pitted a charismatic , non-white Democrat against a maverick , experienced Republican .
In the The West Wing 's fictional 2006 election , actor Jimmy Smits played Latino presidential hopeful , Matthew Santos .
He announced his intention to run with the words , " We live in cynical times , but hope is not up for debate there is only hope . "
In the face of war you believe there can be peace , in the face of despair you believe there can be hope
Barack Obama 's nomination speech Sounds familiar does n't it ?
" Barack Obama was one of the people that I looked to draw upon , " admits Smits .
Just at the time that the Matt Santos character was being developed , Barack Obama gave the key note address at the 2004 Democratic Convention introducing John Kerry .
Smits studied the speech and then met Obama at a political event where they were both speaking .
" We were in this tent that normally would have been filled with people and for some reason it was just me and him .
And we were talking about Chicago politics and he looked at me and said , ' I think I can make an impact ' . "
SANTOS AND OBAMA Barack Obama : Born 1961 .
Elected Illinois Senator in 2004 .
Christian African - American Matthew Santos : Born 1961 .
Elected as Texas Representative in 2000 .
Catholic Mexican - American Similarities between the fictional Matt Santos and Barack Obama are striking ; Santos was a charismatic newcomer , promising hope and raising the possibility of the first non-white Commander in Chief .
In both style and content , he 's a reflection of Obama .
Eli Attie , a writer and producer on the show , was given the task of developing the character .
Attie knew Obama 's key aide , David Axelrod , so he called him for some advice .
" David Axelrod helped explain to me how Obama viewed his race , how he refused to be defined by it .
In politics people are always looking to force people into categories :
What 's your slice of the constituents ?
What 's your political base ?
And it seemed that Obama was very resistant to that idea and that was a key element in his success . "
FIND OUT MORE President Hollywood is on BBC Four on Monday , 15 September at 2100 BST
Or catch up with the BBC iPlayer Attie drew on this information in writing his scripts .
As fans of The West Wing will remember , the issue came up several times during the fictional race for the White House , but Matt Santos never let it distract him from his politics .
" We wanted to make sure that Santos was communicative and politically strong , and then you have the other layer there , that he just happens to be Latino , " says Smits .
He sees that it is the same for Obama ; his ethnicity is important , " but is not the be all and end all of the man " .
Maverick figure Running against Matt Santos in The West Wing 's election was Arnold Vinick .
More by coincidence than design , he bears a striking similarity to John McCain .
Played by Alan Alda , Vinick is a veteran Republican from out west , wise in the ways of Washington .
A maverick on some issues , he is attractive to those in the centre ground .
McCAIN AND VINICK John McCain : Born 1936 .
Vietnam vet .
Arizona Senator since 1986 Arnold Vinick : Born 1940 .
Fictional senator for California since 1982 .
Played by Alan Alda - Hawkeye in Korean War comedy M*A*S *H " The McCain candidacy is very similar to the Vinick candidacy , " says Lawrence O'Donnell , who wrote the character .
" They are good at appealing outside their own party .
And that is actually one of their problems , within their own party , of Republicans not believing that they were Republican enough . "
In The West Wing , Arnold Vinick chose a very conservative Republican as his running mate in an attempt to appeal to his own political base .
It 's a move that McCain seems to have mimicked in his choice of Sarah Palin .
The series took up real political issues , still hot topics this year - the price of oil and bio fuels , national security , immigration , health care , jobs , gun control .
When The West Wing held the all - important TV presidential debate , the show went out live , just like the real thing .
" Both Alan Alda and myself prepared as if we were candidates , " say Smits , acknowledging how it put genuine pressure on the actors to know their positions and get it right .
Some of their exchanges we may hear again in the coming weeks ;
Vinick declared himself pro-nuclear , Santos spoke against that position .
Santos committed to government spending to improve health provision for all , Vinick promised to never raise tax on healthcare .
Crystal ball
So what does this tell us about who is going to win ?
As The West Wing 's election campaign unfolded , the candidates were neck and neck , both on screen and in the writer 's room , with rival camps keen to see their candidate getting ahead .
" It was like two campaigns on the staff of the West Wing firing shots across the bow , " says Eli Attie .
For viewers the outcome was far from certain , much like this year 's real election .
For those still ploughing through West Wing DVDs , we wo n't give away the end result .
But so far at least , events have been a strange case of art reflecting life , reflecting art .
" We ran this campaign in The West Wing before it happened in the country , " says O'Donnell .
" We got lucky on a lot of the stuff - we 're not that smart . "

The Bailout Rush : Time Is Money or Haste Makes Waste ?
For some , rushed bailout has echoes of other hasty Bush administration policies .
Sept. 24 , 2008  --
Though the ongoing financial crisis was years in the making and its fallout will undoubtedly shape U.S. fiscal policy for years to come , the secretary of the treasury urged Congress Tuesday to act " quickly and cleanly " on approving a multibillion - dollar bailout measure .
Time is money , goes the old proverb , but members of Congress -- both Democrat and Republican -- as well as a chorus of economists have questioned the urgency with which Bush administration officials want to act .
They want a measure that would not only allow the federal government to buy up and resell $ 700 billion worth of troubled mortgages , but also put much of the authority to do so directly into the hands of the treasury secretary .
That secretary , Henry Paulson , urged lawmakers " to avoid slowing [ the bill ] down with other provisions that are unrelated or do n't have broad support . "
Each of the groups calling for caution on the bailout bill has its reasons for doing so -- be it the ideology of free - market Republicans , the politics of regulation - prone Democrats or the practical concerns of independent economists .
While Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , who also pleaded Tuesday the case for quick action , are well regarded in the business community , some critics have compared the bailout to the haste with which the Bush administration made the case for war in Iraq .
" This was years in the making , ca n't Congress wait a week to actually think about it ? " asked Barry L. Ritholtz , CEO of Fusion IQ , an institutional research firm and author of " Bailout Nation : How Easy Money Corrupted Wall Street and Shook the World Economy . "
" Were n't these the same guys who two months ago told us everything was fine ?
The administration is proposing the biggest bailout in history .
Should n't we not rush into this ? " he asked .
Sen. Jon Tester , D - Mont. , echoed that sentiment on Capitol Hill , asking : " Why do we have one week to determine $ 700 billion that has to be appropriated or this country 's financial system goes down the pipes ? "
Financial Experts :
What 's the Bailout Rush ?
Ritholtz equated the response by Congress and the media to the administration 's plan to their lack of critical review in the lead up to the Iraq War , when many of the administration 's claims about weapons of mass destruction went unquestioned .
" No one wants to be accused of causing a run on the bank or a panic , but by the time you really have to worry about that we 're way out of cycle .
Did n't we learn from Iraq that you need to ask the questions and ensure there is oversight , " he said .
A bipartisan group of lawmakers is calling for added provisions to the bill that would not only limit the power of the treasury secretary -- whose actions under the current draft " may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency " -- but that would also limit the use of taxpayer funds for multimillion - dollar golden parachutes for the executives of failed financial - services firms .
" I have long opposed government bailouts for individuals and corporate American alike , " said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee .
" We have been given no credible assurances that this plan will work .
We could very well send $ 700 billion , or a trillion , and not resolve the crisis . "
Congress would be prudent to act quickly , said Robert Reich , a professor of public policy at UC , Berkeley and secretary of labor during the Clinton administration , but speed does not mean necessary regulations should not be included in any bailout measure .
" Timing is of the essence .
Markets -- stocks , bonds and international markets for dollars -- are extremely nervous , " Reich told ABCNews.com .
" But this proposal is extremely flawed .
It is essentially a blank check with no one overseeing just how it is to be spent .
It pays to wait to have something sensible . "
Reich also compared a flawed bailout to the Bush administration 's more widely criticized mistakes , including the handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
" If this was a different administration this would be easier .
After Iraq and Katrina , you have to wonder if this administration can pull off anything this huge .
Putting half the federal budget on the line is enough to make people go crazy , " he said .
Gaining Back Public Trust
" There is so little public trust , that these senators and congressmen are going to have to go home and face their constituents and explain why Wall Streeters have made so much money when they have lost so much .
If worse comes to worst , people are going to lose their jobs and lose out on health care .
If this does n't work it will mean $ 5,000 to $ 8,000 per family , how do you explain that ? "
Given the pace at which Congress generally moves , some observers are skeptical that even with all the prodding action will be taken quickly .
" I 'm not convinced that they 're going to move quickly , " said Kenneth Rogoff , an economist at Harvard University .
" Given the scale of the bailout and the amount of discretion , Congress can only move so quickly .
This process has to be open ended with more decisions being made down the board .
It is scary to consider how fast they say they want to move given the amount of money , " he said .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) – Without offering a recommendation , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Sunday the U. S. government faces tough choices as it tries to help arrange a rescue of Lehman Brothers without using public money .
He cautioned that more major U.S. financial institutions may fail in the future , but the government should not protect them all .
The weight of the housing and credit crises , he added , " is in the process of outstripping anything I 've seen " and has yet to run its course .
" It will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the United States stabilizes , " perhaps next year , he said .
The immediate challenge for the Bush administration is resolving the fate of Lehman Brothers .
Global fears intensified over the weekend that Lehman 's collapse would stagger markets and undercut confidence in the U.S. financial system .
The field of possible buyers has narrowed ; how to finance the rescue was the key issue .
Germany 's finance minister appealed for a resolution before Asian markets opened Monday , and more discussions involving officials from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department were expected .
" They 're trying to do it in a different manner " than the Bear Stearns model , Greenspan noted .
The Fed in March agreed to provide a loan of nearly $ 29 billion as part of JPMorgan Chase & Co. 's takeover of the firm .
" The reason is obvious from seeing the effect of the bailout of Bear Stearns .
When Bear Stearns was bailed out , it drew a line under that level of firm , implying that anything that was larger than that firm was capable of getting federal assistance , '' Greenspan said .
But , he said , " if you generalize that , it is very clear that that is an unsustainable situation in the financial markets . "
The government cannot set a floor below these firms , Greenspan said .
Asked what would happen if the government cannot find a way to reach a deal on Lehman without public money , Greenspan said , " They have to make a very decision as to whether or not they allow it to liquidate or they support it .
And those are very difficult decisions . ''
He would not make a recommendation about what to do .
" I do n't know enough of what is going on .
I would have to have very detailed information of what 's on the Lehman Brothers balance sheet ... and what the repercussions would be with any particular solution , " he said .
OSLO , Norway --
A physicist has done the math , and says Usain Bolt could have run the 100 - meter Olympic final in 9.55 seconds if he had not slowed down to showboat .
What if Usain Bolt did n't hotdog it at the finish of the 100 - meter final ?
The research says 9.55 seconds .
Kirby Lee / Image of Sport / US Presswire
" We estimate that he could have finished the race in a time between 9.55 and 9.61 , " Norwegian physicist Hans Eriksen said Friday in a telephone interview .
Bolt won the final at the Beijing Olympics last month in 9.69 seconds , shaving 0.03 seconds off the record he set in May .
Eriksen , a physicist at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo , said he got the idea to examine just how quick Bolt could have gone after hearing Bolt 's coach say the Jamaican could have run 9.52 seconds .
" We saw the final on television and then spent the whole weekend researching , " Eriksen said .
" It was fun .
We 've done more serious research work , but this one got far more attention . "
Eriksen and his colleagues analyzed TV footage of the race , focusing on Bolt 's position , speed and acceleration , as well as that of runner - up Richard Thompson .
Both sprinters slowed before the finish line , but Bolt 's chest - beating celebration some 20 meters before the line cut his speed more .
" We do n't mean to say that this is the final and ultimate result , " Eriksen was quoted as saying in New Scientist magazine .
" Instead , it 's a fun application and simple physics . "
Safety inspectors in California have cited Scaled Composites for being at fault for the explosion that killed three employees at their Mojave Air and Space Port .
The explosion occurred in July 2007 and stunned the X - Prize winning company .
They now face a maximum fine of $ 25,310 .
Burt Rutan ’s Scaled Composite company has been going from strength to strength in recent years .
In 2004 the company was successful at launching their SpaceShipOne to an altitude of 114 km , claiming the $ 10 million Ansari X - Prize in 2004 .
Since this historic win , Rutan has formed a powerful alliance with British businessman Richard Branson ’s Virgin Galactic .
Branson is currently heading the construction of the world ’s first Space Port in the New Mexico desert , using SpaceShipOne ’s successor , the larger SpaceShipTwo , as the principal craft to take 6 people into space .
Stowed under a WhiteKnightTwo aircraft , SpaceShipTwo is designed for a conventional take - off until the pair are at approximately 15 km in altitude .
At this point , the pair separate , allowing SpaceShipTwo to accelerate to 2500 mph by firing its single hybrid rocket engine .
Weightlessness will be achieved , giving space tourists an idea of what it feels like to be in a low Earth orbit .
Tragically , three personnel working on the Scaled Composites site in the Mojave Desert last July were killed in an accident during tests involving a rocket propellant .
The report from safety officials state that the company failed to provide “ effective information and training of the health and physical hazards associated with nitrous oxide , ” the fuel used to power the rockets .
Since the incident safety measures have been stepped up and it is hoped that this sad event wo n’t delay the 2009 launch of the first space tourism flights by Virgin Galactic .

Sept. 11 Commemoration
Let 's have 1 minute of silence to remember the people who died on Sept. 11 , 2001 in the terrorist attacks .
Voter Registration
While most of the media attention is focused on candidate misstatements and national polls , there is important stuff going on below the radar .
In particular , voter registration .
Both sides are doing it , but the Obama campaign is doing it on a scale no party has previously done .
According to an article in Time , voter registration is up by over 400,000 in Florida , Michigan , and North Carolina , and up by over 100,000 in 10 other key states .
Most of the people being registered are under 35 , a key Obama demographic .
These huge increases could determine the election in a number of swing states .
As an aside on voter registration , if you are one of the 7 million Americans living abroad ( including students ) and are over 18 , you are eligible to vote in the state you last lived in .

Electoral - College Graph in a Different Format
A new site , evstrength.com , displays the electoral vote data in a somewhat different format than the " Electoral coll . graph " listed above .
It makes the strong , weak , and barely states more visible .
Polling and Partisan Identification
A series of recent polls have shown John McCain gaining ground on Barack Obama .
No doubt part of that is real due to the Republican convention and especially the speeches by Sarah Palin and McCain himself .
But there is also a troubling issue here relating to partisan identification about which pollsters themselves strongly disagree .
There are two schools of thought .
Gallup , SurveyUSA , and many others say in effect : " If we sample 1000 people and 500 are Republicans and 500 are Democrats , that 's the way it is . "
They just report the raw numbers -- say 50 % McCain and 50 % Obama .
Other pollsters , such as Rasmussen say : " I know there 42 million registered Democrats and 31 million Republicans in the country .
Furthermore my own samples over the past 3 months show ( for example ) that 55 % percent of the people I 've called are Democrats and 45 % are Republicans .
So if I happen to get a 50 - 50 sample one day , I am going to weight the 500 Democrats as if they were 550 and I am going to weight the 500 Republicans as if they were 450 .
Thus even though the raw data said Obama 50 % McCain 50 % I am going to report that as 55 % to 45 % . "
The argument for the first approach is that you are not fudging the numbers , just reporting what you measured .
The argument for the second one is that apparently today we had a bad sample and pretending that half the country is Republican does n't make it so .
The argument about some of the recent national polls is that the number of people calling themselves Republicans is far higher than in previous months .
A good Republican convention may cause more Republicans to plan on voting and may sway independents and even a few Democrats , but it almost never changes partisan composition .
Polls that do n't correct for partisan identification may thus undersample or oversample either party .
Correcting for it eliminates this problem but introduces the problem of knowing when to change the partisan weighting .
Rasmussen uses long - term averages over months to change the weighting .
If you are wondering about what 's going on with these recent polls , here is an article from Seth Coulter about this subject and here is a reaction to the article from Nate Silver .
Brian Schaffner has yet another article on the subject , this one applied to the recent SurveyUSA poll in North Carolina ( where the partisan breakdown was 40 - 41 compared to 46 - 33 in August ) .
A different but related subject is dealing with the partisan pollsters .
Firms like Gallup and SurveyUSA make their money by running polls for newspapers , TV stations , businesses , and others who want to know what the public is thinking .
However , there are other firms that are basically consultants , generally to only one party , and whose job is helping to elect its clients ' candidates .
They may shade or manipulate the results , use biased questions , or selectively publish results ( such as only those favorable to their clients ) .
In general , they are best ignored .
That is why we consistently omit certain pollsters here , such as Strategic Vision ( R ) and PPP ( D ) .
What If the Electoral College is Tied ?
Many people have asked : " What happens if the electoral college is tied at 269 - 269 ? "
For example , look at the map of Aug. 24 .
If it ends up like this and McCain wins Virginia , the final result is 269-269 .
What next ?
If no candidate for President receives 270 electoral votes ( either due to a 269 - 269 tie or a third - party candidate has won a few electoral votes ) , the newly elected House chooses the President , with each state having one vote .
Some people have asked what the House is likely to look like in January 2009 .
Lets start with the House as it is right now .
The blue states have Democratic majorities .
The red ones have Republican majorities .
Arizona and Kansas are split evenly .
Click on the map for an interactive version .
Currently the Democrats control 27 state delegations and the Republicans control 21 .
Arizona and Kansas are evenly split and would probably be unable to decide how to vote .
This assumes all representatives vote the party line .
Any Democrat voting for John McCain would no doubt be punished swiftly and vigorously by Nancy Pelosi , which is probably worse than potential punishment from the voters in 2 years , by which time other issues may dominate the news .
Of course , it is the new House that gets to vote , not the old one .
What changes are likely ?
Let 's look alphabetically .
Alaska only one congressman , currently Don Young ( R ) , but he is facing a tough primary and the winner of the primary will face a difficult race against Ethan Berkowitz ( D ) .
If Young wins the primary , Berkowitz has a decent shot at beating him in the general election .
Arizona is current split 4 - 4 .
If the Democrats hold their four seats and pick up the open seat in AZ - 01 being vacated by Rick Renzi ( R ) , they would control Arizona .
It would certainly be embarrassing to have Arizona to vote against McCain for President , but there is a good chance this could happen .
Thus we have two states that might go Democratic and we have n't even gotten to " B " yet .
Kansas is also split , 2 - 2 , and there is a very competitive race in KS - 02 , with Rep. Nancy Boyda ( D ) facing state treasurer Lynn Jenkins ( R ) .
Jenkins could win this one , which would make Kansas go Republican .
In Michigan , two Republican incumbents are facing very tough battles , Tim Walberg in MI - 07 and Joe Knollenberg in MI - 09 .
If the Democrats win both of these they will control the Michigan delegation .
Mississippi is currently Democratic , but Travis Childers ( D ) is in a rematch with Greg Davis in MS - 01 .
Childers already beat him twice this year in special elections , but the turnout will be heavier in the general election .
If Davis wins , Mississippi , the state splits 2 - 2 .
In Missouri , Sam Graves in MO - 06 has the fight of his life this year against former Kansas City mayor , Kay Barnes .
If Barnes wins , the Democrats will control Missouri .
Nevada could also change .
Jon Porter ( R ) in NV - 03 has a real battle against state senator Dina Titus ( D ) .
If Titus wins , Nevada flips to the Democrats .
New Mexico is another state where changing one seat flips the delegation .
The race to watch here is NM - 01 , a D+2 open seat vacated by Heather Wilson in her abortive run for the Senate nomination .
Initial polling here puts Martin Heinrich ( D ) ahead of Darren White ( R ) here , which means the state could flip .
Ohio currently has 11 Republicans and 7 Democrats in the House .
Two of them , Steve Chabot ( R ) in OH - 01 and Jean Schmidt ( R ) in OH - 02 are facing very strong challengers and could lose .
Two more seats , OH - 15 ( Pryce ) and OH - 16 ( Regula ) are open and the Democrats are fielding very strong candidates .
Winning two of the four is a realistic possibility , in which case Ohio would not be able to vote .
There is one Democratic - held seat in Ohio ( OH - 18 ) which is theoretically at risk , but incumbent Zack Space ( D ) lucked out when the Republicans failed to come up with a first tier candidate .
The Republican , Fred Dailey , has never run for elective office before , so despite the R+6 rating , Space is favored .
So in the best case for Obama , Boyda and Childers hang on and the Democrats pick up Alaska , Arizona , Michigan , Missouri , Nevada , and New Mexico , while neutralizing Ohio .
This would give them control of 33 state delegations .
What 's the best case scenario for McCain ?
Boyda and Childers could lose and one of the freshmen in Arizona ( Giffords or Mitchell could lose ) .
This brings it to 26 Democrats and 24 Republicans .
Still enough for a narrow Obama win .
However , all this assumes that all representatives vote the party line .
But consider Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( D - SD ) and Earl Pomeroy ( D - ND ) .
The Republicans carried both states by over 20 points in 2004 and 2000 and probably will again .
What will they do ?
Pomeroy is 56 and his been in Congress for 8 terms , so he qualifies as a senior guy who wo n't be pushed around easily .
Herseth Sandlin is only 37 and this is only her second term .
Furthermore , she knows very well that she got her job because many voters fondly remember that her grandfather was once governor .
There will be immense pressure on the poor woman to vote the way her state did .
If both of them vote for McCain , he becomes President .
If they split and it becomes 25 - 25 , then the House will unable to elect a President .
In that case the Vice President elected by the Senate ( with each state having two votes , one per senator ) acts as President .
The Democrats are likely to hold a minimum of 55 seats in the new Senate , so in that case Joe Biden would become acting President .
This scenario would also mean that if Pomeroy votes for McCain , then Herseth Sandlin could make McCain President or Biden President depending on her vote .
Ditto Pomeroy if Herseth Sandlin votes for McCain .
And by the way , Rep. Mike Castle ( R ) is the sole representative from heavily Democratic Delaware , a fact Joe Biden will surely bring up if it gets this far .
The whole thing could make 2000 look like a clean - cut victory .
With a close presidential election , half a dozen House races could ultimately determine who becomes ( acting ) President .

Today 's Polls
We have eight new presidential polls today .
There is good news and bad news for both candidates .
For Barack Obama , the good news is that he is still ahead in Michigan and New Hampshire , two Kerry states he really can't afford losing .
If he holds the Kerry states , he starts with a base of 252 electoral votes .
To that he needs 1 - 3 more states .
The good news for John McCain is that for the first time this year he is ahead in New Mexico , a state that Bush won in 2004 but which Obama was really counting on winning this time .
His 49 % to 47 % lead is a statistical tie , but at least he is not far behind there , as he has been all year .
State Obama McCain Start End Pollster Alaska 33 % 64 % Sep 09 Sep 09 Rasmussen Alabama 35 % 55 % Sep 03 Sep 09 Capital Survey Michigan 49 % 45 % Sep 07 Sep 09 Opinion Research Missouri 45 % 50 % Sep 07 Sep 09 Opinion Research North Dakota 41 % 55 % Sep 08 Sep 08 Rasmussen New Hampshire 51 % 45 % Sep 07 Sep 09 Opinion Research New Mexico 47 % 49 % Sep 08 Sep 08 Rasmussen Virginia 46 % 50 % Sep 07 Sep 09 Opinion Research
We also have three Senate polls as follows .
Ted Stevens seems to be narrowing the gap in Alaska , despite his indictment and upcoming trial .
Perhaps he is riding on Sarah Palin 's coattails .

Forget computing the Kazhdan - Lusztig polynomials for E8 , a far more important theorem has apparently been proved .
I wo n't state the answer here as it's fun to think about the problem for yourself .
But a number of proposed proofs of solutions to the Angel problem have been informally published , at least electronically .
Firstly , what is the problem ?
Wikipdia has a succinct write up .
But here 's a quick summary anyway :
The game of Angels and Devils , invented by John Conway ( the same Conway as in the Game of Life , the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures , the proof that subatomic particles have free will and so on ) , is played on an infinite chessboard .
Fix some constant k .
One player plays the Angel .
The other plays the Devil .
On the Devil 's turn , he may eat one square on the chessboard .
( The devil does n't actually have a piece , he just eats whatever square he wants . ) .
On the Angel 's turn she jumps to a square ( distinct from the current one ) up to k king 's moves away .
The Devil wins if the Angel has no legal move .
The Angel wins if she has a strategy that guarantees always to have a legal move .
For each k , who wins ?
Until recently it was unknown if the Angel could win even for arbitrarily large k .
This may seem like a surprise , after all , if the angel can move 1,000 king 's moves , surely she can easily evade the jaws of the devil who can only chomp one square at a time .
But surprisingly , the obvious Angel strategies that come to mind can be countered .
What 's nice about this problem is that it 's so easy to state , and yet has stumped some of the smartest people who like to think about these problems .
Two papers with possible solutions are Máthé 's and Kloster 's .
I do n't think either of them have formally been published yet so I do n't know if the peer review is complete .
Reaction to the movie box office charts
After I made the movie box office charts , there were a lot of visitors from various sites .
I figured it would be interesting to chart the referring site patterns the same way I charted the movies .
Here are statistics for the first 60 hours after the charts were first made public .
Click the chart for a really big interactive breakdown .
Referers are categorized under the shortened domain name .
For example , clicks from either Google Reader or Google search both show up under " google.com " .
Clicks from reddit.com or the programming subreddit both show up under " reddit.com " .
There are a few trends that I found interesting :
Reddit is the Titanic of linkers , even though the link did n't climb very high on the main one .
I wonder what the chart might have looked like if the Digg link took off .
See below for the Reddit / Digg comparison .
of linkers , even though the link did n't climb very high on the main one .
See below for the Reddit / Digg comparison .
Lots of people read kottke.org with Google Reader .
Reaching the delicious front page caused significant bumps at hour 32 ( when they linked to the 2008 page ) and hour 41 ( when they linked to the main page ) .
I 've never heard of fazed .
net , but they sent a long , steady stream of traffic starting at hour 30 .
My favorite link does n't register much on the chart , just a slim purple line starting around hour 25 .
Getting Dugg ( and Stumbled )
The movie charts got Dugg a few days after they made a minor dent on reddit .
They hit the front page end wound up with over 800 diggs and 50 comments .
I had to move some of the images to Amazon S3 to keep up with the demand .
While Digg had a huge bulge , I was surprised to see that StumbleUpon sent much more traffic than Digg over a longer period of time .
Below are the Reddit and Digg referral trend charts over 48 ( different sets of ) hours .
Instead of the Titanic , Reddit is now the Deuce Bigelow , European Gigolo of linkers .

He keeps saying it .
What do you think he means ?
If someone keeps saying to you the kinds of things he says would it put a strain on the " friendship " ?
More exactly I have to ask ARE YOU " HIS FRIEND " ?
And what the heck does he mean ?
Because he keeps saying " my friends " " my friends " " my friends " .
Is he going to lead or " be your friend " ?
Does he mean that there are Americans who are NOT " his friend " ?
Is he only speaking to " his friends " , or all Americans ?
And does he want friends or citizens ?
Does he seem weird and people are getting tired of hearing him ?
I know I may be making the question difficult to answer , but I just want to know what some of you think .
Thankyou .
MIT researchers are designing a wheelchair that responds to verbal commands and remembers how to get various places .
Outside , it uses GPS for wayfinding .
Inside though , GPS does n't work so well so the researchers are investigating positioning schemes using WiFi , cameras , and laser rangefinders .
They 're currently testing a prototype in a Boston nursing home .
From MIT News Office :
Just by saying " take me to the cafeteria " or " go to my room , " the wheelchair user would be able to avoid the need for controlling every twist and turn of the route and could simply sit back and relax as the chair moves from one place to another based on a map stored in its memory .
" It 's a system that can learn and adapt to the user , " says Nicholas Roy , assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics and co-developer of the wheelchair .
" People have different preferences and different ways of referring " to places and objects , he says , and the aim is to have each wheelchair personalized for its user and the user 's environment .
Unlike other attempts to program wheelchairs or other mobile devices , which rely on an intensive process of manually capturing a detailed map of a building , the MIT system can learn about its environment in much the same way as a person would :
By being taken around once on a guided tour , with important places identified along the way .
For example , as the wheelchair is pushed around a nursing home for the first time , the patient or a caregiver would say : " this is my room " or " here we are in the foyer " or " nurse 's station . "
The rover can travel up to 100 m per day , the mission team believes
The US space agency is to send its Mars rover Opportunity on a two - year trek to try to reach a crater called Endeavour .
The robot will have to move about 11 km to get to its new target - a distance that would double what it has already achieved on the planet .
Endeavour is much bigger than anything investigated to date , and will allow a broader range of rocks to be studied .
Opportunity arrived on Mars in January 2004 on a mission scheduled initially to last just three months .
The performance of the rover - like that of its twin , Spirit - has greatly exceeded what anyone had dared hope .
The US space agency ( Nasa ) concedes , however , that the Endeavour assignment will be an extremely tough one .
" We may not get there , but it is scientifically the right direction to go anyway , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University , principal investigator for the science instruments on Opportunity and Spirit .
" This crater is staggeringly large compared to anything we 've seen before . "
Endeavour is to the southeast of Victoria Crater Opportunity has just emerged from the 800 m - wide Victoria Crater .
Endeavour by comparison is 22 km across .
The mission team estimates Opportunity may be able to travel about 100 m per day .
But even at that pace , the journey could take two years .
The rover will stop to study rocks on the way , and in winter months it cannot move because there is not enough sunlight to provide sufficient power for driving .
Detailed satellite imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will help pick out the best route ahead ; and new software recently uploaded to Opportunity will enable the rover to make its own decisions about how best to negotiate large rocks in its path .
At least it does not yet have to cope with the locomotion problems of Spirit .
A jammed wheel on the twin means it must now drive backwards everywhere it goes .
Since landing on the Meridiani plains , Opportunity has gathered important data about Martian geology , including evidence that parts of it were once soaked by water .

Thanks for all the email , comments in the forum , and comments on other forums ( I ’m looking at you , Slashdot ! ) .
Because that article was so widely read — more widely read than the first two articles in the series — I received a number of questions and comments that deserve some elaboration .
So let ’s dive into them .
Cool Article .
Are there other articles ?
Glad you asked .
The Solar Power : One Month Later is the third in a series of articles I ’ve written on my personal exploration of solar power .
The initial article , Checking Out Solar Power dealt with my initial thinking on the subject , including reasons why , plus the bidding process .
The second in the series , Going Solar : The Install discussed the physical installation process .
How much did it cost ?
I talk about costs in the first two articles , but to give round numbers , the total cost of the system was roughly $ 55,000 before rebates .
The California Solar Initiative kicked in about $ 11,500 , which brought our out - of - pocket expense down to $ 43,500 .
My wife ’s company has a deal with Sunpower , so she qualified for an additional rebate of $ 4,750 .
That brought our final cost down to about $ 38,750 .
Again , those are round numbers , but pretty close to the mark .
We ’ll also be getting another $ 2,000 tax credit when we file our 2009 tax return .

" Cap and trade " is the rage today as a primary solution to global warming .
But the European Union 's struggle with this approach indicates it has an uncertain future .
This is because global warming , at its core , is not a technology or policy problem .
It is the greatest failure of thought in human history .
Attempts to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions will fail unless people first alter their thinking and behavior .
Earth is warming because humans , primarily in industrialized nations , suffer from systems blindness .
We have failed to recognize the effects of our insatiable use of fossil fuels , massive resource consumption , and huge emission of waste , including greenhouse gasses , on the ecological and social systems we depend on for life .
That blindness threatens all life forms today and in the future .
Overcoming systems blindness requires a shift to what can be called " sustainable thinking . "
A growing number of private and public organizations and everyday citizens have shown that it is possible to think sustainably .
They use a four - step process : discover , dream , design , and act .
Their first step is to discover the greenhouse gas emissions produced through all aspects of their activities .
They start by assessing the emissions directly produced through their home and business energy use , travel , and waste .
They then identify the emissions they create indirectly , including those generated throughout the entire life cycle of the goods and services , including food , purchased or used .
Discovery is often a life - changing experience .
People become aware of the profound impacts of their activities on the climate and other people .
Albuquerque , N.M. , and Portland , Ore. , have completed greenhouse - gas " inventories " of the amount and sources of emissions generated directly through internal city operations and by the broader community .
Some cities have begun to assess the emissions from products manufactured elsewhere that are used locally .
Xerox and DuPont are just two of the many private companies that use " life - cycle assessments " to quantify their carbon footprint .
Regular people are also doing it , such as those that attend the Climate Master program developed by my organization at the University of Oregon .
Through this 10 - week program , participants are taught how to think systemically and discover the full range of their emissions .
Small towns such as Corvallis , Ore. , big cities such as Denver , and individual groups in Maryland are now considering launching Climate Master programs .
The next step is to dream of new ways to lower our carbon footprint .
Dreaming starts by envisioning what an ideal low or carbon - free condition would look and function like .
Dreaming leads to the design stage , where innovative ways of achieving the ideal are planned .
Albuquerque established the nation 's first municipal capital budget set - aside specifically dedicated to energy reduction and renewable energy projects .
Portland developed a climate action plan through extensive community involvement .
Xerox established the " Energy Challenge 2012 , " which involves the entire company , engages its full business value chain , and integrates climate protection into core business strategies and practices .
The last stage is acting .
Start by increasing energy conservation and efficiency .
Make behavioral changes – such as turning off unused lights , TVs , and computers – routine .
Add extra building insulation .
Use public transportation or walk more .
Install green technologies , from CFL or LED bulbs to more efficient motors .
After all possible efficiencies have been captured , shift to renewable energy .
In Portland , more than 40 high - performance green buildings have been constructed and more than 10,000 multifamily units and 800 homes have been weatherized .
Albuquerque now gets 20 percent of its energy from wind .
Thinking sustainably produces impressive results .
Emissions from city operations in Albuquerque have been reduced by 58 percent ; Portland 's have dropped 16 percent since 1990 , Xerox 's by 18 percent through 2006 , and DuPont 's by 67 percent .
Climate Masters has slashed emissions by an average of two tons per person .
Hundreds of other organizations are beginning to think sustainably .
The State of Florida , for example , recently completed a statewide emissions assessment .
More than 850 mayors have signed the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement that , among other actions , commits cities to inventory their emissions .
IBM and Bayer have each reduced emissions by at least 60 percent since the early 1990s , collectively saving more than $ 4 billion .
Stabilizing the climate will ultimately require an 80 percent cut in emissions , so emissions trading and many other reduction strategies will be needed .
But , no matter what the approach , these pioneers have shown that success ultimately depends on overcoming systems blindness and thinking sustainably .

As part of my research on vegetarian diet , I recently dove into the fascinating book “ The China Study “ .
It was written by Dr. Campbell , a researcher who has spent the past 30 years studying the effects of animal proteins on health .
In addition to simply presenting the numerous studies by various researchers in a meaningful way , the book does a great job of explaining the most common dangerous diseases , in layman ’s terms .
I finally have a basic grasp of the workings behind cancer , diabetes , heart disease , and the various autoimmune diseases .
I believe that the best way to understand and retain something new is by teaching it .
Here is my stab at explaining the basics of these diseases using very simple terms .
I hope this can be helpful to you in gaining some clarity around these health topics that are foreign to most of us .
Through understanding , we can appreciate the intricate workings and intelligence of our bodies ; thus empowering ourselves to make better , more conscious and responsible lifestyle choices .
Let ’s start with autoimmune disease .
Background
I find autoimmune disease to be the most disturbing amongst the other diseases discussed ; particularly , due to its insidious nature of self - attacking , and the lack of treatment options .
About 3 % of Americans have an autoimmune disease , estimating a total of 8.5 million people .
Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is one of the high profile autoimmune diseases that caries with it devastating results .
“ It is a lifelong battle involving a variety of unpredictable and serious disabilities .
MS patients often pass through episodes of acute attacks while gradually losing their ability to walk or to see .
After ten to fifteen years , they often are confined to a wheelchair , and then to a bed for the rest of their lives . ”
Other well studied autoimmune diseases include Type 1 diabetes , lupus and rheumatoid arthritis .
All in all there are forty varying types in this disease group .
Regardless of name , they all share a common behavior in which the immune system attacks our body ’s own cells , causing destruction to our body ’s integrity .
Basic Workings of Our Immune System
Our immune system is not an organ , but a series of cells and processes working together to fight off foreign cells in our blood stream .
The individual soldiers in this battle against foreign invaders are the white blood cells .
There are various types of white blood cells , each with its own specialization .
Our bone marrow is like the main recruiting center for soldiers .
It is in the marrow of bones where stem cells are made .
Some of these cells get released directly into the body for use .
These are called B - Cells .
Some of these cells travel to the thymus ( organ in our chest ) before getting finalized into T - Cells .
The foreign invaders in our body are called Antigen , they are protein molecules which can be a virus or a bacteria that is potentially corruptive to our body .
Each antigen has a unique identity based on the sequence of amino acids which makes up the protein .
Their identities are comparable to difference faces on people .
When a foreign invader is detected , these white blood cells team up into groups to create a customized defense against the invader .
They do so by creating a protein that mirrors the shape of the invader ( antigen ) , such that it fits perfectly onto the antigen and destroys it in a “ kiss of death ” .
Each time a new antigen is encountered , a new mold is created .
The molds are then re-used for future captures of antigens of the same type .
Names for some molds are B - cell antibodies and T - cell - based receptor proteins .
Fancy !
Subsequent attacks on antigens with existing molds mean that they can be destroyed faster and less painful .
This is the basis for Immunization : introducing a tiny dose of a foreign virus , so our body will create the appropriate molds and will know how to deal with them next time .
Autoimmune Diseases : Military Gone Crazy
Problems happen when our soldiers cannot distinguish between invader proteins from our body ’s own proteins .
Molecular mimicry is when invader cells look the same as our own cells .
Meaning , molds created to attack the invader cell will also fit into our own cells .
The actual cause of confusion is still unknown , and the process is extremely complex .
Scientists believe the antigens that trick our body into attacking our own cells may be found in food .
Here is one possibility :
Digestion after eating food
Some proteins are not broken down into amino acid parts
Slips into blood stream from intestine
Treated as foreign invaders by white blood cells
Molds created to destroy them
Starts into motion the self - destructive process
Cow ’s milk is one of such food which supplies several foreign proteins that mimic the proteins found in our bodies .
Normally , our body is smart enough to distinguish which cells are foreign , even if they look similar .
Sort of like the soldiers having safe guards against friendly fire .
The way that this system breaks down is still not understood .
However , many studies have shown that a “ western diet ” ( high animal protein , cholesterol , refined carbohydrates ) is strongly associated with disease incidence .
What we do know is that this self - destructive process is common to all autoimmune diseases .
Type - 1 Diabetes – Immune system attacks the pancreas used to create insulin in our body .
Insulin is used to redirect glucose ( blood sugar ) to other parts of body .
As a result , the body has an overflow of blood sugar .

Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) – Immune system attacks the myelin sheath used to insulate nerve fibers which connects our central and peripheral nervous system to the rest of our body .
As a result , the electrical signals “ short - circuit ” , and the messages / commands will not be properly carried from our brain to various body parts ; thus gradual loss of control over our body .

Arthritis – Immune system attacks the joint tissues .
Based on reputable research studies in relation to nutrition , the consumption of animal - based foods , especially cow ’s milk is associated with greater risk of autoimmune diseases .
This is especially apparent and well - documented in Type - 1 Diabetes , a devastating disease found in children .
Here ’s a quote from the result of one study , “ All of the diabetic children had levels of cow ’s milk antibodies that were higher than those of all the non-diabetic children . ” ( read more on page 187 of China Study ) .
I find it deeply troubling to learn that something we ’ve socially believed to have been an essential staple for “ good health and strong bones ” may cause one of the most devastating diseases a child can develop .

Tea bags and pack look like cigarettes .
Some fun for you and your friends .
See ? - you take a cigarette and drop to hot water cup - and you got tea , because its tea in cigarette ( not tobacco ) .
Filter works like a float .
And there is a common concept for tea and cigarettes and that is , its break to communication between friends .
One of the goofiest things that happened during the 2004 presidential election was when a national poll asked Americans whether they would rather have a beer with George W. Bush or the Democratic candidate , John Kerry .
A majority of those polled indicated they would like to hoist a Heineken with Bush -- how didmethod of choosing a candidate work out for us ? -- and we appear to be at it again , with this year 's version of that nonsense announced late last week .
I 'm sure you heard about it over the weekend …
An Associated Press - Yahoo !
News poll released Friday showed these to be among the most compelling things we should consider when selecting the next President of the United States : Between Barack Obama and John McCain , who would we rather watch a football game with and , as amore dignified follow - up , who would we choose to be our child 's teacher .
For the record , Obama was the choice on both counts but let 's not endorse these ridiculous questions by dwelling on those results .
It 's actually quite sad that in a poll with 34 published pages of questions , these are undoubtedly the only two that made it to your television or newspaper over the weekend .
What I found interesting is that , like most comprehensive polls that include questions about the Iraq war , the AP - Yahoo survey shows once again that the vast majority of Americans want some form of timeline for exiting Iraq -- a result that has not changed much in the last few years .
The poll asked respondents " Do you support or oppose setting a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq ?
" Almost half of all of those questioned " strongly support " a withdrawal timetable , with a total of 72 percent of Americans either " somewhat " or " strongly " supporting a date - certain for withdrawal .
And before " the surge " was somewhat successfully publicized by Bush and John McCain as the end - all - be - all of the Iraq war -- like we have n't had five disastrous years before that and still have no rationale for even being there -- such responses were consistently at 80 percent or more .
But at this point , here 's what almost three - quarters of Americanneed to keep in mind : John McCain and almost every Republican candidate running for office this year think you 're all a bunch of cowards -- they 've said so .
They say you want to " surrender to the terrorists . "
They say you favor a gutless retreat and that you want to " cut and run .
" Perhaps most importantly , they have been questioning your patriotism for a long time and have often accused you of wanting to abandon our troops .
They may not have sent most voters a bulk mail or an e-mail directing those comments personally at them , but they use that language and those sentiments on a daily basis to describe the public figures who agree exactly with the point of view of most Amercians .
In her vice - presidential acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) , Sarah Palin said that Democratic nominee Barack Obama " wants to forfeit " to the terrorists .
Former GOP presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said at the RNC that " if Barack Obama had been President , there would have been no troop surge and our troops would have been withdrawn in defeat " and followed that by accusing Democrats of giving up on Iraq and saying " I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that when they gave up on Iraq they were giving up on America .
" Turncoat former Democrat Joe Lieberman said that Obama " wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle , " and it goes without saying that Bush , McCain , Dick Cheney and every Republican with a second of air time has repeated " cut and run " so many times they probably still mumble it in their sleep and use it as an intoxicating phrase while having sex .
And it may have hit its peak in late 2005 when Ohio Representative Jean Schmidt went after Congressman John Murtha -- a highly - decorated former Marine --- on the floor of the House of Representatives because Murtha had just called for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and smeared him saying " cowards cut and run , Marines never do .
" That was almost three years ago .
That kind of mud had been flying before that , it has since and it will continue through November 4 and beyond .
But no matter how many names they 've been called , no matter how many times Americans have been hammered with " cut and run " and " retreat and defeat " over the last four years , mostfavor an exit from Iraq .
So the three - quarters of Americans sharing the same views on Iraq held by Barack Obama , Joe Biden and other Democrats need to ask themselves one simple question as election day approaches :
Why would they want to vote for John McCain or any Republican when they 've said you 're a coward , are not patriotic , silently support a terrorist victory over America and have turned your back on our troops ?
And then vote accordingly .
Traffic jams are something nearly everyone can relate to .
While driving is ideally a communal activity , where people pay attention to each other and follow the rules of the road , most people seem to follow their whims , only occasionally within the confines of common sense .
This urge to do what is best for the individual leads to headaches for the group , increasing the total amount of time everyone has to spend on the road .
In a paper set to be published in an upcoming issue of Physical Review Letters , physicists Hyejin Youn and Hawoong Jeong , along with computer scientist Micheal Gastner , look at the result of self - interested drivers traveling on both hypothetical and real - world networks .
The abstract describes what happens very clearly :
Uncoordinated individuals in human society pursuing
their personally
optimal strategies do not always achieve the social optimum , the most
beneficial state to the society as a whole .
Instead , strategies form
Nash equilibria which are often socially suboptimal .
Society ,
therefore , has to pay a price of anarchy for the lack of coordination
among its members .
To illustrate this principle , the authors discuss a trivial example : two points A and B are connected by both a short bridge and a long freeway .
Here , the total number of travelers going from A to B is constant , but the bridge is narrow and prone to congestion , while the freeway is wide and is less susceptible to traffic jams .
In this setup , the ideal situation for everyone is for half the traffic to take each path .
Even in this trivial example , however , what is best for everyone is not best to each person .
Using their example numbers , a driver taking the freeway under ideal conditions would reduce his or her individual delay by 40 percent over taking the bridge .
But as more and more people move away from the global optimum and take the bridge , the total time involved in traveling from A to B increases and a Nash equilibrium is reached .
This is the point where " no single user can make any individual gain by changing his own strategy unilaterally . "
In other words , no matter what route you take , you 're going to be stuck in traffic .
By looking at the ratio of the cost at Nash equilibrium to the equilibrium representing the global optimum , one can calculate the price of anarchy ( POA ) — a measure of inefficiency caused by the lack of coordination .
Imaginary bridges and freeways can only take us so far , so the authors decided to apply the analysis to the real world .
They calculated the Price of Anarchy for three real - world commutes : from Harvard Square to Boston Common in Boston , from Washington Market Park to the Queens Midtown Tunnel in New York , and the trip from Borough underground station to Farringdon station in London .
Using a well - established function to model traffic delays , they find that at an average traffic flow of 10,000 vehicles per hour in Boston — a typical number — the POA peaks at 1.3 .
This means that drivers waste 30 percent more time because they are driving with their own interests in mind rather than a group concern ( not a news flash for anyone who has driven in Boston ) .
New York and London had similar peak POA values of about 1.27 and 1.22 , respectively .
To gain a better theoretical understanding of the nature of POA in networks , the team applied their methodology to various types of idealized networks .
They came to the conclusion that , to improve the Price of Anarchy , you must close off various roads — something known as Braess 's paradox .
In the network representing Boston , the researchers find six possible road closures that would reduce the delay in the suboptimal Nash ( selfish ) equilibrium .
A similar analysis of the London and New York networks found that there were seven and twelve roads , respectively , that could be closed to improve the overall travel time .
While still theoretical , the work has the potential to aid future urban planning .
Since the obvious solution of adding more roads may actually make the problem worse , an analysis of this sort could prove invaluable in determining real - world driving conditions .

Devastating declines of amphibian species around the world are a sign of a biodiversity disaster larger than just frogs , salamanders and their ilk , according to researchers from the University of California , Berkeley .
In a new article published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers argue that substantial die - offs of amphibians and other plant and animal species add up to a new mass extinction facing the planet .
" There 's no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now , " said David Wake , professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley .
" Amphibians have been around for about 250 million years .
They made it through when the dinosaurs did n't .
The fact that they 're cutting out now should be a lesson for us . "
The study , co-authored by Wake and Vance Vredenburg , research associate at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley and assistant professor of biology at San Francisco State University , will appear in a special supplement to the journal featuring papers based on presentations from the December 2007 Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium of the National Academy of Sciences , " In the Light of Evolution II : Biodiversity and Extinction . "
New species arise and old species die off all the time , but sometimes the extinction numbers far outweigh the emergence of new species .
Extreme cases of this are called mass extinction events , and there have been only five in our planet 's history , until now .
The sixth mass extinction event , which Wake and others argue is happening currently , is different from the past events .
" My feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of Homo sapiens , " Wake said .

There is no consensus among the scientific community about when the current mass extinction started , Wake said .
It may have been 10,000 years ago , when humans first came from Asia to the Americas and hunted many of the large mammals to extinction .
It may have started after the Industrial Revolution , when the human population exploded .
Or , we might be seeing the start of it right now , Wake said .
But no matter what the start date , empirical data clearly show that extinction rates have dramatically increased over the last few decades , Wake said .
The global amphibian extinction is a particularly bleak example of this drastic decline .
In 2004 , researchers found that nearly one - third of amphibian species are threatened , and many of the non-threatened species are on the wane .
Our own backyard provides a striking example , Wake said .
He and his colleagues study amphibians in the Sierra Nevada , and the picture is grim there , as well .
" We have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves , and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there , too , " Wake said .

Of the seven amphibian species that inhabit the peaks of the Sierra Nevada , five are threatened .
Wake and his colleagues observed that , for two of these species , the Sierra Nevada Yellow - legged Frog and the Southern Yellow - legged Frog , populations over the last few years declined by 95 to 98 percent , even in highly protected areas such as Yosemite National Park .
This means that each local frog population has dwindled to 2 to 5 percent of its former size .
Originally , frogs living atop the highest , most remote peaks seemed to thrive , but recently , they also succumbed .
There are several frog killers in the Sierra Nevada , Wake said .
The first hint of frog decline in this area came in the 1990s , and researchers originally thought that rainbow trout introduced to this area were the culprits - they like to snack on tadpoles and frog eggs .
The UC Berkeley team did experiments in which it physically removed trout from some areas , and the result was that frog populations started to recover .
" But then they disappeared again , and this time there were carcasses , " Wake said .
The culprit is a nasty pathogenic fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis .
Researchers discovered the fungus in Sierra Nevada frogs in 2001 .
Scientists have documented over the last five years mass die - offs and population collapses due to the fungus in the mountain range .
But the fungus is not unique to California .
It has been wiping out amphibians around the world , including in the tropics , where amphibian biodiversity is particularly high .
" It 's been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded , " Wake said .
Global warming and habitat constriction are two other major killers of frogs around the world , Wake said .
And the Sierra Nevada amphibians are also susceptible to poisonous winds carrying pesticides from Central Valley croplands .
" The frogs have really been hit by a one - two punch , " Wake said , " although it 's more like a one - two - three - four punch . "
The frogs are not the only victims in this mass extinction , Wake emphasized .
Scientists studying other organisms have seen similarly dramatic effects .
" Our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work , and the news is very , very grim , " Wake said .
The National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health helped support this study .
Audio files and slides of presentations from the Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium on biodiversity and extinction are available online .
Mark this day down .
Today – last night , actually – the New York Times and Roll Call reported ( it 's hard to see who was first ) what may be the biggest political story of the campaign .
How big ?
John McCain might have to fire his campaign manager .
Big enough ?
The story is this .
The lobbying firm of Rick Davis , the manager , was being paid $ 15,000 a month by Freddie Mac until last month .
That fact is a direct contradiction of words McCain had spoken Sunday night .
At that time , responding to a Times story being prepared for Monday 's paper revealing that Davis had been the head of a lobbying consortium led by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae until 2005 , McCain said Davis had done no further work for either mortgage giant .
Someone 's lying – either Davis to McCain , or McCain to the public .
I trust you see the problem here .
The stories are here , by David Kirkpatrick ( whose reporting on this topic has been leading the way ) and Jackie Calmes of the Times , and here , by Tory Newmeyer of Roll Call .
You should definitely read every word of both .
I think after you do you 'll agree that , depending on how big the pick - up is today and how hard the Obama camp presses this , it 's pretty difficult to see how Davis can stay on as campaign manager .
The revelations are devastating for two reasons .
First , as I noted above , either Davis lied to McCain or McCain lied to the voters .
From the Times story :
On Sunday , in an interview with CNBC and The Times , Mr. McCain responded to a question about that tie between Mr. Davis and the two mortgage companies by saying that he " has had nothing to do with it since , and I 'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it . "
Who lied to whom ?
This is the kind of thing we might not know for a while , or maybe never .
My hunch would be that Davis concealed it from McCain and that McCain , as is his wont , just winged it Sunday night , without really caring whether it was true , because that 's what he does .
But let me clearly label that a hunch .
I do n't know .
But it does n't really matter .
The second reason this is devastating is maybe even bigger than the question of the Sunday lie , which is limited in scope after all to a sort of narrow legal question .
The second reason is that McCain has been going around putting lobbyists , specifically for F & F , at the heart of the whole problem .
This is from the Roll Call piece :
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emerged as issues in the presidential race last week because of turmoil in the financial markets .
In a radio address from Green Bay , Wis. , on Saturday , McCain blamed the companies and their political clout for creating the housing mess now roiling Wall Street .
" At the center of the problem were the lobbyists , politicians and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , '' he said .
" Using money and influence , they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy .
And now , as ever , the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington 's failure . ''
I just can't picture any way of wiggling out of that .
He is talking in those sentences about his own campaign manager !
And he 's going to be able to keep him on ?
Strange things happen all the time , but I have trouble seeing it .
Oh and by the way :
No wonder Steve Schmidt , another top McCain strategist , said on a Monday conference call with reporters that " Whatever The New York Times once was , it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization . "
He obviously knew that more was coming and was trying to lay some discrediting groundwork .
This is a terrible , terrible story for McCain , and yes , the biggest political story of the general - election campaign so far .

or ... Five Years Loving a Game With a Stupid Name .
One of the quirky ' top whatever ' lists that appears every now and then is the list of worst names for video games .
And somewhere on every one of those lists is Divine Divinity .
Yeah , it IS pretty obvious why .
The game would also appear on another list - if some one could figure out how to name it .
That list would be ' best deep role playing game that fans of classic RPG's have ignored because it features action - RPG combat and has a very difficult and long dungeon in the beginning . '
So you can see I wo n't be getting a job naming lists anytime soon .
Point is , this is a game that many RPG fans tried the demo and felt it was just yet another Diablo Clone and left it behind .
Something about the old saying ' you only get one chance to make a first impression ' springs to mind .
But in doing so they missed out on one of the best games in recent years , and one that recently celebrated its ' fifth anniversary of release .
So , as I am inclined to do lately , I cut some time into the aftermath of the busy fall release schedule to replay the game .
While it is the fifth anniversary of the release of the game , I did n't make it very far in the game the first time I played : similar to so many others I fiddled around in the initial town a bit and made it into the catacombs ... and died repeatedly .
I chalked it up as another lame Diablo clone , wrote off the money I spent getting it and uninstalled .
But within a month some comments in a USENET forum made me go back and persevere and work through that section and emerge into the larger game .
I 'm so glad I did , and prevented myself from being one of the poor souls who missed out on this great game .
I say that they missed out because shortly before entering the last level of that dungeon you come upon a scene that reflects much of what will happen for the rest of the game - an existential discussion between skeletons about what is holding them together and how they can even talk without any connective tissue or lungs .
Their self - realization is their demise , and then you return to the massive dungeon .
Soon after this , you encounter a section that is typical of the game : scenes and dialog full of humor and pathos , coupled with a frantic and furious battle that will probably take you more than one try to survive .
There are a number of things I want to mention about this game , and I will discuss many things in detail ... but first let 's take a look at the experience that has taken me 120 + hours for each of the several times I 've played through completely ( and many other partial plays ) .
I wo n't go into elaborate detail on everything I experienced , just touch upon some of the highlights ( and low - lights ) along the way .
Oh - one thing I just have to mention is the music .
When you encounter the main menu you will hear the main theme .
It is beautiful and haunting , and just the beginning of a tremendous sonic experience .
Creating a character is a fairly simple process - you select a gender and class , allocate a few skill and attribute points and off you go .
Your character choices are warrior , mage or survivor , and gender choices of either male or female , with no choice of race .
Your choice of base class gives you certain attribute bonuses and starting values , but does n't restrict you in terms of skill choices or attribute selections as you advance .
I will get into detail with the advancement system later on .
Since the second time I played I have always used a female character for a simple reason - I absolutely love the female voice acting .
The gender choices makes no difference in terms of attributes as it does in some games , so it is strictly a matter of personal choice .
Aleroth :
The opening town , where you awake after watching yourself fall in battle in the opening movie .
There are some cliched moments here - you have little to no memory , all of your equipment had to be left on the battlefield ( well , at least the explanation for that one makes sense ) , and a series of things suddenly and immediately fall to you to resolve .
Yet the quests start pretty small , and you get to start unraveling minor puzzles and mysteries , so any concerns are quickly forgotten .
Some of the voice acting here is pretty bad , but in a way that is hilarious more than anything else and feels like part of a PnP experience than many more recent games where the acting is lifeless and poorly done .
It reminds me of when I used to read books aloud to my kids : I would have a series of characters I 'd use to work through the story .
There are a number of things to do in town , but you are soon given a pressing quest that must take precedence - and one that forces you to explore the catacombs under the city .
Many good gamers have been lost to the immensity of those dungeons .
Here is a picture that shows just the first of five levels :
And honestly that does n't even begin to explain what it feels like going through the dungeons - they are physically exhausting !
You will face massive amounts of difficult enemies who are unrelenting and will need to use speed and strategy and skill to make it through .
But it is worth it ; when you arrive on the other side of the dungeon , with the main quest of the town solved and enough experience and skills to tackle some of the more difficult minor quests ( hint : explore the cemetery ) , you are back on track to discover all of the greatness the game has to offer .
The plot starts to unfold when you try to leave town and on the road to your next major stop on the main storyline , but there are plenty of side - trips along the way .
There is also plenty of combat , but the pace and intensity of combat outside of dungeons seldom approaches what you face in dungeons - which might also be impacted by the fact that outside you can more easily run away .
Regardless , as you roam the roads shaded by green eaves you will see plenty of combat , but also find plenty of nice side - stories and quests and encounters that tell you once and for all : this is a classic RPG experience you are not soon to forget .
Ferol :
This massive region will be the center of your operations for much of the game .
Within this region there are farmlands , towns , inns , dungeons , Dwarven villages , major Orc encampments , cathedrals , and more .
It also attaches to the Elven lands to the south and the large town of Verdistis to the north .
It is hard to even get my head around all of the stuff that happens here , because there are large and small quests , major plot elements , fun little encounters , plenty of nonsense and some good fun .
The main thing that struck me in Ferol was how it juxtaposed my ' completist ' ideas of finding every quest and uncovering every inch of map .
You just do n't know what you will find around the map .
In some places there is just combat , but others have ' bread crumb trails ' that lead you to uncover things , and still others that take you on small journeys off the main quest .
The lesson I quickly learned was that not walking every inch of the map meant possibly missing out on some of the really cool stuff this RPG has to offer .
A major quest section in Ferol is dealing with the Orc stronghold to the southeast .
What I love about those quests is that they accomplish multiple purposes : they forward the story in a logical way , they allow for some politics to leak into the quests as you deal with many characters with different agendas , and of course there is loads of combat and the opportunity to level up several times .
Each area of the game was rich with experiences similar to Ferol : loads of combat , loads of quests , massive areas one on top of the other , and a sense of wit and fun that makes it all worth doing !
The Dark Forest areas seem to never end .
You keep hitting unfolding regions as you go through the region - and it is easy to miss some of the fun little quests while taking it all in .
The Dwarven Halls and Mines are yet another massive area that will take you hours to work through but are rewarding in many ways .
The city of Verdistis is completely different .
There are dungeons and sewers and plenty of combat , but it is largely a quest - filled area that will have you going to and from the other areas .
This is great in a couple of ways - first it is wonderful having a city with so much going on and so many ways to role - play and find quests ; but it is also nice that rather than just having a ' dungeon section ' and a ' city section ' that you get a nice mix of combat and questing throughout .
Some of the stats from the game are impressive - there are more than 20,000 screens , 150 interactive NPC's and 100 moster types to encounter as you play .
The three characters you choose - warrior , wizard or survivor - each have their own ' Ways ' , which is made of four ' Paths ' .
Each of these have eight skills that can be taken up to five levels .
Add on the final Divine ' Way ' and you end up with 96 skills and 480 places to put skill points .
Of course , there are also the standard character attributes such as vitality , mana , strength , agility , intelligence , and constitution to chew up the five attribute points you get per level .
Here are just a few of the cool things from throughout the game world :
Cowardly Knight : you will not be a very high level character when you come across this guy cowering in a barn , seemingly paranoid but looking as if he could squash you like a bug .
He tasks you to search out the assassin .
You manage to do so , and for me it was n't too terrible - but it is the conversations that make an otherwise simple ' kill quest ' loads of fun .
Two need healing : OK , this is actually in Aleroth , but it is one of those quests that makes you work for the solution and rewards you handsomely along the way !
Plus you get abused by a human - hater as a bonus !
Shrimpo ... I just do n't know what to say other than the whole story is sad yet hilarious .
Drizzt : I like how the reference to the famed drow elf is dropped into the game without ham - handedly putting it in your face .
I like how things are seldom as simple or straight - forward as they seem : you are tasked with finding a boy , which forces you to make some tough choices about what you are willing to give up to save the child .
There are also some interesting mysteries that require you to search through several areas and complete sub-quests to finally solve .
Another thing I really liked is the reference to real - life people : how we get to listen to the poetry of Alrik Fassbauer , for example .
There is a personal feeling that there were real people making this game who were involved with the RPG fan community and took some of them into their hearts and into the game .
A couple of comments regarding technical things .
As I mentioned , the voice acting is ' interesting ' and the music is breathtaking .
I would put the overall audio as some of my favorite in any game ever .
The voices remain intimate and fun and imperfect throughout and the music ... oh , how I love the music .
As for the graphics ... let me put this simply - commercially a RPG game released in late 2002 featuring isometric combat was destined to be limited in many markets .
I do n't intend that as a criticism , simply a statement of fact .
RTS games continue to sell very well , but have had to pump up the special effects to the point where a heavy rig is required to run them just in order to remain competitive .
Isometric RPG's have become almost exclusively the purview of indie developers and small development houses outside of North America - and in that regard Divine Divinity is somewhat of an oddity , but not totally .
The game looks good but not great , somewhere between Diablo II and Sacred in terms of quality - which makes sense since it was released between those games .
But while Sacred - and most newer games - provides camera controls , Divine Divinity is more like Baldur 's Gate in terms of having a fixed camera and perspective .
When I first played the game it was before I was working with GamerDad and was doing things that were called ' game comments ' for what was essentially a Star Wars gaming fan site .
I had done one back then for Divine Divinity and wanted to share some of my thoughts from my first playthrough :
" Divine Divinity is an isometric action - RPG in the style of Diablo , but with much more depth than a hack - n - slash game like Sacred .
It is a very difficult game early on , reminiscent of Gothic II , where any move from the path can result in a quick and painful death .
Once your get a few character levels behind you , you are rewarded with an excellent RPG that features great interactions , absolutely amazing sound and music , and a really enjoyable story . "
I know I have said similar things here , but it is interesting how I threaded it into the context of my ( at the time ) relatively new love of and experience with RPG's .
" A major area where an action - RPG 's live or die is on how easily you can execute combat actions .
Divine Divinity has excellent and intuitive controls for most things , and the rest ( like repair ) are very learnable .
Once you figure out how to do things , you can just sail through the game .
More importantly , the game ( properly ) uses the Spacebar for pausing ( whereas Sacred uses it for health potions ) , so you can easily pause , switch skills or spells , then continue the battle .
Moving around , using items , and so on are all intuitive and work well .
The HUD is very flexible , and just about everything can be hidden and easily recalled .
One great element of the game is ' wear and tear ' on your weapons .
One skill you will almost need to take is Repair , which allows you to fix your own equipment ... which can be the difference between life and death in a heated battle .
With enough skill points , you can repair anything to brand - new state .
Another great gameplay element is the ability to charm equipment .
You do this by taking the Charm skill and then placing charm elements on an item that can accept them .
Items can accepts from 1 to 5 charms , and the charms are either bonuses to traits ( like strength or mana ) or to resistances ( like fire or poison ) .
The charms can range from ' minor ' to ' very large ' , with the caveat that once placed they become a permanent part of the item .
Therefore it is critical to plan before using weak charms on strong items , or strong charms on weak items . "
I really liked that weapons and armor wore out with use , and that you needed to either pay to have them repaired or take on the repair skill .
It adds a nice gameplay element , similar to hunger or the need to rest ; and it does it in a way that is n't annoying - unlike the PSP game ***** where your weapons would break every other battle !
" The game displays useful information about what each skill does , what requirements there are , and what the next rank will give you .
Some of the skills are absolutely essential to playing the game , others help in various quests , others are just suited to your particular style .
It is really through the skill system that character development shines - sure you can tailor a BattleMage using trait points ( which I did ) , but it is through judicious skill point allocation that you become a powerhouse that can take out very high level enemies while sustaining virtually no damage ( see screens for the before and after ; ) ) .
In that screen , I have a skill that lets me see the character 's properties , so I know to equip a blade with poison damage . "
I liked breaking down things into ' good , bad and braindead ' in my Dungeon Lords retrospective , so I am going to continue with that here .
Good : The Music : George Lucas said that a major ' character ' in Star Wars was John Williams awesome music .
I would say that one of the main characters in Divine Divinity is Kirill Pokrovsky 's incredible soundtrack .
The music spans several genres and styles and features exotic instrumentation as well as simple chants , and is amazingly well suited to the game and action .
There were several songs available to download for quite a while , and they have been on my iPod since the moment I grabbed them .
Pokrovsky has since released the entire soundtrack on his web site , and I recommend downloading it and checking it out .
Good : Class system .
My first time through I griped a bit about the generalist nature of things , but with each repeated playthrough I appreciate the depth more and more .
You only get three starting classes - warrior , wizard and survivor - and no limits on using skills from any path , but do n't be fooled into thinking it is not a deep system .
Attributes are calculated based on your starting class , so for example a warrior gets more health points per constitution point that either other class .
But there are no limits on the skill choices you make , so if you are playing as a warrior but take all mage skills , that is your choice .
Of course , since your warrior gains magic bonuses and mana more slowly than a wizard you are limiting yourself .
But the point is that you are free to build your character any way you choose .
Bad :
The first big dungeon .
There is little argument that this is the main reason why so many hardcore RPG fans have never played this game through or consider it a disappointment .
It nearly stopped me from getting out of Aleroth on my first time through .
Good :
The first big dungeon .
Do you hate having to kill rats and meatbugs for hours before getting into the meat of things ?
Welcome to Divine Divinity , where your dreams are answered in the form of hundreds of undead creatures bent on cutting short your quest to uncover the secrets of what is happening to you and throughout Rivellon .
Bad :
The very obvious split into ' end - game ' mode .
I really did n't mind the end game , but I have only scoured every inch of the maps once .
My first time through I learned that the only thing awaiting me was monsters to kill , so I wander around enough to grab some goodies and experience and close out the few quests available and then move along to the next area .
It is still enjoyable enough to keep you going , but with the bar set so high in the rest of the game it is a disappointment .
Bad :
Get off the screen already !
Whenever I play , occasionally during cutscenes you are stuck waiting for characters to move off screen so you can regain control of the game .
This is because rather than jerking you out of the game , the scenes are handled in - game and whatever NPC's are around end up stuck with you are the scene unfolds .
This time throuhg I was in a conversation in Verditis and after it concluded , the person was supposed to head off - screen and I would get control back .
But someone was blocking their way , so even after an hour or so of leaving the game running unattended I never got control and just had to quit and reload from the last save .
Times like that make you appreciate obsessive saving habits .
Ugly : " I 'm not exactly sure what that just did " .
By the 300th time your character flips a switch and says that you are ready to scream " I dunno - maybe it unlocked a door like every other time ? "
This is n't like having your character exclaim " how wonderful ! " or " that was nice ! " when you spend skill points , as that is much less frequent - and really is wonderful in terms of working through the game .
This is an event that is already commonplace before you leave Aleroth , and is just the familiar ' find the switch to open the door ' mechanic that gamers have been doing forever .
So why make it such a big deal ?
Good : Skill options allow for tremendous replayability ... let me speak some more on that ...
In my original ' Game Comment ' I also talked about replayability .
I said " Classic RPG's are typically some of the most replayable games out there , due to the ability to play different character types and make different choices .
Which is why I 'm surprised - and somewhat disappointed - to say that there is little replay value in Divine Divinity .
Why ?
Well , as far as I can tell , any * successful * character build will likely contain elements of Warrior , Mage and Survivor by the end of the game , meaning that you wo n't be playing a different class as much as a different ' base class ' .
That is not bad , but you are left with more subtle options for replaying with any different character .
The other reason you would replay is to choose ' the other path ' or other affiliation or whatever .
Divine Divinity plays one path , and you have no choice but to follow it , so that is removed as a replay motivation . "
At the time I took a bit of flak from some who saw things differently .
When I played again a second and third time a couple of years later I took issue with my own analysis , saying " the only thing that I disagree with in that review is the ' replayability ' .
I was disappointed that I needed to sword - train my mage , but it is an action - RPG in terms of combat .
Upon replaying twice , I have taken different routes of character development and come up to very different builds - each of which is very satisfying . " .
My issue with replayability the first time came down to really needing a core set of skills regardless of my base class , but that really ended up just being nitpicking .
Certainly you need some melee skills regardless of what character type you play , but as a mage I tended to heavily use spells along with melee ; as a warrior I just hit things really hard and they died ; and as a survivor I was quick and nimble with sneak attacks and Assassin 's Kisses .
I always tend to take some level of Charm so I could augment weapons , and consider that as a necessity .
I also generally take some levels in Repair , because I hate having to deal with lugging broken items around to get repaired at a shop , especially given the weight limit for characters .
But those concerns belie the depth of the skill system and the way that base class shapes your character as you advance .
You are given a rather stingy amount of skill points compared to the potential 480 skill levels - this means making judicious choices .
Those choices fundamentally limit your choices - you cannot become a master hacker / swordsman / fireballer who can heal and repair everything and everyone .
Just wo n't happen .
For example - I have never been much into playing as a summoner , so I leave that entire Path untouched .
Imagine that .
I like playing the walking artillary barrage ( i.e. offensive spells ) , so I bulk up on elemental magic skills as well as some of the core skills I mentioned .
And I know that I will always play it pretty much the same whenever I 'm a mage - just as my warriors will always carry big swords , not bows or axes .
That is n't a limitation of the game - it is my personal choice .
And as I replayed I have witnessed how different the game can play - I have played Aleroth probably a dozen times now , each time with a different character focus , pushing myself to play an Archer , a Summoner , and so on .
And given the amount of combat , the difference in how the game plays can be tremendous .
So I think you get my point - this game offers plenty of replayability and variety of character development .
It is interesting to me that there were n't too many items that cried out for ' good , bad & ugly ' analysis as there were for Dungeon Lords .
I guess that really reflects that there is so much good stuff throughout that I highlighted in the text that I did n't need to call out patricular items .
And there is n't that much in the way of glaring flaws - just the few I mentioned .
Some final thoughts : this retrospective has taken a while to write for several reasons .
First I had to manage my way through the fall release schedule , which was excruciating this past year .
Then I needed to deal with the fact that I had been laid off , was working a short - term contract engineering job , and was looking for a job all over the country .
Of course the fact that the game takes me over 100 hours to play factors in there somewhere , as does the actual moving and starting a new job and settling into a new house .
But the thing that strikes me is that Divine Divinity has been a constant companion for me - I played much of it in the hotel I stayed at while my family was still in Massachusetts ; the soundtrack has been in constant play on my old iPod , my PDA MP3 collection , and my new iPod .
This is a game that started out as something I bought based on some comments in a USENET forum , nearly tossed away as a Diablo clone based on the first dungeon , yet has become part of the fabric of my gaming experience through the years .
I started playing the game when I had been a hardcore PC gamer for nearly 25 years , yet it was one of the first five RPG's I bought .
That relative inexperience led me to form opinions of games in the 2002 - 2003 timeframe that have radically changed over the years , some for the better and others for the worse .
But my admiration and appreciation for Divine Divinity has only grown .
It is definitely in my ' Top 5 RPG's ' list , and my ' Top 10 Games ' list , and the soundtrack was recently on the top of my Favorite Game Soundtracks list .
Have you played Divine Divinity ?
Did you finish , or did you get stuck after that first dungeon ?
If you do n't own it , grab it for cheap while you can and give it a shot .
If you can manage the real - time combat , I promise you are in for a RPG experience that ranks right up there with the ' big names ' in RPG history ... even if the name is bad enough to have earned it the # 21 spot on GameRevolution 's 50 Worst Video Game Names of All Time .

How Design Can Save Democracy
By Richard Grefé and Jessica Friedman Hewitt
On Nov. 4 , most ballots will repeat design mistakes made in previous elections .
Many of these errors are avoidable .
This year , the United States Election Assistance Commission released ballot design guidelines .
Using these guidelines , we at AIGA developed this feature to identify common design problems and offer improvements .

New York 's Bigger Better Bottle Bill ( BBBB ) expands the existing 5 c deposit bottle bill to include bottled water , iced tea , sports drinks , juice , and other non-carbonated beverages ( with exemptions for wine , liquor , dairy products , infant formula , and certain other products ) .
The twin goals of the bill are to reduce litter and increase the amount of plastics , glass , and aluminum returned to the recycling stream .
The BBBB keeps the per bottle deposit at 5 cents , increases the handling fee paid to retailers , and requires beverage companies to transfer unclaimed deposits ( estimated at $ 100 - $ 180 + million per year ) to the state ’s Environmental Protection Fund .
Contents show ]
How the deposit system works : Edit
The handling fee and the 5c deposit are separate .
The deposit system starts not with the manufacturers of the bottle , but with the people handle the product in the bottle ( bottler , or distributer ) .
When the distributor drops off a shipment of a beverage to a retailer , the retailer pays them the deposit on the bottles they take from the distributor ( the retailer is down a nickel per bottle and the distributor is up a nickel ) .
When the customer purchases a bottle of a beverage from the retailer they pay the retailer a deposit on the bottles they purchase ( the customer is down a nickel per bottle and the retailer is even ) .
When the customer returns the empty bottles to the retailer , they receive a nickel per bottle from the retailer ( the retailer is down a nickel per bottle , the customer is even ) .
When the distributor picks up the bottles from the retailer , they pay the retailer a nickel per bottle plus the 2 cent handling fee ( BBBB would increase to 3.5 c ) per bottle .
At that point the retailer is even on the deposit and the distributor is even on the deposit .
The distributor is down the handling fee .
The distributor knew about the handling fee at the beginning , so presumably they would add 2 cents per bottle to the price they charge the retailer .
The retailer and middlemen would then base the price they charge the consumer on the price they pay the distributor for the product .
Advantages of BBBB : Edit
1.Updating the bottle bill to include non-carbonated beverages would ensure that more than 2 billion additional bottles and cans get recycled in New York each year .
In plastic bottles alone , this would save almost 600,000 barrels of crude oil and 20,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions .
Immediately after the first bottle bill passed , total litter rates dropped by 30 % , with a 70 % reduction in beverage container litter .
Today , non-carbonated beverages make up a quarter of the beverage market , and a disproportionate amount of our litter .
Litter surveys conducted by coastal cleanup volunteers ( including our own September and March cleanups ) found that two - thirds of the bottles and cans polluting New York ’s rivers and beaches are non-deposit containers , and these containers make up 20 % of the total litter volume .
Curbside programs are not effective at capturing single - serve beverage containers , because thirst - quenchers like bottled water and sports drinks are typically consumed and discarded away from home .
Only 20 % of non -deposit beverage containers end up in recycling bins .
In contrast , 80 % of deposit containers are recycled - 70 % through the bottle bill , and another 10 % through curbside programs .
2. Beverage companies are keeping an estimated $ 85 - $ 140 million a year in unclaimed deposits from bottles and cans that are not returned .
Many other states require beverage companies to return unclaimed bottle deposits to benefit the public ( Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , California , Hawaii - ask them )
The Bigger Better Bottle Bill would direct unclaimed deposits to the State Environmental Protection Fund ( EPF ) , a dedicated trust fund for New York ’s environment .
The EPF supports local recycling programs , parks , waterfront revitalization , open space , farmland preservation , and other programs to protect our land , air , and water .
Currently , New York ’s environmental funding needs far outpace existing resources .
The Bigger Better Bottle Bill could generate more than $ 180 million a year to support the Environmental Protection Fund .
3. Container deposit laws provide consistent streams of high quality materials .
Materials collected through municipal programs are more likely to be contaminated in ways that make the recycled materials less usable by manufacturers that make things out of recycled materials .
Manufacturers that use recycled materials like container deposit laws because they produce reliable streams of high quality recyclable materials .
Owens - Illinois , the largest manufacturer of glass containers , supports expansion of the bottle bill .
Drawbacks , problems : Edit
1 . The BBBB covers only beverage containers under one gallon - it will not help with other types of recycling .
It also excludes some single serve containers like milk containers .
2 . The BBBB would increase costs to distributers ( and therefore customers ) .
The beverage distributor is the party responsible for picking up the empty containers from the retailer and ultimately recycling the containers .
For each container they pay a 3.5 cent handling fee .
They have to pay to pick up beverages even if they were not purchased in the state , and must pay the costs of processing and recycling all the material .
Currently the unclaimed deposits kept by the distributers may help to buffer these costs .
Under the BBBB , these increased costs would be passed onto customers .
Response to Drawbacks : Edit
The idea behind the BBBB is not that the distributors will recoup their costs through the sale of recycled materials , but that the total costs of the life - cycle of the product are built into the price of the product .
The Sierra Club has long supported this approach to dealing with waste .
It brings market forces to product packaging and the management ( in this case recycling ) of the waste generated by that packaging .
The customer sees the total life cycle , or cradle to grave , cost of making and disposing of the product and its package when they purchase the product .
It makes it clear and they can decide if they want to spend that much money for a bottle of water , soda , or beer .
In order to lower costs , distributers and bottlers will move towards the most efficiently ( cheaply ) recycled materials .
The existing practice is to place the burden of the costs of disposal on municipalities , and therefore taxpayers .
The advantage of the BBBB approach is that it generates much higher rates of recycling ( 80 % vs 20 % - saving space in landfills and preventing incinerator emissions ) and creates an incentive for people to pick up bottles that may currently be discarded as litter .
It puts the costs of disposal solely on consumers of the product , not on every taxpayer , and this pushes the market towards more environmentally friendly solutions .
Perhaps the Bottle Bill will fare better in the new NY Senate Environment of 2009 .
It has failed in the senate every year for decades .
Shhh .
Those of you in the Lower 48 ( + Hawaii ) … be verrrry quiet … .

Who ’s yelling ?
Progressive talk show hosts and Conservative talk show hosts , Democrats and Republicans , Indpendents and Non-Partisans , Libertarians and Librarians , Lawyers and Teachers , Politicians and Political Junkies , Hockey Moms and State employees , Legislators from both sides of the aisle , and …. pretty much anyone up here who is paying attention .

We ’re such an annoyance , us damn attention - payers …
This contingent of strange political bedfellows have just about had it with Sarah Palin , John McCain and the shenanigans they are pulling with our state government , specifically the department of law .
They ’re also sick of watching the insidious influence of nasty national politics ( in the form of McCain lawyer Ed O’Callaghan ) turning once respected local journalists like former KTUU reporter , now Palin mouthpiece , Megan Stapleton into vicious attack wolves who seem to have no qualms about sinking their teeth into the necks of revered public servants and giving them a good shake .
To quote a certain presidential candidate , “ ENOUGH ! ”
So what ’s an angry mob to do ?
There have been letters to the editor , opinion pieces in the Daily News , open letters from Legislators , ceaseless clacking on the keyboards of inflamed bloggers , talk show hosts that sound like they ’re going to have cardiac arrest … but it just did n’t feel like enough .
People kept asking , what can we DO ??
Enter “ Alaskans for Truth ” , a grassroots organization that has come together to give Alaskans a venue to come and vent .

Richard Cooey , 5ft 7ins and 19 stones , had tried to escape his sentence by claiming his obesity would cause difficulty in finding suitable veins for the shots .
Cooey , 41 , who killed two Ohio university students in 1986 , lost a final appeal earlier today to the US Supreme Court .
Cooey and a then - 17 - year - old accomplice were convicted of the murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery .
The men had been throwing concrete slabs off a bridge on to a main road and one of them struck Ms Offredo 's car .
Pretending to " rescue " the women , Cooey and Clinton Dickens took the victims to a remote field .
They were subjected to a three - and - a - half - hours of rape , torture , stabbing , and fatal bludgeoning .
Cooey carved an " X " into the stomachs of both women .
Each man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows , but both were convicted of murder .
Dickens received a life sentence because of his age .
Cooey 's argument also had been rejected by a federal appeals court in Cincinnati and the Ohio Supreme Court , with both courts ruling that he missed a deadline for filing appeals .
A prisons spokeswoman said Cooey received a pre-execution exam early today and was cleared .
He walked into the death chamber at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville at at 10.15 am and was strapped onto a trolley .

" You ( expletive ) have n't paid any attention to anything I 've said in the last 22 1 / 2 years , why would anyone pay any attention to anything I 've had to say now , " Cooey said looking at the ceiling .
He made no other comment .
Cooey tapped the fingers of his left hand several times before he died .
His lawyers had argued that Cooey was 75 pounds heavier than when he went to death row - the result of prison food and 23 - hour - a - day confinement .
The last Ohio inmate to be executed was Christopher Newton - who was similar in size to Cooey - in May 2007 .
The execution team had trouble putting needles in his arm , which delayed his execution nearly two hours .
There were similar problems in the execution of another inmate in 2006 .
Hasta cuatro veces eludió el candidato republicano a la Casa Blanca , John McCain , comprometerse a reunirse con el jefe del Gobierno español , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , si se convierte en el próximo presidente de los Estados Unidos .
" Me reuniría con aquellos líderes que son nuestros amigos y que quieran trabajar con nosotros en una acción cooperativa " , respondió McCain , en una entrevista con las emisoras del grupo Unión Radio , del que forma parte la Cadena SER .
" Es lógico que tenga prudencia " , alega el jefe del Gobierno
Cuando se le insistió en la cuestión , se limitó a contestar con evasivas .
" Le puedo asegurar que estableceré relaciones más estrechas con nuestros amigos y plantaré cara a quienes quieran dañar a los Estados Unidos " , dijo una vez .
" Me reuniría con cualquier líder que tenga los mismos principios y filosofía que nosotros : derechos humanos , democracia y libertad .
Y me enfrentaré a los que no [ los tengan ] " , agregó otra .
Preguntado al respecto , Zapatero restó ayer importancia a la vaguedad de McCain .
" Es lógico que tenga la prudencia necesaria , hay un proceso electoral [ pendiente ] " , respondió .
" Es verdad que no he tenido un encuentro formal con el presidente [ George W. ] Bush " , insistió Zapatero , aludiendo a la anomalía que supone la inexistencia de un encuentro al máximo nivel entre ambos gobiernos , " pero [ esto ] no ha impedido el trabajo que hemos realizado " .
Y añadió que trabajará con la nueva Administración estadounidense " tenga el color que tenga " y lo hará " con voluntad constructiva y lealtad , como corresponde a países que se tienen por socios " .
Estas declaraciones de McCain contrastan con las que hizo a EL PAÍS en abril pasado , cuando dijo que " es el momento de dejar atrás discrepancias con España " .
Y añadió : " Me gustaría que [ el presidente Zapatero ] visitara Estados Unidos " .
En medios diplomáticos se atribuía ayer la actitud del candidato republicano a una confusión , pues la entrevista se centraba en las relaciones con Latinoamérica y la periodista tuvo que recordarle que España es un país europeo cuando insistió en poner como ejemplo a México .
En el mejor de los casos evidenciaría su ignorancia respecto a Zapatero .
La celebración de una entrevista entre los dos presidentes es una prioridad de la diplomacia española .
Se da por descontado que la cita no tendrá lugar hasta bien avanzado 2009 , pues el ganador de las elecciones de noviembre tomará posesión en enero y deberá formar su equipo y atender otros problemas más urgentes que ocuparse de España .
Pero se quiere que Zapatero vaya a Washington antes de que , en el primer semestre de 2010 , el nuevo inquilino de la Casa Blanca asista en España a la cumbre Unión Europea - EE UU .
La semana que viene acudirá Zapatero a Nueva York para la Asamblea General de la ONU , pero lo máximo que se espera es algún contacto del ministro Miguel Ángel Moratinos con su homóloga , Condoleezza Rice .
Craig Willbanks wants you to know that John McCain - - former prisoner of war , current senator , White House aspirant -- is a traitor , a liar and a wimp .
Willbanks and McCain have never met .
The senator probably has never heard of this hunched - over , soft - spoken fellow who served two tours of duty in Vietnam as an Army combat engineer and now lives in a run-down apartment in Mesa .
Craig Willbanks is obsessed with John McCain , and he is not alone .
He is part of a small , nationwide movement hell - bent on convincing the rest of us that in spite of glowing accounts of McCain 's valor as a POW , Arizona 's senior senator betrayed his country by collaborating with the North Vietnamese , and has been trying to cover up that fact ever since .
Willbanks ' mission : " Do n't get him elected .
Cannot have . . . a traitor in the top position , giving away secrets of the United States . "
To that end , Willbanks spends virtually all his free time retyping any Arizona Republic articles that portray the senator in an unflattering light .
He intends to post them on the Web , where they 'll join a pile of documents that , Willbanks insists , proves McCain collaborated with the Communists during his five years as a POW .
Willbanks has a paying job , as a bus driver for the City of Mesa .
But he was recently reassigned to drive an adult day - care van .
He 's excited about it ; the older people will want to talk about war history , and he can give them packets of information he keeps on McCain .
He 's already given out 15 or so .
" I give them a packet , and they come back and say , ' Well , that goddamn traitor , ' " he says .
The " documents " include an article McCain wrote for U.S. News & World Report in 1973 , upon his release from prison camp .
In the article , McCain admits that he -- like many POWs -- confessed to war crimes under physical and emotional duress .
There 's also a transcript of an interview POW McCain did for French television , a story about McCain that appeared in a Vietnamese newspaper , and an account of an interview of McCain by a Spanish psychiatrist .
Willbanks got these documents from retired Army Colonel Earl Hopper Sr. and his wife , Patty , who run a POW / MIA research organization from their home in Glendale .
The Hoppers ' goal is to force the U.S. government to produce a full accounting of the more than 2,000 men whose bodies have not been recovered from the Vietnam War .
Among those men is Earl Hopper Jr. , the colonel 's eldest son .
Willbanks and the Hoppers believe that live American soldiers were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War , and that McCain is part of the conspiracy to cover it up .
McCain has long contended that there is no proof that live Americans remain in Southeast Asia .
The Hoppers have gathered a motley crew of local Vietnam veterans and POW / MIA family members to assist in their crusade against McCain , and have hooked up with like - minded vets and POW kin across the country .
One foot soldier for the cause is Roy Kerr , a veteran from Goodyear who researches McCain 's business interests full - time .
Around New Year 's , Kerr hand - delivered anti-McCain packets to syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington , U.S. Representative Henry Hyde and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who were in town for " The Weekend , " a conservative confab at the Arizona Biltmore resort .
Kerr packaged the documents in manila envelopes labeled " Veterans for McCain , " figuring no one would open a package that said " Veterans Against McCain . "
Kerr says he has driven to McCain 's home at night to drop copies of anti-McCain literature and " Dump McCain " stickers over the senator 's fence .
And he 's a frequent caller to radio talk shows when McCain is a guest .
He proudly provides taped copies of these interviews , bragging that he made the senator stutter .
( Barely , if at all . )
He does all of this , he says , " to keep myself busy and appease my dislike for McCain . "
And then there 's Ted Sampley , who publishes a newspaper out of Kinston , North Carolina , called U.S. Veteran Dispatch .
Sampley calls McCain the " Manchurian Candidate , " maintaining that the Vietnamese brainwashed McCain , then sent him home to do their bidding -- which , to Sampley 's way of thinking , explains why McCain was instrumental in the nation 's normalization of relations with Vietnam .
The POW / MIA zealots are a dwindling subculture .
Mainstream society tends to dismiss the Willbankses , Hoppers and Kerrs as sad footnotes to an ugly chapter in American history .
Stanley Kutler , professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and editor of The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War , calls the behavior of these people " Sick .
If it were n't so sick , it would be laughable .
These are not nice people .
They are the other side in an ongoing uncivil Civil War in America .
They would refight Vietnam , criminalize abortion , make public school prayer mandatory , prove that Hillary bumped off Vince Foster , and indict Teddy Kennedy for Chappaquiddick .
They are uncivil and intolerant of any views or information they do not share . "
Kutler examined the Hoppers ' packet , which , along with the " documents , " includes political cartoons lampooning McCain , and accounts of testy exchanges between McCain and POW / MIA activists .
Aubrey Immelman , associate professor of psychology at St. John 's University and the College of St. Benedict in Minnesota , looked at the anti-McCain propaganda , too , and observes :
" Once a person becomes as committed to a cause as some of these individuals , it becomes difficult to let go , and the lines between activism , crusade and obsession -- and perhaps even paranoia -- become increasingly blurred . "
Is John McCain a hero or a traitor ?
What a question .
In post -Monica politics , there are n't many taboos .
Enter the presidential sweepstakes , and it 's open season on every detail of your life .
Everything except the hero status of a man who endured a broken leg , two broken arms and five and a half years in North Vietnamese prison camps .
Even McCain foes who carp about his youthful philandering , his grandstanding , his political flip - flopping , his membership in the Keating Five , his wife 's drug addiction , do n't question his war heroism .
So the Earl Hoppers of the world are dismissed as crazies , wackos , extremists -- and perhaps it 's a deserved label .
Then again , to paraphrase another Arizona senator : Extremism in defense of a lost loved one is no vice .
Who could n't imagine themselves single - mindedly demanding the truth about a vanished son or husband ?
McCain says he understands .
" Those people who are family members , at least I have -- I hope I feel - - sympathy and some understanding for their zealotry on this issue , " McCain tells New Times .
" If I had a brother or a son who was in this situation , then clearly I think I would feel very strongly about it . "
Not every POW / MIA activist despises John McCain , and among those who do , there are gradations of disgust .
Many activists do n't like the way McCain has behaved since he was freed .
They abhor his support for the normalization of relations with Vietnam , his apparent lack of respect for them and their cause .
They say he has unfairly attacked those he says prey on the family members by selling them false hopes in the form of faked pictures of their loved ones , even though in some cases McCain has been proved right .
And most of all , the activists feel McCain has used his POW status to spring up the political ranks , with his eye on the presidential prize .
But a few have let their ire take them even farther .
A handful of POW / MIA activists are critical of McCain 's behavior during the war .
They believe that John McCain did not return from Vietnam a hero .
They say his own clumsiness caused his limbs to be broken as he ejected from his plummeting warplane .
They claim McCain was never tortured in prison .
They accuse him of collaborating with not only the North Vietnamese but with Communists in the Soviet Union and Cuba .
They quote unnamed sources who say McCain had a wife and children in Vietnam .
Some even claim he was broken and brainwashed by the Communists and then returned to the U.S. to amass political power and carry out the Reds ' wishes .
Why else , they ask , would McCain support normalization ?
Why else would he have embraced onetime North Vietnamese Colonel Bui Tin during hearings into POW / MIA issues ?
( They circulate a photo of that traitorous act as evidence . )
Why else would the North Vietnamese have erected a monument at the lake in Hanoi where he was shot down in 1967 ?
All these claims disintegrate upon close inspection -- they cannot be proved or disproved -- with one tenuous exception : two former POWs who say they were senior officers at a camp where McCain claims to have been tortured tell New Times they knew of no such torture during that time at that camp .
McCain has denied that he ever reported to these men .
Short of crossing the Pacific to interview McCain 's captors , there is no way to be certain of what he endured .
McCain says that much of his time was spent in solitary confinement .
He did communicate through his cell walls , by tapping messages to other prisoners , but only McCain knows exactly what happened .
Mark Salter , McCain 's chief of staff , says the senator has decided to ignore his POW / MIA detractors and their charges .
" Nobody believes these idiots .
They 're a bunch of jerks .
Forget them , " Salter says .
But as McCain 's political star rises , so do the voices of his naysayers .
Someone really must try to answer the question .
Is John McCain a hero or a traitor ?
To say that Earl and Patty Hopper devote all of their waking hours to the POW / MIA issue would be just short of an overstatement .
They travel the country in an RV , visiting other POW / MIA - niks , attending conferences , badgering government officials for more information about Earl Jr .
Earl Hopper Jr.'s Phantom II disappeared January 10 , 1968 , near the North Vietnam / Laos border .
Over the years , Earl Sr. has had some tantalizing clues as to his son's fate , but nothing conclusive .
Hopper , 77 , perseveres .
He was a founding member of the National League of Families , a group created in the late Sixties that agitated to bring POWs home .
When President Nixon announced that all live POWs had been returned to the U.S. , Earl Hopper Sr. and other relatives of unaccounted - for servicemen refused to believe him .
They have kept the issue alive all these years , though their efforts have been nearly fruitless .
Since 1973 , only one live POW has returned to the U.S. -- perhaps .
A Marine private named Bobby Garwood came home in 1978 , claiming he was a POW .
His story is widely disputed ; many believe he was a defector .
Today , the United States spends $ 55 million each year in an effort to resolve questions of unaccounted - for soldiers .
The unspoken reality is that the government is looking for bodies , not captives ; no one wants to say they know there is no one left alive .
To date , remains of about 500 of the 2,587 POW / MIAs unaccounted for after the Vietnam War have been recovered .
U.S. officials are trying to convince Hopper that they 've found his son's remains .
Costly expeditions into the jungle have yielded an engine plate with the serial number from Earl Jr. 's plane , some bone fragments and teeth .
Even if DNA tests show the remains to be Earl Jr.'s , it 's unlikely that Earl Sr. will believe it .
After all , the movement to rescue POW / MIAs has become his life .
He met Patty through the movement , and they run a nonprofit POW / MIA research organization called Task Force Omega Incorporated out of their Glendale home .
" There are not many people out there that are that active in the POW issue anymore , " Earl Hopper Sr. acknowledges .
" Nor that many involved in anti-McCain .
I know that people we talk to across the country , to include Washington , D.C. , we seldom , seldom hear of anyone that likes McCain .
We have had people who question what we would say or do about McCain , but after we showed them the documents that we have , then they would see why we feel that way . "
On a recent afternoon , Earl and Patty Hopper sat in matching rockers in the den of their Glendale home , and enumerated John McCain 's wartime sins :
* McCain 's broken arms and leg were his own fault .
The Hoppers have no documentation of this -- they have deduced it .
" When he bailed out of his jet , he was not in the right attitude , and that 's how his arms and leg got broken , because he screwed up when he ejected , " Earl says .
Adds Patty , " He did n't have his arms tucked in and his legs tucked together and back . "
* McCain accepted special favors .
For proof , the Hoppers offer the U.S. News article and interviews McCain granted the French , Spanish and Vietnamese .
" The other POWs did not get the medical treatment that McCain got , " Earl says .
" Shortly after he was shot down , as you know , he was in a military hospital that was reserved for North Vietnamese officers .
Clean sheets , nice soft bed , cast on his arm .
" Other POWs who came into the system like that had to endure broken bones sitting or lying in a cell .
Many of them had broken backs , had no treatment whatsoever .
If they gave them any treatment , it would be an aspirin . "
* McCain was never tortured .
Patty : " There are a lot of little nuances , dealing with John McCain .
He claims that he was tortured . . . or he implies it .
That 's a lie . "
The Hoppers have located two former POWs who claim they were senior ranking officers at the time McCain says he was tortured in solitary confinement .
Ted Guy and Gordon " Swede " Larson both tell New Times that while they could not guarantee that McCain was not physically harmed , they doubted it .
" Between the two of us , it 's our belief , and to the best of our knowledge , that no prisoner was beaten or harmed physically in that camp [ known as " The Plantation " ] , " Larson says . " . . .
My only contention with the McCain deal is that while he was at The Plantation , to the best of my knowledge and Ted 's knowledge , he was not physically abused in any way .
No one was in that camp .
It was the camp that people were released from . "
* McCain was not singled out and offered early release .
Patty : " Whether he was actually sat down by the Vietnamese and singled out and said would you like to go home early and having him say no --"
Earl : " No proof of that . "
Patty : " No. Only John 's mouth . "
* John McCain is no hero .
" I do n't consider John McCain a hero , " Earl says .
" No .
No way .
That 's propaganda that 's put out by his people .
And to prove that John 's a fraud and a liar , is that he 's done nothing to stop that propaganda from coming out .
If he was really the man that he should be , he would come out and say , ' Look , that did n't happen to me .
I was n't that ill .
I got special treatment . ' "
Patty : " '-- and I accepted special treatment , because I was afraid not to . ' "
Orson Swindle , who slept next to John McCain for more than a year in the Hanoi Hilton , happened upon Craig Willbanks ' handiwork on the Web recently .
He was horrified .
He disagrees with just about everything that comes out of the Hoppers ' mouths .
As to the suggestion that McCain was responsible for his own broken bones , Swindle says , " The man 's airplane . . . was turning ass over teakettle .
Getting in the right position is sometimes damn difficult .
In his case , he was missing the wing of an airplane and the airplane was tumbling .
For anybody to make that statement , they display their ignorance , and I do n't care who they are . "
The date was October 26 , 1967 .
I was on my 23rd mission , flying right over the heart of Hanoi in a dive at about 4,500 feet , when a Russian missile the size of a telephone pole came up -- the sky was full of them -- and blew the right wing off my Skyhawk dive bomber .
It went into an introverted , almost straight - down spin .
I pulled the ejection handle , and was knocked unconscious by the force of the ejection -- the air speed was about 500 knots .
. . .
I regained consciousness just before I landed by parachute in a lake right in the center of Hanoi , one they called the Western Lake .
My helmet and my oxygen mask had been blown off .
I hit the water and sank to the bottom .
I think the lake is about 15 feet deep , maybe 20 .
I kicked off the bottom .
I did not feel any pain at the time , and was able to rise to the surface .
I took a breath of air and started sinking again .
Of course , I was wearing 50 pounds , at least , of equipment and gear .
I went down and managed to kick up to the surface once more .
I could n't understand why I could n't use my right leg or my arm .
I was in a dazed condition .
I went up to the top again and sank back down .
This time I could n't get back to the surface .
I was wearing an inflatable life - preserver - type thing that looked like water wings .
I reached down with my mouth and got the toggle between my teeth and inflated the preserver and finally floated to the top .
The preceding passage - - a firsthand account titled " How the POWs Fought Back " -- appeared in the May 14 , 1973 , edition of U.S. News & World Report , two months after Navy Lieutenant Commander John Sidney McCain III and 590 other POWs returned to the United States as part of Operation Homecoming .
McCain 's official debriefing , on file at the Library of Congress , contains an almost identical description of his downing .
Several books include similar accounts .
At the time McCain 's jet was blasted from the air , his father was commander in chief of U.S. naval forces in Europe .
His grandfather had also been a Navy admiral .
Yet young John McCain was legendary not for his military acumen but for his reputation as a troublemaker and a ladies ' man .
He had graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy , and earned nicknames such as " McNasty . "
The Vietnamese who fished him out of Truc Bach Lake knew none of that , of course -- only that they 'd found an American .
As was customary , they hauled the soldier to shore and stripped him to his underwear .
A crowd of hecklers gathered .
Again , from U.S. News :
When they had most of my clothes off , I felt a twinge in my right knee .
I sat up and looked at it , and my right foot was resting next to my left knee , just in a 90 - degree position .
I said , " My God -- my leg ! "
That seemed to enrage them - - I do n't know why .
One of them slammed a rifle butt down on my shoulder , and smashed it pretty badly .
Another stuck a bayonet in my foot .
. . .
A woman came over and propped me up and held a cup of tea to my lips , and some photographers took pictures .
This quieted the crowd down quite a bit .
Pretty soon , they put me on a stretcher , lifted it onto a truck , and took me to Hanoi 's main prison .
The facility was Hoa Lo , dubbed the " Hanoi Hilton " by the American prisoners .
McCain says he lapsed in and out of consciousness for a few days .
He had broken his right femur just above the knee , his right arm in three places , and his left arm .
From the first day , he says , he was told he would not receive medical treatment unless he revealed military secrets .
He says he offered nothing but his name , rank and serial number .
On what McCain believes was his fourth day in captivity , two guards came into his cell and pulled back his blanket .
I looked at my knee .
It was about the size , shape and color of a football .
I remembered that when I was a flying instructor a fellow had ejected from his plane and broken his thigh .
He had gone into shock , the blood had pooled in his leg , and he died , which came as quite a shock to us - - a man dying of a broken leg .
Then I realized that a very similar thing was happening to me .
When I saw it , I said to the guard , " O.K. , get the officer . "
McCain agreed to give military information in exchange for a trip to the hospital , but he was told it was too late .
Then , however , the Vietnamese discovered they were holding the " crown prince " -- the admiral 's son .
McCain says he confirmed that his father was the " big admiral " and was taken to a hospital .
He recalled that his hospital room was filthy and he was fed only a few spoonfuls of soup a day and was never washed .
Crude attempts were made to set McCain 's bones , sans painkillers .
An article about McCain appeared in the newspaper Nhan Dan ( The People ) in Hanoi on November 9 , 1967 .
The translation begins :
That piratical pilot had a pretty good - looking face .
He was reasonably fat .
What was worth our attention was that his hair had turned almost completely white although he was only 31 .
He himself drew our attention to that fact right at the beginning of the interrogation .
Was it meant to show his " nobility " of some sort ?
Sometimes this U.S. Navy lieutenant commander still showed his boastful behavior tastelessly that way .
According to the article , McCain described his crash and offered a detailed accounting of the military briefing that preceded it .
Asked for his opinion of the North Vietnamese people , Nhan Dan quoted McCain as saying : " It is evident that the spirit of the Vietnamese people is very high , you are very powerful and to be afraid of .
Your country is very small , and yet it is fighting the biggest and most powerful one .
I may say this is the best example I can say about the determination of the Vietnamese people . "
McCain was also interviewed by a French television crew ( whom he says he later learned were Communists ) .
He says his Vietnamese captors moved him to a clean bed with white sheets for the occasion .
The date of the interview , conducted by a journalist named François Chalais , is unknown .
It aired in France in December 1967 .
From a U.S. Department of Defense transcript of the broadcast :
My meeting with John Sidney McCain was certainly one of those meetings which will affect me most profoundly for the rest of my life .
. . .
In a weak voice , he relates his story to me : " I was carrying out a bombing mission , my 23rd raid , over Hanoi .
It was then that I was hit .
I wanted to eject but while doing so I broke both arms and my right leg .
Unconscious I fell in a lake .
Some Vietnamese jumped into the water and pulled me out .
Later I learned there must have been about 12 of them .
They immediately took me to a hospital , in a condition two inches away from death .
A doctor operated on my thigh .
Others at the same time dealt with my arms . "
" How are you treated here ? "
" Very well .
Everybody is very nice to me . "
" How is the food ? "
He smiles feebly .
Obviously , the least reaction hurts him .
" This is n't Paris , but it is alright . "
" Do you have something to read ? "
" They have suggested that I read , but my hands are unable to hold even a newspaper . "
His cigarette has gone out .
He talks to me about his wife who lives in Jacksonville , Florida , and about his three children .
And now he addresses his family : " I know that this is going to turn out well .
I hope that I will see you soon .
. . . "
After the interview , McCain says he was returned to his squalid room .
Six weeks later , McCain was sent to another Hanoi prison , The Plantation , and put in a room with two Air Force officers , George E. " Bud " Day and Norris Overly .
In his memoir , Return With Honor , published in 1989 , Day recalls the arrival of the white - haired skeleton :
John was in an immense body cast which started at buttock level and extended all the way over his shoulder .
His right arm was propped up , sticking out of the cast like a broomstick protruding from a snowman .
It angled crazily .
One did not have to be a doctor to recognize another butcher job .
. . .
He could not wash , relieve himself , or do any normal function of life without assistance .
Without someone to feed him , he was a dead man .
John 's head and body were filthy .
Food particles and juices covered his chin , neck , and sideburns .
He had not been cleaned after bowel movements .
These things were of no concern to him .
He was " on cloud nine " to have roommates .
We were the first Americans he had talked to .
Day was n't in much better shape than McCain .
He 'd been shot down and captured .
He escaped and was recaptured .
He underwent excruciating rope torture and was beaten repeatedly .
Overly nursed McCain and Day .
The men were relatively well - treated at The Plantation , which was designated the " show camp " for camera crews and visiting dignitaries .
From John G. Hubbell 's POW : A Definitive History of the American Prisoner of War Experience in Vietnam , 1964 - 1973 :
An endless parade of dignitaries came to the cell , mostly to stare at McCain , the " crown prince . "
The visitors were mostly older men .
They wore civilian clothing , but prison staff members attested to their exalted rank by bowing deeply to them as they came and went .
These dignitaries would look upon the young son of an American admiral with something close to awe .
. . .
As Christmas approached , [ Bud ]
Day grew uneasy .
He could not understand the comparatively good treatment , could not reconcile it with the horrors of the recent past .
It seemed clear the enemy was trying to curry favor with McCain .
What would they want in return :
And what did it have to do with him ?
And with Overly ?
Day got an answer in February 1968 , when Overly and two other POWs accepted early release , a move reviled by their fellow prisoners , who had vowed to go home in the order in which they had been imprisoned .
Day and McCain remained together for another month , until McCain was able to walk .
Then McCain lived in solitary confinement for two years .
As far as this business of solitary confinement goes -- the most important thing for survival is communication with someone , even if it 's only a wave or a wink , a tap on the wall , or to have a guy put his thumb up .
-- John McCain ,
" How the POWs Fought Back , "
U.S. News & World Report
McCain became a prolific communicator , tapping and receiving messages from other prisoners in elaborate code .
McCain 's code name was " Crip , " for cripple , because he walked with a limp .
One of McCain 's closest friends was his neighbor at the beginning of his solitary confinement , Lieutenant Colonel Robert Craner .
Craner died during the Eighties , but part of his story is recorded in the 1973 book They Would n't Let Us Die : The Prisoners of War Tell Their Story by Stephen Rowan .
In a Q - and - A format with Rowan , Craner said :
McCain and I leaned on each other a great deal .
We were separated by about 18 inches of brick , and I never saw the guy for the longest time .
. . .
My world had shrunk to a point where the figures in my dreams were myself , the guards , and a voice -- and that was McCain .
I did n't know what he looked like , so I could not visualize him in my dreams .
Yet he was a very vital part of my dreams , because he became the guy -- the only guy -- I turned to , for a period of about two years .
We got to know each other , more intimately , I 'm sure , than I will ever know my wife .
We opened up and talked about damn near everything , besides our immediate problems -- past life , and all the family things we never would have talked to anybody about .
We derived a great deal of strength from this .
Until the summer of 1968 , McCain 's lot had not been so bad , he wrote in U.S. News .
His captors interrogated him frequently , threatening to try him for war crimes , but did not torture him .
That changed in June 1968 , when McCain was asked if he wanted to go home .
I was astonished , and I tell you frankly that I said that I would have to think about it .
I went back to my room , and I thought about it for a long time .
At this time I did not have communication with the camp senior ranking officer , so I could get no advice .
I was worried whether I could stay alive or not , because I was in rather bad condition .
I had been hit with a severe case of dysentery , which kept on for about a year and a half .
I was losing weight again .
Ultimately , McCain says , he adhered to Code of Conduct 's proscription that prisoners are not to accept special favors .
On the morning of July 4 , 1968 -- the day McCain 's father was named commander in chief of U.S. Naval forces in the Pacific -- the prisoner was taken to the " Quiz Room " and put before two notorious interrogators , nicknamed " The Rabbit " and " The Cat . "
They wanted his final answer :
Would he go home ?
Again , the answer was no .
With this , " The Cat , " who was sitting there with a pile of papers in front of him and a pen in his hand , broke the pen in two .
Ink spurted all over .
He stood up , kicked the chair over behind him , and said , " They taught you too well .
. . . " " The Rabbit " said , " Now , McCain , it will be very bad for you .
Go back to your room . "
Nothing happened for weeks .
Then one day McCain was taken to the camp commander , " Slopehead , " who told him , " You have violated all the camp regulations .
You 're a black criminal .
You must confess your crimes . "
McCain refused .
Slopehead asked why he was disrespectful of the guards .
I answered , " Because the guards treat me like an animal . "
When I said that , the guards , who were all in the room -- about 10 of them - - really laid into me .
They bounced me from pillar to post , kicking and laughing and scratching .
After a few hours of that , ropes were put on me and I sat that night bound with ropes .
. . .
For the next four days , I was beaten every two or three hours by different guards .
My left arm was broken again and my ribs were cracked .
After four days , McCain gave in .
He signed a confession admitting to war crimes .
He was left alone for two weeks .
During that time , he says , he regained some strength and was able to refuse the next demand for a confession .
A September 13 , 1968 , cable from Averell Harriman , U.S. ambassador - at - large , to the State Department confirmed that McCain 's captors had offered him early release , but that he had refused .
The cable reported that , according to the Vietnamese , " Commander McCain feared that if he was released before the war is over , President [ Lyndon ] Johnson might ' cause difficulties ' for his father because people will wonder if McCain had been brainwashed . "
Harriman speculated that instead , McCain was abiding by the Code of Conduct .
With the exception of the North Vietnamese , Bob Craner was the only apparent witness -- albeit through a wall - - to McCain 's ordeal during this time .
Craner told Stephen Rowan :
. . .
At the time we [ McCain and Craner ] were fairly effectively cut off from the remainder of the camp , except for sporadic contact , and so we relied on each other .
He asked for what advice I could offer on the topic , after he came back from his little session .
I 'm afraid I did n't have a heck of a lot to offer .
. . .
They lowered the boom on him .
But he stuck with that decision [ to refuse early release ] , and I am immensely proud of him for that .
Rowan :
If they had made an all - out effort , could they have forced him to go home ?
Craner :
There 's little doubt in my mind that they could have tortured him right out of the country , but I 'm sure that 's not what they had in mind .
McCain 's punishment sessions continued , according to his U.S. News piece .
In October 1968 , he " met " another prisoner , Ernest Brace , a civilian , through the wall of his cell .
In his 1988 memoir of the war , A Code to Keep , Brace recalls of McCain :
He continued to get pressure to produce propaganda tapes or make appearances to peace delegations .
Some days he would tell me , through the wall , not to worry if he was n't in his room for a while .
He was refusing , he said , to appear before another peace delegation , and he would probably be spending some time in the punishment room on the other side of the courtyard .
In May 1969 , U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird admonished the North Vietnamese to treat American prisoners humanely , and allow inspections of the camps by impartial observers .
The next month , the Vietnamese released a broadcast quoting McCain saying he had received " very good medical treatment . "
Laird denounced the recording as " contrived . "
In October 1969 , the torture sessions ended abruptly , McCain wrote .
McCain and the others would later learn this was because word of his harsh treatment had gotten back to the U.S. via prisoners who had taken early release .
Three months later , McCain and his neighbor , Ernest Brace , were among a group of POWs moved to the Hanoi Hilton , as punishment for communicating with fellow prisoners .
Brace wrote :
On the night of December 9 [ 1969 ] my door was jerked open , and the guard told me to get ready to move .
. . .
" You are in bad trouble for communicating , " he told me .
" You are being taken to a harsher place . "
Blindfolded , I was placed in the back of a truck with some soldiers and other prisoners .
The vehicle had rolled out of the prison grounds and was heading through the Hanoi streets when I felt someone tapping a message on my thigh .
" Hi , " said the message .
" I John McCain .
Who U ? "
With tears forming in my eyes behind the blindfold , I worked my hand around to grasp my neighbor 's hand , and squeezed out an answer .
" EB here . "
John McCain and Ernie Brace landed in cells in " Golden Nugget , " a section of " Little Vegas , " as the prisoners called that area of the Hanoi Hilton .
McCain was asked to meet with a " visitor " who turned out to be Dr. Fernando Barral , a Spanish psychiatrist living in Cuba .
The interview took place at the Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations in Hanoi .
Barral describes the setting , which included a spread of oranges , cakes , coffee and cigarettes .
An account of Barral 's interview with McCain was published in the Cuban periodical Granma on January 24 , 1970 .
Barral and McCain talked about a variety of subjects , according to Granma .
McCain praised his treatment by the North Vietnamese , spoke of his wife and of his family : " One of my forebears was a colonel in Washington 's independent forces .
Another was a general in the war of secession .
Thus it was natural for me to follow a military career .
Of course my father was not always an admiral ; during World War II he was commander of a submarine .
He has been in the navy since 1927 and has been an admiral since 1965 .
He holds the highest rank in the navy .
If I had not been downed , I would have become an admiral at an earlier age than my father . "
Barral also reported that McCain talked of his education and military training , and that he had once dreamed of becoming an astronaut .
Barral 's psychiatric analysis of " the personality of the prisoner who is responsible for many criminal bombings of the people " :
He showed himself to be intellectually alert during the interview .
From a morale point of view he is not in traumatic shock .
He is neither dejected nor depressed .
He was able to be sarcastic , and even humorous , indicative of psychic equilibrium .
From the moral and ideological point of view he showed us he is an insensitive individual without human depth , who does not show the slightest concern , who does not appear to have thought about the criminal acts he committed against a population from the absolute impunity of his airplane , and that nevertheless those people saved his life , fed him , and looked after his health , and he is now healthy and strong .
I believe that he has bombed densely populated places for sport .
I noted that he was hardened , that he spoke of banal things as if he were at a cocktail party .
McCain became angry when a photographer showed up to snap some pictures of the meeting , and to the chagrin of his captors , said he would never meet with " visitors " again .
In the U.S. News piece , McCain wrote that because of his repeated refusals , he was forced to sit on a stool for three days and three nights .
Although he got a cellmate in March 1970 , by early June he was yanked away from other Americans entirely and relocated to a remote room dubbed " Calcutta . "
It was 6 feet by 2 feet with no ventilation in it , and it was very , very hot .
During the summer I suffered from heat prostration a couple or three times , and dysentery .
I was very ill .
Washing facilities were nonexistent .
My food was cut down to about half rations .
Sometimes I 'd go for a day or so without eating .
All during this time I was taken out to interrogation and pressured to see the antiwar people .
I refused .
By late December 1970 , McCain was moved to a section of the Hanoi Hilton called " Camp Unity , " where for the first time he was in a large cell with dozens of other prisoners .
In March 1971 , it was back to solitary , this time at another camp called " Skid Row . "
November 1971 , back to the Hanoi Hilton , and a room of about 40 POWs .
Aside from bad situations now and then , 1971 and 1972 was a sort of coasting period .
The reason why you see our men in such good condition today is that the food and everything generally improved .
For example , in late '69 I was down to 105 , 110 pounds , boils all over me , suffering dysentery .
We started getting packages with vitamins in them -- about one package a year .
We were able to exercise quite a bit in our rooms and managed to get back in a lot better health .
My health has improved radically .
In fact , I think I 'm in better physical shape than I was when I got shot down .
In January 1973 , following intense U.S. bombing of Hanoi , as the end of the war neared , McCain was moved again to The Plantation .
On March 15 , he boarded a plane home , as part of Operation Homecoming .
He concluded his U.S. News piece :
I had a lot of time to think over there , and came to the conclusion that one of the most important things in life -- along with a man 's family -- is to make some contribution to his country .
John McCain was free again , but his poorly mended bones required extensive surgery and ultimately grounded him to a desk job .
Yet as one career ended , another began .
In 1977 , McCain was assigned to be the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate - - a perfect gig for a guy intrigued by politics .
It was an easy transition for McCain , who had been raised amid dignitaries .
His office quickly became the party spot on the Hill .
But from the start , POW / MIA - niks took a dim view of McCain .
Ann Mills Griffiths , whose brother disappeared in Vietnam , became director of the National League of Families in 1978 .
She recalls lobbying Congress with McCain and his counterpart in the House of Representatives , Red McDaniel , another returned POW .
Griffiths and her group wanted a clear accounting -- dead or alive -- of the Vietnam - era POW / MIAs .
" Clearly , I got the impression that both of them [ McCain and McDaniel ] would kind of go behind what I was saying and say , ' Look , this is really good that the families are trying to get answers and it's very patriotic and all , but it 's unrealistic , ' " Griffiths recalls .
" In other words , kind of , it can't be accomplished , and if anybody had been left there , we would have known it .
. . .
It was sort of condescending . "
If that was McDaniel 's attitude , he had a change of heart .
He now runs the American Defense Institute , an organization devoted to the live POW / MIA issue .
Susan Katz Keating , a Washington Times reporter who wrote a book in 1994 called Prisoners of Hope : Exploiting the POW / MIA Myth in America , labels McDaniel a " Gray Flannel Rambo . "
( He declined to comment for this story when he heard it was about McCain , saying he wanted to " take the high road . " )
McCain apparently never wavered from his skepticism .
In fact , he did n't show much interest in the POW / MIA issue for many years -- a point the POW / MIA activists claim proves his disloyalty .
McCain 's first marriage ended in 1980 , and he quickly remarried .
He retired from the Navy in 1981 , and McCain and his new bride , Cindy Hensley , relocated to her home state , Arizona , and prepared his first congressional bid .
McCain was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 .
" He was trying to focus on his job as a congressman and trying to represent the people of Arizona , " says Ann Mills Griffiths , who is more sympathetic to McCain than radical activists .
" Just because he was a POW did n't mean that was all he could focus on .
So I think there was probably disappointment by some people at that point that he was n't taking a more active leadership role .
At the same time , he was very quietly supporting a lot of [ legislative ] initiatives that we were doing in those days . "
Earl Hopper Sr. sees it differently .
He recalls a meeting at the new congressman 's Mesa field office .
Hopper brought along some refugee reports and other purported live - sighting materials , but says McCain was n't interested .
" John was very much on the defensive at that time , and argumentative , defending the intelligence agencies and their methods of interrogating the refugees and so forth , " Hopper recalls .
" He did n't like what I was saying , I did n't like what he was saying , so we just parted .
" After that , I did n't have too much to do with John McCain . "
But that was far from the end of John McCain 's dealings with POW / MIA activists .
He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , and in 1991 Congress held hearings into the POW / MIA issue , examining World War II , the Korean War , the Vietnam War and the Cold War .
Although the Vietnam POW / MIA activism is by far the most vibrant , there are still questions about the fate of prisoners and MIAs who fought in the other wars .
Many POW / MIA activists did not welcome the hearings .
Ann Mills Griffiths , director of the National League of Families , believes the hearings were designed to bury the issue once and for all .
" What it did was tie up assets and resources for a very long time , cause great divisiveness , give a forum to irresponsibility as well as responsibility , and every time that happens the issue loses , " she says .
" It was a very well - orchestrated , concerted effort to pave the way for all of the steps that the Clinton administration would take .
It was very well - done . "
Senator John Kerry , a Democrat from Massachusetts , was chosen to chair the committee ; Senator Bob Smith , a New Hampshire Republican , was vice chair .
Kerry and Smith , both Vietnam veterans , had differing opinions on the issue .
Kerry made his skepticism clear early in the hearings , which went on for a year .
Smith was more willing to believe that live POWs might remain abroad , particularly in Southeast Asia .
But it was Senator John McCain , the sole former POW on the committee , who attracted the spotlight during the hearings of the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs .
McCain forged a relationship with Kerry , with whom he'd never been close ( Kerry had become a war protester after returning from Vietnam ) and made his skepticism about the live prisoner issue known during his questioning of witnesses .
During one memorable exchange , McCain reduced Dolores Alfond , the sister of a Vietnam POW / MIA , to tears with his harsh comments .
Carol Hrdlicka , who has obtained government documents indicating that her husband , David Hrdlicka , a Vietnam POW / MIA , was alive past 1973 , flew to Washington , D.C. , from Kansas for many of the hearing sessions .
Hrdlicka wears a laminated photo of her husband around her neck .
Her concerns are typical .
" There 's been no evidence to date that he ever died , " Hrdlicka says of her husband .
" If he 's dead , where 's his body , or where 's the evidence ?
And there 's no one from a government agency anyplace that has ever been able to answer that question . "
She did n't get any answers from the Senate committee , either .
After she saw Alfond weep , Hrdlicka was reluctant to testify .
She did anyway , and it went fairly smoothly , she recalls , but she was still furious with McCain .
She glared at him through the rest of the hearings .
" I figured that anybody who was a former POW should have some compassion for the guys who were left behind , " Hrdlicka says , adding , " McCain fascinated me , because he could n't look me in the eye .
And anybody that can't look you in the eye , I feel , is guilty . "
McCain raised eyebrows when he embraced Colonel Bui Tin , a former North Vietnamese political emissary who defected to the U.S.
Tin claims he interrogated McCain in the Hanoi prison camps .
A photo of their embrace was widely published .
Mark Salter , now McCain 's chief of staff , was a legislative assistant at the time .
He had no experience with the POW / MIA issue -- but learned quickly after McCain assigned him to staff the committee .
Salter is quick to observe that Tin made the first move .
" All the members went down to shake his hand , as they do with every witness that testified , " Salter recalls .
" And he reached up and embraced McCain , and that suddenly was splashed everywhere .
Everywhere .
It was n't McCain embracing him , he was being embraced and graciously accepted . "
In fact , a videotape from the hearing confirms that McCain was responding to the colonel 's gesture .
That does n't matter to Carol Hrdlicka .
" Here 's a Vietnamese Communist , and he 's hugging him , " she says . " . . .
I can see being civil , but I can't see hugging the former enemy . "
As expected , the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs concluded that there was no compelling evidence that live prisoners remained in Southeast Asia .
McCain paid -- just a little - - for his unwavering position .
Evan Mecham , impeached as governor of Arizona in 1988 , returned to politics to challenge McCain in 1992 , primarily because of McCain 's position on POW / MIAs .
Mecham failed , obviously .
WHEN JOHNNY GOES FLYING TO HANOI
( sung to the tune of " When Johnny Comes Marching Home " )
When Johnny goes flying to Hanoi ,
He 's got some gall !
We know it 's just a political ploy .
That 's all !
That 's all !
For he will spend his nights and days
selling out our MIAs .
And we 'd sure be glad if he never came home again !
When Johnny goes sailing ' cross the sea ,
He 's got some guts .
To suck up to the enemy ,
and kiss their butts ,
He 'll have a ball in old Hanoi
sneaking round with his joy - boy .
And we 'd sure be glad if he never came home again !
When Johnny hits ground in Vietnam ,
Poohbah !
Poohbah !
We hope he forgets his way back home .
We 'll shout " HURRAH " !
Oh , Hanoi , grant our fondest wish ,
and keep that low - life son-of -a-*****!
And we 'd sure be glad if he never came home again !
-- song by Arizona POW / MIA activists , 1993
John McCain 's flagging stock with POW / MIA activists dipped further with the " October Surprise " - - a hastily arranged , 24 - hour trip to Vietnam orchestrated by the Bush administration in 1992 , just before both the president and McCain stood for reelection .
Some criticized McCain for grandstanding on his status as a former POW , an issue he once swore he would n't exploit .
Mark Salter says the McCain campaign was not enthusiastic about the trip -- the purpose of which was purportedly to check out photographs of live American POW / MIAs -- because it cut into the senator 's flesh - pressing at home .
" The entire campaign flipped about it , " Salter says .
The photographs were fakes .
In some , Salter claims , bullet holes were clearly visible in soldiers ' foreheads .
McCain refused to mollify the POW / MIA activists .
In 1993 , he forged a compromise that , in the eyes of the activists , significantly watered down legislation designed to release classified U.S. government documents on POW / MIAs .
In 1994 , he supported the Clinton administration 's decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam .
And then McCain did something to earn the undying enmity of the POW / MIA community :
He pushed to normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam .
In a meeting at the Oval Office on May 23 , 1995 , McCain told President Clinton , " It does n't matter to me anymore , Mr. President , who was for the war and who was against the war .
I 'm tired of looking back in anger .
What 's important is that we move forward now . "
Salter calls McCain the catalyst for normalization .
He says McCain told Clinton , " I will stand with you as you do it .
I will do whatever you want me to do .
. . . "
When Clinton hesitated , Salter says , McCain told him , " ' This is really about 100 people , ' " referring to the POW / MIA activists .
" ' That 's all it is .
Most veterans are going to have no problems with it .'
" But Clinton , for reasons we all understand . . . was incredibly apprehensive about it .
We had a hard time .
We told him , ' Mr. President , Lafayette Park is not going to fill with fatigue - wearing angry veterans .
Nobody 's going to protest this .
. . .
There 's some suspicion that you wo n't do the hard things , Mr. President .
And people will look at it and say , " Here 's an instance where Clinton took a political risk . "
And you 're going to get praised for this .'
" It was a one - day story .
He was praised for it , and there was absolutely no outcry in the veterans community at all . "
Mark Salter exaggerates .
No , there was no deafening outcry , but the POW / MIA activists -- who certainly number more than 100 - - were furious .
Particularly when McCain stood on the dais for a photo opportunity with Clinton , then embraced him .
Says Ann Mills Griffiths , " So many people view that as John being a cardboard cutout for whatever reasons , to accomplish or to facilitate the Clinton administration 's agenda on normalization . "
When one totals McCain 's 23 missions over North Vietnam , times the number of minutes he was actually over enemy territory ( approximately 20 to 35 minutes per mission ) , McCain 's total time over Vietnam before being shot down , was about 10 1/2 hours .
For those 10 1/2 hours over Vietnam , McCain , the Admiral 's son , was awarded two Silver Stars , two Legions of Merit , two Distinguished Flying Crosses , three Bronze Stars , the Vietnamese Legion of Honor and three Purple Hearts averaging over one hero medal per hour .
-- Ted Sampley ,
U.S. Veteran Dispatch
Like John McCain , Ted Sampley is either a folk hero or a sleaze .
It simply depends upon whom you ask .
Just about everyone in the POW / MIA movement -- and beyond that , in the broader veterans community -- has an opinion .
Sampley is on the fringe of the radical wing of the movement , a member of the National Alliance of Families , which , unlike the National League of Families , still pushes the live POW issue .
Hard .
( The Alliance broke off from the League in the Eighties , in response to what many saw as Ann Mills Griffiths ' kowtowing to Republican government officials . )
Sampley ranks at the top in the pantheon of McCain - haters .
One evening late last June , Sampley manned a table containing POW / MIA tee shirts for sale .
It was situated just outside the Alliance 's annual meeting , which takes place every summer in a Washington , D.C. , hotel across the street from a hotel where the League meets .
POW / MIA memorabilia has long been Sampley 's bread and butter .
Ted 's 6 - year - old son , Owen Lane , nagged his dad to play with him .
" Let me sell some tee shirts , and we can buy some serious toys , " he told the boy , who wandered off .
From a credibility standpoint , Owen and his mother , Robin , are godsends for Sampley .
Never mind that the couple is divorced .
Sampley can say his son is a blood relative of an MIA -- Robin 's father , a Special Forces soldier , disappeared in Laos in May 1968 .
Sampley first got interested in the POW / MIA movement because as a Green Beret he served two tours in Vietnam .
The first was in 1965 , making him one of the first conventional soldiers to be sent there .
( Many early tours were assigned to " advisers . " )
Sampley knew next to nothing about the conflict when he went , and he knew little more about the POW issue until 1971 , when he saw an Army training film about POWs .
He went home to North Carolina and founded a group called Americans Who Care , which handed out literature , sold POW bracelets and publicized the POW cause .
" In 1973 , the prisoners of war came home , " Sampley recalls .
" I watched this , teary eyed , and I believed the government at that time that all our people had come home .
I mean , I had no reason not to . "
He went about his life , working as a potter and for newspapers and in television .
" I just kind of withdrew back into myself , like a lot of vets did . "
In 1982 , Sampley went to Washington , D.C. , for the dedication of the Vietnam War Memorial , and heard many of his fellow veterans express doubts about the fates of comrades .
Sampley made two quick decisions : first , that the government was withholding information , and second , that he would be the one to get the answers .
He did n't get many answers , but he certainly made a lot of noise .
" I took my training in guerrilla warfare and I turned it around on the U.S. government , " Sampley says .
" It was nonviolent civil disobedience . "
He stood up at a meeting of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition and announced it was time to get President Reagan 's attention .
" I said , ' We need to start doing things like they did in the Sixties . '
I said , ' I will chain myself to the White House fence if some of you will go with me . ' "
A handful did , and the national press reacted .
Sampley was just getting warmed up .
" I started thinking of as many types of tricks as I could pull to disrupt the system , " he says , chuckling , " . . . and through my leadership we became some of the biggest nuisances they 've ever -- I mean , we 've done things I can't even admit to .
The idea was not to get anybody hurt , but to disrupt the process , to cause the government to have to talk about the POW issue , to keep the POW issue in the light . "
Because he thought Ann Mills Griffiths and the National League were in cahoots with the Reagan administration , Sampley and his cohorts took over the League 's office in the American Legion building .
" No weapons , " he says .
" Just plain old outsmarting them . "
Mills Griffiths does n't have such fond memories of the stunt , recalling that Sampley " threatened to kill me " before he was hauled off in handcuffs .
Sampley made more headlines when he put a bamboo cage filled with the daughters of POW / MIAs on then - presidential chief of staff Don Regan 's front lawn .
Sampley and the group that came to be known as the " North Carolina Crazies " took 1,500 care packages -- Bibles , toothpaste , food and clothing addressed to individual POW / MIAs -- to the Laos Embassy in Washington , D.C.
When the Laotians threw him out , Sampley dumped the packages on the front lawn of National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci .
" Carlucci had to get five Army trucks there to get them out of his yard , " Sampley recalls .
Sampley sponsored a Rambo of the Year award for anyone who could plant a POW flag within 30 feet of the White House without being shot .
It was all a joke , he insists .
" People did start climbing it [ the White House fence ] , but no one was trying to get over it .
But they [ police ] were beating people off the fence with night sticks .
" The whole objective , it was a Gandhi - type thing , take the night sticks , take the hits , get the attention , get the press .
This went on for years .
. . .
That probably got me the reputation that I 've got now . "
Sampley was n't present for his most famous trick .
In 1992 , he planted hecklers to disrupt President Bush 's speech to the National League of Families .
Sampley was n't allowed in the room , but when Bush began speaking , the crowd began yelling , " No more lies !
No more lies ! "
With the cameras rolling , Bush -- frustrated , after repeated attempts to quiet the hecklers -- yelled , " Sit down and shut up ! "
Sampley 's first POW / MIA - related newspaper debuted in 1986 .
He called it Bamboo Connection , and while the name has changed a few times over the years , he still publishes a paper today .

Although his antics detract from his credibility , Sampley has had some journalistic successes -- including one just last year .
His early reporting led to a CBS News story that prompted the U.S. government to open the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and do DNA testing on what proved to be the remains of Air Force pilot Michael Blassie .
His work earned Sampley a " Laurel " from the Columbia Journalism Review .
His coverage of John McCain has been spotty , at best .
Sampley says he first met McCain in the Eighties , while McCain was still in the U.S. House .
Sampley dropped by to say hello and discuss the POW / MIA issue .
At the time , Sampley did not consider McCain to be a foe .
But it quickly became clear that the two had little in common when it came to the POW / MIA movement .
Sampley recalls , " When we started talking about the POW issue , he [ McCain ] got fidgety , he got agitated .
. . .
He started pacing back and forth . "
Sampley says McCain got up in the middle of the discussion and walked out of his office .
Sampley followed McCain into the hallway .
" Finally , as we got outside , he just walked off and left me .
. . .
Out of his office , out of his building , down the street and he walked faster than me , and I got the hint he did n't want to talk to me anymore .
" At that point , I did n't make a big deal out of it , other than thinking , ' This guy 's a loony tune . ' "
He says he started looking more closely at McCain during the Senate hearings in 1991 - 92 .
Sampley dug up McCain 's 1973 U.S. News & World Report article , as well as the interview with the Spanish psychiatrist and the piece by the French journalist .
" Through that , through his own words . . . and my training as an interrogator , I locked onto him .
I locked onto what he was saying .
And the key thing was when he said , ' I told them that if you 'll take me to a doctor I 'll give you military information . '
" That went BEEP !
BEEP !
BEEP !
BEEP !
Bad .
Wrong , wrong .
That violated everything -- the whole Code of Conduct was violated there .
And I saw that he was trying to cover himself , there must be more to it . "
Sampley 's reporting spun out of control .
He dubbed the senator the " Manchurian Candidate , " suggesting that McCain was a pawn of the Vietnamese because he was afraid they would reveal the true extent of his " collaboration " during the war .
" I 'll say it now , that eventually - - it may not be any time soon -- it will come out .
This stuff will come out .
The exact amount of his collaboration will come out .
He was a serious collaborator . "
Sampley offers no credible proof of these allegations , other than quotes from unnamed former POWs and suggestions that the Vietnamese still have film of McCain 's activities in the prison camps .
The Manchurian Candidate theory , Sampley maintains , is the only plausible explanation for McCain 's behavior on the POW / MIA issue .
" Explain to me why John McCain would turn on us , the families , " he asks .
" Why would he hug Colonel Bui Tin ? . . .
Bui Tin , whether he defected or not , was one of the Communists responsible for the policy that killed American prisoners of war and kept McCain and others in prison .
" It 's not that McCain loves the Vietnamese , he loves himself .
He does n't want them dropping the dime on him , so to speak , making the phone call on him , making available to the American public the extent to which he collaborated in order to save his own skin . "
In December 1992 , as the Senate hearings were winding down , Sampley was making the rounds in the halls of Congress , handing out copies of his latest periodical , which featured McCain and the Queen of Diamonds on the cover with the headline : " Sen. John McCain : ' The Manchurian Candidate . ' "
The story condemned McCain for his lack of support on the live POW / MIA issue , and cited the U.S. News article and others as evidence that McCain had collaborated with the enemy and was protecting the Vietnamese for fear of being exposed .
The article summarized the senator 's political career , relying on reports from daily newspapers and wire services .
It touched on McCain 's role in the Keating Five and his friendship with former Arizona Republic publisher Duke Tully , who had fabricated a military career for himself , only to be exposed in the mid-Eighties .
Sampley claims he never intended to go into McCain 's office , but when he realized that 's where he was , he tossed a copy to the receptionist , requesting that it be delivered to the senator 's veterans affairs assistant .
Mark Salter happened to be standing by the front desk .
Sampley 's version of what ensued goes like this :
" He [ Salter ] said to me , ' You son of a bitch . '
Those were his words .
He said , ' You low - life bastard . ' . . .
The dumbass followed me , yakking at me all the way down the hall .
I 'm thinking , ' Why does n't this guy go away ?
I 'm leaving . '
I turn to go into the stairway , he followed me in there and for some reason he felt frisky and he punched me in the back of the shoulder -- not hard -- and that was it .
I turned around and I fried him . "
Salter claims he just tapped Sampley on the shoulder to get his attention .
Security guards intervened .
Sampley eventually was found guilty of assault and sentenced to two days in jail and 180 days of probation .
He also was ordered to stay away from McCain and his staff .
Of Sampley , Salter says , " Mr. Sampley is about as disreputable a person as I 've ever met in some 20 years of public service .
. . .
He 's just a con artist .
Nothing more , nothing less . "
Salter is referring to Sampley 's business of selling POW / MIA souvenirs at the Vietnam War Memorial .
Sampley formed a nonprofit corporation that sold memorabilia , including tee shirts that were manufactured by his own for - profit company , Red Hawk .
Sampley was sued for copyright infringement by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and a sculptor , for using the likeness of a statue called The Three Servicemen on his tee shirts .
A judge ordered Sampley to pay more than $ 350,000 in royalties .
Sampley , who claims the legal bills broke him , has n't paid .
The North Carolinian continued to blast McCain in print .
In a 1995 article , he dubbed McCain " The Rhinestone Cowboy " and printed his claim that film of McCain 's collaborative acts exists in Vietnam .
He also quoted an unnamed source who said McCain had a wife and children in Vietnam .
He reiterated many of those claims in a 1997 story about McCain .
" Even in this country , as difficult as it is to win a libel suit , we could win one against Sampley , " Salter says .
" He knows he 's making it up and he 's doing it with malice . "
Accusations like Sampley 's have hurt , Salter says .
" I remember the first time I saw the Sampley thing in his paper , the first Manchurian Candidate article , and I showed it to him [ McCain ] .
He was stung .
And I was kind of laughing , to make light of it .
He said , ' It 's not funny . '
" Then after a couple of months , he began to laugh about it , and then refer to himself as the Manchurian Candidate .
He got over it .
But it stung .
And he did n't deserve it .
It was n't right . "
McCain says he can't recall exchanging many words with Sampley , although Sampley claims the senator once walked past him and said , " Hello , scumbag . "
McCain recalls the event -- a congressional fund raiser in North Carolina -- differently .
He says Sampley stood up and berated him .
" I simply said , ' Sampley , you and I have a disagreement , ' " McCain recalls .
" I did n't see any reason to call him any names or lower myself down to that level .
I have some dignity . "
John McCain and his staff take pains to mark a distinction between the Ted Sampleys and the Carol Hrdlickas of the POW / MIA movement .
" You ca n't get mad at the families , but you get mad at the Ted Sampleys of the world , " says Mark Salter .
But many family members maintain they have been abused by McCain .
One is Dolores Alfond , who was reduced to tears by McCain during her 1992 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs .
Salter denies that his boss has ever mistreated a family member .
" I 've never seen him lose it with a family member - - ever , ever . "
Few , if any , of the alleged incidents are recorded , so recollections of participants must be relied upon .
Earl Hopper Sr. says the last time he spoke to McCain was in the early Nineties , in the hallway of the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill .
Hopper was in Washington for a POW / MIA - related hearing .
" I came in and was headed to the hearing room , and John and a couple of his aides were standing off to the side .
And as I went by , I said , ' Hello John . '
" He did n't acknowledge that at all .
He says , ' I do n't like what you said about my wife . '
" I stopped .
I 'd never said anything about Cindy , I did n't know Cindy .
I said , ' What do you mean ?
I never said anything about your wife . '
" ' Well , I 'm not going to get into it here . '
" I said , ' No , you brought it up , now let 's finish it .
I want to know what it is I was supposed to have said , because I 've heard so many lies being told about me . '
" He says , ' Well , I 'm just not going to talk about it . '
" I said , ' John , you 're a goddamn liar , then .
If you make a statement like that and you can't back it up , I want to tell you now , you 're a liar . '
" Well , he turns red and he takes off .
And his aide goes with him .
And I guess that 's the last time I 've ever personally spoken with him . "
McCain says the exchange took place not in Washington but at the Phoenix VA hospital , when both men were attending a POW / MIA - related event .
" We exchanged some words about something , I can't even remember what it was about now , " McCain says .
" I think that he had said something about a friend of mine or something like that , I do n't remember .
And I said , ' Look , I do n't agree with your comments about that , ' and that 's the last time that I have seen or talked to Colonel Hopper , as I remember . "
The most infamous McCain / family encounter took place in 1996 in the hallway of the Russell Senate Office Building , outside McCain 's office .
Carol Hrdlicka was in Washington for a POW / MIA event .
She and a group of other family members were gathering to try to meet with McCain .
As Hrdlicka recalls it , she and two others were early .
They bumped into McCain in the hallway as he walked down the hall to another office .
" Down the hall he comes , and I said , ' Senator McCain , are you coming back ? ' "
Hrdlicka recalls .
She had n't seen him in years , since the Senate Select Committee hearings , and he obviously did n't recognize her .
" ' Oh , yeah , ' he says , ' I 'll be back in a minute . ' "
In the meantime , the group of more than a dozen family members gathered , including one woman who was wheelchair - bound - - right outside the office McCain had stepped into .
He emerged into the crowd .
" What 's really funny is , when he thinks you 're just a regular civilian , he 's got all these smiles on his face , " Hrdlicka says .
But the family members started talking and , Hrdlicka says , the smile faded .
She says the senator shoved Jeanette Jenkins , who was pushing her aunt 's wheelchair , against the wall , in his haste to escape .
Hrdlicka took off after McCain .
He stopped in front of an elevator .
" I stepped in front of him and I said , ' Senator McCain , David Hrdlicka is still sitting over there , ' . . . and he says , ' You just do n't understand . '
And I said , ' I understand . '
I said , ' I understand .
David Hrdlicka is still sitting over there and you 're here . '
And at this point the elevator opens and he steps on and he says , ' Well , you just do n't understand , ' and I said , ' Yes I do , you 're a traitor . '
And at that point the doors shut . "
Hrdlicka , Jenkins and Jane Duke Gaylor , the woman in the wheelchair , all complained to the Senate Ethics Committee .
No action was ever taken .
Mark Salter calls Hrdlicka 's account " an absolute lie .
I was an eyewitness to that event .
An absolute lie .
He [ McCain ] did n't say one word to them , he said , ' Excuse me . '
Did n't touch them , walked , got in the elevator and the both of us went down .
An absolute lie . "
McCain 's recollection : " I walked by them as they were yelling ' traitor ' and words like that , and all of the sudden I was accused of shoving a woman or someone in a wheelchair or something like that .
I was astounded by that .
" But look , let me also say this to you .
Someone like Carol Hrdlicka has spent literally all her adult life on this issue .
It 's very difficult and very emotional for them when literally their whole lives are consumed by this issue .
As is to some degree the case of Earl Hopper . . . .
I understand the emotion associated with this . . . "
Hi , Amy , Laird Gutterson .
I would n't care to go on the record or off the record , on John McCain .
We have sort of an unwritten rule that we do n't talk about each other and what we did while we were there .
I wo n't vote for him , and that 's about the size of it .
-- a phone message
Laird Gutterson , a Tucson resident who was a POW with John McCain in Vietnam , is one of many POWs who are unwilling to talk about their experiences in the camps .
Patty Hopper says many of these men-- including Gutterson -- have confided privately to her about McCain 's behavior , and she 's frustrated that they wo n't go public .
" How many are willing to come up against John 's nastiness ? " she asks .
" He is a scumbag .
He is a piece of garbage .
And he 's vicious and he 's nasty and he knows no bounds .
So how many people want to subject themselves to John Sidney McCain 's mouth ? "
None .
Even Ted Guy and Swede Larson have nothing negative to say about McCain 's behavior -- only that they do n't have firsthand proof he was tortured .
They do complain about McCain 's politics since the war .
And as for McCain 's alleged collaboration with the Communists , Larson says , " I do n't think he told them anything they did n't already know . "
A typical POW response , this to an e-mail Patty Hopper sent to Terry Uyeyama , an Air Force pilot shot down in May 1968 :
Sorry , but I have nothing on McCain , while in prison .
Otherwise , I would have gladly given you something several years ago .
As I said in previous posting , I was never in the same camp , nor did I ever hear anything derogatory about him over there .
If there was any serious breach of conduct , believe me , it probably would have become common knowledge before we all came home .
. . .
The other typical POW response is pro-McCain .
Larry Chesley , a former Republican state legislator from Mesa , who served in the Air Force and was a POW for seven years , says , " John McCain was considered one of the model prisoners of war by all of us that were there .
The people who bad - mouth him are people who have never been with him in prison .
Have you found one of us who ever served with him , who have said this about him ? "
No .
Most are more like Orson Swindle .
Swindle and McCain have remained close over the years .
McCain was instrumental in getting Swindle his current job , as a Federal Communications Commission member .
The two do n't always agree on POW / MIA politics , Swindle says , but he considers McCain a hero , and does n't think people like Earl and Patty Hopper - - who were not POWs -- can pass judgment .
" Some who were not there , I guess , would say , ' You guys are very intolerant of those people . '
But unless you 've been there in our shoes , it 's probably very difficult to comprehend the code we were trying to uphold under very difficult circumstances .
And our Code of Conduct is very clear about what we can and what we should and should not do .
That 's not to say that we did n't fail .
God knows , we all were defeated by the physical and mental torture , and we gave the Communists things we all wish we had not . "
If McCain is a traitor , Swindle says , then he 's a traitor , too , because he -- like many -- signed war - crime confessions .
" People who were n't there have no grounds whatsoever to criticize any one of us for yielding under that kind of pressure and pain .
They were n't there .
And I do n't know what their standard is , where they get their calling from , when we who were there , having gone through it , never judge harshly those who went through the ordeal .
' Cause we know .
They do n't know .
" John McCain is an authentic hero of this country .
He is a helluva patriot .
And he 's quite a bright guy and he 'll make a helluva president . "
New Times : " One more question for you , Senator .
Do you consider yourself a hero ? "
John McCain : " Of course not .
Of course not .
I have never , ever -- I 've stoutly maintained that I was privileged to serve in the company of heroes , but never , never have I described myself as having done anything heroic . "
John McCain 's humility wo n't stop his presidential campaign from painting a heroic portrait .
His staff members have happily pushed their boss 's war record for years , with great success .
A news database search revealed that in the past year alone , the words " McCain " and " hero " appear in the same story or broadcast 631 times .
The words " McCain " and " traitor , " only 22 times .
" You know , it 's part of his bio , " says his chief of staff , Mark Salter .
" I 'm not going to pretend it has n't been an enormous advantage to a politician to have a bio like that .
And you never have to reference it .
It 's just there .
It 's just there .
You go to an audience and they know it and it 's there .
And you know what ?
So what ? . . .
He earned the distinction .
And if there 's an advantage to it , well , what 's wrong with it ?
There should be an advantage to it .
Some people have done that for the country .
Other people have n't . "
To that end , McCain 's own memoir of the war is due out in September .
Salter , who worked on it himself , says half will be devoted to the military careers of McCain 's father and grandfather ; the other half to McCain 's own war experience .
Salter promises the book will showcase a humble McCain .
" When I worked on this book with him , he just kept saying , ' Other guys had it a lot worse .
I think they took it easier on me because of who my dad was .
. . .
When they tied me in ropes , they 'd roll my sleeve up to give it a little padding between the rope and my bicep , you know , little things I noticed .
The only really hard time I had was when I did n't go home , and then it only lasted a week , and sometimes I felt braver , I felt I could get away with more . ' "
The presidential campaign will certainly have to endure the continued jabs from the likes of Ted Sampley .
How is the McCain campaign handling it ?
" Ignoring it , " Salter says .
" Occasionally , we get calls from reporters who've . . . talked to somebody at the [ Ted Sampley 's tee shirt ] booth and , you know , McCain 's the Manchurian Candidate .
But we 've always been able to make our case and nobody 's ever done anything with it . "
Mark Saltveit , editor of The Skeleton Closet , a self - described Web scandal sheet that catalogues reported misdeeds of presidential candidates , says he did n't know quite what to do when the POW / MIA activists started sending him anti-McCain e-mails .
Saltveit , a 37 - year - old San Franciscan , admits his own non-veteran status made him hesitant to give the claims much credence , but he put up a couple links to the POW / MIA sites , to cover his bases .
The Skeleton Closet references rumors of George W. Bush 's drug dalliances and Al Gore 's hypocrisy on the tobacco issue , but Saltveit is n't sure he has the stomach for claims John McCain was n't tortured in Vietnam .
" How more viciously could you attack someone who 's been through what he 's been through ? " he asks .
McCain's POW status has become so ingrained in his political identity that the senator has taken to lampooning it .
A featured speaker at the Gridiron Club 's annual dinner on March 20 ( a night where newsmakers poke fun at themselves ) , McCain went to the podium with the lapels of his tuxedo covered with medals and introduced himself as an " incredibly self - effacing guy " and a " genuine war hero . "

Viruses to power batteries of the future
The energy for tomorrow 's miniature electronic devices could come from tiny microbatteries about half the size of a human cell and built with viruses .
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US believe they can build them , thanks to a new advance in battery technology .
By pouring a mixture of the harmless , genetically engineered M13 virus and the metal cobalt over stamped silicon film , Professor Angela Belcher and her colleagues have created a flexible , microscopic battery that could be cheaply mass produced .
In theory , it could turn virtually any surface - from large computers to tiny implanted detectors for cancer or heart disease - into an energy - storing device .
" The idea of using stamping technique to produce a battery is pretty different , " says Belcher .
" We can make the batteries really small , which lets us put a power source on all sorts of tiny sensors . "
Belcher and her colleagues created the first virus - powered battery in 2006 .
Since then they have been refining their viral battery while working to create other novel energy - storing devices that could be woven into fabrics or poured into containers .
Powerful
Their most recent advance , detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , involves stamping a base material , in this case silicon , so that the negatively charged M13 virus and positively charged cobalt can self - assemble based on their relative charges and the pattern of the stamp .
Stamping the base materials , which can theoretically be nearly any surface , means that the batteries can be produced more cheaply and efficiently .
With silicon as the base material , flexible and curved batteries can be created as well .
Gram for gram , the virus - based batteries are roughly twice as powerful as traditional chemical batteries , says Belcher , although the battery cells are so small - about four micrometres across - that exact measurements are difficult .
It takes about an hour for an M13 battery to form .
While one tiny cell can't hold much energy , when many cells are combined they can power real devices .
Nine months ago Belcher created a button - sized , M13 - based battery and put it into her laser pointer .
After numerous recharges she is still on her first virus - based battery .
" It has n't failed yet , " says Belcher .
Like her laser - pointer battery , other virus - based batteries would be rechargeable and more environmentally friendly that traditional batteries .
The virus batteries are assembled at room temperature , have a relatively neutral pH , and use smaller amounts of potentially troublesome metals like lithium or cobalt .
Applications
Because the batteries are so small they will first be used to power small things , such as lab - on - a- chip technology and implantable devices that would monitor patient health , say Belcher and other researchers .
" This technique has tremendous potential to monitor diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancer , " says Assistant Professor Kimberly Kelly , an oncologist at the University of Virginia .
After chemotherapy or surgery for cancer , patients must be monitored to ensure the cancer does n't return .
In theory , a small device implanted under the skin , powered by M13 , could detect proteins produced by renewed cancer cells .
In response , it could light up ( literally , by triggering a small visible LED , as one example ) , alerting both patient and physician .
It would be like a check engine light for cancer or heart attacks .
" [ Belcher ] is pretty close to developing this technology for light - based applications , " says Kelly .
" I could see them coming out in two years , five years at worst . "
Eventually Belcher hopes to scale up virus - based batteries for larger devices like computers or even cars that would n't need a separate battery .
The battery would instead be built into the surface of the car itself .
" It would be part of the manufacturing process , " says Belcher .
" What we do is provide the surface and the ions , and the batteries built themselves . "
Christopher Neil was arrested in Thailand after Interpol 's public appeal
The trial has begun in Thailand of a paedophile suspect arrested after a doctored internet image was unscrambled using digital technology .
Canadian schoolteacher Christopher Neil was detained last year , after hundreds of photos allegedly showing him abusing Asian boys were investigated .
Interpol reconstituted the pictures with help from German computer experts .
If convicted , the 32 - year - old - who denies the charges against him - could face 20 years in jail .
He has been charged with sexually abusing a minor , filming the alleged abuse , taking a child without parental consent , and holding the child against his will .
The accused was arrested in Thailand soon after Interpol 's unprecedented public appeal .
A doctored image on the internet was unscrambled by police Photos had been found online in 2004 of a man sexually abusing at least a dozen Vietnamese and Cambodian boys , some as young as 6 , but the face of the suspect had been digitally obscured by a swirling shape .
After the images were unscrambled and issued to media for broadcast , investigators received hundreds of tips which led to Mr Neil 's arrest on 19 October 2007 .

Dynamic Django settings context processor
Here 's a nice way of easily passing only certain settings variables to the template .
Because of the way Django looks up context processors , we need a little hack with sys.modules .
import sys from django.conf import settings as django_settings class SettingsProcessor ( object ) : def __getattr__ ( self , attr ) : if attr == ' __file__ ' : # autoreload support in dev server return __file__ else : return lambda request : {attr : getattr( django_settings , attr ) } sys.modules[__name__ + '. settings ' ] = SettingsProcessor ( )
Assuming this is placed in a file called utils / context_processors.py , you can use this from the settings .py file like so :
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
= ( # ....
'utils.context_processors.settings.GOOGLEMAPS_KEY ' , 'utils.context_processors.settings.TEMPLATE_DEBUG ' , 'utils.context_processors.settings.MAXMIND_URL' , )
Nice and simple .

Some of the youngsters on the list are also carving out fortunes of their own .
Yusuf Alekperov , who has dropped to third from first on the list , stands to inherit $ 13.5 billion .
But in the past year , he has also invested over $ 90 million of his own money in his father Vagit 's energy company Lukoil .
If police officers in Ingolstadt notice a decrease in luxury car drivers running red lights these days , we suspect it 's because of a new project piloted by Audi that lets drivers know exactly how long before a traffic light turns .
According to Audi 's press release , the system is meant to prevent " frustrating , fuel - sapping stops at red traffic lights . "
After all , the last thing you want to see when you 're driving your brand - new S5 is a red light .
We 're liking Audi engineers more and more each day .
Dubbed Travolution , the project depends on communications modules built into traffic lights .
Those modules transmit signals to the Audi Multi Media Interface ( MMI ) which , in turn , shows the driver whether he or she is able to proceed safely and if so , what speed he or she must maintain in order to make it through before the light turns red .
Even better , if there 's no oncoming traffic , your Audi can make the light turn green .
Of course , if Ed Bradley is driving , chances are the car will unintentionally accelerate even if his foot is on the brake .
In a world filled with revenue - producing red - light cameras linked to yellow lights shorter than William Hung 's career , Travolution is a refreshing escape that makes driving more efficient and more fun .
Audi 's press release contends that Travolution " could also dramatically reduce the number of actual stops needed by creating a communications link between cars and the traffic light network . "
In other words , a Travolution - equipped traffic light could in real time sense how many cars are waiting to turn at each branch of an intersection and adjust its signal accordingly .
This will come as no surprise to the tinfoil hat brigade , who think that government agents wielding magical TV remotes are already controlling the world 's stoplights .
We like the added safety benefit of the dashboard speed guide for when you do n't know whether it'd be safer to slow down or speed up for a yellow light .
Slam on the brakes , and you 'll waste gas and risk being hit from behind ( 42 percent of signalized accidents ) .
Speed up , and you 'll risk a traffic ticket or a side - on collision ( 28 percent of signalized accidents ) .
Traffic engineers refer to this phenomenon as " the dilemma zone . "
This writer refers to it as , " Sorry , officer , I thought it was going to stay yellow for longer . "
Sadly , the project is only an experiment in Audi 's home city , so this writer will have to rely on the old trick his driving instructor taught him :
The yellow light should hold for as many seconds as the leading digit of the speed limit of the road .
After all , if Travolution catches on , that excuse wo n't hold up in court .

By the time the feds caught up with former stockbroker Shaun Attwood in 2002 , the big- eared Brit hardly seemed like the drug kingpin they were after .
He was living in a cramped apartment in Scottsdale , Arizona , with his fiancé , Claudia .
He spent most days trading stocks online from his home office and hitting the gym .
“ English Shaun , ” as Attwood was known in law enforcement circles , was supposed to be the mastermind of Phoenix ’s largest drug syndicate , dubbed The Evil Empire ; it single - handedly sustained Phoenix ’s booming rave scene .
Homebody or not , a wire picked up Attwood discussing shipments of ecstasy , methamphetamines , LSD , marijuana , and cocaine .
Then the DEA knocked his door in .
For the next five and a half years Shaun Attwood inhabited Sheriff Joe Arpaio ’s notorious jail and the sweltering prisons of central Arizona .
Like many prisoners , he broke out in bedsores and hives , made friends with transsexuals , and evaded the wrath of the Aryan Brotherhood .
But while he did time in maximum security under the self - proclaimed “ toughest sheriff ” in America , Attwood also did something most prisoners can ’t ; he took his father ’s suggestion and started blogging covertly about his daily life .
At first , Attwood ’s aunt was the blog smuggler .
When she visited him at the Madison Street Jail , he handed her a scrap of paper tucked into a stack of legal documents — his first blog post .
Once home , she transcribed the post and emailed it to Attwood ’s father , Derick , in England .
A few days later , Derick activated “ Jon ’s Jail Journal ” on Blogspot .
There he posted his son ’s first blog entry from prison .
Its title : “ Deep Shit . ”
It began :
We have had no running water for three days .
The toilets in our cells are full of faeces and urine .
On the second day of the water outage I knew we were in trouble when the mound in our steel throne peaked above sea level .
Entry by smuggled entry , Jon ’s Jail Journal came to life :
The temperature outside is currently 114 degrees .
The trickle of air into our cell ’s feels like hot air blowing from a hair - dryer .
We are soaked in sweat all day and night …
Between the sweat trickling down my body and the cockroaches tickling my limbs , it is impossible to sleep properly .
Last night , while sleeping on my side , my ear filled up with sweat , and when I moved my head , the sweat poured out onto my face .
I woke up , startled .
It felt like someone was touching my cheek .
Soon enough , the Guardian excerpted Jon ’s Jail Journal .
Shortly after that , the BBC did a story on Attwood .
Suddenly the blog was getting 10,000 hits a month .
In time , “ Jon ’s Jail Journal ” became more than just a way for Attwood to vent about prison conditions .
Derick put up a wish list for Attwood on Amazon.com .
Soon , strangers were sending Attwood hundreds of books .
“ It got to the point that so many books were coming in that we had to take the Amazon wish list down , ” says Derick .
In turn , Attwood donated them to the prison library .
“ I had never really read fiction , ” Attwood says .
That changed .
“ I had a John Updike phase , a Brett Easton Ellis phase .
I read all of Murakami , all of Vonnegut , all of Tom Wolfe . ”
Shortly before his release , he read a biography of Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn , a Russian novelist imprisoned for eight years for criticizing Stalin .
Solzhenitsyn chronicled life in the grim labor camps of Kazakhstan .
His writings exposed the Gulag , and in 1970 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature .
Attwood , sweating in Arizona , took heart :
I have just finished reading a Solzhenitsyn bio that I started two days ago and could n’t put down .
It ’s as if fate has stepped in just before my release and strengthened my commitment to making a go of writing .
My suffering can’t compare with what Solzhenitsyn had to endure , yet he rose from prison to spearhead the literary elite of Russia .
Death called on him so many times : on the front fighting the Nazis , in Russian prisons , and then in the form of cancer .
Reading about the odds he overcome has inspired me .
Attwood ’s most meaningful relationships , however , were ultimately not with books , but with his fellow inmates .
This , too , was reflected in Jon ’s Jail Journal .
Regular readers of the blog came to know a dubious cast of characters that included Xena , a 6 ’ 5 ″ she - male , Two Tonys , an Irish - Italian murderer serving multiple life sentences , and Frankie , an alleged Mexican mafia contract killer .
He writes :
Frankie … is the source of most of the hullabaloo in our pod .
He is a recent arrival from the jail ’s infirmary .
Last month Frankie was calmly playing cards in a maximum security pod , when an 8 inch shank was suddenly plunged into the back of his neck .
Unfazed , he extracted the shank , and was about to return the gesture , when newly arriving guards pepper - sprayed him , causing temporary blindness .
The ‘ hit on the hitman ’ had failed , and Frankie was dragged from the pod , in front of amazed onlookers with blood spurting from the wound .
He was consequently promoted to our pod — a super maximum area , where inmates are confined to tiny 2 man cells for 23 hours every day .
“ Sometimes , ” he says , “ I feel I ’m in a Kafka novel . ”
In recent years , other prisoners have used written correspondence to post profiles on MySpace .
But Jon ’s Jail Journal is one of the few verifiable prison blogs online , and by far the most popular .
Jon ’s Jail Journal has attracted nearly 500,000 readers in the last three years .
Many readers comment on the blog posts , and Attwood ’s father says his email address book now has more than 4,000 entries from people who have contacted his son .
These relationships , Attwood says , have helped him feel connected to life beyond the prison walls .
“ People write to me from Singapore to New Zealand , the Netherlands , China , Siberia , ” he says .
“ I write to up to 50 people a month , and all of those people have come about as a result of the blog .
They can see that I ’ve transformed the negative into the positive . ”
After nearly 3,000 days and hundreds of blog posts , Attwood was released last year .
He ’s still writing , and his literary ambitions do n’t end with his blog .
But until someone picks up his book , he posts notes from bloggers still behind bars .
Like this one :
From June 1 through Nov. 30 each year , the coastal United States comes under threat from the ferocious winds and floodwaters of the hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean basin .
In 2005 , one of the most devastating storms ever to hit U.S. soil , Hurricane Katrina , all but destroyed parts of New Orleans , as the surging ocean waters it pushed to land overtopped the city 's protective levees , inundating a vast region , displacing millions of residents and killing more than 1,800 people .
While Katrina is the most remembered of these swirling storms — its name now infamous — it certainly is n't alone in causing significant death and destruction to areas of the United States .
Here are some of the strongest and most damaging and deadly hurricanes ever to affect the Atlantic Basin , including the United States .
It is not exhaustive and does not include every notable storm in history .
This information is provided by the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service .
Note : Dollar amounts , below , are for the year that the hurricane occurred .
Galveston Hurricane 1900
This killer weather system was first detected over the tropical Atlantic on Aug. 27 .
While the history of the track and intensity is not fully known , the system reached Cuba as a tropical storm on Sept. 3 and moved into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on the 5th .
A general west - northwestward motion occurred over the Gulf accompanied by rapid intensification .
By the time the storm reached the Texas coast south of Galveston late on Sept. 8 , it was a Category 4 hurricane .
After landfall , the cyclone turned northward through the Great Plains .
It became extratropical and turned east - northeastward on Sept. 11 , passing across the Great Lakes , New England , and southeastern Canada .
It was last spotted over the north Atlantic on Sept. 15 .
This hurricane was the deadliest weather disaster in U.S. history .
Storm tides of 8 to 15 ft inundated the whole of Galveston Island , as well as other portions of the nearby Texas coast .
These tides were largely responsible for the 8,000 deaths ( estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000 ) attributed to the storm .
The damage to property was estimated at $ 30 million .

Atlantic - Gulf Hurricane 1919
This fearsome cyclone was first detected near the Lesser Antilles on Sept.
2 . It moved generally west - northwestward for several days , passing near the Dominican Republic on Sept. 4 and into the southeastern Bahamas on the 5th and 6th .
At that time it became a hurricane .
A westward turn on Sept. 7 took the center across the central Bahamas on the 7th and 8th and into the Straits of Florida on the 9th .
The now large hurricane was of Category 4 intensity as the eye passed just south of Key West , Florida , and the Dry Tortugas on Sept. 10 .
A continued west to west - northwestward motion brought the center to the Texas coast south of Corpus Christi as a Category 3 hurricane on Sept. 14 .
The cyclone dissipated over northern Mexico and southern Texas the next day .
Although hurricane - force winds occurred over the Florida Keys and the central and south Texas coast , no reliable wind measurements are available from near the center .
A storm surge of up to 12 feet inundated Corpus Christ , Texas , causing major damage to the coastal areas .
A ship moored near the Dry Tortugas measured a pressure of 27.37 inches as the center passed , and based on this , the storm is ranked as the third most intense to hit the United States .
The death toll was estimated at 600 to 900 people .
Of these , more than 500 were lost on ten ships that either sunk or were reported missing .
Damage in the United States was estimated at $ 22 million .
Great Miami Hurricane 1926
The " Great Miami " Hurricane was first spotted as a tropical wave located 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles on Sept. 11 .
The system moved quickly westward and intensified to hurricane strength as it moved to the north of Puerto Rico on the 15th .
Winds were reported to be nearly 150 mph as the hurricane passed over the Turks Islands on the 16th and through the Bahamas on the 17th .
Little in the way of meteorological information on the approaching hurricane was available to the Weather Bureau in Miami .
As a result , hurricane warnings were not issued until midnight on Sept. 18 , which gave the booming population of South Florida little notice of the impending disaster .
The Category 4 hurricane 's eye moved directly over Miami Beach and downtown Miami during the morning hours of the 18th .
This cyclone produced the highest sustained winds ever recorded in the United States at the time , and the barometric pressure fell to 27.61 inches as the eye passed over Miami .
A storm surge of nearly 15 feet was reported in Coconut Grove .
Many casualties resulted as people ventured outdoors during the half - hour lull in the storm as the eye passed overhead .
Most residents , having not experienced a hurricane , believed that the storm had passed during the lull .
They were suddenly trapped and exposed to the eastern half of the hurricane shortly thereafter .
Every building in the downtown district of Miami was damaged or destroyed .
The town of Moore Haven on the south side of Lake Okeechobee was completely flooded by lake surge from the hurricane .
Hundreds of people in Moore Haven alone were killed by this surge , which left behind floodwaters in the town for weeks afterward .
The hurricane continued northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and approached Pensacola on Sept. 20 .
The storm nearly stalled to the south of Pensacola later that day and buffeted the central Gulf Coast with 24 hours of heavy rainfall , hurricane force winds , and storm surge .
The hurricane weakened as it moved inland over Louisiana later on the 21st .
Nearly every pier , warehouse , and vessel on Pensacola Bay was destroyed .
The great hurricane of 1926 ended the economic boom in South Florida and would be a $ 90 billion disaster had it occurred in recent times .
With a highly transient population across southeastern Florida during the 1920s , the death toll is uncertain since more than 800 people were missing in the aftermath of the cyclone .
A Red Cross report lists 373 deaths and 6,381 injuries as a result of the hurricane .
San Felipe - Okeechobee Hurricane 1928
This classic Cape Verde hurricane was first detected over the tropical Atlantic on Sept. 10 , although it likely formed several days earlier .
It moved westward through the Leeward Islands on the 12th .
It then turned west - northwestward , scoring a direct hit on Puerto Rico on the 13th ( the feast of San Felipe ) as a Category 4 hurricane .
The hurricane continued west - northwestward through the Bahamas and made landfall near Palm Beach , Florida on Sept. 16 .
It turned north - northeastward over the Florida Peninsula on the 17th , a motion which brought the remains of the storm to eastern North Carolina on the 19th .
It then turned northward and merged with a non-tropical low over the eastern Great Lakes on Sept. 20 .
No reliable wind readings are available from near the landfall area in Florida .
However , Palm Beach reported a minimum pressure of 27.43 in , making this the fourth strongest hurricane of record to hit the United States .
In Puerto Rico , San Juan reported 144 mph sustained winds , while Guayama reported a pressure of 27.65 inches .
Additionally , a ship just south of St. Croix , United States Virgin Islands ( USVI ) reported a pressure of 27.50 inches , while Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands reported a pressure of 27.76 inches .
This hurricane caused heavy casualties and extensive destruction along its path from the Leeward Islands to Florida .
The worst tragedy occurred at inland Lake Okeechobee in Florida , where the hurricane caused a lake surge of 6 to 9 feet that inundated the surrounding area .
1,836 people died in Florida , mainly due to the lake surge .
An additional 312 people died in Puerto Rico , and 18 more were reported dead in the Bahamas .
Damage to property was estimated at $ 50 million in Puerto Rico and $ 25 million in Florida .
Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane 1935
This system was first detected east of the central Bahamas on Aug. 29 .
Moving westward , it passed near Andros Island on Sept. 1 , at which time it reached hurricane strength and turned west - northwestward .
Phenomenal strengthening then occurred , and when the storm reached the middle Florida Keys on Sept. 2 , it was a Category 5 hurricane .
After roaring through the Keys , the hurricane turned gradually northward almost parallel to the Florida west coast until it again made landfall near Cedar Key as a Category 2 hurricane on the 4th .
A northeastward motion took the storm across the southeastern United States to the Atlantic coast near Norfolk , Virgina on Sept. 6 . It continued into the Atlantic , becoming extratropical on the 7th and last being detected on the 10th .
No wind measurements are available from the core of this small , but vicious hurricane .
However , a pressure of 26.35 inches measured at Long Key , Florida , makes this the most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States and the second most intense hurricane of record in the Atlantic basin ( surpassed only by the 26.22 inches observed in Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 ) .
The combination of winds and tides were responsible for 408 deaths in the Florida Keys , primarily among World War I veterans working in the area .
Damage in the United States was estimated at $ 6 million .
New England Hurricane 1938
The " Long Island Express " was first detected over the tropical Atlantic on Sept. 13 , although it may have formed a few days earlier .
Moving generally west - northwestward , it passed to the north of Puerto Rico on the 18th and 19th , likely as a category 5 hurricane .
It turned northward on Sept. 20 and by the morning of the 21st it was 100 to 150 miles east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina .
At that point , the hurricane accelerated to a forward motion of 60 to 70 mph , making landfall over Long Island and Connecticut that afternoon as a Category 3 hurricane .
The storm became extratropical after landfall and dissipated over southeastern Canada on Sept. 22 .
Blue Hill Observatory , Massachusetts , measured sustained winds of 121 mph with gusts to 183 mph ( likely influenced by terrain ) .
A U.S. Coast Guard station on Long Island measured a minimum pressure of 27.94 inches .
Storm surges of 10 to 12 feet inundated portions of the coast from Long Island and Connecticut eastward to southeastern Massachusetts , with the most notable surges in Narragansett Bay and Buzzards Bay .
Heavy rains before and during the hurricane produced river flooding , most notably along the Connecticut River .
This hurricane struck with little warning and was responsible for 600 deaths and $ 308 million in damage in the United States .
Great Atlantic Hurricane 1944
This large and powerful hurricane was first detected northeast of the Leeward Islands on Sept.
9 . It moved west - northwestward through the 12th , then turned northward on a track that brought the center near Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , on the 14th .
The cyclone accelerated north - northeastward , moving across eastern New England and into Canada by Sept. 15 .
The storm became extratropical over Canada and finally merged with a larger low near Greenland on Sept. 16 .
This hurricane was of Category 3 intensity at landfalls at Cape Hatteras , Long Island , and Point Judith , Rhode Island , and Category 2 as far north as the coast of Maine .
Cape Henry , Va. , reported 134 mph sustained winds ( measured 90 ft above the ground ) with estimated gusts to 150 mph .
Widespread hurricane - force winds were reported elsewhere along the storm track from North Carolina to Massachusetts with a maximum reported gust of 109 mph at Hartford , Connecticut .
Rainfall totals of 6 to 11 inches accompanied the storm .
While this hurricane caused 46 deaths and $ 100 million in damage in the United States , the worst effects occurred at sea where it wreaked havoc on World War II shipping .
Five ships , including a U.S. Navy destroyer and minesweeper , two U. S. Coast Guard cutters , and a light vessel , sank due to the storm causing 344 deaths .
Hurricanes Carol and Edna 1954
Carol formed near the central Bahama Islands on Aug. 25 , and moved slowly northward and north - northwestward .
By Aug. 30 it was a hurricane about 100 - 150 miles east of Charleston , South Carolina .
It then accelerated north - northeastward , make landfall as a Category 3 hurricane over Long Island , New York , and Connecticut on the 31st .
The cyclone became extratropical later that day as it crossed the remainder of New England and southeastern Canada .
Sustained winds of 80 to 100 mph were reported over much of eastern Connecticut , all of Rhode Island , and eastern Massachusetts .
A peak gust of 130 mph was reported at Block Island , Rhode Island , while gusts of 100 to 125 mph occurred over much of the rest of the affected area .
Storm surge flooding occurred along the New England coast from Long Island northward , with water depths of 8 to 10 feet reported in downtown Providence , Rhode Island .
Carol was responsible for 60 deaths and $ 461 million in damage in the United States .
No discussion of Carol is complete without mention of the remarkably similar Hurricane Edna .
This storm first formed east of the Windward Islands on Sept.
2 . It moved northwestward , and by Sept. 7 it was a hurricane very near where Carol had formed two weeks before .
From this point , Edna followed a path just east of Carol's .
It accelerated past Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , on Sept. 10 and made landfall over Cape Cod as a Category 3 hurricane the next day .
Edna moved across Maine into eastern Canada later on the 11th as it became extratropical .
Martha's Vinyard , Massachusetts , reported a peak wind gust of 120 mph during Edna , and much of the rest of the affected area had gusts of 80 to 100 mph .
The storm was responsible for 20 deaths and $ 40 million in damage in the United States .
Hurricane Hazel 1954
Hazel was first spotted east of the Windward Islands on Oct.
5 . It moved through the islands later that day as a hurricane , then it moved westward over the southern Caribbean Sea through Oct.
8 . A slow turn to the north - northeast occurred from Oct. 9 - 12 , with Hazel crossing western Haiti as a hurricane on the 12th .
The hurricane turned northward and crossed the southeastern Bahamas on the 13th , followed by a northwestward turn on the 14th .
Hazel turned north and accelerated on Oct. 15 , making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near the North Carolina - South Carolina border .
Subsequent rapid motion over the next 12 hours took the storm from the coast across the eastern United States into southeastern Canada as it became extratropical .
High winds occurred over large portions of the eastern United States .
Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , reported a peak wind gust of 106 mph , and winds were estimated at 130 to 150 mph along the coast between Myrtle Beach and Cape Fear , North Carolina .
Washington , D.C. , reported 78 mph sustained winds , and peak gusts of over 90 mph occurred as far northward as inland New York state .
A storm surge of up to 18 feet inundated portions of the North Carolina coast .
Heavy rains of up to 11 inches occurred as far northward as Toronto , Canada , resulting in severe flooding .
Hazel was responsible for 95 deaths and $ 281 million in damage in the United States , 100 deaths and $ 100 million in damage in Canada , and an estimated 400 to 1,000 deaths in Haiti .
Hurricanes Connie and Diane 1955
These two hurricanes must be mentioned together .
They struck the North Carolina coast only five days apart , and the rains from Connie set the stage for the devastating floods caused by Diane .
Connie was first detected as a tropical storm over the tropical Atlantic on Aug .
3 . It moved just north of west for several days , reaching hurricane strength several hundred miles northeast of the Leeward Islands on the 5th .
After passing north of the Leewards on the 6th , Connie turned northwestward - a motion that continued until the 10th .
An erratic , generally north - northwestward motion then brought Connie to the North Carolina coast on Aug. 12 as a Category 3 hurricane .
This was followed by a gradual northwestward turn through Aug. 14 , when Connie dissipated over the eastern Great Lakes .
Fort Macon , North Carolina , reported 75 mph sustained winds with gusts to 100 mph , while a storm surge of up to 8 feet occurred along the coast .
There were no reported deaths and the damage in the United States was $ 40 million .
However , the most significant aspect of Connie was the rainfall of up to 12 inches that affected the northeastern United States .
Diane was first detected over the tropical Atlantic on Aug .
7 . Moving generally west - northwestward , the cyclone became a tropical storm on the 9th .
Diane became a hurricane on Aug. 11 , by which time it was moving northwestward .
A northward turn occurred on the 12th , followed by a westward turn on the 13th and a west - northwestward motion on the 14th .
This motion brought Diane to the North Carolina coast on Aug. 17 as a Category 1 hurricane .
The storm turned northward across Virginia , then it turned northeastward and moved back into the Atlantic near Long Island , New York , on Aug. 19 .
Diane became extratropical over the North Atlantic on the 21st .
Hurricane conditions affected only a small part of the North Carolina coast , and the damage from winds and tides was relatively minor .
The main impact was heavy rains .
Diane poured 10 to 20 inches of rain on areas soaked by Connie just a few days before , producing widespread severe flooding from North Carolina to Massachusetts .
The floods were responsible were 184 deaths and $ 832 million in damage .
Hurricane Audrey 1957
Audrey was first detected over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 24 .
It moved slowly northward as it became a tropical storm and a hurricane the next day .
A faster northward motion brought the center to the coast near the Texas - Louisiana border on the 27th .
Rapid strengthening in the last six hours before landfall meant Audrey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane .
The cyclone turned northeastward after landfall , becoming extratropical over northern Mississippi on June 28 and merging with another low over the Great Lakes the next day .
The combined system was responsible for strong winds and heavy rains over portions of the eastern United States and Canada .
No reliable wind or pressure measurements are available from Audrey 's core at landfall .
The main impact was from 8 - to 12 - foot storm surges that penetrated as far inland as 25 miles over portions of low - lying southwestern Louisiana .
These surges were responsible for the vast majority of the 390 deaths from Audrey .
Damage in the United States was estimated at $ 150 million .
Hurricane Donna 1960
One of the all - time great hurricanes , Donna was first detected as a tropical wave moving off the African coast on Aug. 29 .
It became a tropical storm over the tropical Atlantic the next day and a hurricane on Sept.
1 . Donna followed a general west - northwestward track for the following five days , passing over the northern Leeward Islands on the 4th and 5th as a Category 4 hurricane and then to the north of Puerto Rico later on the 5th .
Donna turned westward on Sept. 7 and passed through the southeastern Bahamas .
A northwestward turn on the 9th brought the hurricane to the middle Florida Keys the next day at Category 4 intensity .
Donna then curved northeastward , crossing the Florida Peninsula on Sept. 11 , followed by eastern North Carolina ( Category 3 ) on the 12th , and the New England states ( Category 3 on Long Island and Categories 1 to 2 elsewhere ) on the 12th and 13th .
The storm became extratropical over eastern Canada on the 13th .
Donna is the only hurricane of record to produce hurricane - force winds in Florida , the Mid-Atlantic states , and New England .
Sombrero Key , Florida reported 128 mph sustained winds with gusts to 150 mph .
In the Mid-Atlantic states , Elizabeth City , North Carolina , reported 83 mph sustained winds , while Manteo , North Carolina , reported a 120 - mph gust .
In New England , Block Island , Rhode Island , reported 95 mph sustained winds with gusts to 130 mph .
Donna caused storm surges of up to 13 feet in the Florida Keys and 11 - foot surges along the southwest coast of Florida .
Four to eight foot surges were reported along portions of the North Carolina coast , with 5 to 10 foot surges along portions of the New England coast .
Heavy rainfalls of 10 to 15 inches occurred in Puerto Rico , 6 to 12 inches in Florida , and 4 to 8 inches elsewhere along the path of the hurricane .
The landfall pressure of 27.46 inches makes Donna the fifth strongest hurricane of record to hit the United States .
It was responsible for 50 deaths in the United States .
One hundred and fourteen deaths were reported from the Leeward Islands to the Bahamas , including 107 in Puerto Rico caused by flooding from the heavy rains .
The hurricane caused $ 387 million in damage in the United States and $ 13 million elsewhere along its path .
Hurricane Camille 1969
This powerful , deadly , and destructive hurricane formed just west of the Cayman Islands on Aug. 14 .
It rapidly intensified and by the time it reached western Cuba the next day it was a Category 3 hurricane .
Camille tracked north - northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 5 hurricane on Aug. 16 .
The hurricane maintained this intensity until it made landfall along the Mississippi coast late on the 17th .
Camille weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed Mississippi into western Tennessee and Kentucky , then it turned eastward across West Virginia and Virginia .
The cyclone moved into the Atlantic on Aug. 20 and regained tropical storm strength before becoming extratropical on the 22nd .
A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis , Mississippi , which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States .
The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known , as the hurricane destroyed all the wind - recording instruments in the landfall area .
The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph .
Columbia , Mississippi , located 75 miles inland , reported 120 mph sustained winds .
A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian , Mississippi .
The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches .
However , as Camille passed over the Virginias , it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches .
Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding .
The combination of winds , surges , and rainfalls caused 256 deaths ( 143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods ) and $ 1.421 billion in damage .
Three deaths were reported in Cuba .
Hurricane Agnes 1972
The large disturbance that became Agnes was first detected over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on June 14 .
The system drifted eastward and became a tropical depression later that day and a tropical storm over the northwestern Caribbean on the 16th .
Agnes turned northward on June 17 and became a hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico the next day .
A continued northward motion brought Agnes to the Florida Panhandle coast on June 19 as a Category 1 hurricane .
Agnes turned northeastward after landfall and weakened to a depression over Georgia .
However , it regained tropical storm strength over eastern North Carolina on June 21 and moved into the Atlantic later that day .
A northwestward turn followed , and a just - under - hurricane - strength Agnes made a final landfall on the 22nd near New York , New York .
The storm merged with a non-tropical low on June 23rd , with the combined system affecting the northeastern United States until the 25th .
Agnes was barely a hurricane at landfall in Florida , and the effects of winds and storm surges were relatively minor .
The major impact was over the northeastern United States , where Agnes combined with the non-tropical low to produce widespread rains of 6 to 12 inches with local amounts of 14 to 19 inches .
These rains produced widespread severe flooding from Virginia northward to New York , with other flooding occurring over the western portions of the Carolinas .
Agnes caused 122 deaths in the United States .
Nine of these were in Florida ( mainly from severe thunderstorms ) while the remainder were associated with the flooding .
The storm was responsible for $ 2.1 billion in damage in the United States , the vast majority of which came from the flooding .
Agnes also affected western Cuba , where seven additional deaths occurred .
Tropical Storm Claudette 1979
Claudette was first detected as a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on July 11 .
The wave spawned a tropical depression on July 16 that briefly became a tropical storm the next day as it approached the Leeward and Virgin Islands .
Claudette weakened to a tropical depression and then a tropical wave while passing near Puerto Rico on the 18th , and little re-development occurred until the system moved into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on the 21st .
Claudette regained tropical storm strength over the western Gulf on July 23 and made landfall the next day near the Louisiana - Texas border .
It made a slow loop over southeastern Texas on the 24th and 25th , followed by a northward motion into Oklahoma on the 27th .
The remnants of Claudette turned eastward and merged with a frontal system over West Virginia on July 29 .
Claudette produced tropical storm conditions along portions of the Texas and Louisiana coasts , but the storm will be most remembered for its rainfall .
Widespread amounts in excess of 10 inches occurred over portions of southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana , with several local amounts in excess of 30 inches .
An observer west of Alvin , Texas , reported 43 inches in 24 hours , which is a United States record for 24 hour rainfall amount .
The storm total at that location was 45 inches .
The rains produced severe flooding that was responsible for one death and $ 400 million in damage .
The storm also produced heavy rains over portions of Puerto Rico that were responsible for one death .
Hurricane Alicia 1983
Alicia formed over the north central Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 15 .
It drifted slowly westward and northwestward while steadily strengthening on the 16th and 17th .
This motion brought Alicia over the western end of Galveston Island , Texas as a Category 3 hurricane on Aug. 18 .
Alicia moved northwestward into Oklahoma as a tropical depression on Aug. 19 , then turned northward before dissipating over Nebraska on the 21st .
The Coast Guard cutter Buttonwood moored at Galveston reported sustained winds of 96 mph with gusts to 125 mph .
Hobby Airport at Houston , Texas , reported 94 mph sustained winds with gusts to 107 mph .
Wind gusts of hurricane force in downtown Houston littered the streets with broken glass as windows broke in the high - rise buildings .
Additionally , twenty - three tornadoes were reported from Alicia .
Alicia was responsible for 21 deaths and $ 2 billion in damage in the United States .
Hurricane Gilbert 1988
A tropical wave exiting the African coastline on Sept. 3 developed into the 12th tropical depression of the season on Sept. 8 while approaching the Windward Islands .
The cyclone rapidly strengthened to hurricane status on Sept. 10 as a west - northwest motion brought Gilbert into the eastern Caribbean Sea .
Gilbert passed directly over Jamaica on Sept. 12 as a major hurricane , becoming the first direct impact for the island from a hurricane since 1951 .
Winds gusted to nearly 150 mph as Gilbert produced a 9 - foot storm surge along Jamaica ’s northeast coast .
Jamaica was devastated as the eyewall traversed the entire length of the island .
During this period the eye contracted from 25 miles to only 12 miles upon exiting Jamaica .
Gilbert emerged off the western coastline of Jamaica and began a period of extraordinarily rapid intensification .
The ferocious hurricane strengthened to Category 4 status as its northern eyewall pounded Grand Cayman Island with 155 mph wind gusts early on Sept. 13 .
Gilbert ’s remarkable intensification trend continued as the cyclone reached Category 5 status on the afternoon of the 13th and eventually reached peak winds of 185 mph .
The minimum central pressure of the cyclone plummeted to 888 millibars , which represented a 70 - millibar drop in only a 24 - hour period .
This minimum central pressure recorded by NOAA aircraft remains the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western hemisphere .
Gilbert crossed the northeast coast of Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula on Sept. 14 , becoming the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin to strike land since Camille in 1969 .
Gilbert weakened over the Yucatan peninsula and emerged into the western Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane .
Gilbert ’s large circulation regained major hurricane status as the cyclone continued on a west - northwest course on the 16th .
The hurricane made its final landfall near the town of La Pesca on the Mexican Gulf Coast on the evening of Sept. 16 as a strong Category 3 hurricane .
Gilbert ’s remnants spawned 29 tornadoes over Texas on Sept. 18 , with flooding spreading to the Midwest as the remnants merged with a frontal boundary over Missouri on Sept. 19 .
Although no reliable measurements of storm surge exist from Gilbert ’s two Mexican landfalls , estimates are that Gilbert produced between 15 and 20 feet of surge along the Yucatan and 8 to 13 feet at landfall in mainland Mexico .
Gilbert ’s large size and impacts were felt over much of the Caribbean , Central America as well as portions of the United States .
The death toll of 318 gives an idea of the scope of Gilbert 's impacts : Mexico 202 , Jamaica 45 , Haiti 30 , Guatemala 12 , Honduras 12 , Dominican Republic 5 , Venezuela 5 , United States 3 , Costa Rica 2 , and Nicaragua 2 .
The deaths from Costa Rica , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua , and Venezuela were caused by inland flash flooding from outer rainbands .
Hurricane Hugo 1989
This classic Cape Verde hurricane was first detected as a tropical wave emerging from the coast of Africa on Sept.
9 . Moving steadily westward , the system became a tropical depression the next day , a tropical storm on the 11th , and a hurricane on the 13th .
Hugo turned west - northwest on Sept. 15 as it became a Category 5 hurricane .
It was still a Category 4 hurricane when the center moved through the Leeward Islands and St. Croix , U.S. Virgin Islands , and the 18th .
Turning northwestward , the center passed across the eastern end of Puerto Rico on Sept. 19 .
This general motion would continue with some acceleration until Hugo made landfall just north of Charleston , South Carolina , on Sept. 22 .
Strengthening in the last twelve hours before landfall made Hugo a Category 4 hurricane at the coast .
After landfall , the storm gradually recurved northeastward , becoming extratropical over southeastern Canada on Sept. 23 .
The Naval Air Station at Roosevelt Roads , Puerto Rico , reported sustained winds of 104 mph with gusts to 120 mph , which were the highest winds reported from the Caribbean .
A ship moored in the Sampit River in South Carolina measured sustained winds of 120 mph .
High winds associated with Hugo extended far inland , with Shaw Air Force Base , South Carolina , reporting 67 mph sustained winds with gusts to 110 mph and Charlotte , North Carolina , reporting 69 mph sustained winds and gusts to 99 mph .
Storm surge from Hugo inundated the South Carolina Coast from Charleston to Myrtle Beach , with maximum storm tides of 20 feet observed in the Cape Romain - Bulls Bay area .
Hugo was responsible for 21 deaths in the mainland United States , five more in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands , and 24 more elsewhere in the Caribbean .
Damage estimates are $ 7 billion in the mainland United States and $ 1 billion in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
Hurricane Andrew 1992
The most destructive United States hurricane of record , at the time , started modestly as a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on Aug. 14 .
The wave spawned a tropical depression on Aug. 16 , which became Tropical Storm Andrew the next day .
Further development was slow , as the west - northwestward moving Andrew encountered an unfavorable upper - level trough .
Indeed , the storm almost dissipated on Aug. 20 due to vertical wind shear .
By Aug. 21 , Andrew was midway between Bermuda and Puerto Rico and turning westward into a more favorable environment .
Rapid strengthening occurred , with Andrew reaching hurricane strength on the 22nd and Category 4 status on the 23rd .
After briefly weakening over the Bahamas , Andrew regained Category 4 status as it blasted its way across south Florida on Aug. 24 .
The hurricane continued westward into the Gulf of Mexico where it gradually turned northward .
This motion brought Andrew to the central Louisiana coast on Aug. 26 as a Category 3 hurricane .
Andrew then turned northeastward , eventually merging with a frontal system over the Mid-Atlantic states on Aug. 28 .
Reports from private barometers helped establish that Andrew 's central pressure at landfall in Homestead , Florida , was 27.23 inches , which makes it the third most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States .
Andrew 's peak winds in south Florida were not directly measured due to destruction of the measuring instruments .
An automated station at Fowey Rocks reported 142 mph sustained winds with gusts to 169 mph ( measured 144 feet above the ground ) , and higher values may have occurred after the station was damaged and stopped reporting .
The National Hurricane Center had a peak gust of 164 mph ( measured 130 feet above the ground ) , while a 177 mph gust was measured at a private home .
Additionally , Berwick , La. , reported 96 mph sustained winds with gusts to 120 mph .
Andrew produced a 17 - foot storm surge near the landfall point in Florida , while storm tides of at least 8 feet inundated portions of the Louisiana coast .
Andrew also produced a killer tornado in southeastern Louisiana .
Andrew was responsible for 23 deaths in the United States and three more in the Bahamas .
The hurricane caused $ 26.5 billion in damage in the United States , of which $ 1 billion occurred in Louisiana and the rest in south Florida .
The vast majority of the damage in Florida was due to the winds .
Damage in the Bahamas was estimated at $ 250 million .
Tropical Storm Alberto 1994
Alberto was first detected as a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on 18 June .
The wave moved into the western Caribbean by late June and formed into a tropical depression near the western tip of Cuba on June 30 .
The cyclone moved northwest through July 1 as it became a tropical storm , then it turned northward .
This motion continued until the cyclone made landfall in the western Florida Panhandle on the 4th .
Alberto then moved north - northeastward into western Georgia , where it did a loop on the 5th and 6th .
The cyclone finally dissipated over central Alabama on July 7 .
Alberto's winds and tides produced only minor damage at the coast , but the excessive rains that fell in Georgia , Alabama , and western Florida were another story .
Amounts exceeded 10 inches in many locations , with the maximum being the 27.61 inch storm total at Americus , GA ( including 21 inches in 24 hours ) .
Severe flooding resulted over large portions of southern Georgia , western Alabama , and the western Florida Panhandle .
The floods were responsible for 30 deaths and $ 500 million in damage .
Hurricane Opal 1995
Opal was first detected as a tropical wave moving off the African coast on September 11 .
The waved moved westward through the Atlantic and Caribbean and merged with a broad low pressure area over the western Caribbean on September 23 .
The combined system then developed into a tropical depression near the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on September 27 .
The depression drifted slowly northward , becoming Tropical Storm Opal as it reached the north coast of Yucatan on the 30th .
Opal then moved slowly westward into the Bay of Campeche , where it became a hurricane on October 2 .
A gradual north - northeastward turn started later on the 2nd , with acceleration on the 3rd and 4th .
Opal continued to strengthen , and a period of rapid strengthening late of the 3rd and early on the 4th made it a Category 4 hurricane .
Weakening followed , and Opal was a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall near Pensacola Beach , Florida late on the 4th .
Opal continued quickly north - northeastward and became extratropical over the Ohio Valley on the 5th .
The cyclone was last seen over the eastern Great Lakes on October 6 .
Hurlbert Field , Florida reported sustained winds of 84 mph with a peak gust of 144 mph , and gusts to 70 mph occurred as far inland as northwest Georgia .
However , the main impact from Opal was from storm surge .
A combination of storm surge and breaking waves inundated portions of the western Florida Panhandle coast to a depth of 10 to 20 ft .
The surge was responsible for the bulk of the $ 3 billion in damage attributed to Opal in the United States .
Opal was responsible for 9 deaths in the United States , including 8 from falling trees and one from a tornado .
Opal was responsible for 50 deaths in Mexico and Guatemala due to flooding caused by heavy rains .
Hurricane Mitch 1998
This powerful hurricane began developing over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on 22 October .
It drifted westward and became a tropical storm later that day , then turned northward and became a hurricane by the 24th .
Mitch then turned westward again and rapidly strengthened , becoming a Category 5 hurricane with a central pressure of 905 mb on the 26th .
After passing over Swan Island on the 27th , a weakening Mitch moved slowly southward near the coastal Islands of Honduras .
It made landfall over northern Honduras on the 29th as a Category 1 hurricane .
Mitch gradually turned westward after landfall , and the surface center dissipated neat the Guatemala - Honduras border on 1 November .
The remnant circulation aloft reached the Bay of Campeche on 2 November and began developing again .
The re-born Mitch became a tropical storm on 3 November , then moved northeastward across the Yucatan Peninsula on the 4th .
Mitch crossed south Florida as a tropical storm on the 5th and then became extratropical later that day .
The extratropical cyclone remained strong as it crossed the Atlantic , eventually affecting the British Isles and Iceland on the 9th and 10th .
Mitch ravaged the offshore islands of Honduras with high winds , seas , and storm surge .
However the greatest impact was widespread heavy rains and severe floods in Honduras , Nicaragua , Guatemala , and El Salvador .
Mitch caused an estimated 9,000 deaths in Central America with another 9,000 missing .
Thirty - one people died when the schooner Fantome sank as it encountered the high winds and seas associated with the hurricane .
Two people died in the Florida Keys when a fishing boat capsized .
Mitch caused tremendous property , infrastructure , and crop damage in Central America , and an additional $ 40 million in damage in Florida .
Hurricane Floyd 1999
Floyd was first detected as a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September 2 .
The system developed into a tropical depression over the tropical Atlantic on September 7 .
Moving steadily west - northwestward , the system became a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane on the 10th .
A northwestward turn late on the 10th was followed by a westward turn on the 12th , with the second turn marking the time Floyd started strengthening in earnest .
It became a Category 4 hurricane on September 13 as it approached the central Bahama Islands .
A west - northwestward turn late on the 13th took the center through the northeastern Bahamas .
This was followed by a gradual turn to the north - northeast , which brought the center to the North Carolina coast near Cape Fear on September 16 as a Category 2 hurricane .
Floyd continued north - northeastward along the coast of the Mid-Atlantic into New England , where the storm became extratropical on the 17th .
The remnants of Floyd merged with a large non-tropical low on September 19 .
While wind gusts of 120 mph and storm surges of 9 to 10 ft were reported from the North Carolina coast , Floyd will be most remembered in the United States for its rainfall .
The combination of Floyd and a frontal system over the eastern United States produced widespread rainfalls in excess of 10 inches from North Carolina northeastward , with amounts as high as 19.06 inches in Wilmington , North Carolina and 13.70 inches at Brewster , New York .
These rains , aided by rains from Tropical Storm Dennis two weeks earlier , caused widespread severe flooding that caused the majority of the $ 3 to 6 billion in damage caused by Floyd .
These floods also were responsible for 50 of the 56 deaths caused by Floyd in the United States .
Floyd also caused damage in the Bahamas , with one death reported .
Hurricane Keith 2000
Keith began developing on 28 September when a tropical depression formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea .
The cyclone moved slowly northwestward on the 29th as it became a tropical storm , then it rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane on the 30th while drifting westward toward the coast of Belize .
Keith stalled with the eyewall over the offshore islands of Belize on 1 October , and it was n't until the 3rd that the center made landfall in Belize .
Keith weakened during this time and was a tropical storm at landfall .
It moved west - northwestward over the Yucatan Peninsula and further weakened to a depression on the 4th .
Keith emerged in the Bay of Campeche late that day and quickly regained tropical storm strength .
It again became a hurricane on the 5th before making landfall just north of Tampico , Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane .
The cyclone dissipated over northeastern Mexico the next day .
Keith was responsible for 24 deaths - 12 in Nicaragua , 5 in Belize , 6 in Honduras , and 1 in Mexico .
The deaths in Belize occurred when two catamarans broke loose during the storm , while 5 of the deaths in Honduras occurred when an airplane disappeared near Roatan Island .
Damage to property , agriculture , and tourism in Belize was estimated at $ 225 million .
Tropical Storm Allison 2001
Allison 's long and complex career began on 5 June as an area of disturbed weather over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico developed into a tropical storm .
The storm made landfall near Freeport , Texas later that day .
Allison weakened to a depression on the 6th , while drifting northward , then it made a slow loop over southeastern Texas from the 7th to the 9th .
The cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico on the 10th and acquired subtropical characteristics .
It then moved east - northeastward over southeastern Louisiana on the 11th , where it re-intensified into a subtropical storm .
Allison weakened back to a subtropical depression on the 12th while continuing east - northeastward , and this motion carried it to southeastern North Carolina by the 14th where it again stalled .
The cyclone drifted northward to northeastward drift over land on the 15th and 16th .
This was followed by a faster northeastward motion on the 17th as the center emerged into the Atlantic .
Allison regained subtropical storm strength later that day before becoming extratropical on the 18th southeast of Cape Cod .
The system dissipated southeast of Nova Scotia the next day .
Allison brought tropical - storm - force winds and above normal tides to portions of the Texas and Louisiana coasts .
However , the greatest legacy of the cyclone was the widespread heavy rains and resulting floods along the entire path of the cyclone .
Houston , Texas , was the worst affected area , as the Port of Houston reported 36.99 inches and several other locations reported more than 30 inches .
The storm also spawned 23 tornadoes .
Allison was responsible for 41 deaths and at least $ 5 billion in damage in the United States , making it the deadliest and costliest U. S. tropical storm of record .
Hurricane Iris 2001
Iris first became a tropical depression just east of the lesser Antilles on 4 October .
The depression tracked west - northwestward into the eastern Caribbean where it became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th .
Iris then turned westward , passing just south of Jamaica on the 7th .
The storm then moved quickly west - southwestward toward the coast of Belize as it became a small but powerful Category 4 hurricane on the 8th ( figure ) .
Iris made landfall over southern Belize early on the 9th at Category 4 intensity , then quickly weakened after landfall to dissipation later that day .
The winds and storm surges of Iris caused severe damage over portions of the southern Belize coast .
The storm was responsible for 31 deaths , including 20 in Belize , 8 in Guatemala , and 3 in the Dominican Republic .
The deaths in Belize occurred when the M/V Wave Dancer capsized in port , killing 20 of the 28 people on board .
Hurricane Isabel 2003
A well - organized but slow moving tropical wave that exited the African coastline on September 1st developed into Tropical Storm Isabel on the morning of September 6th .
Isabel became a hurricane on September 7th and rapidly intensified to Category 4 hurricane strength on the evening of the 8th while the eye was located more than 1100 miles to the east of the Leeward Islands .
This impressive hurricane reached Category 5 strength on September 11th , making Isabel the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Mitch in October 1998 .
The cyclone turned northwestward around the western periphery of the Atlantic ridge beginning on the 15th .
Isabel began to weaken on the 15th as conditions aloft became more hostile , and it fell below major hurricane strength for the first time in eight days on the 16th
Although weakening , Isabel ’s wind field continued to expand as hurricane warnings were issued for most of the North Carolina and Virginia coastline , including the Chesapeake Bay .
Isabel ’s large eye pushed ashore just after the noon hour on September 18th near Drum Inlet along North Carolina ’s Outer Banks .
Isabel was the worst hurricane to affect the Chesapeake Bay region since 1933 .
Storm surge values of more than 8 feet flooded rivers that flowed into the Bay across Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , and Washington , D.C. Isabel brought tropical storm force gusts as far north as New York State as it moved inland .
The most intense hurricane of the 2003 season directly resulted in 17 deaths and more than 3 billion dollars * in damages .
The large wind field toppled trees and cut power to more than four million customers .
Hurricane Charley 2004
Charley originated from a tropical wave , developing into a tropical depression on August 9 about 115 miles south - southeast of Barbados .
The depression strengthened within a low - shear environment to a tropical storm early the next day in the eastern Caribbean , and became a hurricane on the 11th near Jamaica .
Charley 's center passed about 40 miles southwest of the southwest coast of Jamaica , and then passed about 15 miles northeast of Grand Cayman as the hurricane reached category 2 strength on the 12th .
Charley turned to the north - northwest and continued to strengthen , making landfall in western Cuba as a category 3 hurricane with 120 m.p.h. maximum winds .
Charley weakened just after its passage over western Cuba ; its maximum winds decreased to about 110 m.p.h. by the time the center reached the Dry Tortugas around 8 am on the 13th .
Charley then came under the influence of an unseasonably strong mid-tropospheric trough that had dropped from the east - central United States into the eastern Gulf of Mexico .
The hurricane turned north - northeastward and accelerated toward the southwest coast of Florida as it began to intensify rapidly ; dropsonde measurements indicate that Charley 's central pressure fell from 964 mb to 941 mb in 4.5 hours .
By 10 am , the maximum winds had increased to near 125 m.p.h. , and three hours later had increased to 145 m.p.h. - category 4 strength .
Charley made landfall with maximum winds near 150 m.p.h. on the southwest coast of Florida just north of Captiva Island around 3:45 pm .
An hour later , Charley 's eye passed over Punta Gorda .
The hurricane then crossed central Florida , passing near Kissimmee and Orlando .
Charley was still of hurricane intensity around midnight when its center cleared the northeast coast of Florida near Daytona Beach .
After moving into the Atlantic , Charley came ashore again near Cape Romain , South Carolina near midday on the 14th as a category 1 hurricane .
The center then moved just offshore before making a final landfall at North Myrtle Beach .
Charley soon weakened to a tropical storm over southeastern North Carolina and became extratropical on the 15th as it moved back over water near Virginia Beach .
Although ferocious , Charley was a very small hurricane at its Florida landfall , with its maximum winds and storm surge located only about 6 - 7 miles from the center .
This helped minimize the extent and amplitude of the storm surge , which likely did not exceed 7 feet .
However , the hurricane 's violent winds devastated Punta Gorda and neighboring Port Charlotte .
Rainfall amounts were generally modest , less than 8 inches .
Charley also produced 16 tornadoes in Florida , North Carolina and Virginia .
The total U. S. damage is estimated to be near $ 15 billion , making Charley the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history .
Casualties were remarkably low , given the strength of the hurricane and the destruction that resulted .
Charley was directly responsible for ten deaths in the United States .
There were also four deaths in Cuba and one in Jamaica .
Hurricane Frances 2004
Frances developed from a tropical wave , becoming a tropical depression on August 25 several hundred miles west - southwest of the southern Cape Verde Islands , a tropical storm later that day , and a hurricane the following day .
Frances moved generally west - northwestward for the next several days , passing north of the Leeward Islands on the 31st and just north of the Turks and Caicos Islands on the 2nd .
During this time , Frances ' peak winds reached 145 m.p.h. ( category 4 ) on two occasions while the hurricane underwent a series of concentric eyewall cycles .
Westerly wind shear then caused Frances to weaken to a category 2 hurricane by the time it passed over the northwestern Bahamas on the 4th .
Frances made landfall near Stuart , Florida just after midnight on the 5th with 105 m.p.h. ( category 2 ) maximum winds .
Frances gradually weakened as it moved slowly across the Florida Peninsula , and became a tropical storm just before emerging into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico early on September 6 .
Frances made a final landfall in the Florida Big Bend region that afternoon as a tropical storm .
Frances weakened over the southeastern United States and became extratropical over West Virginia on the 9th .
Frances produced a storm surge of nearly 6 feet at its Florida east coast landfall , and caused widespread heavy rains and associated freshwater flooding over much of the eastern United States , with a maximum reported rainfall of 18.07 inches at Linville Falls , North Carolina .
Frances was also associated with an outbreak of over 100 tornadoes throughout the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states .
Eight deaths resulted from the forces of the storm - seven in the United States and one in the Bahamas .
U.S. damage is estimated to be near $ 8.9 billion , over 90 % of which occurred in Florida .
Hurricane Ivan 2004
Ivan developed from a large tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa on August 31 , and spawned a tropical depression two days later .
The depression reached storm strength on September 3rd ( one of only a dozen on record to do so south of 10EN ) and continued to strengthen .
By the 5th , Ivan had become a hurricane about 1150 miles east of the southern Windward Islands .
Eighteen hours later Ivan became the southernmost storm to reach major hurricane status , at 10.2EN .
Ivan was a category 3 hurricane when the center passed about 7 miles south of Grenada , a path that took the northern eyewall of Ivan directly over the island .
In the Caribbean , Ivan became a category 5 hurricane , with winds of 160 m.p.h. , on the 9th when it was south of the Dominican Republic , and on two occasions the minimum pressure fell to 910 mb .
The center of Ivan passed within about 20 miles of Jamaica on the 11th and a similar distance from Grand Cayman on the 12th , with Grand Cayman likely experiencing sustained winds of category 4 strength .
Ivan then turned to the northwest and passed through the Yucatan channel on the 14th , bringing hurricane conditions to extreme western Cuba .
Ivan moved across the east - central Gulf of Mexico , making landfall as a major hurricane with sustained winds of near 120 m.p.h. on the 16th just west of Gulf Shores , Alabama .
Ivan weakened as it moved inland , producing over 100 tornadoes and heavy rains across much of the southeastern United States , before merging with a frontal system over the Delmarva Peninsula on the 18th .
While this would normally be the end of the story , the extratropical remnant low of Ivan split off from the frontal system and drifted southward in the western Atlantic for several days , crossed southern Florida , and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico on the 21st .
The low re-acquired tropical characteristics , becoming a tropical storm for the second time on the 22nd in the central Gulf .
Ivan weakened before it made its final landfall in southwestern Louisiana as a tropical depression on the 24th .
Ivan 's storm surge completely over - washed the island of Grand Cayman , where an estimated 95 % of the buildings were damaged or destroyed .
Surge heights of 10 - 15 feet occurred along the Gulf coast during Ivan 's first U.S. landfall .
Peak rainfall amounts in the Caribbean and United States were generally 10 - 15 inches .
The death toll from Ivan stands at 92 - 39 in Grenada , 25 in the United States , 17 in Jamaica , 4 in Dominican Republic , 3 in Venezuela , 2 in the Cayman Islands , and 1 each in Tobago and Barbados .
U.S. damage is estimated to be near $ 14.2 billion , the third largest total on record .
Hurricane Jeanne 2004
Jeanne formed from a tropical wave , becoming a tropical depression on September 13 near the Leeward Islands , and strengthening to a tropical storm the next day .
Moving west - northwestward , Jeanne struck Puerto Rico on the 15th with 70 m.p.h. winds and then strengthened to a hurricane just before making landfall in the Dominican Republic .
Jeanne spent nearly 36 hours over the rough terrain of Hispaniola , generating torrential rainfall before emerging into the Atlantic north of the island .
Steering currents in the western Atlantic were weak , and Jeanne moved slowly through and north of the southeastern Bahamas over the next five days while it gradually regained the strength it had lost over Hispaniola .
By the 23rd , high pressure had built in over the northeastern United States and western Atlantic , causing Jeanne to turn westward .
Jeanne strengthened and became a major hurricane on the 25th while the center moved over Abaco and then Grand Bahama Island .
Early on the 26th , the center of Jeanne 's 60 - mile - wide eye crossed the Florida coast near Stuart , at virtually the identical spot that Frances had come ashore three weeks earlier .
Maximum winds at the time of landfall are estimated to be near 120 m.p.h .
Jeanne weakened as it moved across central Florida , becoming a tropical storm during the afternoon of the 26th near Tampa , and then weakening to a depression a day later over central Georgia .
The depression was still accompanied by heavy rain when it moved over the Carolinas , Virginia , and the Delmarva Peninsula on the 28th and 29th before becoming extratropical .
Jeanne produced extreme rain accumulations in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola , with nearly 24 inches reported in Vieques .
Rains from the cyclone resulted in historic floods in Puerto Rico , and deadly flash - floods and mudslides in Haiti , where over 3000 people lost their lives and roughly 200,000 were left homeless .
Three deaths occurred in Florida , and one each in Puerto Rico , South Carolina , and Virginia .
In the United States , damage is estimated to be near $ 6.9 billion .
Hurricane Dennis 2005
Dennis formed from a tropical wave that moved westward across the coast of Africa on June 29 .
A tropical depression developed from the wave on July 4 near the southern Windward Islands .
The cyclone moved west - northwestward across the eastern and central Caribbean sea , became a tropical storm on July 5 , and strengthened into a hurricane early on July 6 about 245 miles east - southeast of Jamaica .
Dennis intensified over the next two days , becoming a major hurricane on July 7 and a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 150 mph the next day just south of central Cuba .
Dennis passed over Cabo Cruz , Cuba early on July 8 with winds of 135 mph , and then made landfall along the south - central coast of Cuba that afternoon near Cienfuegos with winds of 145 mph .
After landfall , Dennis passed near Havana and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before emerging over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico early on July 9 .
Although Dennis re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph early on July 10 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico , it weakened to Category 3 strength before making landfall over the western Florida Panhandle near Navarre Beach late that day .
Dennis degenerated to a low pressure area over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys , and it was eventually absorbed by an extratropical low over southeastern Canada on July 18 .
Dennis brought hurricane conditions to many portions of Cuba .
Cabo Cruz reported sustained winds of 133 mph with a gust to 148 mph at 0200 UTC July 8 , with a minimum pressure of 956 mb at 0240 UTC just before the eye passed over the station .
The anemometer was destroyed , and it is possible more extreme winds occurred .
Dennis also caused hurricane conditions in the western Florida Panhandle .
An instrumented tower run by the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program ( FCMP ) at Navarre measured 1 - min average winds ( 5 - m elevation ) of 99 mph and a gust to 121 mph at 1921 UTC July 10 .
Storm - total rainfalls in excess of 23 inches occurred on both Cuba and Jamaica .
Heavy rainfall also occurred over much of Florida and extended well inland over portions of the southeastern United States with the maximum amount of 12.80 inches near Camden , Alabama .
Ten tornadoes were reported in association with Dennis in the United States .
Dennis caused 42 deaths - 22 in Haiti , 16 in Cuba , 3 in the United States , and 1 in Jamaica .
The hurricane caused considerable damage across central and eastern Cuba as well as the western Florida Panhandle , including widespread utility and communications outages .
Considerable storm surge - related damage also occurred near St. Marks , Florida , well to the east of the landfall location .
The damage associated with Dennis in the United States is estimated at $ 2.23 billion .
Hurricane Katrina 2005
On Aug. 29 , 2005 , after passing over the Caribbean and Florida , Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir - Simpson scale with winds of 125 mph ( 201 kph ) .
Though it was not as strong as some of the other destructive storms that have hit the coast when it struck , Katrina had been a Category 5 the day before it hit land .
That previous strength and its large footprint in the Gulf of Mexico created large swells in the ocean waters , resulting in a huge , unrelenting storm surge when the hurricane finally did hit .
Storm surge flooding of 25 to 28 feet ( 7.6 to 8.5 m ) above normal tide level occurred along portions of the Mississippi coast , with storm surge flooding of 10 to 20 feet ( 3 to 6.1 m ) above normal tide levels along the southeastern Louisiana coast .
Ultimately , this storm surge was responsible for much of the damage as it flooded coastal communities , overwhelmed levees , and left at least 80 percent of New Orleans underwater .
By the time the hurricane subsided , Katrina had claimed more than 1,800 human lives and caused roughly $ 125 billion in damages .
It was the deadliest hurricane to strike the United States since the Palm Beach - Lake Okeechobee hurricane of September 1928 .

Jessica Dubroff
P
ILOT , TRAGIC MEDIA DARLING
May 5 , 1988 - April 11 , 1996
I figure Jessica will do more for civil aviation [ than anyone ] since Amelia Earhart .
- Lloyd Dubroff
Jessica Dubroff was born in Massachusetts in 1988 to management consultant Lloyd Dubroff and spiritual healer Lisa Hathaway .
The two separated four years later in California , never having married , and Jessica lived with and was homeschooled by her mother .
Her parents apparently maintained amiable relations , however , with Lloyd staying involved in his children 's lives .
Lisa encouraged her children to take charge of their lives and to passionately dedicate themselves to their own goals and interests , and Jessica developed just such an interest when she was six and her parents arranged to go up together in a small plane .
Starting flying lessons in November of 1996 , she developed a goal , as well : to be the youngest pilot to fly across the country .
The Guinness Book of World Records had ceased recognizing such " youngest pilot " records in fear of encouraging potentially unsafe flights after 9 - year - old Rachel Carter claimed the title in 1994 , but despite that lack of " official " recognition , 8 - year - old Killian Moss had broken her record in 1995 .
FAA regulations require pilots to be 16 years old to solo and 17 to acquire a license ( though it is possible to petition for and receive waivers granting exemptions ) , but any licensed pilot may allow any passenger , licensed or not , to take the controls .
The original pilot is officially noted as the " pilot in command " , regardless of their actual level of control over the flight , and is considered responsible for the aircraft .
Jessica planned to make her flight under the nominal pilotship of Jessica 's flight instructor Joe Reid , who was paid for his time , stated that he intended to leave Jessica in control except in case of emergencies ( most airplanes are fully controllable from both the pilot and copilot 's seats ) , and was reportedly somewhat amused by the whole thing .
At Jessica 's request , her father also accompanied her in the back seat of the plane , Reid 's Cessna Cardinal 177B , tail number N35207 .
The 177 is a fairly comfortable four - seat , high - wing airplane .
While I 've never flown one before , I 've flown similar models that are said to be functionally identical , and found them to be sturdy and reliable , with more than adequate power and handling .
The plan in its final form was for an eight day round trip , starting from Half Moon Bay , California on April the 10th , heading to the east coast , and then making their way back to where they started by the 17th .
As news of her intentions became known , Jessica became the subject of considerable media attention , the Today Show interviewing her crew prior to departure and planning to broadcast their east coast landing live , while local and regional outlets made arrangements to meet with and cover the group at every landing .
Jessica departed Half Moon Bay around 7 AM on April 10th .
By just after 5 PM , she made her third and final landing of the day at Cheyenne Municipal Airport in Cheyenne , Wyoming , for a total distance covered of just under a thousand miles as the crow flies .
At around 8:25 AM on the 11th , Dubroff took off from Cheyenne Municipal Airport in conditions of heavy rain with strong winds and occasional sleet and snow , the type of weather you occasionally see described as " wintry mix " .
Witnesses on the ground reported that the plane made an extremely shallow climb for a short period , began a turn to the right , and then apparently entered a stall and crashed to the ground in a residential neighborhood , about 4,000 feet from the end of the runway .
This was not even a crash landing , but rather an outright crash , with the nose of the plane striking a driveway at approximately a 60 degree angle .
Though there were no casualties and negligible property damage on the ground , the plane was destroyed , and all onboard were killed .
It is believed that Dubroff was not in control of the aircraft at the time of the crash - while Reid had claimed that he would keep his hands off the controls except in the case of emergency , this would certainly seem to qualify as such , and the discovery of the most severe fractures in his arm bones suggest that he was handling the yoke at the time of impact .
The NTSB report laid out several factors which together caused the crash .
First , and most obvious , were the weather conditions , in which it is generally agreed that flying was unadvisable and the takeoff should have been postponed .
Instead , the group decided to take off before the weather worsened and departure became entirely infeasible .
The decision not to postpone is attributed in large part to media commitments which dictated a strict adherence to the original itinerary .
The presence of a thunderstorm in the area , which would have been encountered if the plane continued to fly a straight path after takeoff , was credited for the rightward turn .
The force of lift acting on a plane is always perpendicular to the flight path and to the wings , and when banking less lift is acting upwards , and the plane does not rise as fast or may descend .
This did not in and of itself cause the crash , but an attempt to pull the aircraft 's nose higher to compensate may have contributed to the stall .
Further , between three people , supplies and luggage for same , and the many souvenirs accepted and promotional items given as gifts along the heavily publicized tour , the plane was a little less than a hundred pounds over its rated takeoff weight at the time it left the airport .
Cheyenne Airport is also located at a relatively high altitude , over 6,000 feet above sea level , a condition which neither Jessica or Reid had much familiarity with .
In layman 's terms , this means the air was thin and the engine power output is noticeably decreased unless the fuel / air mixture is adjusted , a relatively simple procedure , but one that it appears was not performed .
Both of these factors would decrease power , slow climb , and increase the " stall speed " , which indicates an airspeed below which the plane is likely to enter a stall .
Finally , though it is obviously difficult to assess in retrospect , there are suspicions that the flyers may not have had enough sleep and were fatigued , which would negatively affect awareness , reaction time , and decision - making .
In summary , the plane was taken up in adverse conditions , and with tolerances cut by several factors the pilots may not have been aware of , was pushed beyond its limits .
No signs of mechanical failure were found , and the accident was attributed entirely to human error .
None of this should be taken to say that Reid was particularly incompetent or foolhardy , however - the NTSB performs very exhaustive analyses of all such aircraft accidents , tracing and noting every possible contributing factor .
These are then published for other pilots to learn from , and I read the summaries of many such reports when I was taking flying lessons .
Believe you me , many people get in trouble arising from far stupider errors and poor decisions .
Many more do the same things or worse and come out of it fine - while Reid is not to be held blameless , the crash was a product of a number of factors ganging up and his luck falling through at the wrong time .
Lisa Hathaway , contacted for comment in the weeks after the crash , renounced any notions of regret over her daughter 's attempt , reaffirming her support for Jessica 's interest and ambition , and placing the death in the context of Jessica 's following her dream .
Somewhat eerily , she quoted Jessica as having earlier proclaimed that " I want to fly until I die " .
Jessica 's 9 - year - old brother Joshua reportedly intended to perform a memorial overflight of Jessica 's funeral , well - attended by the media , but was prevented by bad weather .
In the wake of Jessica 's death , there were scattered calls for something to be done , though it was often unclear what the specific problem was or what should be done to address it .
Resisting ( rightly , in my opinion ) calls to enact a minimum age to operate an aircraft , the FAA waited out the media cycle doing nothing more than issuing a few advisories , essentially reminders to pilots to pay attention to what they were doing .
A vaguely showboating inquiry was convened and an attempt to legislate an age restriction surfaced in Congress , but died in committee .
With a minimum of public attention , insurance claims were negotiated , and the matter dropped off the radar entirely .
As of this node 's date of writing , there have been no further publicly acknowledged attempts at youthful transcontinental flight , and Killian Moss retains the record for the foreseeable future .
From the McCain campaign comes this bizarre ad , trying to say that Obama is not ready to lead this country because he agrees with McCain .
I guess this means that even McCain does n’t believe his own lies .
Interestingly , the third quote in the ad concerns McCain ’s assertion that corporate taxes are higher in the US than in some other countries .
But what the ad leaves out is that Obama was actually disagreeing with McCain .
On paper , our corporate tax rates might appear to be higher , but because of all the loopholes in our tax code , corporations in the US actually pay less taxes .
All this is not to say that Mr. Obama resembles the squashy caricature drawn by his opponents .
He is actually constructively two - minded on the issue .
He caught grief for proposing unilateral action against targets in Pakistan , which now appears to be Bush administration policy .
And there is spine in his language , sometimes too much .
In his convention speech , he said , “ McCain likes to say that he ’ll follow bin Laden to the gates of Hell  but he wo n’t even go to the cave where he lives . ”
I ’m still not sure what this means , but it ’s very muscular .
Barack Obama has also made useful proposals on nuclear matters , promising to secure the world ’s loose fissile material in his first term .
This is an over - idealistic goal , as it would require the cooperation of such countries as North Korea , Iran , Pakistan and , especially , Russia ( though he ’s better positioned to engage Russia on this subject than is the hectoring John McCain ) .
There is no one in Washington more sincerely gripped by the issue than John McCain , but he comes with his own set of problems on matters of counterterrorism , not least of which is his rhetorical excess , and his strange decision , given his ( justifiable ) preoccupation with the issue , to choose as his running mate the figurehead commander of the Alaska National Guard .
Though Islamist terrorism might in fact be the “ transcendent ” threat of our time , as Senator McCain says , it is tactically imprudent to build up the already huge egos of our enemies , to feed the Islamist hope that they are , indeed , engaged in a clash of civilizations .
Years ago , in pre-9/11 Afghanistan , a leader of the Taliban ’s morals police , the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Suppression of Vice , asked me to describe just how much the Taliban frightened Bill Clinton .
I told him not at all .
In fact , Mr. Clinton was probably not frightened enough , but I was n’t going to let on to that .
Watching this man ’s crest fall was a rare pleasure in Kandahar .
Senator McCain has other problems worth noting : an excess of incaution , perhaps , about pre-emption ( in our conversations , the various surprises associated with the Iraq invasion had not caused him to calibrate at all his views on anticipatory defense ) ; and a seeming inability , or unwillingness , to differentiate among Islamist terrorist groups .
I asked him not long ago whether he believes that America conflates its problem with Iran with Israel ’s Iran problem .
He said Israel ’s existence is an American moral and national - security imperative .
“ I think these terrorist organizations that [ Iran ] sponsors , Hamas and the others , are also bent , at least long - term , on the destruction of the United States of America , ” he added .
“ Iraq is a central battleground .
Because these Shiite militias are sending in these special groups , as they call them ... to remove U.S. influence and to drive us out of Iraq . ”
There are many different things taking place inside his answer , not all of which are connected .
Hamas is a disgraceful group , ideologically opposed to most of what America represents , but it is unconnected to the fight against Shiite militias .
These conflations , among other things , preclude serious conversation about ideology and motivation .
So what we have is one presidential candidate who still seems to be casting about for an overarching strategy ; and another one who is not entirely sure whom we ’re fighting .
We can hope against hope that in the next two months , these two men will discuss , in a deliberative and encompassing way , the best ways to protect America from what some nonproliferation experts believe is a nearly inevitable attack .
We should , in fact , demand that this conversation take place , because nothing else matters .
... and I genuinely feel sorry for Palin .
This really is pathetic .
Again it 's not a mass / elite matter .
Anyone who has been to high school immediately recognizes the terror of facing a pop quiz or an oral exam when you just have no idea what you 're talking about .
One hour after her pick was announced , I wrote here :
Let 's assume that Sarah Palin is exactly as smart and disciplined as Barack Obama .
But instead of the year and a half of nonstop campaigning he has behind him , and Joe Biden 's even longer toughening - up process , she comes into the most intense period of the highest stakes campaign with absolutely zero warmup or preparation .
If she has ever addressed an international issue , there 's no evidence of it in internet - land .
The smartest person in the world could not prepare quickly enough to know the pitfalls , and to sound confident while doing so , on all the issues she will be forced to address ...
So the prediction is : unavoidable gaffes .
The challenge for the McCain - Palin campaign is to find some way to defuse them ahead of time , since Socrates , Machiavelli , and Clausewitz reincarnated would themselves make errors in her situation .
And the challenge for Democrats is to lead people to think ,
What if she were in charge ? , without being bullies about it .
My for - the - sake - of - argument assumption was unwarranted .
She is not as smart or disciplined as Barack Obama .
If she were , she would sound better than she does at this point .
And the McCain team has done absolutely nothing to defuse these problems -- nor , to be honest , has Palin herself apparently learned the first thing about successfully finessing questions she is not ready to handle .
( Hint : the approach is not the one she has tried to apply with Katie Couric , that of repeating verbatim the answer that did not do the job the first time around . )
Couric deserves better ratings for the CBS news based on the steely relentlessness of her questions .
Unlike Charlie Gibson , and unlike Joe Biden in a ( possible ! ) future debate , she has no background complications of the older white man bullying the younger , attractive woman .
She was a professional woman who has clearly earned her position grilling someone whose bona fides she clearly doubted .
And Couric displayed one brilliant technique I recommend to all future questioners .
When Palin ducked a question about financial - bailout provisions , saying that " John McCain and I " had not yet reached a decision , Couric asked the deadly question : " So what are the pros and cons ? "
There is no way to fake your way around that .
As Palin showed .
Universal Pictures / Photofest
The civics teacher had an inspired idea : bring American jurisprudence to life by showing the class an award - winning 1957 film .
Twelve Angry Men had all the requisites of instructive high drama : suspense , as one juror tries to change the minds of 11 others hell - bent on sending the accused to death row ; crackling dialogue , written by Reginald Rose , a luminary of television ’s Golden Age ; a scintillating cast , led by Henry Fonda and directed by Sidney Lumet .
The title flashed on - screen — immediately followed by a chorus of groans .
One 15 - year - old wailed for all his disappointed colleagues : “ You did n’t tell us it was going to be in black - and - white ! ”
The place was New Rochelle High School in Westchester , New York , but the same scene could have played across the United States .
The owner of my local video - rental place puts it succinctly : “ Most of our customers are under 30 .
The way they see it , life is in color , so why not movies ?
Which is why we stopped offering black - and - whites , except for the classics .
You know , Chaplin , the Marx Brothers , Citizen Kane , Casablanca , Schindler ’s List , maybe a couple of Woody Allens . ”
If that ’s the current standard , libraries will soon begin removing volumes of poetry from their shelves .
After all , life is in prose , so why not books ?
Alas , what the customers do n’t realize is that B &W cinema remains vital , and often beautiful , because it ’s not a reflection of everyday existence .
Still , youthful viewers ’ resistance is forgivable : they ’re merely recapitulating biology .
Our retinas have two main components , rods and cones .
Rods ( about 3 million per orb ) can perceive only black , white , and shades of gray , but that ’s enough to keep us from tripping over the furniture in a darkened room .
As soon as the lights snap on , 120 million cones take over .
Their job : to register red , yellow , blue , and every hue in between — and we forget how important the rods were just moments before .
This is the story of American cinema , encapsulated .
Black - and - white film was Hollywood ’s principal offering from the silent era to the late 1930s .
Then , curious ticket buyers began flocking to rainbows like Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz — the Technicolor era had opened .
Confined to lower budgets , B &W producers and directors battled back .
Emphasizing narrative , they came up with fresh pictorial techniques : stark , angular shots ; tight close - ups of the stars ; backgrounds that evoked a vital sense of place .
En route , they insisted on lean , incisive scenarios and musical scores that enhanced every emotion from pathos to hilarity .
The good fight continued until the early 1960s , when filmmakers finally ran up the white ( and black ) flag .
From that point on , color reigned supreme .
Screenwriter Daniel Fuchs wrote of the B&W era : “ An excitement filled the theater , a thralldom .
People forgot they were sitting on the seats ; they forgot themselves , their bodies .
They lived only for the film . ”
Gregg Toland , the greatest cinematographer of his generation , never shot in color .
He and his A - picture directors , including John Ford , Orson Welles , and William Wyler , preferred to give audiences the sense that they were watching a suite of etchings .
Who needed color when the haunting landscapes of Wuthering Heights materialized on screen , as if photographed in Emily Brontë ’s nineteenth century ?
Or when Citizen Kane ’s deep - focus montages breathed life into the story of a fatally ambitious press lord ?
Or when The Best Years of Our Lives made an American epic out of the interrupted lives of three World War II vets ?
Toland came to prominence when Technicolor was a rarity .
But the greatest cinematographer of his generation , Conrad Hall ( In Cold Blood , Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) , worked in both media .
He came to dislike color because it tended “ to be very unreal , to detract from the story .
Whereas with black - and - white , there ’s no way to detract , once you accept it , which is right at the beginning . ”
The Western bears him out .
Oaters would seem to need wide blue skies and panoramic Technicolor shots of Monument Valley .
Yet it was two B&W Westerns that set the genre ’s style : High Noon , with Gary Cooper as a stoic sheriff forced to face evil alone ; and Red River , starring John Wayne as the domineering boss of a cattle drive .
That film prefigured Wayne the intractable conservative — deeply suspicious of youth ( in this case , Montgomery Clift ) — who would go on to codirect the pro–Vietnam War movie The Green Berets .
Not long after Red River wrapped , someone encouraged Wayne to take a more nuanced look at politics .
The superstar exploded : “ They tell me everything is n’t black - and - white .
I say , why the hell not ? ”
Comedy is another genre with deep B &W roots .
A huge number of the last century ’s most important comedians established themselves in black - and - white : Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , the Marx Brothers , Jack Benny , Carole Lombard , Jimmy Durante , Jean Harlow , Bob Hope , Lucille Ball , Jackie Gleason , Abbott and Costello , Rosalind Russell , Jerry Lewis — the list of pantheon figures goes on for pages .
As soon as color arrived , though , clowns wound up on the sidelines .
Jimmy Durante now played second banana to Esther Williams ’s water spectaculars ; Danny Kaye , MGM ’s brightest comic star , found himself interrupted by chorus lines of Goldwyn Girls ; Bob Hope , so funny with Bing Crosby in the Road pictures , became a leering embarrassment in such tinted , tasteless features as Call Me Bwana and I ’ll Take Sweden .
Many dreary farces came in black - and - white , of course , but the great comedies have never been equaled .
In 2000 , the American Film Institute published a movie list entitled “ 100 Years , 100 Laughs . ”
Nearly half were in B &W — and they remain the funniest , ranging from It Happened One Night , with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert , to the immortal Bank Dick , with W. C. Fields , to Ernst Lubitsch ’s To Be or Not to Be , an audacious anti-Nazi comedy starring Benny and Lombard .
A gross Technicolor remake , directed by Mel Brooks and starring Brooks and Anne Bancroft , bombed 40 years later .
As for musicals , sure , you can name glorious Technicolor examples — adaptations of Broadway fare like The Music Man , My Fair Lady , and Oliver ! , along with such originals as Singin ’ in the Rain and An American in Paris .
Yet even these take second place to nine black - and - white Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers movies .
Almost every great songwriter journeyed west to work with Astaire in the pre-color period , among them Irving Berlin , the Gershwins , and Cole Porter .
Berlin , usually parsimonious with praise , said , “ You give Fred Astaire a song , and you could forget about it .
If he did change anything , he made it better . ”
So did Rogers .
Astaire danced with other women in other movies , but the magic was no longer there .
No matter how farcical or chaotic the plot , Astaire and Rogers established an island of elegance and passion .
Their dancing “ was a vehicle of serious emotion between a man and a woman , ” dance critic Arlene Croce observed .
“ It never happened in the movies again . ”
Other musical events never happened in the movies again , among them Busby Berkeley ’s lavish ballets .
In the early 1930s , cameras whirred so loudly that they had to be encased in cumbersome , soundproof boxes , which limited choreographers .
Berkeley had his musical numbers prerecorded in a studio , leaving him free to place the cameras wherever his imagination wandered : in the air , on the wall , in a swimming pool .
Dancers arranged in geometric patterns became Berkeley ’s signature and transfigured Warner Brothers movie musicals from 42nd Street until the advent of color , after which Berkeley ’s career rapidly deteriorated .
One can still detect his influence in the stage work of director Susan Strohman , notably in the Broadway productions of The Producers and Young Frankenstein .
But comedies and musicals are only a part of the B&W period — and not the most influential part .
Screen biographies ( “ biopics ” in trade jargon ) burgeoned in the modern color era , and sometimes the filmmakers got them in focus ( Patton , for example ) ; far more often , though , the Hollywood assembly line has churned out Technicolor mistakes like Richard Attenborough ’s Chaplin , which never captured its subject ’s genius .
An earlier Hollywood , by contrast , knew how to do the biopic right , especially the patriotic kind ( these days , major studios would rather set fire to their back lots than produce a pro-American film ) .
During World War II , for instance , Warner Brothers released Yankee Doodle Dandy , centered on the life of composer / performer George M. Cohan and featuring James Cagney in a magnetic , strutting performance .
“ It seems it always happens , ” observes Cagney as Cohan .
“ Whenever we get too high - hat and too sophisticated for flag - waving , some thug nation decides we ’re a pushover all ready to be blackjacked .
And it is n’t long before we ’re looking up , mighty anxiously , to be sure the flag ’s still waving over us . ”
Sergeant York , with Gary Cooper as a World War I hero , was another black - and - white example of triumphant biographica Americana .
So were two stirring films on the country ’s most prodigious inventor — Young Tom Edison , with Mickey Rooney in the title role , and Edison the Man , starring Spencer Tracy as the grownup genius — and three movies about our most beloved president : Abraham Lincoln , with Walter Huston ; Young Mr. Lincoln , with Henry Fonda ; and finally , Abe Lincoln in Illinois , a Raymond Massey vehicle .
Massey spent the rest of his life doing variations on the Lincoln theme ; jealous rivals said he would n’t be happy until someone assassinated him .
Paul Muni , who never appeared in a Technicolor film , was the master of the biopic , vanishing into whatever personality he chose to impersonate .
The multilingual actor , who came to the U.S. as a child , had been a master mimic since his days in the Yiddish theater .
In his thirties , he went through a naturalization ceremony , speaking in a heavy Mitteleuropa accent , squinting as if he did n’t quite understand each question .
During the interrogation , his accent slowly diminished .
He delivered the final answer in impeccable English .
Muni smiled at the dumbfounded official .
“ Your honor , it ’s remarkable .
Now that you ’ve made me a citizen , I can speak perfectly ! ”
He showcased his versatility as a Mexican president in Juarez , a French novelist in The Life of Emile Zola , and a French scientist in The Story of Louis Pasteur , for which he won an Academy Award .
Muni proved so good that he spawned many imitators — frequently miscast .
Films like A Song to Remember , starring a vigorous Cornel Wilde as the consumptive Pole Frédéric Chopin , and Night and Day , with Cary Grant as a heterosexual Cole Porter , may have prompted Jack Warner ’s remark , “ Every time Paul Muni parts his beard and looks through a microscope , we lose a million dollars . ”
If Muni was the classic underplayer , Charles Laughton went over the top with B&W impressions in Rembrandt and The Private Life of Henry VIII .
Hollywood both admired and feared Laughton , who could lurch from low - key to manic in a nanosecond .
After Jamaica
Inn wrapped , Alfred Hitchcock sighed , “ You ca n’t direct a Laughton picture .
The best you can hope for is to referee . ”
The actor became his own referee when MGM let him direct one film , 1955 ’s The Night of the Hunter , which has become a B &W cult classic .
Critic Roger Ebert considers the story of a tattooed religious maniac ( Robert Mitchum ) and the widow he terrorizes ( Shelley Winters ) “ one of the greatest of American films . . . an expressionist oddity , telling its chilling story through visual fantasy . ”
Hunter crept close to one of the most vital B &W genres : horror .
Back in the day , blood ran black , faces were pale even before they registered fright , and studio art directors had to create Transylvanian castles out of whole cloth and two - by - fours .
In The Bad and the Beautiful , the second - best black - and - white film about Hollywood , producer Jonathan Shields ( Kirk Douglas ) lets Fred Amiel ( Barry Sullivan ) in on a secret :
Shields :
Put five men dressed like cats on the screen — what do they look like ?
Amiel : Like five men dressed like cats .
Shields :
When an audience pays to see a picture like this , what do they pay for ?
Amiel :
To get the pants scared off ’em .
Shields :
And what scares the human race more than any other single thing ?
Amiel : The dark .
Shields :
Of course , and why ?
Because the dark has a life of its own .
In the dark , all sorts of things come alive .
Amiel : Yeah .
Suppose we never do show the cat men .
Is that what you ’re thinking ?
Shields : Exactly . . . .
Now , what ’ll we put on the screen that ’ll make the backs of their necks crawl ?
Amiel :
Two eyes shining in the dark .
Shields :
A dog frightened , growling , showing its fangs .
Amiel : A bird , its neck broken , feathers torn from its throat .
Shields :
A little girl screaming , claw marks down her cheeks .
The scene shifts to a child actress caterwauling in the setting that they ’ve just described .
The horror film turns out to be a smash .
The outstanding B&W horror films always suggested more than they showed , and those ominous hints allowed them to reach deep into the viewer ’s psyche .
Parodists have gotten a lot of mileage out of Béla Lugosi ’s lines in Dracula : “ My blood now flows through her veins .
She will live through the centuries to come , as I have lived . ”
And : “ To die . . . to be really dead . . . that must be glooorious . ”
But no actor has come close to Béla ’s unique amalgam of nobility and evil , his narrow eyes lit by tiny spotlights , his Hungarian intonations suggesting bottomless pits of depravity .
Similarly , dozens of actors have played Frankenstein ’s monster .
None , however , could convey the pathos of William Henry Pratt , a Canadian who wisely changed his name to the more exotic Boris Karloff .
The creature was mute in the original film , but in the compelling sequel , The Bride of Frankenstein , he uttered a few words .
“ We belong dead ! ” continues to be quoted as the expression of a contemporary terror — the fear that scientists are on the verge of creating a genetic nightmare in their laboratories .
The horror field is rich with B &W curios .
Few viewers under 50 are aware that Spencer Tracy played Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde opposite Ingrid Bergman ; that the handsome leading man Tyrone Power did his best work as a geek ( someone who bites off the heads of living chickens to horrify audiences ) in Nightmare Alley ; and that Freaks , the story of deformed circus performers , was so graphic that Britain banned it for 30 years .
Other than specialists like James Whale ( Frankenstein ) and Todd Browning ( Dracula ) , only a handful of talented directors ventured onto this exotic turf .
Hitchcock was one .
He characterized his job as “ simply to scare the hell out of people , ” and after creating frissons with such stylish color films as North by Northwest , he set to work on a B &W piece about the strange goings - on at the Bates Motel .
Psycho turned Hollywood tradition on its ear .
The director knocked off the star , Janet Leigh , in the first third of the movie , leaving viewers nonplussed .
Then , with a combination of weird camera perspectives , menacing shadows , and Bernard Herrmann ’s eerie score , he did indeed scare the hell out of people .
The original Psycho , produced for $ 800,000 , grossed $ 10 million .
Unfortunately , it also encouraged a slew of lesser talents to make Technicolor trash like Halloween and other hackneyed screamers .
Film noir got its name from French cineastes .
The term refers to hard - edged , downbeat movies , with iconic heroes and antiheroes , “ bad girl ” temptresses , and a brooding , dangerous atmosphere .
More than 60 years after it was made , the quintessential noir movie remains Double Indemnity , director Billy Wilder ’s adaptation of James M. Cain ’s thriller of betrayal .
The story concerns an insurance salesman , Walter Neff ( Fred MacMurray ) , bedazzled by a steamy adulterous wife , Phyllis Dietrichson ( Barbara Stanwyck ) .
Together they conspire to get rid of her husband .
The lethal romance begins with crackling , double - entendre intensity :
Phyllis : Mr. Neff , why do n’t you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30 ?
He ’ll be in then .
Neff : Who ?
Phyllis :
My husband .
You were anxious to talk to him , were n’t you ?
Neff : Yeah , I was .
But I ’m sort of getting over the idea , if you know what I mean .
Phyllis :
There ’s a speed limit in this state , Mr. Neff , 45 miles an hour .
Neff :
How fast was I going , Officer ?
Phyllis : I ’d say around 90 .
Neff : Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket .
Phyllis : Suppose I let you off with a warning this time .
Neff : Suppose it does n’t take .
Phyllis : Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles .
Neff : Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder .
Phyllis : Suppose you try putting it on my husband ’s shoulder .
Neff :
That tears it .
Tomorrow evening , then .
Phyllis :
That ’s what I suggested .
Neff :
You ’ll be here , too ?
Phyllis : I guess so .
I usually am .
Neff : Same chair , same perfume , same anklet ?
Phyllis : I wonder if I know what you mean .
Neff : I wonder if you wonder .
Dietrichson ’s killing is made to look like an accident .
Neff ’s buddy , Barton Keyes ( Edward G. Robinson ) , is an insurance investigator in the same office .
He believes that the mishap was actually murder and spends the rest of the film vainly attempting to identify the killer .
Double Indemnity ends with Neff shot by Phyllis , bleeding to death on the office floor as he makes his confession .
Neff :
You know why you did n’t figure this one , Keyes ?
Let me tell you .
The guy you were looking for was too close .
He was right across the desk from you .
Keyes : Closer than that , Walter .
( The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence . )
Neff : I love you , too .
As the name implies , film noirs have usually come in shades of black .
True , there have been Technicolor imitations — Body Heat , L.A. Confidential , Chinatown , dramas in which the protagonist , in classic style , winds up lured by a conniving woman into a maelstrom of greed and corruption .
But these films would have been impossible to make without their B&W predecessors : Lady from Shanghai , with Rita Hayworth as the femme fatale and Orson Welles as her prey ; The Blue Dahlia , with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake as victim and victimizer ;
Out of the Past , with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer ; and any one of a dozen Humphrey Bogart movies .
No one can truly understand American cinema without seeing The Maltese Falcon , with Bogie as Sam Spade and Mary Astor as the villainess ; The Big Sleep — the first meeting of Bogart and the future Mrs. B. , Lauren Bacall ; and their second pairing , To Have and Have Not .
( “ You know how to whistle , do n’t you , Steve ?
You just put your lips together and blow . ” )
B&W films relied heavily on trenchant lines like that , one reason why so many have entered the conversational mainstream .
Marlon Brando uttered his most famous words in his fourth movie , On the Waterfront : “ I coulda had class .
I coulda been a contender .
I coulda been somebody . ”
( Twenty - six years later — in Raging Bull , a black - and - white biopic about Jake LaMotta — Robert De Niro paid homage by repeating those lines , word for word , in the boxer ’s dressing room . )
Gregory Peck ’s advice in To Kill a Mockingbird summed up race relations better than any editorial : “ You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view , until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it . ”
Bogart was at his most romantic when he said good - bye to Ingrid Bergman at the Casablanca airport : “ I ’m no good at being noble , but it does n’t take much to see that the problems of three little people do n’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .
Someday you ’ll understand that .
Here ’s looking at you , kid . ”
Bette Davis ’s warning in All About Eve has echoed down the decades : “ Fasten your seatbelts .
It ’s going to be a bumpy night . ”
As has Groucho Marx ’s recollection in Animal Crackers : “ One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas .
How he got in my pajamas , I do n’t know . ”
And Joe E. Brown ’s forgiving comment in Some Like It Hot , when he learns that the woman he loves is a female impersonator : “ Well , nobody ’s perfect . ”
Another genre fills the end - of - the - year TV schedule : the Christmas movie .
Most films in that category rerun without leaving a trace , but there are some notable exceptions .
It ’s a Wonderful Life , made in 1946 , has become as endearing and perennial as Dickens ’s A Christmas Carol .
For three generations , families have eagerly repeated the words of Henry Travers in the role of Clarence the Angel .
Attempting to save the suicidal George Bailey ( Jimmy Stewart ) , Clarence shows what would have occurred in George ’s absence : “ Strange , is n’t it ?
Each man ’s life touches so many other lives .
When he is n’t around he leaves an awful hole , does n’t he ? ”
Another B&W perennial also unreels every December .
Cornball it may be , but Miracle on 34th Street , also a film from the 1940s , still beguiles little boys and girls , thanks to Edmund Gwenn ’s persuasive portrait of a white - bearded gent hired as a Macy ’s Santa and Maureen O’Hara ’s turn as a skeptical mother whose child believes that he is the genuine article .
No doubt the permanence of these movies has to do with their era .
They ’re suffused with the postwar euphoria of the late 1940s , when rationing had disappeared from the American scene and the only items in short supply were cynicism and self - doubt .
More recent Christmas films attempt to be colorful rather than fantastic and to use irony rather than faith and goodwill .
Even the titles bear mocking subtexts — Scrooged , National Lampoon ’s Christmas Vacation , The Santa Clause — as if any display of sentiment would mark the filmmakers as squares in an edgy world .
Black - and - white has no place here .
It speaks directly to the heart , and that ’s not often the organ that modern movies hope to stimulate .
Some two decades ago , Ted Turner came up with one of his most dubious schemes .
To entice the young back into the tent , he ordered minions to banish B &W films by colorizing them .
“ Those fools ! ” Billy Wilder exploded .
“ Do they really think that colorization will make The Informer any better ?
Or Citizen Kane or Casablanca ?
Or do they hope to palm off some of the old stinkers by dipping them in 31 flavors ? ”
Other directors added their own catcalls .
“ To change someone ’s work without any regard to his wishes shows a total contempt for film , for the director , and for the public , ” said Woody Allen .
( Allen had deliberately rejected color when he made Stardust Memories and Manhattan “ because the city photographs so well in black - and - white .
And New York is so familiar to me in black - and - white , probably because of growing up with the tabloids . ” )
Elliot Silverstein , an officer of the Directors Guild of America , wasted no time with niceties :
Turner ’s people were “ lifting their legs on people ’s work .
”
And when Orson Welles heard that Kane might be colorized , he growled : “ Keep Ted Turner and his damned Crayolas off of my picture . ”
Those damned Crayolas were put away in the mid-1990s when Turner and his techies met two unexpected hurdles .
First , the price of colorization became prohibitive .
Second , viewers joined directors and critics to complain about the process ’s ludicrous comic - book tones .
From that point on , we ’ve been able to see features the way their creators intended .
Ironically , some of the greatest American B&W movies now regularly show on the Turner Classic Movie channel .
They ’re also available online from Netflix , Amazon , Barnes & Noble , and other sites .
The curious searcher can find the atmospheric Sherlock Holmes mysteries , every Astaire - Rogers musical , the archetypal horrors , a five - DVD set called The Ultimate Film Noir Collection , such early sci-fi adventures as The Day the Earth Stood Still and Invasion of the Body Snatchers , and much , much more — including the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood : Sunset Boulevard .
In that film , a down - at - the - heels screenwriter , Joe Gillis ( William Holden ) , meets an aging B&W star ( Gloria Swanson ) .
“ You used to be big ! ” he exclaims .
Haughtily , she replies : “ I am big .
It ’s the pictures that got small . ”
Skeptics can test the truth of her remark easily enough .
Hit a few computer keys and order some B &W classics .
Once seen , these major American films cannot be unseen — as those New Rochelle teenagers can testify .
Ten minutes into the screening of Twelve Angry Men , they stopped complaining .
The next day , they asked to see it again .
The Austrian School and the Meltdown
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
The financial meltdown the economists of the Austrian School predicted has arrived .
We are in this crisis because of an excess of artificially created credit at the hands of the Federal Reserve System .
The solution being proposed ?
More artificial credit by the Federal Reserve .
No liquidation of bad debt and malinvestment is to be allowed .
By doing more of the same , we will only continue and intensify the distortions in our economy — all the capital misallocation , all the malinvestment — and prevent the market ’s attempt to re-establish rational pricing of houses and other assets .
Last night the president addressed the nation about the financial crisis .
There is no point in going through his remarks line by line , since I ’d only be repeating what I ’ve been saying over and over — not just for the past several days , but for years and even decades .
Still , at least a few observations are necessary .
The president assures us that his administration “ is working with Congress to address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets . ”
Care to take a guess at whether the Federal Reserve and its money creation spree were even mentioned ?
We are told that “ low interest rates ” led to excessive borrowing , but we are not told how these low interest rates came about .
They were a deliberate policy of the Federal Reserve .
As always , artificially low interest rates distort the market .
Entrepreneurs engage in malinvestments — investments that do not make sense in light of current resource availability , that occur in more temporally remote stages of the capital structure than the pattern of consumer demand can support , and that would not have been made at all if the interest rate had been permitted to tell the truth instead of being toyed with by the Fed .
Not a word about any of that , of course , because Americans might then discover how the great wise men in Washington caused this great debacle .
Better to keep scapegoating the mortgage industry or “ wildcat capitalism ” ( as if we actually have a pure free market ! ) .
Speaking about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the president said : “ Because these companies were chartered by Congress , many believed they were guaranteed by the federal government .
This allowed them to borrow enormous sums of money , fuel the market for questionable investments , and put our financial system at risk . ”
Does n’t that prove the foolishness of chartering Fannie and Freddie in the first place ?
Does n’t that suggest that maybe , just maybe , government may have contributed to this mess ?
And of course , by bailing out Fannie and Freddie , has n’t the federal government shown that the “ many ” who “ believed they were guaranteed by the federal government ” were in fact correct ?
Then come the scare tactics .
If we do n’t give dictatorial powers to the Treasury Secretary “ the stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account .
The value of your home could plummet . ”
Left unsaid , naturally , is that with the bailout and all the money and credit that must be produced out of thin air to fund it , the value of your retirement account will drop anyway , because the value of the dollar will suffer a precipitous decline .
As for home prices , they are obviously much too high , and supply and demand cannot equilibrate if government insists on propping them up .
It ’s the same destructive strategy that government tried during the Great Depression : prop up prices all costs .
The Depression went on for over a decade .
On the other hand , when liquidation was allowed to occur in the equally devastating downturn of 1921 , the economy recovered within less than a year .
The president also tells us that Senators McCain and Obama will join him at the White House today in order to figure out how to get the bipartisan bailout passed .
The two senators would do their country much more good if they stayed on the campaign trail debating which one is the bigger celebrity , or whatever it is that occupies their attention these days .
F.A. Hayek won the Nobel Prize for showing how central banks ’ manipulation of interest rates creates the boom - bust cycle with which we are sadly familiar .
In 1932 , in the depths of the Great Depression , he described the foolish policies being pursued in his day — and which are being proposed , just as destructively , in our own :
Instead of furthering the inevitable liquidation of the maladjustments brought about by the boom during the last three years , all conceivable means have been used to prevent that readjustment from taking place ; and one of these means , which has been repeatedly tried though without success , from the earliest to the most recent stages of depression , has been this deliberate policy of credit expansion … .
To combat the depression by a forced credit expansion is to attempt to cure the evil by the very means which brought it about ; because we are suffering from a misdirection of production , we want to create further misdirection — a procedure that can only lead to a much more severe crisis as soon as the credit expansion comes to an end … .
It is probably to this experiment , together with the attempts to prevent liquidation once the crisis had come , that we owe the exceptional severity and duration of the depression .
The only thing we learn from history , I am afraid , is that we do not learn from history .
The very people who have spent the past several years assuring us that the economy is fundamentally sound , and who themselves foolishly cheered the extension of all these novel kinds of mortgages , are the ones who now claim to be the experts who will restore prosperity !
Just how spectacularly wrong , how utterly without a clue , does someone have to be before his expert status is called into question ?
Oh , and did you notice that the bailout is now being called a “ rescue plan ” ?
I guess “ bailout ” was n’t sitting too well with the American people .
The very people who with somber faces tell us of their deep concern for the spread of democracy around the world are the ones most insistent on forcing a bill through Congress that the American people overwhelmingly oppose .
The very fact that some of you seem to think you ’re supposed to have a voice in all this actually seems to annoy them .
I continue to urge you to contact your representatives and give them a piece of your mind .
I myself am doing everything I can to promote the correct point of view on the crisis .
Be sure also to educate yourselves on these subjects — the Campaign for Liberty blog is an excellent place to start .
Read the posts , ask questions in the comment section , and learn .
H.G. Wells once said that civilization was in a race between education and catastrophe .
Let us learn the truth and spread it as far and wide as our circumstances allow .
For the truth is the greatest weapon we have .

Advertisement A leading US senator says both parties in Congress are in agreement on the outline of a $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) bail - out plan to revive the finance sector .
Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said they had reached " fundamental agreement " on the principles of a deal .
But he later added that it could take beyond Friday 's target to finish work .
US President George W Bush is meeting presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama to discuss the bail - out .
Republicans and Democrats have been worried about who will fund the plan .
Mr Bush has said he hoped there would be agreement on a rescue deal " very shortly " .
We now expect that we will have a plan that can pass the House , pass the Senate and be signed by the president
Republican Senator Robert Bennett of Utah
Robert Peston on the plan US stocks up on bail - out hopes Bail - out : For and Against Bernanke demands action However US Senate Majority leader Harry Reid told journalists discussions were " ongoing " .
Mr Dodd said Congress could act in the next few days to pass a bill on the subject .
" We look forward to reviewing the proposal .
Our focus remains the same - ensuring that the final package is effective , " said Treasury spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli .
After Mr Dodd 's comments Tony Fratto , the White House deputy press secretary , said it was a " a good sign that progress is being made " .
The plan , as it was first proposed last week , would broadly help finance firms offload bad debt , which has triggered a global credit crisis .
The uncertainties can be boiled down to one dilemma : if the bail - out is used to punish the banks it probably wo n't save the global financial system
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Robert Peston on the plan " We now expect that we will have a plan that can pass the House , pass the Senate and be signed by the president , " Republican Senator Robert Bennett of Utah said after meetings with lawmakers on Thursday .
Details of the package were not immediately available but it is tipped to include restrictions on executives ' pay as well as oversight requirements .
The benchmark Dow Jones index rose after Senator Dodd 's comments , to close 198.09 points , or 1.83 % , up at 11,023.26 .
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain are in Washington for the talks .
The pair are due to hold a presidential campaign debate on Friday , but Mr McCain had said it should be called off because of the pressing financial crisis .
However , on Thursday evening Mr McCain 's campaign team said the Republican senator had not yet decided whether to attend the debate .

Concerns
The bail - out has been under scrutiny with politicians on both sides nervous about the deal being rushed through too quickly .
Of particular concern has been the issue of pay for the bosses of the firms in question , as well as concerns over the cost of the plan to the US taxpayer .
But both US Federal Reserve head Ben Bernanke and Mr Bush have warned that without a deal , it would cause a significant set - back to the economy as a whole .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who is due to meet Mr Bush in Washington to talk about the financial turmoil on Friday , said he supported the US initiative to help bolster markets .
Those in favour of the deal have argued that it would : Boost global financial stability
Increase investor confidence
Prevent a global slowdown
Encourage banks to lend to each other , and beat the credit crunch .
Those with reservations have said the bail - out would :
Cost the taxpayer too much money
Benefit bosses of firms who have taken huge risks
Increase state debt
Give too much power to the US Treasury .
One of the main uncertainties of the bail - out is what the true cost will be , and how the Treasury will price the bad debt that it is planning to acquire .
Under the preliminary plan , the government would acquire the bad , mortgage - backed assets of finance firms in a move to ensure they do not fold , to prevent further problems .
The fear is that if more finance firms go under this will have a knock - on effect on other sectors of the economy , further worsening the credit crisis .
Even as markets rose sharply , there are many ongoing questions about what a final plan would look like .
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said the ongoing uncertainties could be " boiled down to one dilemma : if the bail - out is used to punish the banks it probably wo n't save the global financial system .
" But if the banks are n't punished , then US taxpayers may well feel that their pockets have been picked . "
Turmoil
The package was proposed after a period in which markets saw almost unprecedented global turmoil and upheaval .
Key investment firm Lehman Brothers , the fourth largest investment bank in the US , filed for bankruptcy protection and the government had to intervene to rescue insurance giant AIG .
Meanwhile Bank of America stepped in to buy Merrill Lynch .
And investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their status , enabling them to tap into commercial banking , effectively marking the end of an era on Wall Street .
The bail - out is being promoted as a way to help boost the outlook for banks , and improve the availability of credit which has been harder to obtain for banks and businesses as well as individuals .
But not everyone sees the bail - out as the right solution .
Senator Bernie Sanders organised a petition which attacked what it said was the Treasury 's attempt to enable bosses to " continue to make exorbitant salaries and bonuses , " reported Agence - France Presse .
" The wealthiest people , those ... in the best position to pay , are being asked for no sacrifice at all , " read a petition to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .

What are these ?
By David Willey
BBC News , Rome
The number of illegal immigrants entering Italy doubled in the first seven months of the year compared with the same period in 2007 , Rome says .
The figures come in spite of a government crackdown on crime and an increase in the number of deportations .
More than 15,000 illegal immigrants entered the EU via Italy between January and July , Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said .
Many illegal immigrants arrive on boats organised by people traffickers .
Many Italians associate illegal immigration with crime
Mr Maroni , whose Northern League party formed part of the right - wing government coalition , has campaigned strongly against clandestine immigration .
Most of the illegal immigrants come across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has launched a crackdown on crime , which most Italians associate with illegal immigration .
He brought in stringent new measures making it an offence punishable by up to four years jail to enter the country illegally .
Prisons full
Expulsions have increased by 15 % so far this year but the Italian authorities often find the countries of origin of illegal arrivals reluctant to accept them back if they are deported .
Two weeks ago the authorities began deploying troops in joint anti-crime patrols with police in some of Italy 's major cities .
Thirty - three non-EU nationals have been arrested so far .
Italy 's prisons are already crammed with foreigners .
Some 20,000 people out of the 55,000 prisoners currently serving sentences or awaiting trial in Italian jails are foreigners .
The number of these foreign prisoners continues to increase because of the expense and difficulty of executing expulsions ordered by the judiciary .
Euclid
There are no known records of the exact date or place of Euclid 's birth , and little is known about his personal life .
We do know that during the reign of Ptolemy I he taught mathematics in Alexandria , Egypt , at the Alexandria library or " Museum " , and that he wrote the most enduring mathematical work of all time , the Stoicheia or Elements , a thirteen volume work .
This comprehensive compilation of geometrical knowledge , based on the works of Thales , Pythagoras , Plato , Eudoxus , Aristotle , Menaechmus and others , was in common usage for over 2,000 years .
An Arabian author , al - Qifti ( d. 1248 ) , recorded that Euclid 's father was Naucrates and his grandfather was Zenarchus , that he was a Greek , born in Tyre and lived in Damascus .
But there is no real proof that this is the same Euclid .
In fact , another man , Euclid of Megara , a philosopher who lived at the time of Plato , is often confused with Euclid of Alexandria .
Euclid is often referred to as the " Father of Geometry . "
It is probable that he attended Plato 's Academy in Athens , received his mathematical training from students of Plato , and then came to Alexandria .
Alexandria was then the largest city in the western world , and the center of both the papyrus industry and the book trade .
Ptolemy had created the great library at Alexandria , which was known as the Museum , because it was considered a house of the muses for the arts and sciences .
Many scholars worked and taught there , and that is where Euclid wrote The Elements .
There is some evidence that Euclid also founded a school and taught pupils while he was in Alexandria .
The Elements is divided into thirteen books which cover plane geometry , arithmetic and number theory , irrational numbers , and solid geometry .
Euclid organized the known geometrical ideas , starting with simple definitions , axioms , formed statements called theorems , and set forth methods for logical proofs .
He began with accepted mathematical truths , axioms and postulates , and demonstrated logically 467 propositions in plane and solid geometry .
One of the proofs was for the theorem of Pythagoras , proving that the equation is always true for every right triangle .
The Elements was the most widely used textbook of all time , has appeared in more than 1,000 editions since printing was invented , was still found in classrooms until the twentieth century , and is thought to have sold more copies than any book other than the Bible .
Euclid used an approach called the " synthetic approach " to present his theorems .
Using this method , one progresses in a series of logical steps from the known to the unknown .
Euclid proved that it is impossible to find the " largest prime number , " because if you take the largest known prime number , add 1 to the product of all the primes up to and including it , you will get another prime number .
Euclid 's proof for this theorem is generally accepted as one of the " classic " proofs because of its conciseness and clarity .
Millions of prime numbers are known to exist , and more are being added by mathematicians and computer scientists .
Mathematicians since Euclid have attempted without success to find a pattern to the sequence of prime numbers .
The Greek philosopher Proclus records that when Ptolemy I asked if there was an easier way to study geometry than The Elements , Euclid replied , " Sire , there is no royal road to geometry . "
Axioms are statements that are accepted as true .
Euclid believed that we can't be sure of any axioms without proof , so he devised logical steps to prove them .
Euclid divided his ten axioms , which he called " postulates , " into two groups of five .
The first five were " Common Notions , " because they were common to all sciences :
Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another .
If equals are added to equals , the sums are equal .
If equals are subtracted from equals , the remainders are equal .
Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another .
The whole is greater than the part .
You can draw a straight line between any two points .
You can extend the line indefinitely .
You can draw a circle using any line segment as the radius and one end point as the center .
All right angles are equal .
Given a line and a point , you can draw only one line through the point that is parallel to the first line .
Campanus translated The Elements from Arabic to Latin , and the first printed edition appeared in Venice in 1482 .
The first English translation of The Elements was by the mathematician John Dee in 1570 .
Dee 's lectures and writings revived interest in mathematics in England .
His translation was from a Latin translation of an Arabic translation of the original Greek .
In 1733 , an Italian mathematician named Girolamo Saccheri almost discovered non-Euclidean geometry .
He had studied for years in a futile attempt to find a single error in Euclid 's postulates .
On the verge of a breakthrough , he gave up and published Euclid Cleared of Every Flaw .
It would be about a hundred years before another viable geometry was invented .
In 1899 , the German mathematician David Hilbert presented Foundations of Geometry , the first complete set of geometry axioms since Euclid .
Euclid also wrote Data , which contains 94 propositions , Phaenomena , concerning spherical astronomy , Caloptrics , about mirrors , Optics , the theory of perspective , and a work of music theory .
In his works about optics , Euclid made light rays part of geometry , working with them as if they were straight lines .
Many of the works ascribed to Euclid are no longer in existence or are incomplete .
Euclidean constructions
The Greek number system made it hard to do calculations .
Like the Roman number system , it was not a positional system , had no zero , and had only whole numbers .
To compensate for this , they used graphical techniques using a compass and straightedge to produce geometric constructions .
These became known as Euclidean Constructions and are described further in Euclidean Constructions - Tools and Rules
The Abraham Lincoln connection
At age forty , Abraham Lincoln studied Euclid for training in reasoning , and as a traveling lawyer on horseback , kept a copy of Euclid 's Elements in his saddlebag .
In his biography of Lincoln , his law partner Billy Herndon tells how late at night Lincoln would lie on the floor studying Euclid 's geometry by lamplight .
Lincoln 's logical speeches and some of his phrases such as " dedicated to the proposition " in the Gettysburg address are attributed to his reading of Euclid .
Lincoln explains why he was motivated to read Euclid :
" In the course of my law reading I constantly came upon the word " demonstrate " .
I thought at first that I understood its meaning , but soon became satisfied that I did not .
I said to myself , What do I do when I demonstrate more than when I reason or prove ?
How does demonstration differ from any other proof ?
I consulted Webster 's Dictionary .
They told of ' certain proof , ' ' proof beyond the possibility of doubt ' ; but I could form no idea of what sort of proof that was .
I thought a great many things were proved beyond the possibility of doubt , without recourse to any such extraordinary process of reasoning as I understood demonstration to be .
I consulted all the dictionaries and books of reference I could find , but with no better results .
You might as well have defined blue to a blind man .
At last I said , - Lincoln , you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means ; and I left my situation in Springfield , went home to my father 's house , and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight .
I then found out what demonstrate means , and went back to my law studies . "
Quotations
A youth who had begun to read geometry with Euclid , when he had learnt the first proposition , inquired , " What do I get by learning these things ? "
So Euclid called a slave and said " Give him three pence , since he must make a gain out of what he learns . "

" The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God . " - Euclid
" If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm , then you were not born to be a scientific thinker . "

But you must note this :
If God exists and if He really did create the world , then , as we all know , He created it according to the geometry of Euclid . " - Ivan , in The Brothers Karamazov , by Fyodor Dostoyevsky ( 1821-1881 )

Just what you ’ve always wanted : a more awkward way to talk about STDs during foreplay .
A New York company called STDFree Certifications has come up with a sexual - history “ license , ” made up to look like an I.D. card , that will attest to your level sexual health .
The Daily News awesomely calls it an American Sexpress Card .
After you flash it , potential partners can call up STDFree and check up on your latest test results .
It ’s a good , if somewhat hokey idea , but not without its hurdles .
The largest of which is , how on earth do you pull out the License to Thrill in the heat of the moment ?
And when ??
Below , we have some suggestions for people on one - night stands on how to smoothly whip it out :
• Subtly , in the elevator on the way to the apartment : “ Let me just get my keys .
Oh , look what fell out of my pocket !
It ’s my STDFree card !
Anyway , are n’t you so excited to see Christopher Walken on SNL ? ”
• As a preemptive measure : “ Thanks for the coffee !
What ’s this card ? ”
“ Oh , it ’s my STDFree card .
You see , we ’re going to be having sex later and I wanted you to know that I ’m perfectly healthy . ”
“ Why would you assume we ’re going to have sex ? ! ”
“ What , you ’re prejudiced against baristas ? ”

Only A Theory : Evolution and the Battle for America 's Soul
by Kenneth R. Miller
Viking , 2008
Ken Miller is not preaching to the choir .
Although he has a day job as an active research biologist at Brown University , Miller has spent more than two decades on the front lines of the battle over evolution as a writer , lecturer , and expert witness in court .
During these two decades of culture war , he has come to realize that , although the stakes are high in this fight , sometimes the best tactic is the non-martial one : do n't treat the American public as pawns in a propaganda war .
Miller starts with the assumption that most people will be fairly open - minded about evolution and intelligent design .
Before they make a firm judgment on the role of evolution in our public schools , people genuinely want to know what the scientific status of evolution is , and whether intelligent design is truly a scientific challenger .
Many previous books debunking evolution have missed people like this .
Such books typically fall into two categories : necessary but dense , technical works that provide , in detail , the scientific community 's best response to the claims of intelligent design advocates , and scathing , hard - hitting attacks that fire up those who already accept evolution , but turn off readers who are trying hard to understand this issue without being strongly biased either way .
Only A
Theory is a genuine attempt at persuasion , and its approach is a result of Dr. Miller 's years of practice speaking to audiences who want to give both sides a fair shot .
Do n't be fooled , however , into thinking that Miller is trying to find some mutually satisfactory middle ground .
For those who want to know whether evolution really is good science , his answer is unambiguous - evolution is one of the most successful and important theories we have in biology .
And what about intelligent design ?
Its advocates have not even attempted to make this a real scientific discipline ; evolution is the only scientific game in town .
The book starts out with a nod to America 's anti-establishment culture , and how such a culture has helped science thrive .
" America is home to independent - minded individuals for whom a primary virtue is disrespect for authority , " says Miller , and that disrespect is " the reason that our country has embraced science so thoroughly . "
Although the United States for a long time sat in the shadow of Europe 's scientific dominance , a culture of independence helped US science grow - " getting ahead [ in science ] did not mean following the lead of a supervisor , a laboratory head , or a department chair . "
So it 's more than a little ironic that intelligent design advocates are accusing scientists of clinging blindly to orthodoxy , unwilling to recognize that a paradigm - shattering new science is about to overturn 150 years of evolutionary research .
But rather than dismissing such claims as absurd on their face , Miller says OK , let 's give them a fair shot :
" Do the antievolution and intelligent design movements represent genuine revolutionary scientific ideas ?
Has American individualism once again given rise to ground breaking science of the sort that would not be possible in a more authoritarian or hierarchical society ? "
Giving Intelligent Design Its Due
Only A
Theory takes up the challenge , looking one by one at intelligent design 's big claims .
In 26 accessible pages , Miller lays out intelligent design claims about the bacterial flagellum , the blood clotting cascade , and the information encoded in our DNA .
What 's unique about this chapter is that Miller sets up the anti-evolutionary arguments without rebuttal .
Rather than tiring the reader with something along the lines of " intelligent design advocates say this , but evolutionary biologists say this , " Miller gets the reader nodding along , setting the bar nice and high for evolution .
As an example of intelligent design , " the flagellum certainly seems like the real deal , does n't it ? "
This strategy is brilliant .
Miller 's goal is to persuade , but how can you be persuasive in your rebuttal if your audience does n't know the argument you are attacking ?
Miller sets the bar high for evolution because he knows scientists can meet the challenge .
We do n't need to short - change design 's advocates by distorting their arguments , because science can in fact demolish them as they are .
After letting intelligent design have its best shot , Miller lowers the boom .
At first glance , the bacterial flagellum sounds persuasive as an example of design , but how does design really stack up as a science ?
Genuine scientists are n't generally satisfied with just tossing ideas out there .
To be successful , scientists have to embrace their ideas - they take them and test them by applying these ideas in detailed , novel situations .
A prime example of this is the fossil record .
Miller notes that efforts to explain patterns of change observed in the fossil record have played a major role in the development of evolutionary science .
He uses the evolution of the horse family to illustrate the level of detail at which scientists apply their ideas .
Scientists have found fossils covering hundreds of extinct species and 55 million years of horse evolution .
Using evidence from the fossil record , scientists have a detailed explanation for how the horse family developed , from a North American creature the size of a house cat to today 's species that include horses , zebras , and donkeys .
The fossils illustrate the evolutionary concepts of speciation and adaptive radiation , and scientists have correlated these developments with changes in climate and vegetation - exactly the types of environmental changes that evolutionary biologists expect to influence the evolutionary developments observed in the fossil record .
As Miller puts it , scientists have embraced evolution and applied it in detail to the horse fossil record .
What about design ?
Have design advocates embraced their ideas ?
Where are their detailed alternate explanations for the horse fossil record ?
What would a detailed intelligent design theory look like in this case ?
Not much :
First , it would not consider [ the horse family ] a family at all .
From the ID perspective , the relationships detailed in figure 3.1 are n't real , because descent with modification , which is another name for evolution , never actually took place .
Those ancestor - descendant relationships so apparent to paleontologists are just an illusion .
In fact , the evolutionary tree leading to modern horses is n't a tree at all , but just a collection of individual species , directly created by the designer , each without any relationship to the other .
What happened over time is that the designer created a handful of little browsing species and then , as each one went extinct , he replaced it with a modified version .
When those went extinct , he drafted another round of replacements , and then another , then another .
Whatever one can say of this designer , he 's persistent .
He 's also not very skillful , since just about everything he creates goes extinct relatively soon after its first appearance .
Unless of course , constant extinction is part of his master plan .
Examining each major intelligent design claim one by one , we see that design advocates have repeatedly failed to take their own ideas seriously .
In each case , from blood clotting to information in our DNA , evolutionary biologists have rolled up their sleeves and gotten their hands dirty , while design advocates have not conducted a single field study or lab experiment to test their ideas .
And in fact their ideas turn out to be little more than negative arguments against evolutionary biology 's explanations .
At bottom , " even when presented with every opportunity to make their case , the defenders of design resorted to little more than saying ' It 's not good enough for me ' in the face of overwhelming evidence for evolution . "
The Overwhelming Case for Evolution
Having disposed with intelligent design 's claims to be a science , Miller next sets for himself the task of showing his readers just what some of that overwhelming evidence for evolution is .
Many books have covered the same ground , but Miller has learned to pick easy - to - grasp examples that leave a lasting impression .
He puts a lot of focus on recent developments that have come with the availability of thousands of genome DNA sequences and new experimental techniques that have led to the explosion of the science of evo-devo .
What 's most remarkable about all of these discoveries is that they all represent the most recent tests of evolutionary theory .
It was possible for things to have turned out differently - we could have cracked open our genome and discovered that its structure strongly contradicted the core claims of evolutionary theory .
Instead , modern genome sciences have yet again vindicated Darwin .
This is n't the place to reproduce Miller 's detailed examples here ( plus the book is short and very readable - it's worth making the trip to Borders or your local library ) .
But the science has come so far that we can conclude that " we really do know enough about the mechanism of evolutionary change to account for the large scale changes that produce genuine novelty .
As a science , evolution keeps getting better and better at explaining the biological world .
Where do Humans Fit In ?
We 've come a long way in our discussion with the honestly curious reader .
Miller has laid out what intelligent design is , how it fails to be a science , and he has shown that evolutionary biology , by contrast , is a thriving science that is overwhelmingly supported by what we observe in the natural world .
But Miller knows this is n't enough - inevitably after his lectures , someone asks the big question :
" How can you tell me that I 'm just an animal ?
How can you say that I 'm no better than the beasts ?
That the only things that matter in life are to struggle , survive , and mate ?
There 's just got to be much more to life than that . "
Personally , I do n't understand the angst .
I do n't understand why we have to somehow prove ourselves better than animals .
If I live a fulfilling life , nurturing family relationships and friendships , exercising my mind , enjoying the beauty of the world around us , that 's enough , no matter where we came from .
Just because we can trace our ancestry back a million years to non-human animals does n't lessen the value of the personal relationships in my life , nor does it make me less bound to act morally .
There is more to life that just struggling , surviving , and mating - it 's obvious in our everyday activities , and the fact that we 're related to apes does n't change it .
But for many people the angst is real , and here someone like Miller , who is genuinely religious , has a big role to play in our national conversation over evolution .
His most important point is that evolution is not random , it is contingent .
If we rewound the tape of life , and replayed evolutionary history on our planet , would we still get intelligent beings ?
Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould famously said absolutely not , but Miller says not so fast .
He points to the repeated examples of convergent evolution in life - eyes , wings , and brains have evolved independently and repeatedly on this planet .
Both vertebrates and cephalopods have managed to evolve species with sophisticated eyes and intelligent brains .
Nothing on earth right now competes with human intelligence of course , but it is not unreasonable to think that if you replayed life on earth over and over and over , you would , perhaps more often than not , end up with intelligent beings who could fill a role similar to ours .
What this means then is that we are not , as some critics of evolution would have it , just a " mistake of nature . "
There are many options available for finding meaning in our lives , and Miller suggests that " the great value of science is that it speaks to a common human culture of rational understanding , and that culture is accessible both within and outside of a religious context . "
He is suggesting that we can and should defuse ' evolution versus creation ' as a conflict between religion and atheism .
In fact , science can be actually be a place of common ground for the religious and the non-religious .
The Stakes Are High
Valuing that potentially common culture of science is critical , because the stakes in the fight between evolution and design are high .
This is not a curriculum conflict over an esoteric branch of science that can safely be ignored .
Our very ability to keep science working in our culture is at stake .
To illustrate , Miller quotes Allan Bloom , author of The Closing of the American Mind :
The danger [ today 's students ] have been taught to fear is not error but intolerance .
Relativism is necessary to openness , and this is the virtue , the only virtue , which all primary education for more than fifty years has dedicated itself to incubating ...
The point is not to correct the mistakes and really be right , rather it is not to think you are right at all .
Bloom thought the natural sciences were immune to this - science is about correcting mistakes and being as right as we can be given the evidence , not about accepting all theories as equal in the name of tolerance .
But now intelligent design is trying to change the rules of the game .
Unable to succeed in demonstrating design with the scientific method as it currently stands , they advocate changing the scientific method itself to allow religious explanations .
This is what a minority on the Kansas State School Board wrote in 2005 :
The current definition of science is intended to reflect a concept called methodological naturalism , which irrefutably assumes that cause - and - effect laws ( as of physics and chemistry ) are adequate to account for all phenomena and that teleological or design conceptions of nature are invalid .
Although called a " method of science , " the effect of its use is to limit inquiry ( and permissible explanations ) and thus to promote the philosophy of Naturalism ...
In other words , its not fair that science does n't allow supernatural explanations .
If intelligent design advocates could change the rules of science , then invocations of God 's hand would be just as valid as " cause - and - effect laws . "
Miller is right that these are high stakes , and the intelligent design movement sees it too .
Miller quotes a leading design advocate , William Dembski :
The implications of intelligent design are radical in the true sense of this much overused word .
The question posed by intelligent design is not how we should do science and theology in light of the triumph of Enlightenment rationalism and scientific naturalism .
The question is rather how we should do science and theology in light of the impending collapse of Enlightenment rationalism and scientific naturalism .
These ideologies are on the way out ... because they are bankrupt .
That science is bankrupt would surprise anyone who follows the uninterrupted stream of spectacular advances found week after week in science journals , not to mention anyone who enjoys the ubiquitous technology that springs from modern science .
The scientific method is n't perfect , and not all of its products have been benign , but it forms a core element of our society 's success in the modern world .
If we let design advocates destroy science education , our place as a world leader in science and technology will gradually decline , and within a generation or two we will have completely forfeited our leadership in science .
The scientific community can only thrive in a culture that values science - by funding it , by teaching it to our children , and by letting it enrich our individual lives , whether it 's the science that brings us laptops and iPods or the science that lets us look up at a pitch black expanse of night sky and understand that were are made of stuff that was produced in the furnaces of the stars .
If you only want to read one book on our national discussion about evolution , make it Only A Theory .
Ken Miller 's aim is persuasion , not polemics , and our society will benefit from the conversation he is leading .

The Infinity Machine
an exploration of a fantasy world
by Simon Tatham
The Infinity Machine is an extended speculation .
Based on an idea I got from a book I read once , and refined over many years of idle moments , it tries to imagine what the field of computing would be like if computers were able to run infinitely fast .
This is not fiction : it has no plot , no characters , and no action .
On the other hand , it could almost be called " science fiction " in the sense that it takes a premise ( " what if ... " ) and explores the consequences .
But it is n't science fiction in the usual sense , because it tells no story .
The Infinity Machine is likely to appeal mostly to computer programmers , and perhaps also to some mathematicians .
It is a speculation at the technical level .
It does n't explore the social consequences of the premise , merely the technical implications for computer architecture , operating system and compiler design , networking , and cryptography .
If you 're a " hacker " type who finds these things inherently interesting , read on .
If you 're not , you will most likely be bored .
You have been warned .
I thought this idea up when I was 15 or so , and I 've been taking the speculation further in spare moments ever since then .
It 's my own little fantasy world , and it 's been so much fun exploring it that I thought I 'd write it down in the hope that somebody else might like it too .
Dedication
This work is dedicated to Ian Stewart , for writing Game , Set and Math which contained the inspiration for all of this .
Getting Started
What might it even mean for a computer to run infinitely fast ?
In Game , Set and Math by Ian Stewart , one of the characters makes a throwaway remark .
Imagine , he said , a light switch .
Switch it on .
After a second , switch it off .
After another half second , back on again .
Off after another quarter , on after another eighth , and so on , halving the time interval each time .
After two seconds , any mathematician knows , you will have switched the switch an infinite number of times .
So after those two seconds are up , is the light on or off ?
( Off , said another character , because you 'll blow the fuse if you switch it that fast .
So the first character hit him . )
The book then briefly mentions that it might be fun to build a computer like that light switch : after the first second it makes a computation , after the next half second it makes another , after the next quarter ... and so by the time two seconds are up it will have made infinitely many computational steps .
So you could test , rather than proving , conjectures such as Goldbach 's : every even number is the sum of two primes .
You set up the program , wait two seconds , and you have your answer : either " no such integer found " , or a printout of the smallest counterexample .
Clearly such a computer could never exist in this Universe , and neither could the infinite memory it would need to hold the huge numbers it would be working with .
But let 's not let mere reality stand in our way ; suppose we did live in a world in which it was possible .
What would life be like for the programmers in that world ?
Memory Layout
The Infinity Machine 's memory , let 's suppose , is an infinitely long line of bits , numbered from zero .
For every non-negative integer there exists a bit .
How are we to find enough structure in this long line to be able to encompass large numbers of infinitely long strings ?
The old infinite - hotel puzzle ( also known as " Hilbert 's Hotel " after Hilbert the mathematician ) begins to give us the answer .
In a hotel containing infinitely many rooms , all of which are full , how do you find room for infinitely many new guests ?
Simply move every guest to the room with twice the number - room 1 moves to room 2 , room 2 to room 4 , 3 to 6 , and so on - and then all the odd - numbered rooms are free .
So we can split any infinite stream of bits into two infinite streams by separating the odd bits from the even bits .
Each of those streams , in turn , can be split .
And so on - so we can have a binary tree of bit streams , all of which can fit in the Machine 's memory without interfering with one another .
That sounds promising , but I think with a little more structure we can do even better .
Instead of splitting a stream into two , let 's split it into an infinite number of substreams , like this : split the stream in two , then split one of the remaining streams in two , then split one of those two in two , and so on .
So for a stream S , we have a substream S [ 0 ] containing all the bits whose indices are 1 mod 2 , a substream S [ 1 ] containing the bits whose indices are 2 mod 4 , S [ 2 ] with indices 4 mod 8 , and so on .
So any stream of bits can quickly be separated into infinitely many substreams .
Better still , the substreams can be separated into sub-substreams and so on ... S [ 2 ] [ 34 ] [ 22 ] or whatever .
The whole system has the property that any substream , at any level , can be identified by a starting index and an increment - an arithmetic progression .
There are better properties than that , though . S [ 0 ] contains all the bits whose index within S ends in a 1 when written in binary .
S [ 1 ] contains the bits whose index ends in 10 , S [ 2 ] the bits ending in 100 , and in general S [ n ] contains the bits whose index within S ends in a 1 followed by n zeros .
Following on from this , we find that S [ i ] [ j ] [ k ] contains the bits whose index in S ends in a 1 , i zeros , a 1 , j zeros , a 1 , and k zeros .
So given an " address " in the form of start index plus increment , we can easily compute the sequence of substream indices that led to that address from the root stream ( the whole memory ) .
In particular , we can move " up " one level , to the stream 's parent , and then back " down " to find its immediate neighbours .
This , I think , would be a good basis for the Infinity Machine 's memory architecture .
Most data types follow naturally from this : an array is easily implemented within a stream by placing element i in S [ i ] - and then the array can hold infinitely many elements , and each element is of infinite size and in turn can hold anything it likes .
Array elements need not be the same type - so a compiler can map names to array indices , and voilà !
a structure .
An arbitrary integer can be stored in an infinite bit stream in a wide variety of ways , even ways as silly as n zeros followed by a one .
It does n't seem worth choosing one .
A pointer has to be encoded as two integers , because it must specify a starting index and an increment in order to identify a substream .
Because we can always find the parent stream of any substream , we can perform pointer arithmetic by finding S and i such that the pointer P describes S [ i ] , and then constructing S [ i + x ] for integer x .
( Interestingly , a pointer physically can't run off the bottom of its array - it would be meaningless to try to subtract from a pointer to element zero - and since the array has infinite extent it can't run off the top either .
No more rogue dereferences blowing things up ! )
Clocking
My original vision of the Infinity Machine was that it would have a basic clock rate - perhaps 1KHz or something about as feeble - and in its basic mode it ticked along at 1KHz executing one instruction per cycle .
However , one of the possible instructions would be the " infinity " instruction , the execution of which would cause its 1/1000 second clock cycle to be split into a half , a quarter , an eighth and so on , with one instruction being run in each fragment , So in a single " base " clock cycle , the Machine would execute either a single instruction or a single infinite sequence of them .
After an infinite sequence terminated , control would resume at a point specified in the initial " infinity " instruction .
Any bit of memory modified only finitely often by the infinite run would have a well - defined value on exit from the sequence ; any bit modified infinitely often , like Ian Stewart 's light switch , would have an " unpredictable " value .
( This is " modified " in the strong sense of having its value changed , not in the weak sense of being written to ; repeatedly writing the same value to a bit does n't count as modification . )
This is an interesting architecture from a mathematician 's point of view .
It forces you to think carefully about what computations can be done in one infinite sequence , or maybe two or three .
Computing a Mandelbrot set to arbitrary depth , for example , can be done happily in a single infinite sequence : you compute the points you need using increasingly high precision fixed point arithmetic , and update the result array repeatedly .
For each point , there will be a precision beyond which the approximations yield the " right " answer , and so all subsequent computations at higher and higher precision will not alter the value of that pixel .
So by the end of your infinite run , the results will have stabilised and will be predictable on routine exit .
As a computer scientist , however , I have a slight horror of things which wo n't nest to arbitrary depth .
If this " infinity " instruction can turn a 1KHz clock cycle into an infinite sequence , why should n't it be able to do the same to any finitely long clock cycle - such as the ones inside the original infinite sequence ?
Then you could have a single base clock cycle , divided into infinitely many subcycles , an infinite subset of which could also be divided the same way , and so on ... the machine could run infinitely many infinite computations within a single tick .
Recreational mathematicians will probably see this as cheating .
It makes it much easier to achieve a lot of things which would still have been possible with some contortion on the original restricted Machine , but robs us of the pleasure of thinking up the contortions .
But the enhanced arbitrarily - nestable version makes for more interesting computer science , so I 'm deliberately choosing to go with that .
For the rest of this work I 'll be assuming we have an extended Infinity Machine .
As an aside , here 's an example of a very useful operation on the extended Machine which I believe is painful on the original : testing whether an infinite bit stream contains finitely or infinitely many ones .
Take one infinite run down the stream ; every time you see a zero , set the corresponding bit in an infinite workspace to 1 , and every time you see a one , set the whole workspace back to 0 .
( The workspace starts as all 0 . )
Then every bit of the workspace is modified at most twice and is therefore well defined on exit .
Next , set our output variable to " infinite " and take a second infinite run , in which we examine the workspace for 1s .
If we find one , we set our output variable to " finite " .
At the end of this second run we have our answer .
Now on the original Machine , this requires two infinite runs and thus takes two base cycles , but on the extended Machine it can all be done within another infinite run .
Instruction Set
Speed on the Infinity Machine is n't much of an issue , unsurprisingly .
It is n't necessary to have a massive array of instructions , as long as you have a few which can have the right effects .
For a while I speculated that perhaps all you needed was a few simple bit operations and the " infinity " instruction , and then you'd be able to build addition ( even of arbitrarily long integers ) out of an " infinity " followed by a long string of bit-ops .
However , the Machine itself must have an inherent ability to do addition at a level below the instruction set , since it must increment its program counter every time it fetches a new instruction .
So I think that , realistically , a " successor " operator must exist in the instruction set .
It 's quite tempting to use the minimalist " register machine " instruction set : one instruction increments an integer register by 1 , and the other branches if it is zero but otherwise decrements it .
These two instructions , together with " halt " , form a machine equivalent to a Turing machine , so with the addition of some I/O primitives and the all - important " infinity " instruction they are sufficient .
For personal taste , I 'd prefer to see some elementary bitwise operations ( AND , OR , XOR ) as well , but of course you can build an AND using an " infinity " containing adds and subtracts .
I 'm not going to dwell much further on the Infinity Machine 's instruction set : there is a wide range of options and I do n't think it 's very important which is chosen .
One thing I would like to see , though , is for instructions to be infinitely long .
( A program is an array , and the program counter steps along it . )
This allows " load " instructions to contain their own literals , and more usefully it allows the " infinity " instruction to contain its own instruction substream .
Interrupt Handling
The Infinity Machine can execute n instructions as easily as one .
In any finite - length clock cycle , be it at base level or some distance down , the Machine might choose , instead of executing the instruction in its queue , to execute a notional " infinity " instruction within which are some number of additional instructions , then the one it was supposed to execute , and then an infinite sequence of NOPs to use up the remains of the subsequence .
This provides a natural means by which the Machine can handle interrupts .
At the beginning of any clock cycle , it checks to see if any interrupts are pending , and if so it runs a notional " infinity " which contains the interrupt handler (s ) and the scheduled instruction .
This achieves an arbitrary amount of processing in response to any interrupt , without affecting the performance of the interrupted code ( since the scheduled instruction gets executed at some point during the same cycle it would otherwise have taken the whole of ) .
This scheme means that the maximum latency of an interrupt is twice the base clock rate : if an interrupt arrives just after the start of a base cycle which is not an " infinity " , it will be serviced during a notional " infinity " in the following base cycle .
Of course , if it arrives during the execution of an " infinity " , the response time might be much quicker .
( It 's worth noting that this interrupt scheme can be handled entirely in software , by having the Machine emulate itself at full speed .
The details are left as an exercise for the reader ... )
Operating System
The obvious way to run a multi-process operating system is for the OS , in every base cycle , to run an " infinity " in which it lets each process execute instructions until the process reaches a blocking system call .
This allows every process to run as fast as its I/O and IPC requirements will allow it .
Of course , if the process needs to perform infinite computation rather than just doing finite computations arbitrarily fast , then the process can issue its own " infinity " instructions within the OS's .
The Infinity Machine requires no hardware memory protection to implement security between processes : instead of allowing each process to run instructions directly , it would be just as quick to emulate the instructions in a process - and the emulation could provide all the memory protection and security features the OS required .
Better still , the emulation could provide additions to the instruction set , and then the Machine itself would n't have to have a trap instruction for system calls ( or INT , or SWI , or whatever you like to call it ) .
Although the Infinity Machine removes a lot of the programmer 's traditional worries such as algorithm optimisation , OS design is not one of them .
You could emulate each process in a separate virtual memory space which the process could n't see outside , or you could emulate all processes in a shared memory space and deliberately protect each process from reads and writes by the others .
In the multiple address space model , you could provide a system call to set up shared memory between processes ( easily implemented without special hardware , of course : whenever a process writes to a shared area the emulator just repeats the write in all other copies of the area ) ; in the single address space model you can provide a system call whereby a process can allow a part of its memory to be readable to another .
There is still more than one way to design an OS , and there is plenty of scope for the usual holy wars about which way is best .
More frighteningly still , with the advent of inter-process communication , the time - slicing situation becomes more interesting .
Suddenly it does n't seem to be enough that a process gets one time slice every base clock cycle !
If two processes are communicating , they might want to do serious communication - not just exchanging infinite amounts of data , but exchanging data infinitely often .
One time slice per process per base cycle only allows a finite frequency of data exchange , and not a high frequency at that .
One IPC model that seems peculiarly well suited to this sort of work is the message - passing model .
Suppose I am a process wishing to communicate with another process .
I send it a message - as usual , my message is just an infinitely long bit stream - and it processes the message and returns me a result .
My process has effectively yielded a part of its time slice to the other process .
For this to work in the Infinity Machine , the receiving process would have had to register the address of a message - handling function with the OS .
The sending of a message is a system call , and when my process executes that system call the OS responds by running an " infinity " instruction in which it calls the other process 's message handler .
The result of the handler is returned to me .
The time this takes out of my time slice is predictable - just one clock cycle , which itself was probably a few " infinity " sequences deep - and so I can pass data to another process arbitrarily often .
More confusingly still , the other process 's message handler might respond by formulating a reply and passing it back to my message handler - so my own process is running again , during the part of my time slice I have voluntarily given up to the other process .
Indeed , there 's no reason why our message handlers should n't call one another in a bottomless recursion , passing data back and forth rather like coroutines !
It may take up infinite stack space , but we have that to spare ... and it'll all be over in the blink of an eye in any case .
( This bit makes my head spin , I admit . )
OS design in the Infinity Machine seems to me to be a fertile field , with plenty of design choices left which are n't rendered meaningless by the extra computing power .
Many of the good old holy wars in finite OS design are still applicable , and there are new ones too .
( I dread to even think about the prospect of infinitely many processes running at once ... )
Programming Language and Compiler Design
The " obvious " extension to a language like C , to support the " infinity " instruction , is to introduce a new kind of block construct , infinity .
This would surround a block of code and cause it to be executed within an " infinity " instruction .
For example :
true = 1 ; infinity { int i , j ; for ( i = 2 ; ; i += 2 ) { for ( j = i - 1 ; j > 0 ; j--) if ( prime ( j ) && prime ( i - j ) ) break ; if ( j <= 0 ) /* this even number is NOT the sum of 2 primes */ true = 0 ; } } printf ( " Goldbach 's conjecture is %s
" , true ? " TRUE " : " FALSE " ) ;
This fairly simple piece of code would establish once and for all the truth or otherwise of Goldbach 's conjecture .
The infinite run uses the contents of the braces , and at the end of the subdivided clock cycle , execution resumes after the last closing brace .
So far , so simple .
After all , once we 've swallowed the existence of an " infinity " machine instruction in the first place , it 's hardly difficult to envisage an extra keyword in C to make use of it .
( Although that 's not the only extension to C present : notice that those innocent - looking " int i " and " int j " must be true integer variables - able to store any whole number , no matter how big .
Quite where this leaves " long int " is an exercise for the reader ... )
The fun begins when we consider blocking system calls in our programs , such as read ( ) .
If our program executes read ( ) at the top level , no problem : the call will block the process until data is available and then execution will resume .
But if read ( ) is executed within an " infinity " block , then when the process resumes , it must start another " infinity " run in the next time slice to finish off the block .
Since , in general , a blocking call might be ( perhaps accidentally ) executed arbitrarily many " infinity " levels deep , a compiler for this variant of C must have some impressive capabilities .
Perhaps the compiler would output a small standard interpreter module and translate the program itself into a form acceptable to the interpreter - then the interpreter might be able to have direct knowledge of the process 's time slices and take care of resuming " infinity " blocks after a task switch .
Alternatively , we could choose to disallow blocking system calls within an " infinity " block .
This is n't terribly desirable either , since catching this at compile time would require a language attribute on all functions - and worse , on all function pointers , leading to the same chaos that happened when ANSI C acquired " const " , as everybody scrabbled to update their programs to put the qualifiers in the right places , and inevitably lazy people ended up casting the " const " away instead of handling it properly .
The only remaining solution is to forbid blocking system calls within " infinity " blocks at the OS level - have the call return EWOULDBLOCK .
That 's probably the lowest - effort solution , but hardly ideal ...
Network
Networking in the Infinity Machine has all the problems of IPC , without the easy availability of solutions .
We have a choice of networking models to consider in the Infinity Machine world ; possibly the most obvious is the one which allows us to transfer an infinite amount of data in an instant .
We 'll assume that the receiving Machine will place the data in a queue and schedule an interrupt , after which the receiving process on the machine will be able to access and use the data .
The single biggest question , then , is this : is it possible for two processes on different Infinity Machines to exchange data infinitely often ?
Exchanging infinite amounts of data finitely often might not be enough for some applications .
In the absence of security requirements , of course , one process could transfer all its data to the other , which could then perform the needed computation and return the results - but when the two processes do n't trust one another , they will each want to keep some data private from the other and will therefore both need to perform parts of whatever computation is taking place .
As soon as this computation becomes sufficiently complex , the processes will need to exchange data infinitely often .
We could perhaps imagine a situation in which both Machines arrange to run an " infinity " cycle at about the same time , and then they exchange data as fast as possible within this cycle .
For this to allow an infinite number of data exchanges , though , it is necessary that the " infinity " cycles end at exactly the same instant : if one cycle ends before the other , then the machine whose cycle ends second will only have managed to execute a finite number of instructions .
It 's difficult to prove this sort of result mathematically - and if there is one thing the Infinity Machine is it 's mathematically well defined .
However , I conjecture that in order for two Machines to exchange data an infinite number of times in a finite time span , the two Machines must have synchronised clocks .
( Addendum , as of 23 - Jun - 2001 )
Interestingly , there is a very useful application for two Machines exchanging data infinitely many times : it makes for a completely reliable transaction .
In finite networking , to perform a transaction between two machines ( in the sense that either both machines do something , or neither does , but never only one ) , you usually use an exchange of confirmation packets , and each machine completes the transaction if it detected no dropped packets in the exchange .
This suffers from the problem that if the last packet in the sequence is dropped , the sending side will not notice , so there is always the chance of one side completing the transaction and the other side not doing so .
But with two Infinity Machines , you could exchange an infinite sequence of confirmations , and each side would complete the transaction if and only if it had received an infinite number of packets .
This is perfectly reliable , because at most one packet ( the initiating one ) is ever sent not in response to another ; so if I have received an infinite number of packets , I know the other Machine must have sent an infinite number of packets ; and since all but at most one of those must have been in response to one of my packets , I know the other Machine must also have received an infinite number of packets !
So with 100 % reliability , I complete my end of the transaction if , and only if , the other Machine completes its .
Cryptography
The Infinity Machine can bring all known forms of cryptography to a grinding halt , except of course for the one - time pad .
Any RSA public key can be instantly inverted to find the corresponding private key , allowing signature forging and decryption .
Diffie - Hellman key exchange is no better - the Machine can listen to the key exchange , quickly solve the discrete logarithm problem and obtain the session key .
Hash functions can be reversed to find other plaintexts with the same hash .
Even symmetric algorithms with a shared secret key are n't safe - with an appreciable amount of ciphertext and only a vague idea of the nature of the data ( " ASCII text " for example ) , the Machine can try all possible decryption keys and see which potential plaintexts fall within the description of the real plaintext .
There will probably be few enough left that choosing the right one is a matter for only a moment 's thought !
One - time pads are still safe : even the Infinity Machine can't get around the fact that trying all possible one - time pads is equivalent to trying all possible messages - arbitrarily many other perfectly plausible answers will come up alongside the right one and there is no way to tell which is which .
So having brought finite cryptography to its knees , what does the Infinity Machine offer as an alternative ?
Before addressing this question , I 'd like to digress briefly to talk about random numbers .
No finite key of any kind is safe from a listening Infinity Machine , which can try all finite keys .
Therefore any viable infinite cryptosystem must require an infinite supply of random numbers .
Where to get them from ?
Perhaps they could come from the unpredictability of any memory bit modified infinitely often within an " infinity " cycle .
I said in the " Clocking " section that any such bit comes out of the other end of the cycle with an unpredictable value ; possibly a good cryptographic extension to the Machine would be to have those bits be truly random rather than merely unreliable .
So it 's easy to generate an infinite one - time pad : just execute the simple piece of code
bit x [ ] ; /* infinite array of single bits */ infinity { int i = 0 ; for ( ; ; ) { infinity { int j ; for ( j = 0 ; ; j ++ ) bit[j ] = i ; } i = ~i ; } }
and you will have filled your bit array with random numbers .
( Reader exercise : how might a really paranoid OS detect and prohibit the generation and use of random numbers by an unprivileged process ? )
Assuming a secure channel to transmit this one - time pad through , Alice 's future communications with Bob are now assured .
She can select infinitely many infinite subsets of this one - time pad and never exhaust it .
She need only transmit a starting position and a step size , just like addressing a substream of the Infinity Machine 's memory , and Bob can pick the same substream out of his copy of the pad .
( Addendum , as of 7 - Jul - 2003 :
In fact , given an infinite one - time key you can not merely encrypt unbreakably , but you can both encrypt and MAC unforgeably in one operation .
Break the one - time key into infinitely many infinite subsequences in the usual way .
Take the first of these sequences , and use it to encode the first bit of the plaintext , using two bits of key at a time : set one of the first two bits of the output , chosen by a key bit , to be equal to the first bit of plaintext XORed with the second key bit .
Then set one of the next two output bits , chosen by a third key bit , to be equal to the first plaintext bit XORed with a fourth key bit , and so on .
So you end up with infinitely many copies of the first plaintext bit , stored in an unpredictable infinite subset of the ciphertext , XORed with never - again used bits of one - time key .
Now take the second infinite key subsequence , and use it to encode the second plaintext bit infinitely many times in the remaining unused ciphertext bits in the same way , and so on .
The decryptor must check every copy of every bit to provide the MAC functionality ; for an attacker to correctly alter even one bit of the plaintext , they must correctly guess infinitely many key bits in order to work out which set of bits must be flipped in the ciphertext .
So it is probability zero that this scheme could ever be broken . )
So that 's symmetric cryptography sorted .
The key must be infinite , but once it 's there it 's just as safe as a one - time pad and never runs out .
Asymmetric cryptography , then , is the hard part .
We are going to require a function that maps an infinite bit sequence ( the private key , or some preliminary value that will yield both keys ) to another infinite bit sequence ( the public key ) non-reversibly .
( For public - key cryptography , in fact we require more properties than that : we will need the transformation to be one which intrinsically also provides a means of using the public key to encrypt something that only the private key can decrypt .
But let 's consider the general idea of a trapdoor function first : it will provide us with secure hashing if we can manage it , and that 's useful in itself . )
The problem with non-reversibility is step - by - step analysis .
If the output stream contains bits whose value depends on only finitely many of the input bits , then it is vulnerable : knowing the value of that output bit allows you to rule out a lot of values for the inputs .
In general , any input bit which is part of a finite set of bits that determine an output bit is weak , and if the input contains weak bits then there is a problem .
So a trapdoor function will need to be one in which each output bit depends on an infinite subset of the input bits .
I can't think of anything of that kind which would also be bijective , or even close enough to bijectivity to work .
Readers are invited to help out here !
( Addendum , as of 19 - Aug - 2006 : some progress on this .
Suppose you divide the space of infinite bit streams into equivalence classes such that two streams are equivalent iff their bitwise XOR is computable by a finitely long program .
Suppose you then invoke the Axiom of Choice to find a representative member of each equivalence class .
Then , given an input bit stream , you XOR it with the representative member for its own equivalence class , giving a computable bit stream , which you can then convert into the finite program which generates it and then generate a hash bit by ordinary finite hashing .
Repeat infinitely many times , with a fresh invocation of the Axiom of Choice for each output bit , and you have an infinitely long bit stream derived from your input one .
I believe even an Infinity Machine cannot invert this function , because taking into account any finite subset of the output bits does not narrow down the possible inputs to the point where they cease to be uncountable .
So this looks like a workable hash function .
Unfortunately , as far as I can see , each invocation of the AoC requires uncountably many bits to store its output , and uncountably many instructions to be executed to invent it in the first place , so an Infinity Machine as I 've described it cannot compute the hash function either !
And if you go one better and introduce an Uncountable Machine , then it can probably invert the function as well as computing it .
Does this mean public trapdoor functions are infeasible on the Infinity Machine , or is there a completely different approach ? )
Conclusion
I 've presented the Infinity Machine , a mathematical definition of an infinitely fast computer system .
I 've explored the effects of infinite storage and infinite speed on operating system design , language design , networking and cryptography .
The Infinity Machine 's world is a radically different one from the one we poor finite computer programmers live in , and yet hauntingly familiar as well .
It still contains unanswered questions , such as whether it would be possible to contrive any scheme of asymmetric cryptography to replace the various finite public - key systems that the Machine renders obsolete .
I hope you 've enjoyed my tour of this fantasy world .
I 'd be fascinated to see any contributions anyone else has .
Astrophysicists Rely on Linux to Crunch Data
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 23 , 2008
There 's been a lot of talk about the gigantic particle accelerator known as the Large Hadron Collider recently .
Lots of people were excited about the search for the theoretical Higgs boson .
A few were concerned that it would open a black hole and end life as we know it .
Most were disappointed when technical issues forced the Collider 's early shutdown for repairs .
Few people , though , mentioned that part of the multi-billion dollar project relies heavily on Linux .
Linux Magazine has a fascinating look at how the Collider 's data processing grid is powered by Scientific Linux , a derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
Author Kristian Kissling says , " Contrary to what its name implies , Scientific Linux is not a collector of research software .
It is rather based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
CERN , Fermilab and other universities and research facilities contribute to the Linux distribution ’s development and adapt it to the needs of the worldwide research community . "
It 's this custom version of Linux that astrophysicists around the world are running on computers that will crunch roughly 15 million gigabytes of data from the super - collider 's various tests .
Though the collider is expected to be out of service for about two months , once it 's up and running , you can donate a portion of your computer 's resources to CERN 's Large Hadron Collider project via the LHC@home project .
NASA astronaut Nicole Stott leads the way as spaceflyers test out the new COLBERT treadmill on the International Space Station in October 2009 .
Staying fit in space is about to get easier now that astronauts on the International Space Station have finished building a new zero - gravity treadmill named after TV comedian Stephen Colbert .
Dubbed COLBERT after the host of Comedy Central 's " The Colbert Report , " the new exercise treadmill is now awaiting a series of tests to make sure it 's working correctly before astronauts can begin running on it .
" It 's done , and we 're looking at it right now , " space station flight engineer Nicole Stott said Monday via a video link .
The $ 5 million space treadmill was unpacked on the orbiting lab in September , but took about 20 hours for astronauts to put it together from more than 100 pieces .
Four of the station 's six astronaut residents wore broad smiles as they piled onto the treadmill for an impromptu " test run " last week , but spun their legs in weightlessness since the exercise machine was not yet ready for full operations .
Officially called the Combined Operational Load-BearingExternal Resistance Treadmill ( or COLBERT ) , the hardware got its name as a consolation prize for Mr. Colbert , who won an online NASA contest for the naming rights to a new space station module set to launch next ( NASA opted to name the new module Tranquility instead ) .
" It 's all put together in its rack but it has n't been checked out yet , " NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told SPACE.com .
" The team is working on it .
They 'll evaluate the data and the crew will be given a ' go ' or ' no go ' to run on it . "
The treadmill is one of a suite of instruments spaceflyers use to fight the bone loss and muscle decay associated with space travel .
The COLBERT treadmill should provide a better workout than the existing treadmill on the station , though both will continue to be used , Humphries said .
" They can have increased force as their foot falls as they hit the treadmill and that 's what really helps with maintaining their bone density , " Humphries said .
" It 's a commercial off - the - shelf treadmill that 's been outfitted especially for spaceflight . "
To keep from floating away while running on it , astronauts will have to attach themselves to the treadmill with elastic straps on their shoulders and waists .
" It 's actually a beautiful piece of hardware , " Stott said .
" I think it 's going to be a really excellent piece of exercise equipment .
We 're actually really looking forward to getting to run all over COLBERT . "
The hardware is also specially designed to spread a minimum of vibrations through the space station , so as not to disturb the sensitive science experiments and instruments onboard .
Now that it 's built , the COLBERT should only need an occasional greasing of its bearings to stay operational .
The treadmill is built to handle 150,000 miles of running , NASA officials said .
The e-mails , comments and threats kept pouring in across the country for my column , Palin : McCain 's version of ' Trust me , ' and I knew I 'd struck a nerve .
But then a couple readers told me how they 'd heard about it :
The column had been forwarded by Gov. Sarah Palin 's people ( allegedly ) as part of their toddler tantrum on the mean ole media .
That might explain the curious number of people who have written to tell me that I have no right to express opinions in an opinion column .
I am deeply flattered .
I would advise them read Anne Kornblut 's analysis of what 's fair game in elections .
Good stuff , especially when you consider that the Hillary Clinton campaign dragged her personal reputation through the mud .
I am utterly sickened by the John McCain campaign 's contempt for the American people .
No one expressed it better than spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace who declared on MSNBC that the American public does n't need Palin to answer questions .
When Time editor Jay Carney , a friend of McCain's , politely expressed incredulity that Palin would dodge questions from the press , Wallace shrieked , " Who cares !?
Who cares ?
But I mean , like , from who , from you ?
Who cares ?
No offense .
Who cares if she can talk to Time magazine ? "
Now I understand there will be folks shouting , " Good !
Stick in the the media ! "
Yeah , we in the media can be arrogant jerks .
Sometimes we do n't tell you what you need to know , just all about John Edwards ' possible love baby , if McCain looked good against a green screen and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright shouting a couple times .
But few voters actually get to talk to Barack Obama , Joe Biden , John McCain or Sarah Palin in person .
That 's where the media come in .
We can ask the questions you 'll never be able to in your living room .
You should know what Sarah Palin thinks we should do about Iran 's nuclear program .
You should hear about her plan for the foreclosure crisis .
You have a right to know what she thinks the solution is to turning around the auto industry .
She did n't talk about any of that ( incredibly the latter ) on Friday in Sterling Heights .
Stump speeches are not enough to inform the public .
That 's why candidates need to answer questions from the press .
And we , in turn , owe it to them and you to ask substantive questions .
But Palin was noticeably the only member of either presidential ticket to skip the Sunday talk shows today .
This makes Palin look weak , despite her proclamations about being a " pit bull with lipstick . "
Pit bulls ain't afraid of the Eastern Elites in the media ; they rip them to shreds .
Just ask Ann Coulter .
The left is gaining some traction with painting her as a chicken , which is something no candidate , especially a woman , wants .
McCain top aid Rick Davis sloughed this off , saying , " I 'd never commit to anything in the future .
...
Our strategy is in our hands , not the media's .
We 're going to do what 's in our best interests to try to win the election .
If we think going on TV news shows are [ sic ] in our best interests , we 'll do it .
If we do n't , we wo n't . "
Just remember the next time a politician tells you he's not talking to the press , it 's not for your benefit .
It 's for his .
So when McCain and Palin expect you to cheer that they 're sticking it to the media , they 're really asking you to celebrate that they 're sticking it to you .
And here 's a roundup of some intriguing stories on Palin in light of my posts this week :
The Politico's Roger Simon writes the best column on the role of the political press I have ever read .
" It is not our job to ask questions .
Or it should n't be .
To hear from the pols at the Republican National Convention this week , our job is to endorse and support the decisions of the pols . "
Conservative Detroit News columnist Nolan Finley apologizes for not drinking the Palin Kool - Aid .
Time 's Joe Klein looks at McCain 's slime the press strategy and if it will cause the media to be gentler on the Republican .
The Freep 's Stephen Henderson ponders the new morality that teen pregnancy can be celebrated and asks how it would be viewed if Bristol Palin were black .
A McCain aide can't answer what Palin 's foreign policy credentials are , leading Republicans to criticize CNN for biased reporting .
Gone are the days of the Straight Talk Express , when McCain is hostile to innocuous questions in a Time interview , such as asking him to define honor in political campaigns .
A Wasilla evangelical Christian mom disagrees with Palin 's choices .
Hanna Rosin explores how the Religious Rights ' views on morality have changed as their behavior has n't met their ideals .
Jacob Weisberg points out how shotgun weddings equal sky - high divorce rates and looks at how the right 's anti-abortion absolutism has meant more acceptance of teen pregnancy .
With the financial markets teetering on the edge of a meltdown , many are wondering again about the root causes :
Most importantly , where were the regulators while all this trouble brewed ?
Lehman Brothers problems stem from heavy investment in mortgages .
Like many other investment banks , Lehman bought mortgages in bulk , re-packaged them , and re-sold them .
According to Reuters , in 2006 and 2007 Lehman was the âtop U.S. underwriter of mortgage bondsâ and controlled fully ten percent of the market .
But of course the roots of the marketâs crisis go far deeper .
Over the past decade , a âshadow banking systemâ has developed outside the reach of regulators .
As the New York TimesÂ´ Paul Krugman explains today , while regulators have long focused on banks , banks â now play only a minor role in channeling funds from savers to borrowers ; most of the business of finance is carried out through complex deals arranged by ânon - depositoryâ institutions , institutions like the late lamented Bear Stearns — and Lehman.â 
Those institutions have in turn created wildly complex investments that are largely beyond the purview of regulators and little - understood .
According to todayâs Washington Post , the market for one type of those investments , corporate derivatives , is worth $ 50 trillion and is a âmodel of obscurity .â 
Writing this morning , the Timesâ top financial correspondent pointed his finger squarely at the lack of regulatory control : â It was a lack of regulation of the shadow financial system and its players that allowed this to happen.â 
Back in March , the New York Times explained how regulators ended up on the sidelines : Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington ended up â supporting deregulation , even as newly minted but little - understood products like derivatives proliferated .â 
â A milestone in the deregulation effort came in the fall of 2000 , â says the Times , with the passage of âa little - noticed piece of legislation called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.â 
What the bill did was simple , says the Times :
It âkept much of the market for derivatives and other exotic instruments off - limitsâ to regulators .
That bill , combined with more well - known legislation that abolished firewalls between investment banks and commercial banks , gave the investment banks room to create financial products that , as the Times put it , âare virtually hidden from investors , analysts and regulators.â 
In one congressional hearing the Times recounts , the - then CEO of Citigroup , Charles Prince , was asked by Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) why billions of dollars of investment liabilities hadnât been previously disclosed :
â Why arenât they on your balance sheet ? â asked Mr. Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts .
The congressman recalled that Mr. Prince said doing so would have put Citigroup at a disadvantage with Wall Street investment banks that were more loosely regulated and were allowed to take far greater risks .
( A spokeswoman for Mr. Prince confirmed the conversation . )
It was at that moment , Mr. Frank says , that he first realized just how much freedom Wall Street firms had , and how lightly regulated they were in comparison with commercial banks , which have to answer to an alphabet soup of government agencies like the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency .
â Not only did Wall Street have so much freedom , but it gave commercial banks an incentive to try and evade their regulations , â  Mr. Frank says .
When it came to Wall Street , he says , â we thought we didnât need regulation .â 

See Morgan Stanley shares Morgan Stanley shares surged after Japanese banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it would buy a stake in the bruised Wall Street bank .
The Japanese group said the stake will account for 10 % to 20 % of Morgan Stanley 's common shares .
A price has not yet been decided .
Further details will be revealed after the group has completed due diligence .
Morgan Stanley has been humbled by the credit crisis tearing through the world 's financial system .
A tie -up with Mitsubishi UFJ - the world 's second largest bank holding company with $ 1.1 trillion ( £ 595 bn ) in deposits - would allow New York - based Morgan Stanley to shore up its capital base .
" As one of the largest commercial banks in the world , Mitsubishi UFJ would be a valuable partner as we transition to a bank holding company and build our bank services and deposit base , " said John J. Mack , Morgan Stanley 's chairman and chief executive .
Morgan Stanley shares shot up as much as 16 % on the news and were trading up almost $ 3 , or 10.7 % , at $ 30.13 in early New York trade .
But they are still much lower than their 2007 peak of $ 74 last June , shortly before the credit crisis unfolded .
Collapse of confidence
The deal , estimated to be worth around $ 8.5 bn , comes shortly after Morgan Stanley was granted approval by the Federal Reserve to change its status to become a bank holding company , which allows it to grow its deposits to raise funds .
The radical move , which was taken by Goldman Sachs too , marks the end of the independent investment bank on Wall Street , which aggressively grew profits using money borrowed from the bond market - a model which is now in tatters .
It follows a collapse of confidence in the world 's financial institutions , which saw the sudden demise of US investment bank Lehman Brothers and forced Merrill Lynch to agree to a takeover by Bank of America .
Last week 's events also saw the biggest insurer in the US , American International Group ( AIG ) , effectively nationalised by the US government after it failed to access enough cash to run its business .
In the UK , a run on the shares of HBOS - the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland - drove it to shelter in the wings of Lloyds TSB amid fears for the future of the UK 's top mortgage lender .
Strategic alliance
It was widely reported last week that Morgan Stanley was seeking a tie - up to reassure investors worried about its financial health .
Potential partners included US bank Wachovia and a Chinese sovereign wealth fund .
Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial said in a statement that the deal was dependent on due diligence and the approval of the necessary regulatory authorities .
The investment is a sign that Japanese banks have rebuilt their balance sheets after a decade of struggling with crippling bad loans .
They are now keen to take advantage of victims of the credit crisis to expand abroad .
On the same day , Nomura swooped on the Asia - Pacific assets of the defunct US investment bank Lehman Brothers .

Energy Expertise
Today , the person who “ knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America ” let slip some pearls of wisdom :
“ Of course , it ’s a fungible commodity and they do n’t flag , you know , the molecules , where it ’s going and where it ’s not .
But in the sense of the Congress today , they know that there are very , very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first .
So , I believe that what Congress is going to do , also , is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it ’s Americans who get stuck holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here , pumped here .
It ’s got to flow into our domestic markets first . ”
I ’m not sure I fully grasp that , though I am relieved to know that they , whoever they are , do n’t have to sit around flagging individual molecules all day long .
I think , despite her saying that Congress is “ not going to allow the export bans ” , that she is actually recommending such a ban .
At any rate , what she says makes a lot more sense on the assumption that either the ‘ not ’ or the ‘ bans ’ was a slip than it does on the assumption that she thought that lifting nonexistent export bans would keep our oil here at home .
It seems pretty clear to me that Sarah Palin has no idea at all what she ’s talking about here .
But let ’s pretend this is a serious statement , and consider it seriously .
Who do we presently export oil to ?
Well : in 2007 , the two main recipients of our oil were Mexico and Canada , who between them received some 170,716,000 barrels of what the Energy Information Administration calls “ petroleum and products . ”
That ’s nearly a third of our exports .
But guess what ?
When you look at the analogous table of imports , who turns up in first and second place ?
Canada and Mexico again !
They sold us 1,455,280,000 barrels between them in 2007 , or about eight and a half times as much as we sold them .
If you check crude oil alone , it turns out that all our exports in 2007 went to Canada , which was also our number one supplier , selling us nearly seventy times as much crude oil as we sold the Canadians .
Do you think that they would keep on selling us all that oil if we unilaterally stopped selling oil to them ?
Maybe they would , and maybe they would n’t .
Do you think Sarah Palin knows the answer ?
I hope so .
It would be pretty strange for the nation ’s foremost expert on energy to come out in favor of an embargo without knowing whether or not it would cost us nearly 1.3 billion barrels of “ petroleum and products ” a day year ( oops ) , including about 19 % of our total crude oil imports .
Annoying our neighbors so much that they cut off our oil supplies would , I suppose , be one way of helping us achieve energy independence , but it does n’t seem like a particularly good idea .
Call me cynical , though : I do n’t think Sarah Palin had any idea what she was talking about , any more than I think John McCain had any idea what he was talking about when he said she “ knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America ” .
Because if she does , we ’re in much deeper trouble than I had imagined .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says it is weighing its options following the arrival of more NATO vessels in the Black Sea , according to reports .
Russia Monday accused " foreign navy ships " of delivering weapons to Georgia as the European Union met to discuss possible sanctions against Moscow .
Putin , visiting Uzbekistan to promote the launch of a natural gas pipeline Tuesday , said that its response to ships would be " calm , without any sort of hysteria .
But of course , there will be an answer , " the Associated Press reported .
Georgian troops attacked pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia on August 7 , triggering the Russian response .
Each side offered conflicting figures on how many people died in the fighting .
Russia has not fully withdrawn its troops from Georgia after sending them across the border for what it called peacekeeping operations and what Georgia called an invasion .
Putin also questioned Tuesday the manner in which the United States had delivered humanitarian aid to Georgia .
" We do n't understand what American ships are doing on the Georgian shores , but this is a question of taste , it 's a decision by our American colleagues , " agencies reported Putin as saying .
" The second question is why the humanitarian aid is being delivered on naval vessels armed with the newest rocket systems . "
Earlier Tuesday Russian officials criticized the European Union for threatening to postpone talks on a new political and economic partnership deal .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday that the EU would have to re-examine its partnership with Russia if Moscow did not respect a cease - fire agreement .
Sarkozy , whose country holds the six - month rotating EU presidency , also confirmed that he will visit Moscow next week .
" We will be asking Russia to ensure the full and scrupulous respect of the ( cease - fire ) plan , " he said .
" The EU would welcome a real partnership with Russia that is in the interests of all , but it takes two to tango .
You have to be two to have a partnership .
" Therefore this crisis means that we have to re-examine our relationship with Russia . "
Meanwhile , Russia 's NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , accused the U.S. of pushing Poland and the ex-Soviet Baltic states to demand tougher sanctions against Russia , AP reported .
" It is clear who the losing side is : the policy pursued by the Polish president and his Baltic co-thinkers , " Rogozin said .
They acted as " the advocates of Washington 's line to undermine pan-European cooperation , " he was quoted as saying .
EU leaders met Monday in Brussels , Belgium , to discuss how to react to Russia 's recognition of the breakaway Georgia regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states .

Palin praises ... Obama ?
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin -- occasionally mentioned as a McCain vice presidential prospect -- has put out a press release praising Obama 's energy plan .
Alaska energy politics seem to trump national politics here , though it's also interesting to see a red( dish ) state Republican so willing to associate herself with the Democratic nominee .
“ I am pleased to see Senator Obama acknowledge the huge potential Alaska ’s natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs , ” Palin says in the release .
“ The steps taken by the Alaska State Legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready , willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs . ”
More :
Governor Palin also acknowledged the Senator ’s proposal to offer $ 1,000 rebates to those struggling with the high cost of energy .
“ We in Alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home , ” Governor Palin said .
“ This is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long - term energy plans can be put into place .
We have already enjoyed the support of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , and it is gratifying to see Senator Obama get on board . ”
Hard to know what to make of the Stevens shout - out , but Alaska politics are another country .
Palin did question Obama 's proposal to tax oil company profits .
Electoral College Estimates
The table below shows the results of our prediction algorithm for the Presidential Elections in November .
The method by which a projection is determined is complicated , using local regression , but its all explained if you 're really curious .
The algorithm outputs a projected result and the Electoral Votes are assigned based on those percentages .
If a candidate gets a higher percentage than their opponent they will receive all of the Electoral Votes for that specific state .
In the real election Maine and Nebraska award their EVs based on congressional districts , but for the current analysis a complete allocation will be used .
Perhaps in the future after further data has be collected Nebraska and Maine will be predicted on the congressional level .
The polls used in the calculations can be viewed on our polls and graphs page .

WASHINGTON
– Senator Joe Biden , who was chosen by Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama to be his running mate in the upcoming US elections , has previously declared himself to be a Zionist .
Calling Israel " the single greatest strength America has in the Middle East , " he also revealed a Jewish connection in an interview last year .
Obama 's Choice Obama chooses Biden as VP Associated Press Democratic presidential hopeful chooses Delaware senator as running mate , source says .
Biden considered well - versed in foreign and defense issues Obama chooses Biden as VP
He added that " probably my most poignant Seder memory is not with the Bergers , but what happened right after I came back from meeting Golda Meir ( in 1973 ) .
I had predicted that something was going on in Egypt .
And I remember people talking about what it meant to them if Israel were actually defeated . "
Biden presented himself as a friend to Israel , which he referred to as the US ' greatest Middle East ally .
" Imagine our circumstance in the world were there no Israel .
How many battleships would there be ?
How many troops would be stationed ? " he asked .
He also called comments about Israel 's connection to the war in Iraq " insulting " , explaining that " if tomorrow , peace broke out between Israelis and Palestinians , does anybody think there would n't be a full - blown war in Iraq ? "
Regarding the terror attacks in Israel , Biden said the Sept. 11 attacks made American parents feel what Israeli parents have been feeling .
" The difference between now and before 9/11 , " he said , " is that many Americans can taste what it must feel like for every Israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus , on a bicycle or to walk ; and they pray to God that cell phone does n't ring . "
' No pardon for Pollard '
Biden also commented on Jonathan Pollard , sentenced to life in prison for espionage charges .
" He has to serve his sentence .
There 's a rationale , in my view , why Pollard should be given leniency .
But there is not a rationale to say , ' What happened did not happen and should be pardoned ' , " he said .
" My worry is that , if I were president , to go and pardon Pollard would make a lie out of the notion that there are certain rules .
You cannot give classified information , period .
Even to a friend .
If this were Great Britain , it would be the same thing . "
Biden is currently serving his sixth term in the US Senate , is of Irish descent , and was born in Pennsylvania .
He became an attorney in 1969 and in 1972 was first elected to Senate .
Just a short while later , his wife and one of his children were killed in a car accident .
His two sons were injured but recovered fully .
Biden became a senator at the age of 30 , which is the earliest age at which one can be elected to the Senate according to US law .
He continues to reside in Delaware and makes the two - hour journey to Capitol Hill by train every morning .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Austerity measures attached to International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loans may have contributed to a resurgence in tuberculosis in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union , researchers said on Tuesday .

Governments may be reducing funding for health services such as hospitals and clinics to meet strict IMF economic targets , the British researchers said .
The study , published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine , found that countries participating in IMF programmes had seen tuberculosis death rates increase by at least 17 percent between 1991 and 2000 -- equivalent to more than 100,000 additional deaths .
About one million new cases were recorded during the same period .
Nations that received money from other institutions with less restrictive economic conditions attached had seen a nearly 8 percent drop in tuberculosis death rates , David Stuckler and colleagues at the University of Cambridge said .
“ IMF lending did not appear to be a response to worsened health outcomes ; rather , it appeared to be a precipitant of such outcomes , ” they wrote .
But an IMF spokesman questioned whether the study took into account the instability following the break - up of the Soviet Union , and said it takes time for the disease to develop so the mortality rates could be linked to something previously .
“ If the IMF had not stepped in to help the post - communist countries , the declines in health spending would likely have been more pronounced and disease generally more severe , ” IMF spokesman William Murray said in an email .
Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease typically attacking the lungs that kills an estimated 1.6 million each year around the world .
The emergence and spread of drug - resistant germs makes treating it much harder and could make the disease even deadlier .
Parts of the former Soviet Union are some of the hardest hit by drug - resistant TB .
The researchers used a statistical model to compare tuberculosis rates for 21 post - Communist countries along with the timing and length of IMF loans to other lending programmes .
Even when considering population changes , war , inflation and other factors that can lead to new cases , the researchers found that rising TB rates correlated closely to when IMF funding began .
The size of a loan and length of time a country participated were also important , according to the study that analyzed IMF programmes in the region and TB rates between 1991 and 2000 .
“ We tested a lot of competing explanations and none could account for the patterns , ” Stuckler said in a telephone interview .
“ We are not saying the IMF loans are the only determinant but they help explain some of the patterns . ”
Until someone comes up with a REASON for HDD capacity to double at the same price point every 12 months , there is going to be diminishing returns in consumers ' minds .
I doubt mainstream ( i.e. , non-techies ) can fathom what a 1 TB drive is right now , much less a 2 TB drive in a year , and a 4 TB drive in another year .
If downloadable video were ubiquitous and had high market share , 2 TB drives would be necessary .
But we 're not there yet , and it looks to be a while .
The 500 GB and under ( especially for laptops ) range looks to be the sweetspot , and while SSDs can't compete in that range YET , give 'em a couple of years .
Will SSDs every be THE storage solution for desktops . . . that is a tough road , as the already mentioned size and price ARE issues for desktops .
The one variable I could see affecting the desktop / server space ( say in 5 - 7 years ) is power consumption and heat generation .

Yesterday , September 22 , Congressman Ron Paul publicly gave me his endorsement for the office of President of the United States .
In his blog at the Campaign for Liberty web site , he said , " I 'm supporting Chuck Baldwin , the Constitution Party candidate . "
( See the complete statement at : http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog/?p=582 )
Obviously , I could not be more delighted and honored to have Dr. Paul 's endorsement .
I called him last evening and thanked him personally .
And now I want to thank him publicly .
I am fully aware that Dr. Paul was under considerable pressure from various groups that were actively soliciting his support .
I can honestly say that I never lobbied Dr. Paul for his endorsement .
He knew I would be thrilled to have it , but I have too much respect for Ron Paul to be so presumptuous as to expect him to endorse me .
I completely understood his neutrality .
He has strong ties to both the Libertarian and Constitution parties -- not to mention the obvious fact that he is a ten - term Republican Congressman with much support from the Republican Party in his home district .
I was happy to support Ron Paul during the Republican primaries , because I believe in the same principles .
I personally campaigned for him in several states and in this column .
And I asked ( or expected ) nothing in return .
In fact , I have stated this publicly , time and again : if Ron Paul had won the Republican nomination for President , I would not be running .
I would still be supporting Ron Paul .
I am running for President because the Republican Party rejected Ron's Paul 's message of constitutional government , fiscal responsibility , and non-interventionism .
Therefore , someone had to pick up the mantle and carry this message into the general election .
The Constitution Party asked me to be their standard - bearer in order to bring this message to the American people in November .
So , here I am .
And now , Ron Paul 's endorsement is further substantiation that the message of constitutional government will not die in 2008 .
The American people still have a real choice instead of the big - government , globalist , interventionist , " big box " party candidates , John McCain and Barack Obama .
Ron Paul 's message is my message ; Ron Paul 's fight is my fight .
I want to return America to constitutional government .
" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . "
( Amendment X ) I believe that , and will govern the Executive branch of the federal government accordingly .
My sworn oath to the Tenth Amendment means I would dismantle the Patriot Act and restore law enforcement to the states and local governments , where it rightly belongs .
Yes , this includes the so - called " war on drugs " and the so - called " war on terror . "
No more warrantless searches and seizures .
No more eavesdropping on Americans ' phone calls , or collecting Americans ' emails , or spying on American citizens without court order and oversight .
No more stripping Americans of their constitutional rights in the name of " national security . "
In addition , I would use every power and authority vested to my office to preserve and protect the right of the people to keep and bear arms .
And , yes , I will immediately restore Posse Comitatus .
As President , I want to protect America from Washington , D.C. , as much I want to protect it from foreign powers .
I will also take the words of the Declaration of Independence seriously , where it states , " That these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States . "
This means the day I am sworn in as President of the United States , the New World Order comes crashing down !
The NAFTA superhighway is dead .
The North American Union is dead .
I will work to eliminate NAFTA , CAFTA , GATT , and the WTO .
The FTAA is DOA .
I will not expend tax dollars for the support of the United Nations .
Furthermore , I will take my oath to the Constitution seriously , when it states that one of the express purposes of the federal government is to " repel Invasions . "
This means we will secure America 's borders , because the illegal immigration crisis is more than mere immigration : it is an invasion , and I will stop it !
Even if I have to send the U.S. Army to the borders , we will put a stop to this invasion of illegal aliens .
I will also aggressively prosecute those employers who knowingly hire illegals .
And did I mention that my first day in office is Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean 's last day in prison ?
I will personally open the prison doors and restore to these men their freedom .
I will also give them their jobs back ( with pay ) , if they want them .
And one more item on this point : my first day of office is also U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton 's last day on the job .
I also share Ron Paul 's concerns for the way the two major parties have allowed the United States to become a meddlesome , interventionist , nation - building empire for the sake of satisfying the greedy machinations of international bankers and power - hungry politicians .
I will not only bring our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan , but also from most of the other 130 nations that currently house U.S. forces .
I will end foreign aid .
I will get the U.S. out of NATO .
It is past time for the European states to defend themselves .
It is time for us to stop sticking our nose in every other nation 's business and start taking care of the United States .
The Warfare State will kill us .
Global empires are not sustainable .
I repeat : global empires are not sustainable .
If history teaches anything , it teaches that .
Furthermore , the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war is over , when I become President .
Because I will take my oath to the Constitution seriously , I would never send troops to invade and occupy a foreign country without a Declaration of War by Congress .
In dealing with rogue terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda , I will seek letters of Marque and Reprisal from Congress , which would give me the authority to use whatever special and / or private forces are necessary to seek out and destroy those who desire our hurt .
And even though I am a born again Christian ( as is Ron Paul ) , I would take my responsibility to protect the religious liberty of every American seriously .
People have the right to worship God ( or not worship God ) according to the dictates of their own conscience .
Whether one is Baptist , Catholic , Mormon , or agnostic , people have the right to practice their faith as they see fit .
I am absolutely dedicated to preserving religious liberty .
Religious tyranny is as evil as political or social tyranny .
And , as I will be no man 's slave , neither will I be any man 's master .
I also share Ron Paul 's commitment to the sanctity of life .
When I become President , I will use the bully pulpit of the White House to press Congress to pass Dr. Paul 's Sanctity of Life Act , which would overturn Roe v. Wade and end abortion - on - demand .
On this topic , the GOP is especially hypocritical .
The Republican Party controlled the entire federal government for six years and did nothing to save the life of a single unborn child .
Saving unborn babies from the abortionists ' scalpel is more than rhetoric with me , however .
Another area of agreement with Ron Paul is my philosophy of economics .
Dr. Paul has been predicting the current financial meltdown in this country for years .
And when all is done , the current bailout being proposed will do more harm than good .
The problem is , America 's leaders have rejected sound money policies for years , and the chickens are coming home to roost .
As President , I would seek to overturn the 16th Amendment , eliminate the Internal Revenue Service , and disband the Federal Reserve .
I would lead the charge to return America to sound money principles .
I would seek to reduce federal spending to constitutional levels by eliminating those same federal departments that Newt Gingrich promised to eliminate in his Contract with America back in 1994 ( and then failed to do ) .
I would seek to eliminate the Departments of Education , Commerce , Energy , etc .
I would demand that Congress pass a balanced budget and that we stop deficit spending .
Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama will do any of the above .
If he were President , Dr. Paul would do it , however , and so would I .
Needless to say , I am both humbled and honored that Ron Paul would place enough faith in me that he would endorse me for President .
I can think of no higher compliment to my candidacy .
I here and now publicly thank him for this vote of confidence .
I know my Vice Presidential running mate , Darrell Castle ( a former Marine Corps officer and Vietnam veteran ) , joins me in inviting all of Dr. Paul 's supporters to help us take the message of constitutional government into the general election on November 4 .
Thank you .

The main stadium at the London Olympics may be wrapped in a kilometre - long video screen in an attempt to create a defining visual image to rival Beijing 's architecturally startling Bird 's Nest arena .
London 2012 officials will return from China next week to begin detailed consideration of the " look of London " , which has so far been defined by a graffiti - style logo which drew as much criticism as praise .
Now , after the Bird's Nest became the identifying image of the 2008 games , attention will shift to how London 's centrepiece stadium will appear on billions of television sets around the world .
The stadium 's architect , Rod Sheard , is advocating a kilometre - long screen that would establish the London games as the first digital Olympics .
Everything from images of main events to Olympic - inspired art could be projected on to the screen and Olympic officials confirmed the idea was to be developed in the coming year .
" Sydney took the opening and closing ceremony into the air with cables , Beijing has demonstrated what is currently possible using lighting and visual imagery , " said Sheard , who designed the Sydney Olympic stadium and Wembley .
" The London Olympic stadium will be the beginning of digital technology .
We see the stadium as the ultimate communication device . "
He said records , replays , previews and live events could be projected to create a kind of " Henman Hill of the Olympics " .
The London mayor , Boris Johnson , who arrived at the games on Thursday and will take the Olympic flag at Sunday 's closing ceremony , has admitted to being " dazzled " by the Beijing games , but has promised " fantastic ingenuity " to match the Chinese staging .
Beijing 's Birds
Nest stadium and bubble - wrapped water cube swimming pool have been widely acclaimed as among the most startling Olympic architecture ever , but cost more than twice the London budget of £ 9.3bn .
Lord Coe , who is leading preparations for the London games , said this week : " It is unlikely we will see a games of this scale and stature again .
It is unlikely this will be the format for the future .
It wo n't be in London . "
But the president of the International Olympic Committee , Jacques Rogge , warned yesterday that London 2012 would have to live up to Beijing 's standards .
" London has and will have to deliver as well as China in the welfare of the athletes , " he told the BBC .
" I mean the quality of the Olympic Village , the quality of the transportation from the Village to the venues , the operation of the venues .
This has to be as good because the games are for the athletes .
The games are not for London , the games are not for Great Britain , the games are not for the IOC . "
Sheard 's idea will face intense scrutiny from cost controllers committed to keeping the stadium to its £ 496 m budget .
A digital screen is likely to cost far more than the original idea for a 30 - metre - high fabric wrap to conceal scaffolding supporting 55,000 temporary seats in the 80,000 - seat venue .
Sources at the Olympic Delivery Authority ( ODA ) said detailed calculations had yet to be made of what could be achieved within the budget .
Early designs showed the wrap made from a recycled polymer or even hemp and decorated with still images of Olympic athletes made up of pixelated graphics to echo London 2012 's graffiti - style logo .
The wrap is essential to animate an otherwise rudimentary stadium that architect Will Alsop described as " disappointing " when it was unveiled .
He was among many who complained that the design , dubbed by some the " vol - au - vent " , was an anticlimax after plans were ditched that imagined the stadium 's exterior like petals of a flower .
Olympic officials said yesterday that an artist or artists could be commissioned to produce ideas for the screen , which will also protect spectators and competitors from cross -winds .
" The idea of using digital technology on the wrap of the stadium is an option that is being discussed , " a source at the ODA said .
" It is early days .
As we look more closely at the creative treatment of this element in 2009 and 2010 we would assess the need for the creative skills of an artist and that would have to fit in with the overall look of the games . "
The design of the stadium will be instrumental in creating a visual identity as it is likely to feature in the backdrop to broadcasts seen on TV around the world .
Olympic officials hope other venues , including the velodrome , by Sir Michael Hopkins , and the £ 303 m aquatics centre , designed by Zaha Hadid , will capture the imagination , as well as the distinctly London backdrops to events such as beach volleyball at Horse Guards Parade and archery at Lord 's cricket ground .

Something about the cover just seemed a little bit… off .

There ’s a metaphor there , but I ’m having trouble deciding exactly what it is , or perhaps more accurately to whom it applies .
Seriously , I ’m not generally one to read messages into things — in fact , I probably lean too far the other direction — but on this ?
Somebody needs to be fired for gross negligence , because there ’s a message being sent here , intentionally or otherwise .
In fact , it ’s worse if it ’s unintentional .
The question is who was negligent .
The photographer for not seeing what the placement communicated ?
The editor for approving use of the image on their cover ?
The McCain campaign for approving the image in the first place ?
Maybe all of the above .

Obama : McCain and Palin ' lying ' Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday September 8 , 2008
Print This Email This FARMINGTON HILLS , Michigan ( AFP ) - Barack Obama ripped into John McCain and Sarah Palin as never before Monday , accusing his Republican White House foes of " shameless " dishonesty with their claim to be " mavericks " ready to shake up Washington .
McCain and Palin were " lying about their records , " the Obama campaign said after the Republican running mates advertised themselves in a television spot as the " original mavericks " who would stand up for hard - pressed voters .
Some of the White House race 's most savage exchanges yet came as polls showed the contenders deadlocked or McCain pulling into a post - convention lead after he electrified the Republican base -- and appeared to confound the Obama campaign -- by adding Alaska Governor Palin to his ticket .
" I 've got to admit , these folks are shameless , " Obama told a rally here , displaying a passion and an intensity rarely seen from the Illinois senator .
He noted that Palin had originally supported an infamous " Bridge to Nowhere " project in Alaska , and had hired a Washington lobbyist to secure millions of dollars in federal funding for the small town of which she was mayor .
" When John McCain gets up there with Sarah Palin and says ' we 're for change ' ... you 've got to ask yourselves , what are they talking about , how do they have the nerve to say it ? " the Democrat added .
" It 's empty words .
You 're just saying it because you realize , gosh , Obama 's been talking about change and it seems to be working , so maybe we should say it too , " he added to mocking laughter from a crowd of 1,500 .
While other polls have Obama ahead in all - important battleground states such as Michigan , Pennsylvania and Colorado , his campaign has clearly decided it is time to take off the gloves against McCain and , in particular , Palin .
" You ca n't just make stuff up , you ca n't just reinvent yourself , " he said earlier in Flint , Michigan , in response to Palin 's boast that she had intervened to kill the federally funded bridge .
" The American people are n't stupid . "
An ad by the Obama campaign featured a photo of Palin wearing a T - shirt extolling the scrapped bridge , which would have connected a handful of Alaskans to an airport at vast expense , and highlighted McCain 's lock - step voting record with President George W. Bush .
" Politicians lying about their records ?
You do n't call that maverick -- you call it more of the same , " the announcer said , breaching one of the last taboos of US politics by accusing the Republicans of outright dishonesty .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said : " Despite being discredited over and over again by numerous news organizations , the McCain campaign continues to repeat the lie that Sarah Palin stopped the Bridge to Nowhere .
" McCain and Palin will say or do anything to make people believe that they will change something besides the person sitting in the Oval Office , " he said .
With polls showing four - fifths of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track , the " change " mantle has emerged as a central motif of the election campaign and one that McCain is claiming for himself despite his Republican Party 's widespread unpopularity .
The tactic appears to be working .
A USA Today / Gallup survey showed McCain ahead by 50 to 46 percent among registered voters , a turnaround from one week ago when , just after the Democratic convention , Obama had a seven - point lead .
Twenty - nine percent of respondents said the choice of Palin had made them more likely to vote for McCain , while 21 percent said they were now less likely to back the Republicans .
Polls by CNN , Rasmussen , and the Washington Post had McCain essentially tied with Obama , after the Arizona senator trailed by as much as nine points last week .
" We 're going to work for you and we 're going to drain the swamp in Washington , DC , " McCain told a rally in Lee 's Summit , Missouri after his campaign aired its " original mavericks " broadcast .
" We 'll take them on and we 'll defeat 'em because America knows it 's time for change and it's time for the right change . "
McCain praised Palin's history of fighting corruption in her own party and pork - barrel spending while governor of Alaska , and touted his own reputation of bucking the party line .
" I will veto every pork barrel earmark spending bill that comes across my desk .
We will stop it , my friends , because it breeds corruption and we can no longer stand for that , " the Arizona senator said .
The following commercial was released by the Obama campaign on Monday .
Chrysler has no timetable to sell its Viper operations , but the sports - car assets have attracted interest from third parties in North America as well as abroad , says Jim Press , Chrysler vice chairman and president .
It was because of outside interest that the automaker announced recently that Chrysler parent Cerberus had put the Viper brand under “ strategic review ” for standalone sale .
In hindsight , the move should not be seen as a surprise , given that Cerberus is a hedge company more interested in making money than cars .
That ’s right , snake lovers , if you come up with enough cash — piles of it — you could have all the tire - smokin ’ , gas - suckin ’ , hooligan - style fun you could dream of with your very own Viper - making operation .
Among the domestic names tossed around as potential suitors are Roush and Saleen , the latter of which is already involved in Viper assembly , as it paints the cars .
And no one would be surprised to see Middle Eastern or Indian interest in the American - as - apple - pie sports car .
Press would not say how many parties were in the hunt , noting it has hired financial advisor Lazard Limited to handle logistics .
Press says he sees no need to retain any interest in the Viper in the event of a sale .
Press tells reporters in Detroit that while the Viper name and cars are tremendous and bestow performance cred on the Dodge brand , the reality is the automaker must prioritize resource spending and balance such diverse needs as making a profit on 300,000 minivan sales — or 100 hand - built Vipers .
The comment confirms the pervasive backdrop of fear that Chrysler might otherwise drop the Viper altogether if it believes the car is taking too much attention and resources away from core products .
It is built at the Conner Avenue assembly plant in Detroit that is scheduled to close by the end of 2011 .
Viper is a big part of Chrysler ’s heritage , dating back to the first concept unveiled in 1989 .
The public loved it , and it was fast - tracked for production as a 1992 model and has played the role of halo vehicle ever since .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- From Dallas , Texas to Dabancheng , China , energy companies are staking fortunes on harnessing wind power .
Texan energy companies are investing heavily to build wind turbines following a landmark ruling last week .
Several Texan transmission companies announced Monday they were forming a consortium to invest in the $ 5 billion cost of building new power lines to take advantage of the state 's vast wind power .
The consortium , comprised of existing transmission operators , includes Dallas - based Oncor , the state 's largest power delivery company , Electric Transmission Texas ( ETT ) and units of American Electric Power Co. among others .
Those new lines , dubbed by Oncor as a " renewable energy superhighway , " will accommodate about 18,500 megawatts of wind generation by 2012 -- enough energy to power 4 million homes .
Texas currently leads the nation in wind capacity at about 5,500 MW .
The companies are hoping to take advantage of a landmark ruling on Friday that gave Texas preliminary approval for a $ 4.9 billion plan to build transmission lines to carry wind power from West Texas to urban areas .
It is said to be the largest investment in clean , renewable energy in U.S. history .
Texas citizens will have to assist with the plan 's construction ; paying an extra $ 3 to $ 4 per month on their bills for the next few years .
However , they stand to recoup these costs in what they will save in energy bills later .
Not surprisingly , energy companies are eager to jump on the bandwagon to build a large part of the superhighway .
Oncor Senior Vice President of Transmission Charles Jenkins said in a news release : " At Oncor we want to be an important part of the solution .
Texas is already a leader in wind energy and this is the next step in maintaining that leadership position .
The wind energy industry has benefited from the support of billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens , who is planning to build the world 's largest wind farm on about 200,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle .
When completed , his 2,700 turbines will be capable of producing enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes .
Pickens spoke to CNN about his plans to increase reliance on natural resources like wind and solar .
He said : " What I want to do is to fold in the great resource we have in the central part of this country , which is wind .
And then you have resource from Texas west to California .
" You 've got solar .
Those two resources have to be developed .
So when you develop the wind , you can then remove natural gas from power generation and put it into a transportation fuel market .
" Wind power is ... clean , it 's renewable .
It 's everything you want .
And it 's a stable supply of energy .
It 's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind . "
Meanwhile , China could well be on its way to blowing the U.S. out of the water when it comes to harnessing wind energy .
This is a rare energy success story for a country whose carbon emissions were recorded as the highest in the world last year , according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency .
But the Chinese energy revolution has been quietly gaining strength , observers say .
Like their American counterparts , Chinese tycoons are increasingly directing their investment into renewable power .
Zhu Yuguo , ranks at 102 on the Forbes China Rich List , with a personal fortune of 5.71 billion Yuan and has invested heavily in the wind power industry .
Steve Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council said : " China 's wind energy market is unrecognizable from two years ago . "
" It is huge , huge , huge .
But it is not realized yet in the outside world , " Sawyer said in an interview with London 's Guardian newspaper .
China 's wind generation has increased by more than 100 percent per year since 2005 and 20 per cent of the power supply to the venues of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games will come from wind generators , according to the official state agency , Xinhua .
It was initially hoped the country would generate 5 gigawatts of wind by 2010 , but that goal was met three years early in 2007 .
The 2010 goal has now been revised to 10 gigawatts but experts say this could well hit 20 gigawatts .
The Guanting Wind Farm in Beijing has installed capacity of 64.5 megawatts and has supplied 35 million kilowatts of electricity to Beijing so far .
The wind farm is estimated to supply 100 million KWH per year to Beijing , or 300,000 KWH per day , enough to satisfy the consumption of 100,000 households .
However , China still relies heavily on using coal , which supplies 70 per cent of China 's energy needs .
But Junfeng Li of the China Renewable Energy Industries Association has a more optimistic outlook .
In a paper last month , he wrote : " China is witnessing the start of a golden age of wind power development and the magnitude of the growth has caught policymakers off guard .
" It is widely believed that wind power will be able to compete with coal generation by as early as 2015 . "
Chris Cooley , a friend of the bloggers as well as an accomplished blogger in his own right , had a nice day on the field today , but I do n't think that 's what people are going to remember come tomorrow .
Earlier today Chris posted on his official blog about a fun section of the playbook that Jim Zorn asks his players to decorate for themselves ( he 's like a bohemian football coach ! ) as well as a position test he took to prepare for today 's opponents .
What he may or may not have realized is that he was also posting a picture of his dick for the world to see .
The uncropped image is after the jump in all its not safe for work glory .
Update after the jump .
I honestly have no idea whether or not he might have done this on purpose , but considering his quirky personality and prankster ways it would n't be entirely unsurprising .
I guess we 'll know for sure if he 's quick to yank it ...uh... so yeah , please continue sending us your tips ...uhhh ....

As it sought to address the Lehman Brothers crisis over the weekend , the next big problem became insurer American International Group , Inc. , which is reaching out the central bank for a loan .
The season of Republican recrimination has dawned .
The favorite rationalization for the candidate ’s drift toward double digit deficits in the polls seems to be that the smears against Obama came too late and looked too desperate .
If only McCain had descended into the mire months ago — things might have been different .
There is no evidence , of course , that the old Rovian road , no matter when taken , would have led back to the White House in 2008 .
In serious times , assaults on Ayers and ACORN seem frivolous ; and appeals to fear and intolerance do n’t win votes , they merely stoke hate and incite right - wing believers .
New York Times columnist William Kristol , who once recommended war on Obama ’s character , now urges McCain to “ fire the campaign ” that followed Kristol ’s advice .
But mixed messages are the essence of McCain ’s exertions .
The candidate suffers grievously from a dual sense — first that he has no credible plan to deal with the economic issues he ’s said he does n’t understand and , second , that he ’s not steady , but erratic , irascible , lurching from position to position as he wanders around the stage .
Unmoored from strategic coherence , the candidate and his advisors jump from tactic to tactic searching compulsively for the latest trick .
This is the driving force behind the campaign ’s biggest mistake : selecting the unvetted , unserious Sarah Palin as a running mate .
The hasty turn to Palin was based on a series of off - the - cuff assumptions — that she could attract Hillary voters , appeal to women generally , and substitute for the unacceptably pro-choice Joe Lieberman as a way to restore McCain ’s brand as a maverick .
The aim of this Hail Mary pass was somehow to switch the playing field from the economy to earmarks .
The calculation was wrong on every count .
After an initial bounce generated by the bouncy Palin , most Hillary supporters recoiled from a caricature of the woman president or vice president they someday hope to see .
Palin ’s obvious lack of competence has pushed a rising tide of moderate women and independents toward Obama .
Palin ca n’t even get through a Sunday talk show or a non-Fox network interview .
She can do a fraction of the job of a running mate — read a speech — but the rest is beyond her .
Palin has n’t broadened McCain ’s appeal ; she has narrowed it to a shrunken Republican base that is seething with resentment , often openly bigoted and clearly insufficient to win the election .
The vituperation that marks rally after rally on the Republican side is alienating voters .
Palin , who is now far more barracuda than hockey mom , has become the symbol of it .
Back in the Gore campaign of 2000 , my former partner Tad Devine expressed his doubts about Lieberman as a running mate by telling Gore : “ Mr. Vice President , you need Mr. October , not Mr. August . ”
Sarah Palin glaringly fails that test ; she provided instant gratification , but then the bubble deflated .
One reason the McCain campaign became so distracted in September was its constant scramble , from Troopergate to the Biden debate , to keep up the pretense that Palin is minimally plausible .
And what kind of “ reformer ” picks a running mate under active investigation for abusing the power of her office ?
Now when Americans think of McCain ’s vice presidential choice , they see him as someone willing to do anything , say anything , to get elected .
The impression overhangs his entire campaign .
Maybe that ’s why , in his latest game plan , Palin has been assigned to a back seat on McCain ’s express to nowhere .
Even some mainstream Republicans have concluded that Palin is proof that party loyalty can ask too much .
Frum rated the Palin pick as " bold " and " shrewd " — and perhaps irresponsible .
He was right on one count .
She wo n’t know what this means since she religiously avoids Harry Potter , but Palin has shape - shifted from being an engaging curiosity to being a hit - woman , from moose hunter to media quarry .
Today , she has the worst ratings of any candidate on either ticket .
She ’s a mistake so vast that she contains all the hollowness of McCain ’s nasty campaign .
As he lurches toward November , McCain ’s Palin experience is the political equivalent of a lost college weekend — that wacky , self - indulgent party where you tied one on and spent the night with the wrong date .
It ’s fun for a moment .
But then comes morning and a hangover and — oh no — the wrong person is still there .
Max Payne Film Director Complains of Rating Woes , Accuses MPAA of Sucking Cock
" The Motion Picture Association of America gave The Dark Knight a PG - 13 rating and basically sucked Warner Bros . ' cock , " Moore said to DasGamer , referring to the blockbuster film sometimes thought too dark for the PG - 13 rating .
Moore 's outburst stems from attempts to secure a PG - 13 rating for Max Payne , which would theoretically allow for some mature content while avoiding the age restrictions and reduced revenues of an R rating .
" I have a serious amount of issues with the MPAA , " he continued .
" The MPAA changes their rules willy - nilly and it depends on who 's seeing your actual movie at the time .
It 's very difficult to get a hold on what 's acceptable . "
Moore feels that not only has the MPAA treated him unfairly , but that they also acted subjectively in preliminarily assigning an R rating to his film : " They said to me , the movie feels R . And I said , ' What the fuck is that , a group therapy session ? '
You can't do that .
They 're meant to judge content , not intent . "
The Max Payne game series , developed for PC by Remedy , was rated Mature by the ESRB .
Much like an R rating , Mature indicates that it is suitable for players above 17 .
Meanwhile , the movie , trailer here has not yet received its final rating , but will appear in theaters on October 17 .
' Extreme weather events ' such as the hot summer of 2003 , which
caused an extra 35,000 deaths across southern Europe from heat stress
and poor air quality , will happen more frequently .
Britain and
the North Sea area will be hit more often by violent cyclones and the
predicted rise in sea level will double to more than a metre , putting
vast coastal areas at risk from flooding .
The bleak report from
WWF - formerly the World Wildlife Fund - also predicts crops failures
and the collapse of eco systems on both land and sea .
And it
calls on the EU to set an example to the rest of the world by agreeing
a package of challenging targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions
to tackle the consequences of climate change and to keep any increase
in global temperatures below 2C .
The agency says that the 2007
report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) - a
study of global warming by 4,000 scientists from more than 150
countries which alerted the world to the possible consequences of
global warming - is now out of date .
WWF 's report , Climate Change : Faster , stronger , sooner , has updated all the scientific data and concluded that global warming is accelerating far beyond the IPCC 's forecasts .
As
an example it says the first ' tipping point ' may have already been
reached in the Arctic , where sea ice is disappearing up to 30 years
ahead of IPCC predictions and may be gone completely within five years
- something that has n't occurred for a million years .
It could result in rapid and abrupt climate change rather than the gradual changes forecast by the IPCC .
The findings include :
* Global sea level rise could more than double from the IPCC 's estimate of 0.59 m by the end of the century .
*
Natural carbon sinks , such as forests and oceans , are losing their
ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere faster than expected .

* Rising temperatures have already led to a major reduction in food crops resulting in losses of 40 m tonnes of grain per year .
* Marine ecosystems in the North and Baltic Sea are being exposed to the warmest temperatures measured since records began .
*
The number and intensity of extreme cyclones over the UK and North Sea
are projected to increase , leading to increased wind speeds and
storm - related losses over Western and Central Europe .
The
report was issued to coincide with a meeting of EU Environment
Ministers today to discuss new laws aimed at tackling climate change .
Some countries , including Italy and Poland , have already rejected
proposals for higher cuts in emissions claiming they are unaffordable
and unrealistic when many countries are facing recession .
The UK
is the only country so far to commit to a legally binding 80 per cent
cut in emissions by 2050 which the Government claims can be achieved by
a switch to renewable energy sources - such as wind and wave - combined
with a new generation of nuclear power stations .
In the report
WWF urges the EU to commit to a reduction target of at least 30 per
cent below 1990 levels by 2020 without relying on offsetting overseas
and to provide financial support so developing countries can cut their
own emissions and prepare for unavoidable impacts of climate change .
WWF - UK's
Head of Climate Change , Dr. Keith Allott , said : " Climate change is a
major challenge to the future of mankind and the environment , and this
sobering overview highlights just how critical it is that EU
environment ministers , who are meeting today to discuss EU legislation
to tackle climate change , commit to a strong climate and energy
package , in order to ensure a low carbon future .
" If the European
Union wants to be seen as leader at UN talks in Copenhagen next year ,
and to help secure a strong global deal to tackle climate change after
2012 , then it must stop shirking its responsibilities and commit to
real emissions cuts within Europe . "
The report has been
endorsed by Professor Jean - Pascal van Ypersele , the newly elected Vice
Chair of the IPCC , who said : " It is clear that climate change is
already having a greater impact than most scientists had anticipated ,
so it 's vital that international mitigation and adaptation responses
become swifter and more ambitious . "
Yes , immigration is a complicated and combustible issue for political candidates  and the economic meltdown is everyone ’s top priority .
No , that is no excuse for ignoring immigration or lying about it to voters , as John McCain and Barack Obama have been doing .
Mr. McCain lied first , in a Spanish - language ad that accused Mr. Obama of helping to kill immigration reform last year , by voting for amendments that supposedly doomed a bipartisan bill .
The ad lamented the result : “ No guest worker program .
No path to citizenship .
No secure borders .
No reform .
Is that being on our side ? ”
That is a jaw - dropping distortion .
The bill was n’t killed by any amendments .
It was killed by a firestorm of talk - radio rage and a Republican - led filibuster .
The very bill that Mr. McCain now mourns is the one he sidled away from as his own party weakened and killed it .
It ’s the one he says he would now vote against .
For Mr. McCain to suggest that Mr. Obama opposes the “ path to citizenship ” and “ guest worker program ” compounds his dishonesty .
Mr. Obama supports the three pillars of comprehensive reform  tougher enforcement , expanded legal immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already here .

The rainy season is over and the Niger Delta is lush and humid .
This southern edge of West Africa , where Nigeria 's wealth pumps out of oil and gas fields to bypass millions of its poorest people , is a restless place .
In the small delta state of Akwa Ibom , the tension and the poverty has delivered an opportunity for a new and terrible phenomenon that is leading to the abuse and the murder of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of children .
And it is being done in the name of Christianity .
Almost everyone goes to church here .
Driving through the town of Esit Eket , the rust - streaked signs , tarpaulins hung between trees and posters on boulders , advertise a church for every third or fourth house along the road .
Such names as New Testament Assembly , Church of God Mission , Mount Zion Gospel , Glory of God , Brotherhood of the Cross , Redeemed , Apostalistic .
Behind the smartly painted doors pastors make a living by ' deliverances ' - exorcisms - for people beset by witchcraft , something seen to cause anything from divorce , disease , accidents or job losses .
With so many churches it's a competitive market , but by local standards a lucrative one .
But an exploitative situation has now grown into something much more sinister as preachers are turning their attentions to children - naming them as witches .
In a maddened state of terror , parents and whole villages turn on the child .
They are burnt , poisoned , slashed , chained to trees , buried alive or simply beaten and chased off into the bush .
Some parents scrape together sums needed to pay for a deliverance - sometimes as much as three or four months ' salary for the average working man - although the pastor will explain that the witch might return and a second deliverance will be needed .
Even if the parent wants to keep the child , their neighbours may attack it in the street .
This is not just a few cases .
This is becoming commonplace .
In Esit Eket , up a nameless , puddled - and - potholed path is a concrete shack stuffed to its fetid rafters with roughly made bunk beds .
Here , three to a bed like battery chickens , sleep victims of the besuited Christian pastors and their hours - long , late - night services .
Ostracised and abandoned , these are the children a whole community believes fervently are witches .
Sam Ikpe - Itauma is one of the few people in this area who does not believe what the evangelical ' prophets ' are preaching .
He opened his house to a few homeless waifs he came across , and now he tries his best to look after 131 .
' The neighbours were not happy with me and tell me " you are supporting witches " .
This project was an accident , I saw children being abandoned and it was very worrying .
I started with three children , then every day it increased up to 15 , so we had to open this new place , ' he says .
' For every maybe five children we see on the streets , we believe one has been killed , although it could be more as neighbours turn a blind eye when a witch child disappears .
' It is good we have this shelter , but it is under constant attack . '
As he speaks two villagers walk past , at the end of the yard , pulling scarfs across their eyes to hide the ' witches ' from their sight .
Ikpe -Itauma 's wife , Elizabeth , acts as nurse to the injured children and they have called this place the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network , a big name for a small refuge .
It has found support from a charity running a school in the area , Stepping Stones Nigeria , which is trying to help with money to feed the children , but the numbers turning up here are a huge challenge .
Mary Sudnad , 10 , grimaces as her hair is pulled into corn rows by Agnes , 11 , but the scalp just above her forehead is bald and blistered .
Mary tells her story fast , in staccato , staring fixedly at the ground .
' My youngest brother died .
The pastor told my mother it was because I was a witch .
Three men came to my house .
I did n't know these men .
My mother left the house .
Left these men .
They beat me . '
She pushes her fists under her chin to show how her father lay , stretched out on his stomach on the floor of their hut , watching .
After the beating there was a trip to the church for ' a deliverance ' .
A day later there was a walk in the bush with her mother .
They picked poisonous ' asiri ' berries that were made into a draught and forced down Mary 's throat .
If that did n't kill her , her mother warned her , then it would be a barbed - wire hanging .
Finally her mother threw boiling water and caustic soda over her head and body , and her father dumped his screaming daughter in a field .
Drifting in and out of consciousness , she stayed near the house for a long time before finally slinking off into the bush .
Mary was seven .
She says she still does n't feel safe .
She says : ' My mother does n't love me . '
And , finally , a tear streaks down her beautiful face .
Gerry was picked out by a ' prophetess ' at a prayer night and named as a witch .
His mother cursed him , his father siphoned petrol from his motorbike tank and spat it over his eight - year - old face .
Gerry 's facial blistering is as visible as the trauma in his dull eyes .
He asks every adult he sees if they will take him home to his parents : ' It 's not them , it 's the prophetess , I am scared of her . '
Nwaeka is about 16 .
She sits by herself in the mud , her eyes rolling , scratching at her stick - thin arms .
The other children are surprisingly patient with her .
The wound on her head where a nail was driven in looks to be healing well .
Nine - year - old Etido had nails , too , five of them across the crown of his downy head .
Its hard to tell what damage has been done .
Udo , now 12 , was beaten and abandoned by his mother .
He nearly lost his arm after villagers , finding him foraging for food by the roadside , saw him as a witch and hacked at him with machetes .
Magrose is seven .
Her mother dug a pit in the wood and tried to bury her alive .
Michael was found by a farmer clearing a ditch , starving and unable to stand on legs that had been flogged raw .
Ekemini Abia has the look of someone in a deep state of shock .
Both ankles are circled with gruesome wounds and she moves at a painful hobble .
Named as a witch , her father and elders from the church tied her to a tree , the rope cutting her to the bone , and left the 13 - year - old there alone for more than a week .
There are sibling groups such as Prince , four , and Rita , nine .
Rita told her mum she had dreamt of a lovely party where there was lots to eat and to drink .
The belief is that a witch flies away to the coven at night while the body sleeps , so Rita 's sweet dream was proof enough : she was a witch and because she had shared food with her sibling - the way witchcraft is spread - both were abandoned .
Victoria , cheeky and funny , aged four , and her seven - year - old sister Helen , a serene little girl .
Left by their parents in the shell of an old shack , the girls did n't dare move from where they had been abandoned and ate leaves and grass .
The youngest here is a baby .
The older girls take it in turn to sling her on their skinny hips and Ikpe - Itauma has named her Amelia , after his grandmother .
He estimates around 5,000 children have been abandoned in this area since 1998 and says many bodies have turned up in the rivers or in the forest .
Many more are never found .
' The more children the pastor declares witches , the more famous he gets and the more money he can make , ' he says .
' The parents are asked for so much money that they will pay in instalments or perhaps sell their property .
This is not what churches should be doing .'
Although old tribal beliefs in witch doctors are not so deeply buried in people 's memories , and although there had been indigenous Christians in Nigeria since the 19th century , it is American and Scottish Pentecostal and evangelical missionaries of the past 50 years who have shaped these fanatical beliefs .
Evil spirits , satanic possessions and miracles can be found aplenty in the Bible , references to killing witches turn up in Exodus , Deuteronomy and Galatians , and literal interpretation of scriptures is a popular crowd - pleaser .
Pastor Joe Ita is the preacher at Liberty Gospel Church in nearby Eket .
' We base our faith on the Bible , we are led by the holy spirit and we have a programme of exposing false religion and sorcery . '
Soft of voice and in his smart suit and tie , his church is being painted and he apologises for having to sit outside near his shiny new Audi to talk .
There are nearly 60 branches of Liberty Gospel across the Niger Delta .
It was started by a local woman , mother - of - two Helen Ukpabio , whose luxurious house and expensive white Humvee are much admired in the city of Calabar where she now lives .
Many people in this area credit the popular evangelical DVDs she produces and stars in with helping to spread the child witch belief .
Ita denies charging for exorcisms but acknowledges his congregation is poor and has to work hard to scrape up the donations the church expects .
' To give more than you can afford is blessed .
We are the only ones who really know the secrets of witches .
Parents do n't come here with the intention of abandoning their children , but when a child is a witch then you have to say " what is that there ?
Not your child . "
The parents come to us when they see manifestations .
But the secret is that , even if you abandon your child , the curse is still upon you , even if you kill your child the curse stays .
So you have to come here to be delivered afterwards as well , ' he explains patiently .
' We know how they operate .
A witch will put a spell on its mother 's bra and the mother will get breast cancer .
But we cannot attribute all things to witches , they work on inclinations too , so they do n't create HIV , but if you are promiscuous then the witch will give you HIV . '
As the light fades , he presents a pile of Ukpabio 's DVDs .
Mistakenly thinking they are a gift , I am firmly put right .
Later that night , in another part of town , the hands of the clock edge towards midnight .
The humidity of the day is sealed into the windowless church and drums pound along with the screeching of the sweat - drenched preacher .
' No witches , oh Lord , ' he screams into the microphone .
' As this hour approaches , save us , oh Lord ! '
His congregation is dancing , palms aloft , women writhe and yell in tongues .
A group moves forward shepherding five children , one a baby , and kneel on the concrete floor and the pastor comes among them , pressing his hands down on each child 's head in turn , as they try to hide in the skirts of the woman .
This is deliverance night at the Church of the True Redeemer , and while the service will carry on for some hours , the main event - for which the parents will have paid cash - is over .
Walking out into the night , the drums and singing from other churches ring out as such scenes are being repeated across the village .
It is hard to find people to speak out against the brutality .
Chief Victor
Ikot is one .
He not only speaks out against the ' tinpot ' churches , but has also done the unthinkable and taken in a witch to his own home .
The chief 's niece , Mbet , was declared a witch when she was eight .
Her mother , Ekaete , made her drink olive oil , then poison berries , then invited local men to beat her with sticks .
The pastor padlocked her to a tree but unlocked her when her mother could not find the money for a deliverance .
Mbet fled .
Mbet , now 11 , says she has not seen the woman since , adding : ' My mother is a wicked mother . '
The Observer tracked down Mbet 's mother to her roadside clothing stall where she nervously fiddled with her mobile phone and told us how her daughter had given her what sounded very much like all the symptoms of malaria .
' I had internal heat , ' she says , indicating her stomach .
' It was my daughter who had caused this , she drew all the water from my body .
I could do nothing .
She was stubborn , very stubborn . '
And if her daughter had died in the bush ?
She shrugged : ' That is God 's will .
It is in God 's hands . '
Chief Victor has no time for his sister - in - law .
' Nowadays when a child becomes stubborn , then everyone calls them witches .
But it is usually from the age of 10 down , I have never seen anyone try to throw a macho adult into the street .
This child becomes a nuisance , so they give a dog a bad name and they can hang it .
' It is alarming because no household is untouched .
But it is the greed of the pastors , driving around in Mercedes , that makes them choose the vulnerable . '
In a nearby village The Observer came across five - year - old twins , Itohowo and Kufre .
They are still hanging around close to their mother 's shack , but are obviously malnourished and in filthy rags .
Approaching the boys brings a crowd of villagers who stand around and shout : ' Take them away from us , they are witches . '
' Take them away before they kill us all . '
' Witches ' .
The woman who gave birth to these sorry scraps of humanity stands slightly apart from the crowd , arms crossed .
Iambong Etim Otoyo has no intention of taking any responsibility for her sons .
' They are witches , ' she says firmly and walks away .
And by nightfall there are 133 children in the chicken coop concrete house at Esit Eket .

The world 's first commercially available " smart " homes , which will be virtually self - sufficient in energy terms by using cutting - edge efficiency and microgeneration technologies , will be available by the end of 2009 for rent in Barcelona and Paris , developers told a conference in Spain yesterday .
The Smart Energy Home ( SEH ) consortium , a collaboration of university researchers , chemical and construction companies , hope that the homes will demonstrate the potential for cutting down personal energy use in the home , with plans for further homes in Warsaw and Berlin and ongoing discussions about a project in the UK .
Rudiger Iden of BASF , one of the companies in the consortium , outlined plans for the demonstration homes at the Euroscience Open Forum meeting in Barcelona .
In Paris there will be an apartment block containing 200 dwellings , while in Barcelona , the SEH consortium will build around 40 flats .
On average , a family expends around 3,000 kilowatt - hours of energy per year and around 70 % of that is used up in and around our homes .
Iden said that SEH was aimed at reducing the environmental impact of this proportion virtually to zero .
Some of the technologies slated for use in the homes are tried and tested , such as using renewable energy sources to generate electricity - either wind turbines or solar PV panels and concentrators on the roof - and better thermal wall insulation .
The SEH homes could also use smart energy - management systems that can , for example , use sensors to work out where there are people in a house and turn heating and lighting on and off depending on where it is needed .
Other ideas will be more advanced , such as the use of phase - change materials to even out fluctuations in temperature inside a building .
These wax - like materials are embedded into the walls , storing heat when temperatures are high by melting .
When external temperatures drop , the materials solidify and release the trapped heat back into the house .
To even out seasonal changes in temperature , homes could collect excess energy during summer and use it to freeze a block of water in their basement .
When the building next needs cooling , the water can be melted .
Next - generation energy - efficient appliances and organic LED lights will also be used in the SEH demonstration projects to cut primary energy use .
Iden said that previous attempts to use smart technologies in homes had foundered because of the way they had been designed so far - each technology in isolation from the others .
" Innovative homes are currently substantially more expensive than standard houses due to low production volume of the products and lack of easy design solutions . "
He also pointed to the lack of inspiring or visible examples of innovative homes across the world .
By contrast , the SEH consortium will design its homes as a whole unit .
The first phase of their project will renovate older apartment blocks .
" The lowest hanging fruit , the easiest money to be made is in existing buildings , " said Laszlo Bax , director of the SEH project .
" Of course , in a new build you can go further and have a better result in the end . "
Eventually the consortium plans to build zero-emission homes from scratch and then " active houses " which can provide energy for themselves and sell excess into the public grid .
SEH was set up by an EU - funded project called SusChem aimed at introducing new sustainable technologies into building , will be formally launched in the coming weeks when the building contracts for the first apartment blocks are signed .
Bax said the consortium was set up to show that smart homes could be built using available technology and that people should be able to buy into the homes without having to choose between environmental sustainability and modern living .
" The concept is not just sustainable from the point of view that 's its good for the planet to have zero-emission homes but we'd also like to combine it with something that is seductive or persuasive for people who need to buy into such a home . "
He added : " Trying to avoid having to make a choice of ' do I want to be sustainable or something that 's nice for myself ' , we'd like the choice to be the same choice of choosing a smart energy home which is being good to the planet while being good to yourself . "

" You arrogant ass !
You 've killed us ! "
So said the executive officer of a Soviet submarine to his captain in Tom Clancy 's novel " The Hunt for Red October " after the captain had recklessly fired a torpedo that homed in on his own sub .
NBC 's David Gregory must have had similar thoughts as he noted , ruefully , that the news media 's assault on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin boosted substantially the television audience for her acceptance speech Wednesday night .
No friend of Barack Obama -- and the last week has demonstrated he has no better , nor more unscrupulous , friends than those in the news media -- can be happy about that .
Journalists last week cast aside the mask of objectivity to reveal they are so deeply in the tank for Mr. Obama most have grown gills .
For six days , Sarah Palin and her family were subjected to a relentless barrage of innuendo .
Journalists were trying to " define " her before she had an opportunity to introduce herself to the people in the lower 48 .
She was portrayed as an ignorant redneck from a hick town who should be home caring for her children instead of running for high public office .
Then Sarah Palin got her opportunity to speak , and her enemies learned firsthand why her nickname is " Sarah Barracuda . "
Dismiss if you will the rapturous response to Ms. Palin 's speech by the delegates in the convention hall and the posters on conservative blogs .
The best testament to its power was the lame response of the Obama campaign .
They noted she had the help of a speechwriter ( the very talented Matt Scully ) in preparing her remarks .
Well , duh .
Every major political figure has speechwriters .
Sarah Palin works fine without a script .
It 's Barack Obama who ums and ahs without a teleprompter .
In my lifetime , I 've only heard three or four speeches ( all by Ronald Reagan ) that I thought were as good or better than Sarah Palin's .
She 's as much a natural in politics as Michael Jordan was in basketball .
" Several moderate Democrat friends of mine have been e-mailing -- few if any would ever vote for McCain -- but all agree Palin was very strong , " Michael Crowley wrote on The New Republic 's blog .
" The more liberal among them are a little panicked . "
With good reason .
With a smile on her face , Ms. Palin sliced and diced Barack Obama with the skill she dresses a moose she just shot .
There were a host of good lines which I 'm sure we 'll see in McCain commercials in the near future .
But ultimately the most effective may be this one : " In small towns , we do n't know quite what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening , and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people are n't listening . "
What gives this line its power is that Sarah Palin is definitely part of the " we " -- the small town , blue - collar Americans who will decide this election .
Only once in modern times has a vice presidential candidate swung an election .
Lyndon Johnson brought Texas and Alabama to John F. Kennedy in 1960 , states that otherwise would have been suspicious of a Catholic liberal from New England .
I think Sarah Palin will be the second .
She has changed the nature of this race in ways ominous for Mr. Obama .
First , this race is no longer between a candidate who advocates change and the status quo , as Democrats would like to frame it .
It 's between two different visions of change , and between a ticket that 's actually delivered reform , and a ticket that just talks about it .
The argument that John McCain represents a third term for George W. Bush was strained to start with .
It 's ludicrous now .
Second , the Republican base is more fired up , and the party more united than it 's been since Ronald Reagan ran for his second term .
Conservatives see in Sarah Palin Ronald Reagan in a dress , the brains and backbone of Margaret Thatcher in a younger , prettier package .
The Grand Old Party has a bright new face .
Mr. Obama owes much of his new troubles to his friends in the news media .
Republicans -- and independent and Democratic women appalled by their sexism -- were enraged by the vicious assaults on Sarah Palin and her family .
After he learned his fleet had attacked Pearl Harbor before a formal declaration of war , Japanese Adm .
Isoroku Yamamoto is reputed to have said : " I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve . "
The vice presidential debate is Oct. 2 . If I were Joe Biden , I would be very , very afraid .

Financial crises are consistent in one way , and one way only :
They ’re far more sexy when your neighbors are wearing them .
When you suffer your own , runaway inflation becomes infuriating rather than exotic , and bogus bank scams go from intriguing to fist - clenching .
It ’s all fine and well until it hits you squarely across the jaw .
Which is what the people who run ( or , more aptly , misguide ) the United States have just done to the general population .
For all the progress we ’re making , a purple elephant might as well be running the show .
Which leads to a deeper question .
Namely , does anyone run the show during a financial crisis ?
Is there any way to skip out of one as quickly as it enveloped you ?
Check out these ten nasty crises , and see for yourself :
10 . Swedish Financial Crisis ( 1990 - 1994 )
Cause :
In 1985 , Sweden deregulated its credit market , leading to a commercial property speculation bubble .
Between 1990 - 94 , the bubble burst , leaving 90 % of the banking sector with massive losses , including all of Sweden ’s largest banks .
Action :
The government bailed out banks that looked like they could eventually survive the crisis , nationalizing two of them .
It also extended a guarantee to those banks ’ creditors , which kept consumer confidence up .
It let the banks destroyed by the crisis fail .
Though the government took on bad assets worth about $ 9.9 billion , it was eventually able to recoup the losses through dividends and reselling assets from the nationalized banks .
Stockholders were left empty - handed , but taxpayers did n’t have to foot the bailout bill .
Hear that , United States ?
Moral of the story :
Do n’t save stockholders if you can save taxpayers .
Investors , who take calculated risks by investing in the stock market , are in a position to bear losses with partial responsibility .
Taxpayers , meanwhile , should not be punished for someone else ’s oversights .
9. United States Savings and Loan Crisis ( 1986 -1989 )
Cost : $ 160.1 billion ( $ 124.6 billion taxpayer money ) and 747 United States savings and loan associations .
Causes : Policy expert Bert Ely says old , incompetent policies were behind the mess .
Among them :
- The government picked S&L ’s , traditionally funded by short - term deposits , to finance long - term , fixed - rate mortgages .
Whenever short - term interest rates went up , S&Ls lost money on their long - term mortgages , leading to negative mortgage interest rate spreads .
- The S&L industry was subject a Depression - area regulation limiting the interest rates banks could pay on their deposits .
To keep interest costs under control , S&Ls used funds from savers to cover home buyers , earning interest income on ten- to twenty - year - old fixed - rate mortgages through what Ely calls “ maturity mismatching ” .
- Restrictions on interest rates stuck S&Ls with rates below market value .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which kept interest rates for homebuyers low , limited S&Ls ’ profits –another reason they relied heavily on maturity mismatching to make a profit .
When Chairman of the Fed Paul Volcker restricted the dollar ’s growth in the early ‘ 80s to combat stagflation , interest rates skyrocketed , and the S&L industry collapsed .
Action : The Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act ( 1989 ) , which created two new oversight agencies , a new insurance fund for thrifts , and a trust corporation to get rid of the zombie institutions that regulators had taken over .
Additionally , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were given more responsibility in supporting mortgages for families in need .
Moral of the story :
When the government puts impossible restrictions on a bank ’s ability to make money , the bank finds a workaround to keep its bottom line working .
When the Fed makes a change that blows the lid off the bank ’s workaround , the whole system collapses .
8. Northern Rock Bailout ( Great Britain , 2007 )
Image : Dominic Alves / Flickr
Causes : Financial services expert Martin Upton says that when vast numbers of mortgage holders with bad credit in the United States defaulted on their loans , financial institutions around the world became cautious about lending one another money .
After all , nobody was sure how much money their exposure to the US subprime crisis would lose them .
As a result , liquidity around the world went down , while interest rates went up .
Unlike the United States , the Bank of England did not flood the markets with billions of dollars to get liquidity back up .
Banks were , for the most part , on their own .
Enter Northern Rock .
Northern Rock ’s lucrative mortgage business ( comprising about 40 % of company assets ) , was located in a company in the ( tax - sheltered ) Channel Islands called Granite .
Granite was a charitable trust set up to benefit a Down ’s Syndrome charity .
However , Granite never donated any of its £ 45 billion of assets to the charity .
Instead , it acted as a securitization vehicle , selling “ asset - backed securities ” to investors and replacing maturing mortgages with new ones .
When global liquidity dried up , Northern Rock could n’t cover its money market borrowings .
It asked the Bank of England for money in 2007 , at which point the Tripartite Authority gave it emergency financial support .
After the bailout news hit , customers Martin Upton ” > ran on the bank , withdrawing about £ 1 billion , or 5 % of Northern Rock ’s total bank deposits , in one day , and up to £ 2 billion by September 17 .
Bank shares to fell 72 % .
The run tapered off after the British Government said it would guarantee all Northern Rock deposits .
In January 2008 , Northern Rock sold its lifetime home equity release mortgage portfolio to JP Morgan , using the £ 2.2 billion gained from the sale to pay off part of its Bank of England loan .
In February , the government announced that it adding Northern Rock ’s liabilities to the country ’s national debt , now pegged at 45 % of GDP .
It was thus nationalized .
Action :
An internal report released in March 2008 cited inadequate government supervision during the Northern Rock crisis , but blamed the bank ’s collapse on its senior management .
Moral of the story : Repackaging debt as assets in a fake nonprofit only works when the economy is going smoothly .
Do n’t build your entire business out of this practice and expect to survive .
7. Tulip Mania ( The Netherlands , 1637 )
Causes :
The first speculative bubble on record revolved not around property or companies , but around tulip bulbs .
After tulips were introduced by modern - day Turkey to Europe in the mid-1500s , people in the Netherlands grew especially fond of them , seeing them as a status symbol .
Tulips infected with a certain virus tended to develop spectacular colors , flames , and lines on their petals .
These new varieties were given high - sounding names and coveted wildly by the population .
In order to secure these fancy tulips in advance — tulips with the virus can take as long as 12 years to develop from seed to flower — a market developed around their trade .
Traders signed medieval futures contracts that guaranteed them tulips at the end of the season .
Professional growers , meanwhile , were willing to pay more and more for the popular flowers .
Some tulips were worth more than peoples ’ annual wages .
In the 1630s , speculators , lured by tales of sudden riches , flooded the market .
The Dutch government banned short selling of futures contracts several times in the 1600s to control the mania .
It also created a formal market for purchase and sale of tulip futures , requiring traders to meet in taverns and pay a small fee for each trade .
Bulb prices climbed until early 1637 , when tulip traders were no longer able to sell bulbs at inflated prices .
Demand collapsed , leading to a drop in price .
The tulip futures trade stopped .
Action : Tulip speculators went to the government for help .
The government , in turn , permitted futures contracts to be voided with a 10 % fee .
Many futures holders voided their contracts , and bulb sellers were stuck with their inventory .
Moral of the story : People go crazy when they become convinced that they can get rich quickly .
Even off a tulip bulb future .
6. Wall Street Crash of 1929
Cause :
In the late 1920s , hundreds of thousands of investors contributed to a speculative bubble in the stock market .
Many went into debt to purchase stock , resulting in more than $ 8.5 billion in debt throughout the nation — more money than was in circulation at the time .
When the market turned bearish on October 24 , 1929 , investors panicked , causing a massive selloff that tanked the stock markets and contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s .
To demonstrate confidence in the market , the Rockefeller family and the heads of major banks bought large quantities of stock .
This move did n’t stop the panic .
During the week of October 24 , the market lost a total of $ 30 billion , more than the United States had spent on World War I .
The stock market crashed caused businesses to close , mass layoffs , and a rash of bankruptcies .
An international run on the dollar resulted in increased interest rates , driving out around 4,000 lenders .
Action : After an investigation , Congress passed the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 ( now repealed ) , mandating a separation between investment and commercial banks .
They believed this would avert another dramatic panic sale .
It did n’t — the Dow fell 22.6 % in 1987 — but , to date , the Great Depression that followed the 1929 crash has n’t been repeated .
Moral of the story : Do n’t panic .
Many scholars now say that the 1929 crash did n’t cause the Great Depression , but certainly contributed to its severity .
Public panic only makes situations worse than they already are .
5 . The Japanese asset price bubble ( 1986 - 1990 )
Image : Wikimedia Commons
Causes : After World War II , Japan ’s domestic policies encouraged people to save money .
People put more money into banks , making it easier for companies to take out loans and lines of credit .
Using their new lines of credit , Japanese companies invested in capital resources , enabling them to produce goods more efficiently than international competitors .
Japanese provided high - quality products at extremely competitive prices , becoming a major world economic power in the process .
At the same time , the yen steadily appreciated .
Investors to make good money off financial markets .
People used easy credit to develop property and buy homes , contributing to a speculative real estate bubble .
Real estate prices inflated , with some Tokyo properties selling at $ 139,000 / square foot .
Stocks prices seemed to have no ceiling at all .
Reinvestment expanded the economy further .
The Nikkei reached an all - time high of 38,957.44 in December of 1989 .
Then , in the early 1990s , Japan ’s bubble started to sink .
Rather than a dramatic crash , real estate and stock values decreased slowly , leading to Japan ’s “ lost decade . ”
People started investing outside of the country ; companies lost some of their competitive advantage internationally as a result .
Low consumption rates coupled with lower output and employment meant steady deflation .
Action :
The government lowered interest rates to practically nothing , which did nothing to encourage Japanese people to put money in the banks .
The government subsidized banks and businesses on the brink of failure , effectively propping up zombie organizations with little visible benefit to the economy .
The Yen carry trade became one of the main ways people made money off their investments .
In 2003 , the Nikkei finally started climbing again .
Moral of the story :
When bubbles grow , they ’re wonderful in every way .
When they sink — and they can sink , rather than popping — they can set the economy back more than a decade .
4 . The .com bubble ( 1995 - 2000 )
Cause :
In the mid-1990s , a new type of business emerged :
The .com , a company either based solely on the Web or servicing the Internet , its people , and its technology .
When early . coms ’ stock values shot skyward , venture capitalists jumped aboard en masse to finance Internet startups .
A .com ’s lack of a viable business plan did n’t stop many VCs from throwing in money .
Investors and startup executives assumed that once a .com had peoples ’ attention , the money would come organically in the future .
Speculators jumped in , creating a market full of wildly overvalued startups .
Lavish spending and astronomical publicity campaigns followed .
. coms burned through their VC money , positive it would come back soon .
Day trading became a relatively common way to make fast money .
In 2000 , the NASDAQ began to trend downward , leading to what ’s known as the .com bust .
Action :
Though the government did n’t address .com startups or speculation , its policies and timing may have contributed to a loss of confidence .
Between 1999 - 2000 , the Fed increased interest rates six times in order to reign in the economy .
Around the same time , a flurry of government investigations stalled corrupt business practices .
For example , around the same time the NASDAQ began its slide , Microsoft was declared a monopoly .
Major telecommunications companies , such as MCI Worldcom , toppled under debt and management scandals .
Regulators put the financial industry under fire for misleading investors during the .com boom .
Famously , Enron collapsed after investigators uncovered an accounting scandal .
The Sarbanes - Oxley Act was passed in 2002 , laying out far tougher transparency and accountability standards for public companies .
Moral of the story :
The market , your favorite bipolar uncle , likes to celebrate wildly when he finds out about new technology .
Just be sure to steer clear of him when his mania turns into prolonged , howling grief .
3. 1997 Asian Financial Crisis ( 1997 -1999 )
Image : Wikimedia Commons
Causes :
In the years leading up to the crisis , Southeast Asia was a hot international investment destination .
ASEAN countries ’ high short - term interest rates gave foreign investors favorable rates .
Capital flooded into the region .
Asset prices increased , and growth rates in the early 1990s were as high as 12 % of GDP , leading analysts to refer to the phenomenon as the “ Asian Tigers ” and “ Asian Economic Miracle . ”
At the same time , Thailand , South Korea , and Indonesia ran huge deficits .
They borrowed quite a bit of money externally ; keeping their own interest rates fixed encouraged this behavior .
This left them vulnerable to changes in foreign markets .
In the early ‘90s , foreign investors turned away from Asia .
Higher US interest rates valued the dollar up , which in turn made Southeast Asia ’s exports less competitive ( their currencies were pegged to the US dollar ) .
Southeast Asian exports slowed in early 1996 , fueled at least in part by China ’s increased competitiveness in the export market .
What caused the crisis from here is subject to rampant debate .
Some say that policies leading to large amounts of credit pushed up asset prices , which then collapsed , leading to massive debt defaults ( kind of like the subprime crisis ) .
International investors panicked and withdrew credit .
To keep the region attractive to foreign investors , ASEAN governments jacked up interest rates and bought up excess domestic money using foreign reserves .
As a result , the governments ’ central banks started running out of foreign reserves , while capital continued to drain from the region .
In 1997 , Thailand ’s government decided to float the baht , unleashing what ’s now known as the Asian Financial Crisis .
Regional currencies depreciated , meaning liabilities denominated in terms of foreign currency grew even more expensive in domestic terms .
Entire economic sectors melted down , while people fell into poverty .
Stock markets and currencies rapidly devalued .
Politics destabilized , with executive resignations and an increase in extremist groups .
The region seemed to melt down in the blink of an eye .
Actions : The International Monetary Fund created bailout packages dictating reforms in exchange for debt defaults .
The reforms included cutting government spending , allowing banks to fail , raising interest rates , and becoming more transparent .
The IMF ’s actions had questionable results , leading to a backlash against powerful international NGOs that continues today .
Some say the crisis in Asia also contributed to the recent United States housing bubble .
Moral of the story :
When things crash , rich people may interfere , offering money in exchange for an agenda .
That does n’t mean their agenda is right , or even useful .
Moral # 2 : Financial meltdowns can happen at the speed of light .
2. Russian financial crisis ( 1998 )
Image : Kremlin.ru
Causes :
In 1993 , the Russian government came up with inflation - free short - term treasury bills , known as GKOs , to finance the country ’s deficit .
GKOs were traded on currency exchanges .
Though mostly state - owned , roughly 1/3 of funding came from foreign speculators , which they attracted through high interest rates .
The government used proceeds from sales of new GKOs to pay off interest on matured bills — a classic Ponzi scheme .
In June 1997 , looking to raise capital , the government increased GKO interest rates to 150 % .
By the beginning of 1998 , GKO interest payments comprised more than half the federal government ’s revenue .
They became large domestic banks ’ main source of revenue .
Meanwhile , the government owed workers roughly $ 12.5 billion in unpaid wages .
It was also making more money from GKOs than from taxes .
Investors lost confidence in the Russian government when they put all the pieces together , selling Russian securities and rubles .
The Central Bank tried unsuccessfully to stabilize the ruble by spending an estimated $ 27 billion of its United States dollar reserves .
In August 1998 , Russia ’s markets collapsed .
Investors , fearing a devaluation of the ruble and a debt default , panicked , leaving the market with a 65 % drop in one day .
As a result , several major banks closed , and inflation increased .
It also eradicated the nascent middle class by eating through peoples ’ bank savings .
Actions :
The government cut spending on social - and municipal services .
Fortunately , oil prices skyrocketed after 1999 , facilitating a quick recovery .
Moral of the story :
Do n’t anger people while financing yourself with a Ponzi scheme .
It ends up being much more expensive in the long run .
1. Argentine economic crisis ( 1999 –2002 )
Causes : Agentina had a history of volatility when the 1980s Latin American crisis struck .
The import - dependent country was running low on US dollars , a currency that people were entitled to convert their pesos into if they felt like it ( this was a “ safe ” option for many people ) .
The country also had a history of runaway inflation and associated loss of confidence in its currency .
Meanwhile , the government spent lavishly on itself while ignoring the country ’s crumbling industrial infrastructure .
In the 1980s , Mexico and Brazil , major Argentinian trade partners , suffered economic crises that spread through Latin America .
Brazil ’s real was devalued in 1999 , hurting Argentine exports ; at the same time , the dollar was revalued , delivering the Argentinian peso another blow .
In 1999 , the country entered a 3 - year recession .
The government did not devalue the peso or unpeg it from the dollar , making the crisis worse .
The recession deepened .
Investors ran on banks for dollars , which they then sent abroad for safety .
In response , the government more or less froze everyone ’s bank account .
Citizens protested in major cities , eventually starting fires and destroying property .
Violence and fatalities ensued .
In 2001 , the government collapsed .
People bartered for goods because they lacked cash .
Business shut down .
Many people eked out a living by scavenging cardboard for recycling plants .
Action :
The government at first tried to set up a third currency between the peso and the dollar , but this failed .
It then mandated that all dollars in banks be converted into pesos .
The exchange was left to float , leading the peso to depreciate .
Exports became more competitive .
The government tightened its tax policies , improved social welfare , encouraged business growth , and put reserve dollars up for sale on the market .
As worldwide demand from Argentinian agricultural products increased , the country grew a trade surplus .
It continues to struggle with inflation , however .
Moral of the story : Freezing bank accounts is a really bad idea .

Arnold Schwarzenegger has sacked thousands of temporary California state workers and slashed the pay of full - time civil servants in a bid to halt a fiscal crisis .
California 's governor signed an executive order terminating 10,300 part - time jobs and reducing the pay of 200,000 state employees to the federal minimum wage until a state budget is approved .
He said the unprecedented action was to avoid a " full - blown " fiscal crisis and that he had been left with " no easy choices " .
" This is not an action that I take lightly .
I understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so I want to apologise to all the state employees for having to do that , " he said .
Officials in California 's legislature see the governor 's decision as an attempt to expedite the approval of the state budget , which has yet to be agreed one month after the state 's fiscal year began .
This has left the state unable to pay contractors , higher education workers and legislative employees .
Schwarzenegger 's emergency measures are expected to save the state coffers £ 1bn - still a fraction of the $ 15.2 bn ( £ 7.7 bn ) state deficit .
The layoffs and a freeze on hiring and overtime , which took effect immediately , will save about $ 80 m .
The administration has not said which employees will be exempt .
Those in the essential services , such as public safety and emergency medical care , are expected to be spared the layoffs .
The governor 's minimum wage order , due to take effect in September , is likely to be challenged by employee unions .
The state 's comptroller , John Chiang , who has the job of issuing pay cheques , has vowed to ignore the pay cut .
If a budget is not in place by the end of August , Chiang said his office would be forced to forgo more than $ 3bn in payments to schools , rural hospitals , health clinics , nursing homes other organisations that provide state services .
Democratic and Republican assembly members remain divided over whether to plug the gap with tax increases or spending cuts .
Google has announced a new mammoth undertaking that will bring the past 30 years of print journalism online , through a partnership with around 100 newspaper publishers .
The new feature which ties in with the company ’s book - scanning operation will make fully searchable newspaper pages available to the public that will appear just as they did when they were originally printed .
The new feature was announced at the TechCrunch50 Conference ( Sept 8 - 10 ) where a demonstration showed how the project put the scanned documents into context with related articles from other papers displayed on the right hand side of the page .
Google plans to run its
Adsense advertising next to the documents using a revenue share model , so that all parties benefit from the endeavor .
This seems a wise move and has likely contributed to the search giant ’s success in garnering support from so many publishers .
The newspaper scans will be zoomable , much like Google Maps and will display all the original content including headlines and advertisements , giving you a feel for the times .
Google created a new algorithm for the project that works in conjunction with Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) to enable the billions of pages of newsprint to be searchable .

When Ulrike Rubcic heard that her town would take down all of its traffic lights , she rolled her eyes in disbelief .
Tucked between cornfields and cow meadows , the main street in this bucolic northern German community was also a thoroughfare with thousands of cars and trucks zooming to or from nearby Osnabruck .
" Are we waiting for the first accident ? " she thought then .
But this summer the town reworked its downtown thoroughfare , not only scrapping the traffic lights but also tearing down the curbs and erasing marked crosswalks .
The busiest part of the main street turned into a " naked " square shared equally by bikes , pedestrians , cars , and trucks .
Now , there is only one rule :
Always give way to the person on the right .
Two months into the experiment , " Instead of thinking , ' It 's going to be red , I need to give gas , people have to slow down , to look to the right and the left , to be considerate " says Ms. Rubcic .
The bonus ?
Town people recognize they have become a bit closer to one another .
" The whole village has become more human .
We look at each other , we greet each other , " she says .
In recent years , initiatives that aim at rescuing streets from the hegemony of cars , giving more space for pedestrians and cyclists and combating increased speed , traffic , and trouble have popped up in cities across Europe .
In a new experiment , " Paris respire , " the banks of the Seine are closed to traffic on sunny days .
Switzerland has set up " zones of encounter " where playgrounds or landscaped areas force cars to slow down and pedestrians have priority .
Hundreds of Dutch neighborhoods have successfully done away with traffic signs .
But Bohmte broke new ground .
In Germany , a country fond of rules , Bohmte did what politicians had hitherto not dared to do .
" What 's revolutionary about Bohmte is that it took off its signs on a state highway with a lot of traffic , " says Heiner Monheim , a traffic management expert at the University of Trier , speaking at a recent European conference on sign - free towns convened here .
Beyond that , Monheim says , the model 's real legacy is to have brought people closer to " rediscovering and appreciating cities not only as traffic places but also as human , social places . "
Just like so many other German communities , Bohmte 's location as a busy artery was both its blessing and its curse .
Close to 13,000 cars and trucks would speed along its main street every day .
" Drivers did n't care about kids , " says Klaus Mueller , strolling about with his grandchild and noting that the flow of cars is more slow and steady now .
Because Bohmte 's main street is a state highway , the town cannot forbid truck traffic .
Mayor Klaus Goedejohann knew that the heavy traffic spoilt the town 's atmosphere , but that it also provided the town 's livelihood .
" How do we manage to meet the interest of all the traffic participants without excluding anybody ? " he recalls thinking .
Then Mr. Goedejohann heard of a radical traffic - management philosophy called " shared space . "
Pioneered by a Dutch engineer who thought towns were safer with fewer rules , it envisioned open surfaces on which motorists and pedestrians could " negotiate " with one another by eye contact , other signals , and a greater consideration for one another .
Segregating cars and pedestrians was wrong , argued Hans Monderman , whose death this winter rekindled people 's interest in his ideas .
Portrayed as a dangerous maverick decades ago , Mr. Monderman put in place more than 100 shared - space schemes in the Netherlands .
When the European Union launched a research project on shared space , Bohmte decided to try it , along with six other towns , including Ostend in Belgium and Ipswich in England .
Not everybody feels good about the town having spent close to $ 3.3 million on redesigning its downtown .
On the day of a shared - space conference in Bohmte , Franz Josef Breiner walked hesitantly on the main street 's flat surface with his cane , assessing the ground .
He is sight - impaired and cannot make eye contact with drivers : shared space robs him of the safety nets that were curbs and sidewalks .
" In theory shared space is more human , but we 're left out , " Mr. Breiner says .
Although shared space " offers a chance to win back space for nonmotorized participants , " skepticism also runs high because many people worry that the children and elderly will not be able to communicate with drivers .
Still , a 2008 study in Holland reported that shared space has reduced the number of accidents in sign - free areas .
Goedejohann , Bohmte 's mayor , is confident .
His town averaged 50 accidents last year .
Since the shared space concept was enacted , there have n't been any , he says .
And other city governments are reacting .
In Hamburg a new coalition of green and conservative politicians have pledged to design shared space streets in every neighborhood .
" My theory , " Monderman said last fall at a new urbanism summit in London , " was if you want to make people behave in a village , maybe you have to make it feel like a village . "
[ Pastafarians stage a counter - protest .
Photo cred – Brian Chilson ]
It was a victory for Pastafarians everywhere .
Last Friday – Talk Like a Pirate Day – the Central Arkansas Pastafarians interrupted and caused the discontinuation of a Westboro Baptist Church hate - demonstration .
Westboro Baptist Church is best known for picketing funeral processions of soldiers killed in the Iraq War , but they hate everyone who does n’t share their literal interpretation of the Bible .
From Wikipedia :
The church runs numerous websites such as GodHatesFags.com , GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of homosexuality , Roman Catholics , Muslims and Jews , as well as populations it believes are supporting the aforementioned groups , including Chinese , Swedes , Canadians , Irish , British , Mexicans and Americans .
These guys are intolerant assholes ; I am so happy to see our fellow Pastafarians ruin their day .
The Arkansas Times had this to say about the Pastafarian counter - protest :
What do you do to make a bunch of soulless nutcases abandon their post at the Convention Center ?
Send in the pirates !
Yep , the cuckoo Phelps hate group walked the plank this morning after a happy bunch dressed like pirates and holding signs saying “ God hates shrimp — Leviticus ” and “ God hates cotton - polyester blends ” stood opposite them at the corner of Markham and Scott streets .
The group , made up of Central Arkansas Pastafarians , waved swords and growled “ Arrghh ! ” in a manner that would have made Abbie Hoffman proud .
With cars honking and waving at the pirates and a TV crew giving them all the attention , the Phelps group — with a child in tow , sadly — picked up their “ fag ” epithets and went away .
Pitiful .
A sincere thank you to the Central Arkansas Pastafarians .
You made us all proud .

There is a broad consensus that Congress must act to stave off deeper turmoil on Wall Street .
Irrespective of the final agreement yet to be reached , there are several principles that must be part of a broader reform effort that begins this week and continues in the coming months .
This is not just a financial crisis ; it 's an economic crisis .
Therefore , the solutions we pursue cannot simply stabilize the markets .
We must also deal with the interconnected economic challenges that set the stage for this crisis -- and reverse the failed policies that allowed a potential crisis to become a real one .
First , we must address the skyrocketing rates of mortgage defaults and foreclosures that have buffeted the economy and ignited the credit crisis .
Two million homeowners carry mortgages worth more than their homes .
They hold $ 3 trillion in mortgage debt .
Nearly three million adjustable - rate mortgages are scheduled for a rate increase in the next two years .
Another wave of foreclosures looms .
I 've proposed a new Home Owners ' Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) , to launch a national effort to help homeowners refinance their mortgages .
The original HOLC , launched in 1933 , bought mortgages from failed banks and modified the terms so families could make affordable payments while keeping their homes .
The original HOLC returned a profit to the Treasury and saved one million homes .
We can save roughly three times that many today .
We should also put in place a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and freeze rate hikes in adjustable - rate mortgages .
We 've got to stem the tide of failing mortgages and give the markets time to recover .
The time for ideological , partisan arguments against these actions is over .
For years , the calls to provide borrowers an affordable opportunity to avoid foreclosure as a means of preventing wider turmoil were dismissed as government intrusion into the private marketplace .
My proposals over the past two years were derided as too much , too soon .
Now we are forced to reckon with too little , too late .
From AP :
While Obama Waffles takes aim at Obama ’s politics by poking fun at his public remarks and positions on issues , it also plays off the image of the classic pancake - mix icon Aunt Jemima , which has been widely criticized as a demeaning stereotype .
Obama is portrayed with popping eyes and big , thick lips as he stares at a plate of waffles and smiles broadly .
Placing Obama in Arab - like headdress recalls the false rumor that he is a follower of Islam , though he is actually a Christian .
On the back of the box , Obama is depicted in stereotypical Mexican dress , including a sombrero , above a recipe for “ Open Border Fiesta Waffles ” that says it can serve “ 4 or more illegal aliens . ”
The recipe includes a tip : “ While waiting for these zesty treats to invade your home , why not learn a foreign language ? ”
The novelty item also takes shots at 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry , Obama ’s wife , Michelle
First off , this is THE religious right summit .
Just to show you how ungodly , how un-Christian , the religious really is .
Second , just imagine the outcry if we ’d sold “ Cindy McCain drug testing kits ” at our big conventions .
McCain and Palin are speaking at this convention ( as is Obama ) .
Are they going to be speaking out against this blatant racism , sexism and Latino bashing , or does John McCain only care about prejudice when it ’s a lie that helps him win an election ?
Greg Mitchell has more , including a photo of the product .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering a plan to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department , as its seeks to shore up its finances amid an expected wave of bank failures , according to a published report Tuesday .
Funds borrowed from the Treasury would used to cover short - term cash - flow needs related to reimbursing depositors in the aftermath of bank failure , the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday , citing comments by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair .
The report said the borrowed funds would be repaid once assets from the failed bank are sold .
LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) --
A jury of nine women and three men -- none of them black -- was seated Thursday for the trial of O.J. Simpson on kidnapping and armed robbery charges .
Judge Jackie Glass decided prosecutors had a " race - neutral " reason for dismissing the potential juror .
The judge made no official mention of the jury 's makeup , but prosecutors revealed in court that no blacks were on the jury .
A black man and black woman , however , are among six alternate jurors .
Defense attorneys had argued the prosecutors were deliberately trying to exclude blacks , but Judge Jackie Glass denied their challenges .
Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Monday in the case against Simpson and a co-defendant , Clarence Stewart .
Prosecutors say Simpson and five other men stormed into a Las Vegas hotel room on September 13 , 2007 to recover sports memorabilia that Simpson said belonged to him .
Prosecutors say at least two men with Simpson had guns as they robbed a pair of sports memorabilia dealers .
If convicted on all counts , Simpson faces a possible sentence of life in prison .
He has pleaded not guilty and has told CNN he was trying to get his property back .
Four of five Simpson 's original co-defendants have struck deals with the prosecution to testify against Simpson .
One testified in a pre-trial hearing that " O.J. Simpson wanted me to have a weapon . "
Another testified that Simpson " wanted me to help him acquire some guns . "
An attorney for Simpson , Yale Galanter , has disputed that .
" O.J. Simpson did not know that there were guns in that room , " Galanter said .

Note :
This article , to be published in the October 2008 issue of Scientific American , was originally printed with the title , " Questions for Would - Be Presidents . "
Add your own questions for McCain and Obama in our comments section below .
No one has ever complained that U.S. presidential candidates talk too much about science , and this year has been no exception .
Nevertheless , science - related issues such as energy and health care , once viewed as sideshows , have taken center stage in this election .
The candidates ’ positions are often vague , but they are an improvement on past campaigns .
Here are some follow - up questions that they invite .
Energy
Both John McCain and Barack Obama have called for a cap - and - trade system to cut carbon emissions , although Obama ’s proposed reduction ( 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050 ) is larger than McCain ’s ( 65 percent ) .
Both candidates , however , need to answer a crucial question :
Why cap - and - trade when so many policy experts , seeing the troubles with carbon trading in Europe , now recommend a simpler carbon tax ?
Both candidates oppose Yucca Mountain , the controversial proposed nuclear waste dump .
McCain has advocated an “ international repository ” instead .
What is the difference ?
Where does Obama propose to put the waste ?
The U.S. has spent 30 years studying Yucca ; switching sites will restart the clock .
What will nuclear plants do with all their spent fuel in the meantime ?
Beyond these generalities , the candidates diverge .
McCain would subsidize the construction of 45 new nuclear reactors , costing upward of $ 270 billion and taking 20 years to complete .
Why invest that much public money in nuclear rather than solar or wind power , which could start pumping out watts much sooner ?
How would offshore oil drilling , which McCain has urged , help wean the nation off fossil fuels ?
Obama has spelled out intermediate milestones for emissions reductions and specific targets for biofuels and other renewables .
How would these goals be enforced ?
He has promised $ 150 billion over 10 years for energy research and development as well as a $ 10 - billion - a - year venture capital fund .
What would stop that money , as in so many past efforts , from being allocated by lobbyists rather than engineers ?
Does the energy industry really need more venture capital ?
Oddly , he has promised to “ fight the efforts of big oil and big agribusiness to undermine ” corn - based ethanol .
How has agribusiness sought to undermine corn ethanol ?
If anything , it seems rather the opposite .
And why sustain support for corn ethanol when it is the most ungreen of all biofuels ?
Embryonic stem cells
Both McCain and Obama support harvesting stem cells from embryos left over from in vitro fertilization .
McCain would ban scientists from using donor eggs to create disease - specific stem cell lines or chimeric animals to see how human stem cells behave during development .
How , then , would his policy be substantially different from the current highly restrictive one , and how would it encourage the discovery of lifesaving treatments ?
As for Obama , what alternative sources of embryonic cells would he permit ?
What federal oversight should embryonic stem cell research have that other forms of biomedical research , including those involving human subjects , do not already have ?
Space
Both candidates support President George W. Bush ’s plan to send astronauts to the moon and then to Mars .
Are McCain and Obama willing to increase NASA ’s budget commensurately , or would they beggar the space science programs ?
Other topics
Obama , more than McCain , has taken positions on many other science issues .
He has promised to double federal funding for basic research .
Over what period ?
And does that figure include his promised energy investment ?
He has said he would appoint a chief technology officer to protect citizens ’ electronic privacy , but could that person really overrule federal agencies with their own prerogatives ?
How precisely would Obama make good on his vow to reform the troubled copyright and patent system ?
Both candidates clearly need to flesh out their ideas if those ideas are to rise above throwaway campaign pledges and become real policy .

Seeing this headline in the New York Post made me furious .
The Democrats – and a number of Republicans – are insisting on some basic accountability measures and a pledge that they will be able to pass some sort of relief for those affected by the crisis who are n’t millionaires .
Each of these requests is reasonable .
The first request is absolutely essential .
The Post ‘s attempts to “ stampede the herd ” into accepting whatever it is Paulson wants are dangerous .
Everyone from Newt Gingrich to Paul Krugman to William Kristol to Matt Yglesias to NRO ’s Yuval Levin has urged caution and some sort of oversight mechanism as the least .
The proposed bill would give Secretary Paulson authority to “ take such actions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the authorities in this Act , ” giving him extremely broad powers to unilaterally control the market in addition to the $ 700 billion .
In addition to these dictatorial powers , Paulson would be granted legal immunity for all of his actions :
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
Although I doubt Paulson would use this crisis to personally profit – nothing in the law would prevent him .
And if he did , no action could be taken against him .
This is incredibly reckless .
This law would remain in effect for two years – which would allow Obama ’s Secretary of the Treasury as well as Paulson to , in exercising authority under this law , do virtually anything and be immune from any consequences .
This is how the Patriot Act was pushed through Congress in the dead of night , with no one reading the weighty tome .
This is how democracies are given away in a moment of crisis , in that Roman tradition of granting a temporary dictatorship over Rome until a crisis passes .
Power is never given away easily – and so , in the end , the democracy with temporary dictators became a permanent dictatorship .
In this age of terrorism and globalization , the crisis is never fully past us ; and a new one is always on the horizon .
I do n’t think anyone has any definite idea about what will work in this situation .
And this is a time for pragmatism , not ideology .
But even – and especially – in a crisis , there must be accountability and limits .
This fear - mongering by the Post and other Republican puppets represents the worst impulse we can have at this time .
We must act quickly but deliberately – because in our understandable haste , we might accidentally give away more than we intend .

Tell the real John McCain story and you indict the entire political system .
It is not a pretty story .
No one really wants to know .
I truly believe that if you spelled it out so people could really understand the McCain phenomenon , few would thank you .
Instead , they would probably be inclined to hate you for the information and discount anything you had to say on any other matter in the future .
There is , after all , validity to the legend about shooting the messenger .
Voters have been comfortable in supporting McCain because he is the mirror image of everything this superficial Sun Belt culture teaches us to admire .
On the surface , he is the war hero with an earnest , pleasing personality .
He is a family man and friend to Mr. Average Man , to the downtrodden , to the Native Americans and the poor .
He loves Sun City residents , too , as well as the blacks , although few can recall having ever seen him in the presence of a black person .
McCain is the son and grandson of Navy admirals , an Annapolis graduate , Navy pilot and former Pentagon lobbyist .
It was while in the Pentagon that McCain curried favor with John Tower , the powerful Senator John Tower of Texas who believed there was never a weapons system too costly to be purchased .
It was Tower who tipped McCain off to the career opportunity of moving to Tempe , Arizona , so that he could run for the seat in Arizona 's First Congressional District being vacated after 30 years by John Rhodes .
Barely here long enough to qualify for a driver 's license , McCain won a four - way Republican primary in 1982 with a mere 32 percent of the vote .
Info John McCain
He became a formidable vote - getter by the simple habit of wrapping himself in the American flag , a most convenient way of reminding voters that he had been a prisoner of war for six years in Vietnam .
Any time McCain feels threatened , he makes a well - publicized trip back to Vietnam to search for missing prisoners of war .
Friends say McCain undergoes a knee - jerk reaction each time he hears about Claire Sargent 's growing strength in the current senatorial campaign .
McCain grabs a telephone , calls his campaign manager and orders that more time be purchased on all TV stations around the state to run the commercial about his being a prisoner .
Ever since his involvement with Charlie Keating came to light , McCain has become a virtual commuter to the Far East .
There are no constituents out there .
But the mere fact of his flying across the ocean wins votes in Arizona .
His success stems from the fact that too many Arizonans are impressed by surface patriotism .
This state is packed with wowsers who served a year at the lowest rank in some branch of the armed forces .
They moved here because of job opportunities and the weather and now march around boasting of their stature as " veterans . "
Arizona is also a haven for retired officers who moved to Sun City so they might take advantage of the discounts at the PX on the local military bases .
This military mindset , as well as a know - nothing conservatism rivaling that of Orange County , California , has made this state a natural for McCain .
Another reason for McCain 's success in Arizona , which surpasses even Mississippi as the most backward state in the Union , is the cretinous nature of so many of this state 's native inhabitants .
Most Arizonans , even college graduates , have inadequate educations .
The school system is so abominable that even a degree from its largest institution , Arizona State University , does not necessarily mean that its bearer can read beyond a grade - school level .
This is not fantasy .
Several years ago , people were shocked to learn that Mr. Turtle Lane , a distinguished former football star at ASU , could neither read nor write .
Most Arizonans are too ignorant and afraid to consider change .
Can you , for example , think of any other state that would consider Evan Mecham a serious candidate for anything other than Saturday Night Live ?
But the secret to McCain 's success to date is that he worships the one true God worshiped by the established churches : money .
I leave out the Mormons not with any intent to offend them .
It is just that the Mormons are not a church , but a secret society that happens to love money to a greater degree than the established churches .
McCain is the perfect example of evil masquerading as good .
He made an advantageous marriage to the daughter of state beer baron Jim Hensley , the Budweiser distributor .
This made him an instant millionaire .
Hensley is a man who understands loyalty .
In his earlier days , he and his brother took falls for his then - boss Kemper Marley .
Hensley and his brother were convicted .
Their rewards were exclusive distributor territories in Phoenix and Tucson .
Since then they have become inordinately wealthy .
Marley , now deceased , was one of the state 's richest men .
His name surfaced as the power behind the 1976 car - bomb murder of Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles .
At Marley 's funeral , Frank Sinatra 's signature tune " My Way " was played by the organist over the objections of the church 's pastor .
The man responsible for this unusual tribute was Max Dunlap , whose trial for Bolles ' murder is scheduled to begin next month .
It is no longer fashionable in local journalistic circles to mention McCain 's close friendship with Charlie Keating .
It 's a shame they had a falling out .
They seemed to have so much in common and enjoyed each other 's company so much .
They met in 1981 when McCain moved to Arizona .
Keating was a World War II pilot .
McCain made nine vacation trips to Keating 's home in the Bahamas from 1984 to 1986 .
The trips were made free of charge on jets provided by Keating .
Because the ethical violation was so obvious , McCain was eventually forced to pay $ 13,433 for the flights to Keating 's company , American Continental Corporation .
He escaped ethical censure because the trips were made while he was a member of the House of Representatives and the trips did n't come to light until he was a member of the Senate , which conveniently declared it had no jurisdiction .
The House could n't act , either , for the same reason .
Keating contributed $ 112,000 to McCain 's 1982 and 1984 House campaigns and his 1986 Senate run .
McCain 's father - in - law and his wife also took advantage of the chance to make a lucrative shopping - center investment with Keating .
McCain was also a great friend of then - Arizona Republic publisher Duke Tully , who was thought to be a former Marine pilot .
The two men used to go over to Luke Air Force Base and fly jet planes together .
Tully became the godfather to McCain 's child .
When it turned out that Tully never served in the Marines , it provoked a delightful local scandal .
Tully went into exile and McCain had nothing further to do with him .
When it became apparent Keating was about to fall , McCain quickly cut ties with him , too .
Associate Professor Martin Jarvis at the Charles Darwin University claims that he has found strong evidence that the wife of Bach actually wrote many of his music pieces .
Professor Jarvis from Australia has undergone forensic training from police investigators and has applied this knowledge in an investigation of the manuscripts from Bach ’s archive of his famous music .
The evidence seems to clearly show that Anna Magdalena Wilcke , Bach ’s second wife , wrote several of the manuscripts previously credited to her famous husband , Johan Sebastian Bach .
Jarvis , who is also conductor of the Darwin Orchestra said
I do n’t doubt at least that the Cello Suites are not written by Johan Sebastian .
The professor first became suspicious about the composer ’s music when he attended the Royal Academy of Music in London .
He was convinced that there was something wrong when he was playing Bach ’s Cello Suites , and finally deconstructed the Suites to come up with 18 reasons why they were not written by Bach .
He said :
It does n’t sound musically mature .
It sounds like an exercise , and you have to work incredibly hard to make it sound like a piece of music .
Over the course of his research , he found two 1713 manuscripts in Anna Magdalena ’s handwriting .
This is significant because this is seven years before the two had ever met .
This research lead to Jarvis acquiring an actual Bach manuscript .
By using the forensic analysis that he had learned from the police training , he found the imprint of an inscription “ Ecrite par Madam Bachen ” on the manuscript ’s cover , which means “ written by Madam Bachen ”
“ So you bring all these bits together and there seems to be overwhelming evidence that she was involved , ” Jarvis said .
Being a woman at that point , there was no likelihood that she would have been recognized as a composer .
Had she remained unmarried maybe she would have been , but once she got married , it was this way for all women in society at that point , that they became the property of their husband and their intellectual property was their husband ’s too .
We have lots of other examples in music history of women getting married and then publishing the music under their husband ’s name .
We do n’t know , for example , in this great Mozart year , we do n’t know how gifted Mozart ’s sister was , Nannerl .
Was she also a composer ? ”
Bach married Anna Magdalena in 1721 and died in 1750 .
Martin Jarvis accepts there may be some hostility to his research that casts doubt on one of the world ’s most famous musicians .
But he says he ’s determined to continue his work and set the record straight .
Blizzard Entertainment announced today that the newest expansion pack for World of Warcraft , entitled Wrath of the Lich King , will be in stores on Nov. 13 , 2008 .
The expansion pack will cost $ 39.99 .

V8 祭り
ウェブっ子の間では Google Chrome の JS 処理系である V8 祭りが絶賛開催中らしい .
いつもは出遅れる私もたまにはやんやしたいと思っていろいろ読んでみたものの , VM に食傷気味な自分に気付いた . けれど , そうは言っても祭りは別腹 .
一通り騒いでみます .
販促マンガ や 資料 によれば , V8 は以下のような特徴を備えている .
hidden class transition と fast property access
generational accurate GC accurate だから incremental GC もできる オブジェクトの rellocation はするけど handle は使わず参照元書き換 え
中間表現のインタプリタなしの native code 生成 .
instruction cache
コードをみたところ , incremental GC 以外は実装されているかんじ .
incremental GC も , マンガを注意深く読むと " we can also implement incremental garbage collection " となっており , 実装したとは書いてない .
まあ広告だしね ...
広告に書いてないところで面白かった(? ) のはこんなところ :
JIT は x86 と ARM .
ARM は Android 用であろう .
ゲーム屋待望の PowerPC 版はなし .
VM 実行状態のシリアライザつき . 用途不明 .
VM のインスタンスは複数 つくれない .
YARV 風なネイティブスレッド + 単一ロックのスレッドモデル embedding には向かないし , マルチプロセスになってない普通のブラウザに組込むのも辛い気がする
特にマルチ VM ができないのはひどい .
ホストがマルチプロセスだからって今時こりゃねーよ. グローバル変数は悪ですよ. まあ Android 移植で困るだろうから , そのうち直すんだろうけどね ...
ダメなところはさておき , 面白そうなの は
JIT と instruction cache
hidden class transition
precise GC
あたりだろうか .
速いコードといったら JIT だとおもうので , そのへんを中心に hidden class transition もちらっと見るかんじを目指して読んでいきます .
コード概 観
V8 のコードはおよそ 13 万行ある . ( テストのぞく . )
これだけのコードが単一ディレクトリにまとめて入っており , モジュールの内訳がわかりにくい. とりあえず主観で分類してみよう. (...リストは長くなりすぎたので 別ページへ. ) こんなかんじになった :
共通部分 : 基本的なデータ構造 , メモリ管理 , 移植層 , ...
ホスト API : ライブラリとして呼び出すための API と実装
パーサ : JavaScript をパースして AST を作 る
オブジェクトモデル : JavaScript のオブジェクトなど , GC で管理されるオブジェクトの実 装
GC : ヒープやらマークスイープやら
JIT : 機械語生 成
ランタイム : 生成された機械語から呼び出される API .
デバッグ支援そのほ か
処理系はまずスクリプトの文字列を AST に変換する .
JIT モジュールはこの AST をトラバースし , 機械語を出力する .
出力された機械語を呼び出せば 実行スタートといった塩梅になる .
さすがにまとめてコンパイルは辛いので遅延の仕組みは入ってるっぽい.
JIT をみるためには , JIT 本体とオブジェクトモデルを眺めればいい .
メモリ管 理
...といっても季節柄メモリ管理を無視はできない.
なのでちょっとだけ .
GC がからむとメモリ管理には慎重でありたい .
V8 のメモリ管理は大きくわけて三系統ある . V8 は , メモリ管理の方法にあわせ , ある種の注釈として基底クラスを用意している. malloc ( ) / free ( ) 相当の API を使う自前メモリ管理の対象は Malloced クラスを継承する .
( allocation .h )
Malloced なクラスの数は多くない .
GC で確保するヒープは Malloced である. そりゃそうだ .
apache の memory pool のように文脈に紐づけて一括解放する場合は ZoneObject を継承する . ( zone .h ) AST のノードは ZoneObject である .
( ちなみに一括解放のコンテクストも singleton だった. まじかよ . )
GC で管理するオブジェクトは HeapObject を継承する . ( objects .h ) HeapObject のサブクラスは JS のオブジェクトや , JIT されたコードは GC で管理される .
objects.h 冒頭のコメントを見るとよい .
動的なメモリ管理の対象とならず , 他のオブジェクトに埋め込まれるクラスは
Embedded を継承する. これらのクラスは operator new ( ) , delete ( ) が呼ばれるとエラーになる .
インスタンスをつくらず , グローバル変数やそのアクセサをまとめる名前空間として使うクラスは
AllStatic を継承する .
AllStatic なクラスの多さは V8 コードベースの不吉な匂いを象徴している .
V8 のマネジドオブジェクト
GC の対象となる HeapObject は処理系のあちこちに顔をだす .
まずはこの構造を確認したい .
HeapObject は Object のサブクラスである .
Object のサブクラスにはこの他に Smi クラスがある .
HeapObject を始めとする Object の一族は C++ に反旗をひるがえす挑発的な作りになっている.
Object の一族にはメンバ変数がひとつもない . 仮想関数もない .
コンストラクタもデストラクタもない. この一族は C++ のオブジェクトモデルを完全に無視し , オブジェクトのメモリレイアウトを自分で取り仕切っている.
たとえば Array クラスには length というメンバ変数 ...があるかのようなアクセサが定義されている .
// objects.h class Array : public HeapObject { public : // [ length ] : length of the array .
inline int length ( ) ; inline void set_length ( int value ) ; ... } ;
実装はこんなマクロ :
// objects-inl.h INT_ACCESSORS( Array , length , kLengthOffset ) # define INT_ACCESSORS ( holder , name , offset ) \ int holder : : name ( ) { return READ_INT_FIELD ( this , offset ) ; } \ void holder : : set_##name( int value ) { WRITE_INT_FIELD ( this , offset , value ) ; } ... # define READ_INT_FIELD( p , offset ) \ ( * reinterpret_cast < int * >( FIELD_ADDR ( p , offset ) ) ) # define WRITE_INT_FIELD( p , offset , value ) \ ( * reinterpret_cast < int * >( FIELD_ADDR ( p , offset ) ) = value ) ... # define FIELD_ADDR ( p , offset ) \ ( reinterpret_cast < byte * > ( p ) + offset - kHeapObjectTag )
this のアドレスに適当なオフセットを足して該当の型にキャストしている .
要するにふつうコンパイラがやってくれることを自分でやっている.
初期化もコンストラクタなんて軟弱なものは使わない:
// heap.cc Object * Heap :: AllocateFixedArray( int length , PretenureFlag pretenure ) { ... int size = FixedArray :: SizeFor( length ) ; Object * result ; ... result = AllocateRaw ( size , space ) ; ... // Initialize the object .
reinterpret_cast < Array *>( result ) ->set_map(fixed_array_map ( ) ) ; FixedArray * array = FixedArray : : cast ( result ) ; array -> set_length( length ) ; for ( int index = 0 ; index < length ; index ++ ) array -> set_undefined ( index ) ; return array ; }
GC 用のヒープから必要なメモリを確保し , そのあと初期化している .
バイト列を自分で直接操作するのは , メモリレイアウトを完全に把握して precise GC をするためだろう . ただ C++ への愛があれば pragma でパディングを制御しつつ operator new ( ) で GC のヒープを確保することもできたはず. V8 の書き手は C++ があまり好きじゃないんだろうね.
V8 は Ruby と同様 , 整数値はヒープにとらずポインタに埋め込む .
だから 整数値をあらわす Smi ( small integer ) クラスのコードは少し面白いことになる .
// objects - inl.h int Smi::value ( ) { return reinterpret_cast < int >( this ) >>
kSmiTagSize ; }
ポインタからタグビットを削っている. this をシフトするコードってはじめてみたよ ...
ポインタワードには整 数( smi ) か HeapObject かエラー値が含まれており , 下位のタグビットでそれを判別する .
タグビットのレイアウトは以下のとおり:
// objects.h // Formats of Object* : // Smi : [ 31 bit signed int ]
0 // HeapObject : [ 32 bit direct pointer ] ( 4 byte aligned ) | 01 // Failure : [ 30 bit signed int ] 11
よくみると , 先に登場し た FIELD_ADDR ( ) の定義でタグビッ ト( kHeapObjectTag ) を除去しているのがわかる .
オブジェクトの型情報 : Map オブジェク ト
HeapObject の先頭ワードは常に Map オブジェクトを指している .
Map オブジェクト は
Class みたいなもので , 該当オブジェクトのレイアウト情報などを持っている .
宣伝文句で hidden class と呼んでいるものの実体はこ の
Map クラスである .
( 資料のリンクをたどると , Map という名前 は Self 由来であることがわかる . )
// objects.h class Map : public HeapObject { public : // instance size . inline int instance_size ( ) ; inline void set_instance_size ( int value ) ; // instance type. inline InstanceType instance_type( ) ; inline void set_instance_type( InstanceType value ) ; ... // [ prototype ] : implicit prototype object .
DECL_ACCESSORS ( prototype , Object ) // [ constructor ] : points back to the function responsible for this map .
DECL_ACCESSORS ( constructor , Object ) // [ instance descriptors ] : describes the object .
DECL_ACCESSORS(instance_descriptors , DescriptorArray ) // [ stub cache ] : contains stubs compiled for this map .
DECL_ACCESSORS ( code_cache , FixedArray ) ... } ;
いかにも型情報っぽい .
マークビッ ト
V8 の元ねたになった Strongtalk VM では先頭ワードに GC のマークビットなどが入っており , Map を指すのは二番目のワードだったらしい .
V8 では 先頭ワードの下位ビットをマークビットに使うことで 1 ワードの節約に成功している .
( Strongtalk の ML でも小ささを自慢している . )
Map を挿す先頭ワードのためにわざわざラッパクラスまである .
//objects.h class MapWord BASE_EMBEDDED
{ public : // Normal state : the map word contains a map pointer .
//
Create a map word from a map pointer .
.. static inline MapWord FromMap ( Map* map ) ; //
View this map word as a map pointer .
inline Map* ToMap( ) ; ... //
Return this map word but with its mark bit set .
inline void SetMark ( ) ; //
Return this map word but with its mark bit cleared .
inline void ClearMark ( ) ; ... explicit MapWord ( uintptr_t value ) : value_( value ) {} uintptr_t value_ ; ... } ;
// objects-inl.h void MapWord :: SetMark ( ) { value_ &= ~ kMarkingMask ; } ... void MapWord :: ClearMark ( ) { value_ |= kMarkingMask ; }
全体の荒々しさと比べて抽象の粒度がちぐはぐな気はするけど , そこはこだわりの現れなのかも .
Map , オブジェクトレイアウト , Precise GC
2 ワード目以降のレイアウトはオブジェクトの型によってことなる.
先頭ワードの Map オブジェクトを参照することで型がわかり , 型からレイアウトを知ることができる .
要するにダウンキャストできる .
GC もこの型情報を利用してオブジェクトグラフをトラバースする .
( mark - sweep の mark とかね . ) オジェクトグラフのトラバースには Visitor パターン , ObjectVisitor が使われる .
HeapObject が visit 用 API を用意している :
// object.cc void HeapObject :: Iterate ( ObjectVisitor * v ) { // Handle header IteratePointer( v , kMapOffset ) ; // Handle object body Map* m = map ( ) ; IterateBody (m->instance_type( ) , SizeFromMap(m ) , v ) ; } void HeapObject :: IterateBody ( InstanceType type , int object_size , ObjectVisitor * v ) { ... switch ( type ) { case FIXED_ARRAY_TYPE : reinterpret_cast < FixedArray *>( this )-> FixedArrayIterateBody( v ) ; break ; case JS_OBJECT_TYPE : case JS_VALUE_TYPE : case JS_ARRAY_TYPE : case JS_FUNCTION_TYPE : case JS_GLOBAL_OBJECT_TYPE : reinterpret_cast<JSObject *>( this ) -> JSObjectIterateBody ( object_size , v ) ; break ; case JS_BUILTINS_OBJECT_TYPE : reinterpret_cast<JSObject *>( this ) -> JSObjectIterateBody ( object_size , v ) ; break ; case ODDBALL_TYPE : reinterpret_cast < Oddball *>( this ) -> OddballIterateBody( v ) ; break ; case PROXY_TYPE : reinterpret_cast < Proxy *>( this ) -> ProxyIterateBody( v ) ; break ; case MAP_TYPE : reinterpret_cast < Map *>( this )->MapIterateBody( v ) ; break ; case CODE_TYPE : reinterpret_cast < Code *>( this ) -> CodeIterateBody( v ) ; break ; .... default : PrintF ( " Unknown type : %d
" , type ) ; UNREACHABLE ( ) ; } } } ... void JSObject ::JSObjectIterateBody( int object_size , ObjectVisitor * v ) { //
Iterate over all fields in the body .
Assumes all are Object*. IteratePointers ( v , kPropertiesOffset , object_size ) ; } ... void HeapObject :: IteratePointers ( ObjectVisitor* v , int start , int end ) { v->VisitPointers(reinterpret_cast < Object **>( FIELD_ADDR ( this , start ) ) , reinterpret_cast < Object **>( FIELD_ADDR ( this , end ) ) ) ; }
オブジェクトが自己申告するならそりゃ precise だよね .
GC の起点となる グローバル変数やスタックフレームにも , ObjectVisitor がトラバースするための API がある .
オブジェクトのプロパティ
V8 の目玉の一つにプロパティアクセスの高速化がある . 従来の JavaScript 処理系は , プロパティをインスタンス単位のハッシュテーブルに保存していた.
V8 は " fast mode " と銘打って , ハッシュではなく配列にプロパティを保存することができる.
// objects-inl.h ACCESSORS( JSObject , properties , FixedArray , kPropertiesOffset )
ここでは properties フィールドの型は FixedArray ( 配列 ) と宣言されているが , モードによっては Dictionary ( =ハッシュ ) が含まれることもある .
このように配列を使うかハッシュを使うかは排他である.
どちらを使っているかは上の properties フィールドに代入されているオブジェクトの型情報( Map ) でわかる .
bool JSObject ::HasFastProperties ( ) { return ! properties ( ) -> IsDictionary ( ) ; } ... bool Object : : IsDictionary ( ) { return IsHashTable ( ) && this != Heap::symbol_table ( ) ; } ... bool Object :: IsHashTable ( ) { return Object :: IsHeapObject ( ) && HeapObject :: cast ( this ) -> map ( ) == Heap ::hash_table_map( ) ; } ... bool Object :: IsHeapObject ( ) { return HAS_HEAP_OBJECT_TAG ( this ) ; }
配列のインデクスとプロパティ名の関係は , インスタンスに対応する Map オブジェクトの instance_descriptors フィールドに記録されている .
instance_descriptors はプロパティの情報を示す Descriptor オブジェクトの配列である .
// objects.h class Map : public HeapObject { public : // [ instance descriptors ] : describes the object .
DECL_ACCESSORS(instance_descriptors , DescriptorArray ) ... } ;
// objects.h class Descriptor BASE_EMBEDDED
{ public : ... private : String * key_ ; // プロパティ名 Object * value_ ; // 配列内のインデクス PropertyDetails details_ ; // ReadOnly , DontDelete , DontEnum などのフラグ詰め合せ } ;
Dictionary を使うのはプロパティ数が多すぎる時など限られた場面のようなので , 以下ではもっぱら配列のケースだけに注目して話を進める .
プロパティの get と set をそれぞれ見てみよう .
まず get から
// なぜか JSObject じゃなくて Object のメソッド .
Object * Object :: GetProperty ( String* key ) { PropertyAttributes attributes ; return GetPropertyWithReceiver ( this , key , &attributes ) ; } ... Object * Object::GetPropertyWithReceiver( Object* receiver , String * name , PropertyAttributes * attributes ) { LookupResult result ; Lookup ( name , &result ) ; return GetProperty ( receiver , &result , name , attributes ) ; } ... Object * Object :: GetProperty ( Object * receiver , LookupResult * result , String * name , PropertyAttributes * attributes ) { ... if ( ! result ->IsProperty ( ) ) { // プロパティがなかった...
* attributes = ABSENT ; return Heap::undefined_value( ) ; } ... Object * value ; JSObject * holder = result -> holder ( ) ; switch ( result -> type ( ) ) { case NORMAL : // ハッシュを引く場合 value = holder ->property_dictionary ( )->ValueAt( result->GetDictionaryEntry ( ) ) ; ASSERT (!value -> IsTheHole ( ) || result -> IsReadOnly ( ) ) ; return value -> IsTheHole ( ) ?
Heap::undefined_value( ) : value ; case FIELD : // 配列アクセスの場合 value = holder -> properties ( )-> get ( result->GetFieldIndex ( ) ) ; // インデクスでとれる ASSERT (!value -> IsTheHole ( ) || result -> IsReadOnly ( ) ) ; return value -> IsTheHole ( ) ?
Heap::undefined_value( ) : value ; ... default : UNREACHABLE ( ) ; return NULL ; } }
set .
Object * JSObject ::SetProperty ( String* name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { LookupResult result ; LocalLookup ( name , &result ) ; return SetProperty ( &result , name , value , attributes ) ; }
Object * JSObject ::SetProperty ( LookupResult* result , String * name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { ... switch ( result -> type ( ) ) { case NORMAL : // ハッシュの場合 . property_dictionary ( )->ValueAtPut( result->GetDictionaryEntry ( ) , value ) ; return value ; case FIELD : // 配列の場合 properties ( ) -> set ( result -> GetFieldIndex ( ) , value ) ; return value ; ... default : UNREACHABLE ( ) ; } UNREACHABLE ( ) ; return value ; }
雰囲気はわかった( よね? ) けれど , 疑問もある .
たとえば ...:
Map が型情報だとして , どうやってオブジェクトの型を決めるの？ マンガにあった hidden class の話はどうなったの ?
配列に保存するのはいいとして , Lookup ( ) でプロパティ名の文字列から配列の添字( インデクス)を検索すると遅いんじゃない?
とりあえず一つ目から片付けていきたい .
隠れクラスの実現 : Map Transition
オブジェクトの型情報である Map クラスのインスタンスはまず , 同じコンストラクタ関数を持つオブジェクト間で共有される .
つまり同じコンストラクタをもてば同じ型だとみなされる.
関数オブジェクトは自身が construct するオブジェクトに登録する Map オブジェクトを , 自分の Map とは別に持っている .
実行時にプロパティが増えるとオブジェクト内のプロパティのレイアウト(=どんな名前のプロパティがいくつあるか)が変わる.
Map にはプロパティのレイアウトが記述されているから , それが変わると同 じ Map を使えなくなる .
このときオブジェクトは新しい
Map を作り , 自分に登録する .
この仕組みを Map Transition と呼ぶようだ .
要するにプロパティが増減すると型が変わるわけ.
function Hello( ) { this .
foo = 1 ; this .bar = 2 ; } var hell o1 = new Hello( ) ; var hell o2 = new Hello ( ) ; // hell o1 と hell o2 は Map を共有 : 生成元のコンストラクタが同じ .
hello1.baz = 3 ; // hell o1 の Map は baz を含む新し い
Map に差しかわり , hell o2 とは別マップを参照する .
コードはこんなの :
// objects.cc Object * JSObject ::SetProperty ( String* name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { LookupResult result ; LocalLookup ( name , &result ) ; return SetProperty ( &result , name , value , attributes ) ; // ここにすすむ }
Object * JSObject ::SetProperty ( LookupResult* result , String * name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { .... if ( result -> IsNotFound ( ) ) { return AddProperty ( name , value , attributes ) ; // ここにすすむ } .... } Object * JSObject :: AddProperty ( String * name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { if ( HasFastProperties ( ) ) { //
Ensure the descriptor array does not get too big .
if ( map ( )->instance_descriptors ()->number_of_descriptors ( ) < DescriptorArray :: kMaxNumberOfDescriptors ) { ... return AddFastProperty ( name , value , attributes ) ; // ここにすすむ } } else ...{ } } ... }
ようやく本題 :
Object * JSObject :: AddFastProperty ( String* name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { ... DescriptorArray * old_descriptors = map()->instance_descriptors ( ) ; ... //
Compute the new index for new field .
int index = map ( ) -> NextFreePropertyIndex ( ) ; ... //
Allocate new instance descriptors with ( name , index ) added // プロパティの Descriptor を追加した新しい DescriptorArray をつくる FieldDescriptor new_field ( name , index , attributes ) ; Object * new_descriptors = old_descriptors->CopyInsert( &new_field , REMOVE_TRANSITIONS ) ; ... if ( map ( )->unused_property_fields ( ) >
0 ) { ASSERT ( index < properties ( ) -> length ( ) ) ; //
Allocate a new map for the object .
// Map も新しいのを作る Object * r = map ( )-> Copy ( ) ; Map* new_map = Map :: cast ( r ) ; ... //
We have now allocated all the necessary objects .
//
All the changes can be applied at once , so they are atomic .
... // 新しい Map に新しい DescriptorArray を挿し ... new_map->set_instance_descriptors( DescriptorArray::cast( new_descriptors ) ) ; new_map->set_unused_property_fields(map()->unused_property_fields ( ) - 1 ) ; // それを自分にセットする set_map( new_map ) ; // プロパティも忘れず追加. properties ( ) -> set ( index , value ) ; } else { ... } return value ; }
さて , 一つ気になることがある .
同じコンストラクタを持てば Map が共有されるとして , コンストラクタの中でプロパティが追加されたら何がおこるのだろう.
追加のたびに Map ができてしまったら , 空のオブジェクト以外はみな違う Map を持つことになってしまう .
( つまり大半のオブジェクトが違う型になってしまう. ) それじゃ台無しだ .
コンストラクタ内のプロパティアクセスは特別扱い...なんてのも苦しい.
継承なんかもあるし...
V8 の Map Transition は , この問題をうまく扱っている .
transit 前の Map に , " この Map にはプロパティが追加されて新しい Map ができたよ " というマークを 残しておくのだ. 先の AddFastProperty ( ) のコードで " ... " と省略していた場所に , 実はその仕組みが潜んでいる .
省略箇所を変えて引用しなおし :
Object * JSObject :: AddFastProperty ( String* name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { ... //
Compute the new index for new field .
int index = map ( )-> NextFreePropertyIndex ( ) ; // Allocate new instance descriptors with ( name , index ) added FieldDescriptor new_field ( name , index , attributes ) ; Object * new_descriptors = old_descriptors->CopyInsert( &new_field , REMOVE_TRANSITIONS ) ; ... if ( map ( )->unused_property_fields ( ) >
0 ) { ASSERT ( index < properties ( ) -> length ( ) ) ; //
Allocate a new map for the object .
Object * r = map ( ) -> Copy ( ) ; if ( r -> IsFailure ( ) ) return r; Map* new_map = Map :: cast (r ) ; if ( allow_map_transition ) { // ある所定の条件を満たすなら... //
Allocate new instance descriptors for the old map with map transition .
// 古い( 既存の ) DescriptorArray に " MapTransitionDescriptor " を追加する MapTransitionDescriptor d( name , Map: : cast ( new_map ) , attributes ) ; Object * r = old_descriptors ->CopyInsert( &d , KEEP_TRANSITIONS ) ; ... old_descriptors = DescriptorArray : : cast (r ) ; } // 既存の Map の DescriptorArray を MapTransitionDescriptor を追加したものに差し替える map()->set_instance_descriptors(old_descriptors ) ; // あとはこれまでどおり new_map->set_instance_descriptors(DescriptorArray::cast( new_descriptors ) ) ; new_map->set_unused_property_fields(map()->unused_property_fields ( ) - 1 ) ; set_map ( new_map ) ; properties ( ) -> set ( index , value ) ; } else { ... } return value ; }
MapTransitionDescriptor が問題の " マーク " .
この MapTransitionDescriptor には , 追加されたプロパティ名と transit 先の Map , そして " transit した " という事実を表すフラグが入っている .
class MapTransitionDescriptor : public Descriptor { public : MapTransitionDescriptor ( String * key , Map* map , PropertyAttributes attributes ) : Descriptor ( key , map , attributes , MAP_TRANSITION ) { } } ;
JSObject :: SetProperty ( ) がこのマークをみつけたら , 新しい Map を作るかわりに transit 先の Map を使いつつプロパティを登録する .
Object * JSObject ::SetProperty ( LookupResult* result , String * name , Object * value , PropertyAttributes attributes ) { ... switch ( result -> type ( ) ) { case NORMAL : ... case FIELD : ... case MAP_TRANSITION : // マーク発見! if ( attributes == result->GetAttributes ( ) ) { //
Only use map transition if the attributes match .
// マークを使ってプロパティを追加!
return AddFastPropertyUsingMap( result->GetTransitionMap( ) , name , value ) ; } else { // Map を再利用できないこともある ... return AddFastProperty ( name , value , attributes ) ; } ... default : UNREACHABLE ( ) ; } UNREACHABLE ( ) ; return value ; } ... Object * JSObject ::AddFastPropertyUsingMap( Map* new_map , String * name , Object* value ) { int index = new_map->PropertyIndexFor( name ) ; if ( map ( )->unused_property_fields ( ) >
0 ) { ASSERT ( index < properties ( ) -> length ( ) ) ; properties ( ) -> set ( index , value ) ; // プロパティを追加しつつ... } else { ... } set_map ( new_map ) ; // 与えられた Map に transit !
return value ; }
こうしてめでたく Map が共有された .
なんとなく transit 元から " 継承 " されたクラスができるかんじだね .
こうした追跡の仕組みがあるなら , コンストラクタ毎に最初の Map をわける必要はないようにも思える .
ただ全てのオブジェクトで最初の Map を共有してしまうと , 最初 Map には大量の MapTransitionDescriptor が登録されてしまう .
これは性能上都合が悪そうだ .
だからコンストラクタ単位で分割しているのだろう.
型付け , JIT , instruction cache ( はまた今度 )
hidden class の謎が解けたところで , もう一つ疑問が残っていた : " DescriptorArray から配列インデクスを検索すると遅いじゃん ? " これはまったくそのとおりで , 上の JSObject :: GetProperty ( ) や JSObject :: SetProperty ( ) は どう見ても速いはずがない .
かわりに Map オブジェクトを活用した JIT の仕組みが快速アクセスを実現する .
...のだけれど今日はもう力尽きました. コードひどすぎ. 続きはそのうち .
What 's happening in the Middle East , then , is n't just another chapter in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
What 's happening is an Islamist - Israeli war .
You might even say this is part of the Islamist war on the West - - but is India part of the West ?
Better to say that what 's under attack is liberal democratic civilization , whose leading representative right now happens to be the United States .
. . .
The war against radical Islamism is likely to be a long one .
Radical Islamism is n't going away anytime soon .
But it will make a big difference how strong the state sponsors , harborers , and financiers of radical Islamism are .
Thus , our focus should be less on Hamas and Hezbollah , and more on their paymasters and real commanders -- Syria and Iran .
And our focus should be not only on the regional war in the Middle East , but also on the global struggle against radical Islamism .
For while Syria and Iran are enemies of Israel , they are also enemies of the United States .
We have done a poor job of standing up to them and weakening them .
They are now testing us more boldly than one would have thought possible a few years ago .
Weakness is provocative .
We have been too weak , and have allowed ourselves to be perceived as weak .
. . .
The right response is renewed strength -- in supporting the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan , in standing with Israel , and in pursuing regime change in Syria and Iran .
For that matter , we might consider countering this act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities .
Why wait ?
But such a military strike would take a while to organize .
In the meantime , perhaps President Bush can fly from the silly G8 summit in St. Petersburg -- a summit that will most likely convey a message of moral confusion and political indecision -- to Jerusalem , the capital of a nation that stands with us , and is willing to fight with us , against our common enemies .
This is our war , too .
But we have not heard anything about " seizing the moment . "
We hear lawyer talk and diplotalk , surrender talk and appeasement talk , and there is no action whatsoever .
Is this not the time to go after the terrorist training camps in Syria and Iran ?
What in the world are we waiting for ?
And finally , if we dither through this one , the next one will be worse .
Maybe much worse .
It 's not going away .
Stability is a mirage .
Chamberlain had a choice between dishonor and war .
He chose war and got dishonor .
You too , Mr. President .
It 's the way it works .
Robert Satloff 's analysis in the new issue of the Weekly Standard anticipates the direct Iranian involvement in the conflict : . . . .
Defeat for Israel - - either on the battlefield or via coerced compromises to achieve flawed cease - fires -- is a defeat for U.S. interests ; it will inspire radicals of every stripe , release Iran and Syria to spread more mayhem inside Iraq , and make more likely our own eventual confrontation with this emboldened alliance of extremists .

EAGLEBURGER : Finally , I would say so long as the Iranians can put arms into -- into Hezbollah through Syria , I think we have a continuing problem .
And I , for a long time have felt we had to get much tougher with the Syrians than we are now .
It may be that the Iraq issue has made it more difficult for us to get tough .
But the Syrians ...
BLITZER : What does that mean , Mr. Secretary ...
EAGLEBURGER : Well , what it means to me is that we , for one thing , ought to be putting real pressure on their border with Iraq more than we are , and I think putting economic pressure on them .
And frankly , I do n't care as well , if we go in along with the Israelis and drop a few bombs on them .
A very significant development is occurring in how neoconservatives are discussing America 's responsibilities in the Middle East : they are now expressly advocating , far more openly than ever before , that Israel 's enemies are America 's enemies , and that the war which Israel is now fighting is also America 's war -- one in which America should immediately intervene .
I will write my own reactions to this view later , but for now , I want to simply document the emergence of this argument in very influential circles .
In the past , neoconservatives have danced delicately around the notion that Israel 's conflicts should be viewed by the U.S. as its own conflicts .
But , to his credit , Bill Kristol yesterday came right out and candidly put his views on the table .
In the Weekly Standard , Kristol 's column -- entitled " This is Our War " ( by " Our " he means the U.S. ) -- argues explicitly what many have contended for some time is an unstated belief of neoconservatives : that the U.S. should view the threats to Israel as threats to the U.S. , because the enemy is the same , and should join Israel in the destruction of these enemies .
Kristol actually argues that President Bush should immediately abandon the G - 8 summit in Russia and fly to Jerusalem in order to stand by Israel , in " our " new war , which should be waged against Iran , Syria and Hezbollah , for starters .
This article is very significant and I am quoting from it at length : Bill Kristol is one of the most influential neonconservative pundits in the country , if not the most influential , and the fact that he is openly advocating this world - view means that we will be seeing much more of it from the neoconservative precincts which led us into the invasion of Iraq .
Already , John Podhoretz in National Review is excitedly celebrating Kristol 's argument , and Michael Ledeen is already complaining that the Administration has n't yet thrown the U.S. militarily into this new war , where we have whole new enemies -- Iran and Syria -- waiting to be attacked :
And then , from John Hinderaker at Powerline , where the excitement over this conflict is palpable -- they really think this is , finally , our big chance to expand our war beyond Iraq , where things are going really well , into Syria and Iran -- we find this
It should go without saying that one can believe that Israel is within its rights to defend itself against Hezbollah without also believing that the U.S. should become involved in this extraordinarily flammable conflict .
But these neoconservatives do n't recognize that distinction .
As they are now expressly arguing , Israel 's enemies are America 's enemies , and this war being waged by Israel ought to become America 's war -- and the sooner the better .
I believe it is obvious to most Americans , who have turned completely on the war in Iraq , that it is sheer lunacy to expand that failed war effort to now include American war on even more countries -- including more powerful ones with more powerful allies , such as Iran -- let alone to do so as part of , and in the middle of , an Arab - Israeli war .
But if there is one lesson that we ought to have learned over the past several years , it is that there is no militaristic proposal too crazed or extremist to be undertaken by this administration .
And anyone who thinks that these neoconservatives now lack real influence within the Bush administration is sorely mistaken . :
At Obsidian Wings , Hilzoy has a thoughtful and lengthy analysis of the new war in the Middle East .
Without endorsing all of its particulars , she presents a balanced and rational view of what is motivating each party , something which is quite difficult to do for most people when writing about that region . :
I also read this analysis of the Middle East conflict by Billmon yesterday and meant to link to it , because it is superb ( again , without necessarily agreeing with each of its claims ) , and was just reminded to do so by someone who mentioned it in Comments .
And I equally recommend Billmon 's second post from yesterday on the surprising military adeptness of Hezbollah thus far and what that means for Israel and the region . :
Nobody should take comfort in thinking that a desire for the U.S. to intervene in Israel 's war is confined to extremist neoconservative circles .
Here is Bush 41 Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger -- generally considered a grown - up foreign policy adult -- with Wolf Blitzer yesterday ( h/t Elton Beard via e-mail ) :
The mindless casualness with which such people blithely advocate starting a new war -- like it's no different that deciding what one will eat for dinner tomorrow -- is breathtaking .
There is an influential and determined minority out there craving U.S. intervention in this war .
They are searching for any means to expand the war in Iraq to additional countries , all as part of our Epic War of Civilizations , and given their past success in inducing the U.S. to invade Iraq , I think it 's a mistake to assume that what they are advocating is too extreme and self - evidently disastrous to become a reality .
