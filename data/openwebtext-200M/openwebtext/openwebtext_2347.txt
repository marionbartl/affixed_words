As I look around the blogosphere , and view memeorandum , it occurred to me that we may have hit and passed Peak Wingnut .
Do n’t get me wrong , this election is still not over and by no means in the bag , but as I read things , the hey day of modern wingnuttia may have passed .
Sure , there is still lots going on - the Obama smears have been fast and furious , and there are lots of current attempts to mainstream nonsense ( a solid example would be Jonah ’s market analysis ) , but it all seems so yesterday .
These days , there seem to be more than enough outlets to rebut the bullshit , the media is tired of being treated like morons , and the Democrats seem for once ready and itching for a fight .
But most of all , the attempts just seem so feeble .
In the past few days we have seen Red State put a front page post up about Obama ’s birth certificate and NRO ’s Andy McCarthy tried to convince us that William Ayers ghost wrote Obama ’s books , but for the most part , they gained no traction and were laughed off by everyone .
I was one of the early ones to snap out of things and come to my senses and Andrew Sullivan has all but tattooed Obamanation on his chest , but even more telling , folks like David Frum , Kathleen Parker , Chris Buckley , and Chris Hitchens have all jumped ship .
Now granted , there are still some diehards - just today Mark Steyn and K - Lo were chastising David “ Axis of Evil ” Frum for insufficient fealty to the cause , but it really does feel like we have reached and surpassed Peak Wingnut .
Nothing like two wars , an economic meltdown , and Sarah Palin to bring clarity to the debate .
All that seems left are the really embattled dead - enders , and we know from WWII that some soldiers can go on fighting the same old battles forever .
The question now for historians and bloggers alike is to approximate the closest estimate of the date at which it peaked .
So , the questions for you all :
Have we surpassed Peak Wingnut ?
When did it happen ?
What event most clearly demonstrates we have passed Peak Wingnut ?
Or is this premise completely flawed , and wingnut is a renewable resource and will experience a dramatic surge on the first day of an Obama Presidency ?
Discuss .
*** Update ***
Never mind , via the comments , I see I spoke too soon .
Eager to spread a National Enquirer rumor that Obama had gay , anal , black on black pedophile sex as a ten year old ( btw - the correct term is not “ affair ” but “ molested ” ) , Erick at Red State writes the following in yet another one of those special front page posts we have grown to love :
The National Enquirer now suggests Barack Obama had an underage , gay affair with a pedophile .
Yup .
That Frank Marshall Davis guy Barry says was his good friend ?
Turns out he was a perv of the first order and liked young boys .
This post is not intended to spread that rumor .
Frankly , if Obama wins , we ’ll have our hands full around here making sure folks do n’t develop Obama Derangement Syndrome .
Not designed to spread the rumor ?
And develop Obama Derangement Syndrome ?
You do n’t have it now ?
Ignore all my questions from above - wingnut is a renewable resource .
Peak Wingnut was the shortest lived “ theory ” ever .
I eagerly await learning how this was all a joke ( hahaha ) .
And for the record , I really do n’t remember a lot of liberals running around embracing the Palin / National Enquirer story .
In fact , what I remember is certain folks , in the aftermath of the Edwards / Enquirer nonsense suddenly amazed that regarding Palin , the Enquirer was now no longer reliable .
I avoided all of the Palin absurdities with regards to the Enquirer .
Ugh .

With Henry Paulson on record that he would not continue past the Bush term as Treasury Secretary , debate moderator Tom Brokaw asked who the candidates would choose as a Treasury Secretary .
McCain 's response :
You know that ’s a tough question , and there ’s a lot of qualified Americans .
But I think the first criteria , Tom , would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with .
Immediately say we can trust that individual .
Supporter of Sen. Obama ’s is Warren Buffet .
He ’s already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations , institutions today .
I like Meg Whitman .
She knows what it ’s like to be out there in the marketplace .
She knows how to create jobs .
Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and now , 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay .
Maybe someone here has done business with them .
But the point is , it ’s going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence .
Confidence ?
Hmmmmm .... I guess McCain did n't read today 's LA Times :
Online retailer EBay Inc. , which is trying to reverse years of slowing growth in its auction business amid rising competition and a spreading financial crisis , said Monday that it would cut 10 % of its global workforce even as it spends $ 1.3 billion to buy three Web businesses .
Even after announcing the largest reduction in its 13 - year history , which EBay said would save $ 150 million in annual operating costs , the San Jose company saw its shares tumble by as much as 12 % to their lowest level in more than five years .
They recovered to close at $ 17.89 , down 5.5 % .
Investors are concerned that EBay 's bread and butter , online auctions , is showing increasing vulnerability to slowing consumer spending , the slumping U.S. housing market and high fuel prices .[..]
Although EBay said the layoffs ( of about 1,000 full time employees ) were not a result of the economic downturn , Chief Executive John Donahoe acknowledged that the weakening economy and the strengthening dollar were affecting sales .
Donahoe , who took the reins from Meg Whitman in March , has been trying to lead a corporate overhaul .
Yeah , that inspires confidence , does n't it ?
But I 'm curious , as the Obama debate record site shows , McCain has mentioned his good friend Phil Gramm several times as a likely Treasury Secretary .
Wonder why he did n't bring him up last night ?
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -
It 's a question that comes up whenever anyone of African - American descent is a candidate for office , and this year is no exception : is the so - called " Bradley effect " going to play a role in the 2008 presidential race ?
Many pollsters doubt it , and think there 's an even more fundamental question to be asked - whether there ever was such a phenomenon .
If there was , they seriously doubt that with all the time that has passed since the late Tom Bradley lost a close gubernatorial race in California 26 years ago - despite being ahead in late polls - that it will play a significant role when the time comes to pull the lever for Barack Obama or John McCain Nov. 4 .
" I think the evidence is very mixed on whether the [ effect ] occurs , " said Frank Newport , editor - in - chief of the Gallup Poll .
" There may be a rare effect , but that does n't affect our surveys . "
Not even Rev. Al Sharpton , caught briefly at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August , thinks it will play much of a role .
" We 're always concerned , but I have no particular concerns about the Bradley effect , " Sharpton said .
" I think [ voters ] have [ evolved ] .
We 'll see how far , but I think they have . "
One - third negative
To be sure , the question of race is bound to rear its head again , at least in some measure .
A recent poll conducted by Associated Press and Yahoo News said that one - third of white Democrats harbor at least some negative views toward blacks .
As a result , several million voters could turn away from Obama because of his race , the poll said , with as much as 6 % to 7 % of the electorate picking another option for president purely based on that issue .
With the presidency on the line , voters with anti-black sentiments may feel determined to send Obama down to defeat , reasoning that too much is at stake for them to stray from past voting practices .
Obama , whose father was Kenyan and mother was white , has a lead over McCain that is slowly growing , and is anywhere from 7 % to 8 % , according to various estimates .
The central question , however , is whether voters will be truthful when pollsters ask who they plan to pick in November , a key element of the Bradley effect .
It reasons that some self - conscious voters were afraid to reveal their true sentiments when asked by pollsters for whom they would vote .
That very question causes some to pause and reflect : why would voters lie to anonymous pollsters ?
Why would n't voters simply just say they support the white candidate without further explanation ?
" I do n't know , " said Gallup 's Newport .
" That 's why I do n't think there 's any evidence to support it . "
1982 race
The Bradley effect got its name when the African - American mayor of Los Angeles ran against Republican George Deukmejian in the state 's gubernatorial race in 1982 .
In polls just prior to Election Day , Bradley was shown to have a comfortable lead of more than 5 percentage points .
It seemed a foregone conclusion that Bradley , who died 10 years ago this last Monday , would become the first African - American to win a governor 's race in the nation .
Newspapers and magazines reportedly fashioned covers touting the milestone , but they jumped the gun .
When the polls closed on Nov. 2 of that year , it was determined that Bradley lost to Deukmejian by less than 100,000 votes out of nearly 7.9 million ballots cast .
Afterward , there were concerns that voters misled pollsters by insisting they would vote for Bradley in surveys , but changed their tune when push came to shove in the voting booth .
Mark DiCamillo , now the director of the San Francisco - based Field Poll , one of the most widely used California polling institutions , remembers the incident well .
Field had projected Bradley to win by at least five percent over Deukmejian .
" I 'd been at Field for only two years .
I thought I was going to be fired , " DiCamillo said .
Small role
The Field Poll was n't alone in predicting a relatively easy Bradley victory .
And as it turned out , race played only a small portion in Bradley 's defeat , if any , DiCamillo said .
Field did a white paper dissecting what happened three months after the fact , and discovered that if voters had concealed their true intentions , it might have only affected 1 or 2 % of the vote at the most .
It was more a perfect storm of activity that doomed Bradley in the voting booth , all of which worked against him , DiCamillo said .
That 's unusual in that mitigating factors tend to offset each other in elections ; in this case all worked against one candidate .
First , there was a handgun initiative on the ballot in that election , bringing out an unusually heavy Republican vote in the election , he said .
There also was a lower - than - usual turnout from minority voters .
Another factor that puts holes in the Bradley effect theory is that he won the race at the polls .
But an unusually high number of absentee ballots - with more than 300,000 or nearly 60 % - were cast for Deukmejian .
A relaxing of rules on absentee voting made for an unpredictably high number of Republicans casting ballots away from their precincts .
Had any one of those factors not played a part in the election , Bradley would have emerged victorious , Di Camillo contends .
" It was a classic upset , with eggs on pollsters ' faces up and down , " he said .
Other examples
Still , some pollsters believe the Bradley effect was real .
African - American Douglas Wilder barely squeaked out a victory in Virginia 's 1989 gubernatorial race by less than half a percentage point despite holding a nine - point lead just before the election .
The phenomenon actually is sometimes called the Wilder effect .
There are other examples , such as Harold Washington 's four - point victory in the 1983 Chicago mayoral race despite a double - digit lead in polls , and David Dinkins ' two - point victory over Rudy Giuliani in 1989 to be New York 's mayor despite a 14 - point margin in late polls .
" People do n't like to admit they 're prejudiced , " said Maurice Carroll , director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
He agrees , though , that the electorate has evolved to the point where any such effect should be minimal .
Indeed , a number of multi-racial contests since those races seem to indicate a minimal racial impact .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , an Indian - American , was thought to have lost a 2003 runoff in the gubernatorial race due to the Bradley effect , but he ended up winning four years later by a wider margin than polls showed .
Harold Ford , an African - American , lost by a slim margin in the Tennessee U.S. Senate race to white candidate Bob Corker , but exit polls showed that white voters who actually cast ballots for Ford were close percentage - wise to what earlier polling showed .
Some pollsters believe that the electorate has evolved to the point where there could be a " reverse Bradley effect . "
Young voters who could show up en masse in support of Obama may not be getting counted in polls , particularly if they use only cell phones and do n't have land lines .
" What we have to do is make sure we have enough young people in our polls , " said Scott Rasmussen , whose firm Rasmussen Reports conducts daily polling on the presidential race , concurs .
He adds that younger voters generally are n't harboring the same feelings about race as earlier generations .
" My own sense of the campaign is we 're not going to see a huge Bradley effect , " he said .
" Of course it 's possible .
And we wo n't know until Election Day . "

In her first interview after John McCain picked her to be the GOP ’s vice presidential nominee , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin claimed that her foreign policy credentials were enhanced because “ you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska . ”
She also pointed out that she had experience dealing with trade delegations .
Later , asked by CBS News ’ Katie Couric if she had ever participated in negotiations with Russia , Palin said , “ We have trade missions back and forth .
We — we do — it ’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia . ”
But the calendars tracking Palin ’s official meetings during her tenure as governor contain not one listing indicating she ever met with a Russian official .
In fact , the 562 pages of her daily schedules — obtained by Mother Jones under Alaska ’s Open Records Act — indicate that Palin had few meetings at all with any foreign representatives and rarely dealt with any topic related to foreign policy .
The schedules include about 20 meetings , events , or phone calls in which Palin interacted with foreign officials .
And in many instances , these interactions were cursory or ceremonial and did not involve policy details .
According to the schedules released , Palin spent roughly 12 hours over the course of 19 months on these meetings .
( This does n’t count what happened during a four - day trip she took to Kuwait to visit members of the Alaska National Guard .
The schedules for those days do not detail whom she met . )
The calendars show no meetings between her and a trade delegation from any nation .
It ’s possible that the calendars are not fully accurate reflections of what happened — perhaps some meetings ran longer ( or shorter ) than scheduled .
And it ’s possible that in her off hours , Palin pored over Foreign Affairs , held unofficial chats with foreign officials , and sought out foreign policy experts .
Also , there is a six - week gap in her calendars — from mid May through the end of June 2007 — due to what her office calls a “ computer failure . ”
But according to the schedules , throughout her stint as governor , Palin has devoted merely a few hours to anything of a foreign relations nature , and most of her contact with foreign officials came through discussions with Canadian officials about a natural gas pipeline involving a Canadian company .
Here is a complete list of all of Palin ’s official calendar entries for events or meetings in which she had to interact with a foreign representative .
The missing weeks aside , this list represents the sum of the foreign policy experience she obtained while serving as governor .
January 18 , 2007 — Palin hosts an afternoon reception at the governor ’s mansion for representatives of the Pacific Northwest Economic Region ( PNWER ) , a regional US - Canadian forum that includes several Canadian government officials .
Her office previously has announced she will hold separate meetings to discuss trade and border issues with three Canadian officials –Yukon Premier Dennis Fentie , Canadian Consul General Peter Lloyd ( who is based in Seattle ) and Minister of Tourism Brendan Bell — who are in Alaska in conjunction with the PNWER meeting .
January 19 , 2007 — Palin meets with Fentie for 30 minutes , with Lloyd for 30 minutes , and with Bell for 30 minutes .
She does not attend the PNWER dinner hosted that night by the Canadian government for Alaskan officials and business leaders .
January 22 , 2007 — Palin receives a call at 7:00 am from Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to discuss cross - border issues and visas .
February 24 , 2007 —
In Washington , DC , for a National Governors Association meeting , Palin attends a reception at the Italian embassy .
She stays for 30 minutes before leaving for a dinner hosted by the Republican Governors Association .
March 10 , 2007 — Palin hosts the annual Fur & Ice reception in Fairbanks for about 30 diplomats and international tourism representatives .
A Palin press release issued before the event noted , “ Governor Sarah Palin will welcome members of Alaska ’s diplomatic corps to Fairbanks to view the ice carvings of Ice Alaska ’s 2007 World Ice Art Championship . ”
Following the afternoon reception , Palin attends the NCAA rifle championships .

April 16 , 2007 — Palin and a few aides meet with Taiwanese officials for an hour .
May 15 , 2007 — Palin holds a “ brief courtesy ” meeting with Martin Uden , then the head of the British consulate in San Francisco .
The calendar notes , “ He ’ll be visiting Juneau today off of one of the Cruise Ships . ”
July 23 - 26 , 2007 — Palin visits Kuwait to meet with members of the Alaska National Guard .
( After Palin was selected as McCain ’s running mate , her aides , referring to this trip , said she had traveled to Ireland , Germany , Kuwait and Iraq .
But on this visit , she did not go beyond the Kuwait - Iraq border , and she did not truly visit Ireland ; her plane made a refueling stop there . )
August 27 , 2007 — David Akov , the Israeli consul general for the Pacific Northwest , pays a 30 - minute - long “ courtesy call ” on Palin .
David Gottstein , AIPAC ’s Alaska chairman , also attends .
Akov invites Palin to visit Israel .
She reportedly tells Akov that Alaskans “ love Israel . ”
September 12 , 2007 — Palin holds a 15 - minute - long “ courtesy ” meeting with Hideo Fujita , the new chief of Japan ’s consulate in Anchorage .
September 13 , 2007 — Palin holds a 15 - minute long “ courtesy ” meeting with Peng Keyu , the head of the Chinese consulate in San Francisco .
October 15 , 2007 — Palin meets Iceland ’s president , Olafur Ragnar Grimsson .
The session is scheduled for 30 minutes .
Grimsson is in Alaska to attend the Arctic Energy Summit Technology Conference .
( After she became McCain ’s running mate , she was asked if she had ever met with a world leader .
She said , no — forgetting this meeting . )

Her calendar also refers to “ Canadian officials phone calls ” that day .
January 21 , 2008 — Palin is schedule for a brief “ stop by ” visit with Joe Balash , a Palin aide , and Brian Mason , a member of the legislative assembly of Alberta , Canada .

Diplomats from the Philippines , South Korea , the Slovak Republic , South Africa , Hungary , Indonesia , Italy , Poland , Finland , Germany , and Egypt attend .
Her calendar lists no separate meetings with any of them .
May 22 , 2008 —
At 7:15 am , Palin calls Yukon Premier Dennis Fentie ; for ten minutes they discuss the news that her administration will ask the state legislature to award a license for a 1,715 - mile - long natural gas pipeline to TransCanada .
( Her administration has turned down bids from other conglomerates , including ConocoPhillips . )
Later , she has a five - minute - long phone call with Canadian Minister of Industry Jim Prentice .
August 11 - 12 , 2008 — Palin attends a reception and delivers welcoming remarks for the Eighth Conference of Arctic Parliamentarians .
The conference , which meets every two years , includes delegates from Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Russia , Sweden , and the United States .
This year , it holds panels on human health in the Arctic region , Arctic marine policy , adaptation to climate change , and energy resources in the Arctic .
After welcoming the delegates , Palin leaves to attend a “ dedication and blessing ceremony ” for a cultural and visitors center in Fairbanks .
JERUSALEM —
In a crowded laboratory painted in gray and cooled like a cave , half a dozen specialists embarked this week on a historic undertaking : digitally photographing every one of the thousands of fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls with the aim of making the entire file — among the most sought - after and examined documents on earth — available to all on the Internet .
Equipped with high - powered cameras with resolution and clarity many times greater than those of conventional models , and with lights that emit neither heat nor ultraviolet rays , the scientists and technicians are uncovering previously illegible sections and letters of the scrolls , discoveries that could have significant scholarly impact .
The 2,000 - year - old scrolls , found in the late 1940s in caves near the Dead Sea east of Jerusalem , contain the earliest known copies of every book of the Hebrew Bible ( missing only the Book of Esther ) , as well as apocryphal texts and descriptions of rituals of a Jewish sect at the time of Jesus .
The texts , most of them on parchment but some on papyrus , date from the third century B.C. to the first century A.D.

Only a handful of the scrolls exist in large pieces , with several on permanent exhibit at the Israel Museum here in its dimly lighted Shrine of the Book .
Most of what was found is separated into 15,000 fragments that make up about 900 documents , fueling a longstanding debate on how to order the fragments as well as the origin and meaning of what is written on them .

While programming in Ruby is fun most of the times , setting up and configuring all the needed software components usually is n't .
Fortunately , there exist an increasing number of Ruby software stacks in various flavors : Amazon EC2 images , virtual machine images , or simple installers for an existing system .
This list is by no means comprehensive , but should give an overview of the different kinds of Ruby software stacks available .
RubyWorks
The RubyWorks Production Stack is an offering from ThoughtWorks and consists of a several open source products , already configured to work together and easily installable and updateable via your Linux distribution 's regular tools .
It is offered for RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 , CentOS , Debian Etch , and Ubuntu Feisty .
Once you 've installed the rubyworks package , you 'll have a cluster of Mongrels behind HAProxy and monitored using monit .
ThoughtWorks also offers paid support for this software stack .
EC2 on Rails
As the name gives away , EC2 on Rails is an image for Amazon 's Elastic Computing Cloud EC2 .
It 's an Ubuntu Linux server image and will run a Mongrel cluster behind Apache 2.2 , mysql , memcached , monit , and much more for you .
It also creates a backup of your data to Amazon S3 .
The management is done with Capistrano ; you 'll get all that 's needed with the ec2onrails gem .
Elastic Server On - Demand
Elastic Server On - Demand , from CohesiveFT , lets you customize your own server before you can download an image for VMWare , Parallels , Xen , or EC2 .
You can also download images from other users and rate their images .
Certainly a very interesting solution if you want to get a customized system quickly , without the need to install everything by hand .
Bitnami RubyStack and JRubyStack
Bitnami offers a whole range of software stacks , including one for Ruby with Rails , MySQL , Subversion and several gems .
The JRuby stack includes JRuby , Rails , Java , Tomcat , Glass Fish gem , MySQL and Subversion .
Bitnami's stacks are based on an installer and work with Linux , OS X , and Windows , so you do n't need a virtual machine to run them .
Engine Yard Express
If you 're interested in Engine Yard 's hosting services and want to know how one of their slices works , then you should try the Engine Yard Express VMWare image .
It starts four mongrels , two of them Rails instances and the other two Merb .
What 's your opinion of such software stacks ?
Are they a good thing or is it better to install or configure everything yourself ?
Do you know of other stacks ?
Before she became a famously untidy television chef , Julia Child had a secret career as an American spy , winning praise for her attention to detail as she managed the flow of classified communications from remote posts in Ceylon and China during World War II .
Long before he appeared on screen as a lunatic general in “ Dr. Strangelove ” and a corrupt cop in “ The Godfather , ” Sterling Hayden was parachuting into fascist Croatia as a secret operative for America ’s fledgling espionage service .
And decades before he was named CIA director , William J. Casey was running clandestine operations for the agency ’s predecessor -- the Office of Strategic Services , or OSS -- from its European headquarters in London .
The U.S. government pulled back the covers on these careers in espionage and thousands of others Thursday , granting public access for the first time to previously classified personnel files of Americans who served in the OSS .
Advertisement
The records on Child , Hayden and Casey were among 35,000 personnel files made available at a National Archives facility in suburban Washington .
Archives officials said the records cover the careers of more than 24,000 OSS employees .
The documents offer new insights into the inner workings of what many consider the nation ’s first formal spy service .
There is still debate over whether the OSS was effective in hastening the end of the war .
But the service , which was launched in 1942 and shut down three years later , accounts for one of the most colorful periods in U.S. espionage -- a time before intelligence agencies were burdened with bureaucracies or forced to answer to congressional committees .
The personnel records , many of them discolored and crumbling , are stored in a climate - controlled chamber on the archives ’ second floor .
Much of the material is mundane -- records of when people were hired , how much they were paid and where they were sent .
They generally do not reveal significant details about sensitive operations ; much of that information is in a separate collection .
But they do provide often fascinating glimpses into the backgrounds , and even personalities , of thousands of Americans who spent at least a short part of their lives working in the cloak - and - dagger world of spies .
Advertisement
The new documents “ add a human face to the story of this organization , ” said Steven Tilley , a director at the National Archives .
Tilley said the documents were released in large part because of historical organizations ’ pressure on the CIA , which held the files until 2001 and spent two years reviewing them before agreeing to their declassification .
“ These records will certainly be of interest to researchers , ” Tilley said .
“ They go to the personal [ backgrounds ] of the individuals who joined and fill in some of the gaps of what they did and how they did it . ”
For example , Child -- then Julia McWilliams -- sought employment with the OSS after becoming bored with her duties as a typist for the Office of War Information .
In one document she lists as her reason for leaving that organization : “ typed over 10,000 little white cards and put in for a transfer to OSS . ”
Child , a Pasadena native , is also disarmingly honest about other blemishes on her resume .
Explaining why she had left an advertising job at a Beverly Hills department store , she wrote : “ Fired , and I do n’t wonder . ”

She goes on to explain how she had made a tactical error that upset her supervisors and regretted that she had n’t “ been older and more experienced ” so that she could have handled the situation better .
After being hired at OSS headquarters in Washington , she was sent to clandestine stations in Asia , where she was responsible for “ registering , cataloguing and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications . ”
Child , who met her husband , Paul , in the OSS and who died in 2003 , was given an award for her resourcefulness as well as her “ inherent cheerfulness . ”
Casey ’s file is also illuminating .
As director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Reagan , he was a deeply controversial figure , credited with rebuilding the agency ’s spy ranks but criticized for rogue operations and tainted by his suspected ties to the Iran - Contra scandal .
His records indicate that his stint in the OSS was also marked by a penchant for risk - taking and daring operations .
In Europe , Casey developed a system for dropping operatives behind German lines during “ the moonless period of the month . ”
His agents were so well prepared that by the time they shed their parachutes , they could blend in seamlessly with the local population , armed with cover identities that “ would stand up under the closest Gestapo scrutiny . ”

Among other prominent people whose OSS records were released were historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , CIA directors Allen Dulles and Richard Helms , major league baseball catcher Morris “ Moe ” Berg , Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg and millionaire philanthropist Paul Mellon ( who , on his resume , listed “ trustee ” and “ horse breeder ” as prior occupations ) .
Of course , the vast majority of the files reflect the OSS careers of Americans whose names never achieved such recognition , and four were on hand Thursday for the opening of their own personnel files -- including Elizabeth McIntosh , 93 , who followed her OSS service with a lengthy career at the CIA .
McIntosh said her time in the OSS was largely devoted to “ morale operations ” -- not boosting the morale of U.S. forces , she pointed out , but eroding the morale of Japanese troops .
Her unit used radio broadcasts and leaflet drops to spread worry among Japanese forces .
At one point , she said , her group intercepted postcards that Japanese troops were sending home , erasing the reassuring messages the soldiers had written and replacing them with complaints about the lack of food and ammunition .
Notes to sweethearts were modified to say that the soldier had met a beautiful Burmese woman and would not be coming home .

After reviewing her file , McIntosh , who lives in Woodbridge , Va. , said she was thrilled to see that her supervisors had given her glowing marks .
Asked whether she was comfortable seeing such information released to public view , she said , “ I think it ’s all right .
It ’s been a long time .
There ’s nothing to hide anymore . ”

BARACK OBAMA has warned supporters against over - confidence as polls and political commentators predict a big victory for the Democratic presidential candidate next month , writes Denis Staunton
Speaking to donors in New York after instant polls suggested that he won his third and final debate with John McCain , the Democrat reminded them that he had been prematurely declared a winner during his party 's primaries .
" For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set , I just have two words for you : New Hampshire , " he said .
" I 've been in these positions before when we were favoured and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked . "
The candidates had tough exchanges on Wednesday night over taxation , abortion and the conduct of their campaigns in the liveliest and most substantive debate of the presidential contest .
Mr McCain was on the offensive for most of the 90 - minute event at New York 's Hofstra University , and landed more blows in his most impressive debate performance of the campaign .
Mr Obama smiled through most of the Republican 's attacks , responding in a cool , measured tone while Mr McCain often appeared frustrated and peevish .
A few minutes after the debate began , Mr McCain rebuked Mr Obama for linking him to the unpopular White House incumbent .
" Senator Obama , I am not President Bush , " Mr McCain said .
" If you wanted to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago .
I 'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country . "
Mr McCain questioned the Democrat 's account of his relationship with William Ayers , a former urban guerrilla with whom Mr Obama served on a number of non-profit boards in Chicago .
" Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago .
Forty years ago , when I was eight years old , he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group .
I have roundly condemned those acts , " Mr Obama said .
" Mr Ayers is not involved in my campaign .
He has never been involved in this campaign .
And he will not advise me in the White House . "
Mr McCain denied that he has been running a negative campaign and complained that Mr Obama had not condemned remarks by Georgia congressman John Lewis comparing the Republican 's campaign to that of 1960s segregationist George Wallace .
" That , to me , was so hurtful , " Mr McCain said .
Mr Obama said that Mr Lewis , who was a civil rights leader in the 1960s , may have " gone over the line " but he held back from criticising the congressman 's remarks .
Although Mr Lewis and Mr Ayers figured in the debate , neither played as prominent a role as " Joe the Plumber " - Joe Wurzelbacher , a plumber from Toledo , Ohio , who told Mr Obama at a rally that he was worried about the Democrat 's tax policies .
Mr Wurzelbacher said he was thinking of buying his plumbing business but that he was concerned that if it made more than $ 250,000 a year , Mr Obama would increase his taxes .
Mr McCain referred to the plumber repeatedly during the debate , accusing Mr Obama of seeking to strangle the American dream by redistributing wealth .
" I want Joe the Plumber to spread that wealth around .
You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around , " the Republican said .
" The whole premise behind Senator Obama 's plans are class warfare , let 's spread the wealth around .
" I want small businesses - and by the way , the small businesses that we 're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now .
Who - why would you want to increase anybody 's taxes right now ?
Why would you want to do that , anyone , anyone in America , when we have such a tough time , when these small business people , like Joe the Plumber , are going to create jobs , unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around . "
I love seeing people dork out in pastry form .

Readers of a certain age might remember the old newspaper cartoon of a man so down on his luck that he resorts to wearing an empty barrel held in place by suspenders .
If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue on their present course , barrels may again become fashionable for US taxpayers .
Criticized last week as fatally flawed  by Alan Greenspan , the two so - called mortgage giants are at the center of the current financial crisis .
Owned by private investors but chartered by Congress for the purpose of supplying liquidity to mortgage lenders , thereby putting home ownership within the reach of more Americans , Fannie and Freddie aggressively participated in the booming housing market of the early 21st century .
By the end of the third quarter of 2007 , the two were guaranteeing or had purchased outright roughly half of the nations home mortgages , accumulating in the process $ 5.2 trillion worth of debt , nearly $ 4 trillion more than on their books in 2003 .
The roof then fell in .
Real estate prices plummeted , mortgage default rates soared , and the market value of Fannie and Freddies asset portfolios primarily consisting of the income expected from the mortgages they owned and the mortgage - backed securities they sold to investors went into freefall .
Crisis might have been averted had the two companies kept reserves adequate for meeting such a contingency , but Fannie and Freddies regulator , the Department of Housing and Urban Developments Office of Federal Housing Oversight , demanded reserves of just 3 percent , a figure much lower than required of banks and other financial institutions and one that in hindsight was utterly irresponsible .
Last month , as Fannie and Freddies losses mounted and concerns grew that their collapse might cause meltdowns in financial markets both at home and abroad , Congress enacted rescue legislation .
Among other provisions , Julys housing - relief bill allows the Treasury to extend unlimited lines of credit to Fannie and Freddie and , if necessary , to buy their stock .
Undercutting the common perception that the housing crisis was precipitated by predatory  lending to low - income , subprime borrowers who did not qualify for conventional loans , the new law also authorizes Fannie and Freddie to buy mortgages worth up to $ 625,000 .
In a worst - case scenario , the two companies would be taken over by the federal government .
Taxpayers would then be fully responsible for their combined $ 5.2 trillion in debt , instantly increasing the national debt by 50 percent .
One might have thought that the federal governments recent actions represented a necessary response to financial events beyond Fannie and Freddies control .
But that would be wrong .
Ahead of the real estate bust a year ago , they were as eager to purchase or to guarantee risky home loans as banks and other institutions were to make them .
 Alt - A mortgages , home loans in a category somewhere between prime and subprime , now account for 10 percent of the single - family mortgages on Freddie Macs books and 11 percent of those on Fannie Maes .
For good reason , such mortgages , negotiated with borrowers who cannot or will not fully document their income or assets , have been called liar loans .
Indeed , it is only because lenders believed ( evidently correctly ) that they could shift their risk to Freddie and Fannie that they were willing to make such loans in the first place .
Fannie and Freddies reckless practices were in turn encouraged by the belief ( again evidently justified ) that they had grown too big to be allowed to fail .
Fannie Mae lost $ 2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2008 ; Freddie lost $ 821 million during the same period .
For the year ending last June 30 , the two companies posted losses totaling $ 14 billion .
As of June 30 , the estimated market value of the assets on Freddie Macs books was a negative $ 5.6 billion .
Relying in part on last months housing bill allowing the Federal Housing Authority to make some $ 300 billion available for refinancing existing home mortgages , Fannie and Freddie say they will attempt to raise additional capital privately and to take steps to slow loan defaults and home foreclosures .
But in an environment where it is now clear that the two companies are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government , the potential liabilities of taxpayers will continue to balloon .
Although Fannie claims to have tightened requirements for liar loans , it will keep buying them until years end .
Stay tuned for more bad news .

Not only are our skills being neutered , it 's being done in a way which makes us think we 're still at the top of our game .
It 's exactly like The Matrix .
Exactly like The Matrix .
Yes , a no - thumbed bonobo monkey can now feel a simulation of the sense of achievement we 've enjoyed since the ' 80s , but just remember , as The Incredibles told us , when everyone 's super , no - one will be .
Do n't believe the full extent to which we 've been emasculated ?
Read on .
Regenerative health
By far the worst offense perpetrated against good , honest , battle - hardened gaming skills .
Let this be clear ; you have no reason - no reason at all - to feel proud of yourself for defeating your enemy if you can shrug off a bullet - wound with a nice quiet sit down .
That 's like Superman beating up old ladies and being all " Hur hur ! I r teh badass " about it .
Automatically regenerating health makes an utter mockery of the skills really needed to succeed in any combat situation .
Is it enough to wade blindly into any conflict , happy to soak up any number of gunshots , punches and stabbings to the face as long as you 're scoring a few hits yourself ?
Has any soldier , swordsman or martial artist in history ever tried to get through a fight by simply dishing out the damage with a flagrant disregard for personal safety ?
Probably a few have , but no - one 's ever heard of them because they died really bloody quickly !
Real combat is a skilled balance of damage and evasion .
It 's about wrong - footing your opponent and maximising attack opportunities while maintaining a tactical sense of self - preservation .
It is not about charging into a battle zone , thoughtlessly swinging your gun around your head , safe in the knowledge that you spotted a rock to recharge behind on your way in , and thus are in no danger from the assembled enemy ranks whatsoever .
Auto-aim
A system implemented originally , and still primarily , in the first - person shooter .
The first - person shooter being a genre based almost entirely around the concept of aiming .
Is anyone else seeing anything wrong with this ?
So what 's next ?
Auto - driving in the next Burnout update ?
Auto - punching and kicking in the home versions of Street Fighter IV ?
A Mario game where we only have to maneuver the portly one within six feet of a koopa before he runs up and bops them on the head , all of his own accord ?
Look , we could understand this crap when FPS had rubbish controls .
Aiming up and down with cursor keys was always an excercise in knitting with spaghetti , and in a strictly head - on game like the original Doom , vertical auto - aim was vital .
But in this age of decent dual analogue control and the unfailing wonder of the laser mouse , it 's just patronising .
Auto - aim is like being eight years old , falling arse over tit off the bike you 're trying to learn to ride , and having your well - meaning but intrusive grandma grab the back of the saddle and guide you along .
" Aw , is the poor wittle man having trouble shooting the baddies ?
Here , let Granny Halo do it for you , diddums "
" Sod off , grandmother .
Shooting these bastards to death is my own business .
How will I ever become a man if you wo n't allow me the honour of my own headshots ? "
Unskippable Tutorials
We need a manual or a tutorial , not both .
Do publishers assume we 're illiterate as well as woefully unskilled ?
Do they think that we wo n't understand the meaning of all those cryptic symbols , shapes and colours in their unfathomable grimoire , and thus will need worked , practical examples before we can make sense of " Press A to jump " ?
This kind of hand - holding just will not do .
But woah !
" Hold A to jump higher ! ? "
What kind of avant garde torment is this ?
Hold us mother , we 're scared !

Palin : Vice President
Is in Charge of the Senate
Created : October 21 , 2008 14:30 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
ANCHORAGE , Alaska —
Think Progress has a great catch .
At the end of an interview with a local TV station in Colorado , Gov. Sarah Palin said she thinks the vice president ’s job is to be “ in charge of the U.S. Senate . ”
Third - grader Brandon Garcia asked what Palin thinks the vice president ’s job entails .
Palin replied :
[ T ] hey ’re in charge of the U.S. Senate so if they want to they can really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom .
Palin first propounded her expansive views of the vice president ’s office during the vice presidential debate with Sen.
Joe Biden .
When moderator Gwen Ifill asked her if she believes , as Dick Cheney does , that the vice president is not solely a member of the executive branch , Palin responded that there is “ much flexibility ” in the job .
Well , our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president .
And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president ’s agenda in that position .
Yeah , so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there , and we ’ll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation .
The whole Colorado interview is worth watching .
Palin talks taxes , energy and her views on funding programs for special - needs children .
The comment about the role of the vice president is around the 7 - minute mark .

U.S.A. : A man tried to sell his girlfriend 's stepdaughter to some guys for $ 10 worth of crack and they called the cops on him .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday September 10 2008
In the article below it was stated that Sarah Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party .
The Alaskan Independence party subsequently issued a statement saying it had been wrong to claim Sarah Palin was a member .
New revelations about the Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin — including her membership of a party that wants Alaskans to vote on becoming a separate country — are raising questions about how thoroughly John McCain 's campaign vetted her background before adding her to the ticket .
Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party ( AIP ) before becoming an elected Republican official , according to party members , and recorded a video message for the AIP convention this year .
The AIP 's chief goal is securing Alaska a vote on seceding from the US , a goal that party leaders believe the state was denied before it became part of the US almost 50 years ago .
Yet it is the AIP 's motto , " Alaska First , Alaska Always " , that may cause the most trouble for McCain .
The Republican 's campaign slogan this year is " Country First " .
At the convention where Palin 's video was played , the AIP vice - chairman , George Clark , told the audience that she was an AIP member before getting her first political post as mayor of the small town of Wasilla , Alaska .
" But you get along to go along — she eventually joined the Republican party , where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics , and well , I wo n't go into that , " Clark said .
" She also had about an 80 % approval rating , and is pretty well sympathetic to her former membership . "
Palin suggested in a July interview with CNBC news that she would insist on making Alaskan issues a high priority before agreeing to serve as a vice - presidential candidate .
" We want to make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position , especially for Alaskans , and for the things we 're trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the US , before I can even start addressing that question , " she said .
In response to the AIP flap , the McCain camp denied that Palin was a party member and released voter registration documents that showed her affiliating with Republicans .
" If the Alaska Independence Party at some point taught Governor Palin their secret handshake , there is no record of it , " McCain aide Michael Goldfarb wrote on the campaign 's website .
" Otherwise , the only relevant criterion for membership in a party is registration -- and Palin has never been a member of the AIP .
Intense media scrutiny of Palin since she became McCain 's running mate four days ago has led to speculation that the Republican party failed to fully examine her background .
In addition to the pregnancy of Palin 's 17 - year - old unmarried daughter , Bristol , several other disclosures threaten to throw the McCain camp into turmoil .
Palin has promoted her independence from Alaska 's powerful senior senator , Ted Stevens , who is facing seven criminal charges in Washington .
But she served for two years as a director for one of his political groups that was able to raise unlimited money from corporate patrons .
Palin faced pressure to resign as mayor of Wasilla in 1997 after she fired the city police chief for not fully supporting her agenda , leading to a lawsuit for breach of contract .
In Alaska , Palin faces an ethics investigation into whether she abused her office by firing the public safety commissioner , who refused to intervene in a messy divorce case involving her sister .
Palin has hired an attorney to help her handle the case , leading to another round of embarrassing press coverage .
McCain 's spokesman , Tucker Eskew , defended the selection : " This legal defence is neither new nor uncommon nor at all political .
It is a matter of her job and is not recent and it is not related to her selection on the McCain - Palin ticket . "
In the dying days of the Bush administration , yet another presidential claim in the " war on terror " has been proved false by the withdrawal of the main charge against six Algerians held without trial for nearly seven years at Guantanamo prison camp .
George Bush 's assertion in his 2002 State of the Union address – the same speech in which he wrongly claimed that Saddam Hussein had tried to import aluminium tubes from Niger – was that " our soldiers , working with the Bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy [ in Sarajevo ] . "
Not only has the US government withdrawn that charge against the six Algerians , all of whom had taken citizenship or residence in Bosnia , but lawyers defending the Arabs – who had already been acquitted of such a plot in a Sarajevo court – have found that the US threatened to pull its troops out of the Nato peacekeeping force in Bosnia if the men were not handed over .
According to testimony presented by the Bosnian Prime Minister , Alija Behman , the deputy US ambassador to Bosnia in 2001 , Christopher Hoh , told him that if he did not hand the men to the Americans , " then let God protect Bosnia and Herzegovina " .
That such a threat should be made – and the international High Representative to Bosnia at the time , Wolfgang Petritsch , has also told lawyers it was – shows for the first time just how ruthless and unprincipled US foreign policy had become in Mr Bush 's " war on terror " .
By withdrawing their military and diplomatic support for the Bosnian peace process , the Americans would have backed out of the Dayton accord which they themselves had negotiated .
Then the Bosnian government would have lost its legitimacy and the country might have collapsed back into a civil war which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of civilians and involved mass rape as well as massacre .
The people of Bosnia might then have endured " terror " on a scale far greater than the attacks of al - Qa'ida against the United States .

When the Bosnian court was preparing to release their six prisoners , Prime Minister Behman was informed that Mr Bush , Vice - President Richard Cheney and the Defence Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , had been personally briefed and the White House had decided that , if they were freed , US troops in the Nato Stabilisation Force in Bosnia would seize them , using " whatever force is necessary " .
So , despite a three - month investigation by the Bosnian police , their clearance and a specific demand by the Dayton - established Bosnian Human Rights Chamber that they should not be forced to leave Bosnia , US forces seized all six , shackled and blindfolded them and put them on a plane to Guantanamo .
Mustafa Idir , Mohamed Nechla , Hadj Boudella , Lakhdar Boumedienne , Belkacem Bensayah and Saber Lahmar have remained there since , the only European citizens still in Guanatanamo .
Five of their wives are still waiting for them in Bosnia along with 20 of their children , two of whom their fathers have never seen .
Their case will be put to a habeas corpus district court hearing in Washington next week – the six will appear in a live transmission from Guantanamo – where their lawyers will point out that another critical charge has also been withdrawn by the US government .
The administration has withdrawn evidence given by a federal prisoner , Enaam Arnaout , against Boudella – that he trained at an al - Qa'ida camp in Afghanistan – when lawyers were about to discover that the US Justice Department had said five years earlier that an FBI interview with the man was " not reliable " .
Even stranger is that the six prisoners are claimed by the US to be " enemy combatants " when – with the dropping of the embassy bomb - plot charge – there is no evidence they have ever fought US troops or planned to attack US interests anywhere in the world .
Part of the case against Bensayah involved the alleged discovery of a piece of paper at his home , bearing a telephone number for an al - Qa'ida operative , Abu Zubayder .
" The Bosnian police could n't get this number to work in Afghanistan or Pakistan , " one of the prisoners ' lawyers , Stephen Oleskey , says .
" Now we believe an announcement that the paper had been discovered was made before it was ' found ' . "
Mr Oleskey says Clint Williamson , the US war crimes ambassador , met Bosnia 's Prime Minister , Nicola Spiric , this week .
" There 's only one reason he makes these visits , " he said .
" To negotiate the return of people in Guantanamo . "
The White House may intend to save itself further embarrassment by ending the torment of six more apparently innocent young men .

Transport Secretary Geoff
Hoon has said the government is prepared to go " quite a long way " with civil liberties to " stop terrorists killing people " .
He was responding to criticism of plans for a database of mobile and web records , saying it was needed because terrorists used such communications .
By not monitoring this traffic , it would be " giving a licence to terrorists to kill people " , he said .
Lib Dem MP Julia Goldsworthy queried how far it would undermine freedom .
Earlier the government confirmed the controversial plans would not be in the Queen 's Speech .
On BBC One 's Question Time , Mr Hoon said the plans would only extend powers that already exist for ordinary telephone calls , to cover data and information " going across the internet " .
If they are going to use the internet to communicate with each other and we do n't have the power to deal with that , then you are giving a licence to terrorists to kill people
Geoff Hoon
Transport secretary
He said the police and security services needed the powers to deal with " terrorists or criminals " using telephones connected to the internet , for " perfectly proper reasons , to protect our society " .
But the Lib Dems ' communities spokeswoman Julia Goldsworthy said it sounded like " something I would expect to read in [ George Orwell 's book ] 1984 " and questioned whether the government and councils could be trusted not to misuse the powers .
She asked : " How much more control can they have ?
How far is he prepared to go to undermine civil liberties ? "
Mr Hoon interjected : " To stop terrorists killing people in our society , quite a long way actually .
" If they are going to use the internet to communicate with each other and we do n't have the power to deal with that , then you are giving a licence to terrorists to kill people . "
' Orwellian '
He added : " The biggest civil liberty of all is not to be killed by a terrorist . "
The plans were condemned as " Orwellian " on Wednesday by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have called on the government to justify proposals for a giant database containing all internet and telephone traffic .
Details of the times , dates , duration and locations of mobile phone calls , numbers called , website visited and addresses e-mailed are already stored by telecommunications companies for 12 months under a voluntary agreement .
The data can be accessed by police on request but the government plans to take control of the process in order to comply with an EU directive and make it easier for investigators to do their job .
Information would be kept for two years by law and may be held centrally on a searchable database .
The government had also promised new laws to protect civil liberties .
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said pulling all the information together in a central server , to be managed by government , " represents a very profound change in the relationship between the state and the citizen " .
In a speech on Wednesday Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said a consultation would be held on the controversial plan in the New Year but did not say if it would be dropped from the Queen 's Speech which sets out the government 's legislative programme for the year ahead However , on Thursday Commons leader Harriet Harman confirmed it would be delayed after calls in the Commons from the Conservatives and Lib Dems for a debate on the draft Communications Data Bill , in which it was due to be outlined .
' No content '
She told MPs : " The draft communication bill was in the draft legislative programme and a number of issues and concerns have been raised about it .
" The home secretary makes it clear that at all times , on important issues such as these , she wants to listen to what people 's concerns are , she wants to consider those concerns , she wants to consult on a bipartisan and wide basis . "
On Wednesday Ms Smith attempted to reassure people that the content of their e-mails and phone conversations would not be stored and local authorities would not be able to trawl through looking for " lower level criminality " .
But the proposals came under fire from critics , including the government 's own reviewer of anti-terror laws , Lord Carlile , who said it would need " very strict controls " .

Jerry Sanders , the founder of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices , once said , “ We ’re the oil of the eighties ” in reference to the red - hot semiconductor industry so many years ago .
So it ’s only fitting that oil money has come to bail out AMD in its hour of need .
The New York Times is reporting that Sunnyvale , Calif . - based AMD will split into two companies .
One will focus on designing microprocessors , while the other will focus on the business of manufacturing them .
The plan , articulated by AMD management earlier this year , is what the company must do to survive against the newly resurgent Intel .
Under the deal , two Abu Dhabi investment companies will invest $ 6 billion into both companies so that AMD can build a planned factory near Albany , N.Y. , and upgrade a Germany factory .
AMD will own 44.4 percent of the new entity , to be named the Foundry Company .
The Advanced Technology Company , formed by the Abu Dhabi government , will own the rest .
AMD put up a valiant fight against Intel , starting in 2003 , when it launched the Opteron processor .
The design was both energy and memory efficient , helping to cut electricity costs just as they were spiraling out of control for data center managers .
It took years for Intel to recover .
But the world ’s biggest chip maker had many times more engineers than AMD and far more money to pour into factories .
In 2006 , Intel came up with a better chip design , based on its Core architecture .
It retook just about all of the market share that AMD had gained .
Intel ’s resurgence made this outcome inevitable .
AMD lost money and was on the ropes ; in June , it had $ 5.3 billion in debt and $ 1.6 billion in cash .
The investment in the chip - making process for upcoming 45 - nanometer factories is so big that chip makers would have to generate $ 13 billion over five years to justify the investment .
Now it has come to this .
Intel will be competing against foreign governments .
They are so far willing to put up the multibillion - dollar ante that it takes to compete head on with Intel .
The Foundry Company will make chips for AMD and other customers too .
It will in effect be a contract chip manufacturer and it will license chip manufacturing processes from IBM .

House prices ' to plummet by 35 % ' - the biggest ever fall in Britain
House prices will fall a record - breaking 35 per cent by next autumn , a leading firm of economists warned yesterday .
The collapse will be the biggest fall ever seen in this country .
The claim , from the consultancy Capital Economics , will horrify homeowners who face being plunged into negative equity .
Not needed : Estate agent boards piled up in a yard in Hull
According to the forecast , around £ 65,000 will be wiped off the value of the average home .
At the height of the property boom last year the average home was worth £ 186,000 .
By next autumn it will be worth around £ 120,000 .
Capital Economics had originally expected house prices to drop 35 per cent by the end of 2010 .
But yesterday it amended this forecast in the light of recent economic turmoil .
The consultancy still expects the same fall , but squeezed into a much shorter period .
Prices are then predicted to stagnate for 18 months before a tentative recovery begins in 2011 .
Ed Stansfield , property economist at Capital Economics , said : ' The sheer speed of adjustment is causing alarm . '
The housing market has been affected by the credit crunch that has frozen the world 's financial markets
But he added this may be a good thing as it could provide a boost for the economy .
' While a period of falling house prices will inevitably be painful , we believe that the
quicker house prices return to fair value , the less damage the housing market correction will do to the wider economy , ' he said .
In a further blow , the financial information firm Moneyfacts said yesterday that it expects a rise in repossessions as lenders refuse to cut their mortgage rates .
Mortgage expert Darren Cook said : ' With more base rate cuts on the horizon , which in part are intended to reduce the burden on household finances , we could find ourselves in a situation where the Bank of England 's decisions on a rate cut will have little or no bearing on the majority of families ' mortgage outgoings .
It could ultimately result in an increase in repossessions . '
Rare success :
The number of homes which sold last month slumped to its lowest - ever level , down more than 50 per cent compared to the same month last year
Just one in four banks have cut their standard variable rate since the Bank of England 's emergency half - point cut two weeks ago .
Meanwhile , official figures show homeowners who want to sell their property face the toughest battle to find a buyer since records began .
The number of homes which sold last month slumped to its lowest - ever level , down more than 50 per cent compared with the same month last year , according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs .
Just 59,000 homes were sold in September , against 100,000 each month just nine months ago .
Howard Archer , chief economist at the consultancy Global Insight , said buyers will continue to disappear and the number will fall even lower .
He said : ' Housing market activity and house prices seem poised for further weakness as the fundamentals remain largely unfavourable . '
Mr Archer expects prices to fall 16 per cent this year and a further 15 per cent next year .
Last week a report by the ratings agency Standard & Poor 's estimated that around 60,000 homeowners a month are falling into the negative equity trap
By the end of October , it is expected that 335,000 will be in negative equity and Standard & Poor 's expect the number to peak at 1.7 million next year .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Although Barack Obama leads John McCain by almost 30 percentage points among 18 - to 29 - year - old registered voters , these younger voters are still less likely than older voters to report being registered to vote , paying attention to the election , or planning to vote this year .
Obama is clearly the favored candidate among young voters , while Obama and McCain are much more competitive among the older age groups .
Obama leads McCain by 62 % to 34 % among registered voters 18 to 29 years of age , based on Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviewing conducted Oct. 1 - 20 .
That 's a much larger margin than in any other age group .
Among those aged 30 to 49 , Obama maintains a 6 - point margin .
His lead is similar among voters between the ages of 50 and 64 ( 7 points ) .
The two candidates are essentially tied among senior citizens .
( Over this same period , Obama is leading McCain among all registered voters by 9 points , 51 % to 42 % . )
This strength of support for a Democratic presidential nominee among the youth is not a new phenomenon .
In Gallup 's final poll before the 2004 election , the Democratic nominee John Kerry received 59 % of the support of 18 - to 29 - year - old registered voters , while the Republican George W. Bush received 36 % support .
That compared to the overall sample of registered voters in which Kerry was leading Bush by 2 points , 48 % to 46 % .
( Bush led Kerry among likely voters by 49 % to 47 % . )
Despite the skew among 18 - to 29 - year - old voters toward Obama , it 's important to note that their vote is not monolithically for the Democratic nominee .
A general increase in voting among younger voters will bring one McCain voter to the polls for every two Obama voters .
Thus , a general increased turnout among the under - 30 voting group will increase Obama 's overall percentage of the vote , but most likely not as dramatically as would , for example , increased turnout among black voters , of whom 9 out of 10 prefer Obama .
There is evidence of an increase in new - voter registration and potentially higher participation among young voters given Obama 's appeal .
But to what extent can Gallup 's large daily tracking samples provide insight into whether younger voters will in fact vote at high rates ?
Based on Oct. 14 - 20 tracking data , which include interviews with more than 6,500 registered voters , 18 - to 29 - year - olds still lag well behind older voters on key predictors of turnout .
At the most basic level , younger voters are significantly less likely than those who are older to report that they are registered to vote .
This is not a surprising finding .
Young people are more mobile , less likely to have a permanent residence , and in general less plugged in to the political system .
This year , there has been discussion about efforts to register young people ( on college campuses , for example ) , but these data suggest that those in the under - 30 group have a way to go before they are registered at the same rates as those who are older , particularly those aged 50 and above .
The data also show that younger voters , despite the sense that they are deeply involved in the political process this year , are less likely than those who are older to say they have given quite a lot of thought to the election .
Perhaps most importantly , younger voters are much less likely to self - report that they are likely to vote .
One of Gallup 's series of likely voter questions asks respondents to place themselves on a 1 to 10 scale , where 10 means they will definitely vote and 1 means they definitely will not vote .
The results show that those under 30 are significantly less likely to put themselves in the 9 or 10 position ( definitely or almost definitely likely to vote ) than is the case among their elders .
Gallup has found similar patterns by age in past elections , and the current data suggest younger voters still have a way to go to match the levels of registration , interest , and intention to vote of older Americans .
That is not to rule out the possibility that young voters ' propensity to vote could increase in the final two weeks of the campaign , or that massive Democratic " get out the vote " efforts on Election Day could motivate many latent Obama supporters to officially register that preference in the voting booth .
Likely Voter Models
Gallup has used these measures -- in addition to measures of past voting behavior -- to identify likely voters in past elections , and these have proven successful in estimating the overall popular vote for president .
Because younger voters are less likely to answer these turnout - indicator questions in a way that would have Gallup identify them as likely voters this year , their share of the likely voting electorate as of mid-October appears as if it will be similar to what it has been in past elections .
Note that the proportion of 18 - to 29 - year - olds in the likely voter sample is similar even based on Gallup 's " expanded " likely voter model , which takes into account only a respondent 's current voting intention , and thus would give infrequent or new voters the same chance of being defined as a likely voter as those who vote regularly .
The expanded likely voter model 's estimate of the share of 18 - to 29 - year - olds in the electorate is only slightly higher than the estimate of Gallup 's " traditional " likely voter model .
The traditional model is based on respondents ' current voting intentions and their past voting behavior , and although it does include adjustments for those who were too young to vote in the last presidential election , it would to some degree underestimate infrequent voters or new voters who could have voted in past elections but did not .
Turnout Estimates
Obama maintains a significant lead among 18 - to 29 - year - olds using both likely voter models -- 60 % to 37 % using the expanded model , but a more narrow 54 % to 42 % using the traditional model , according to Oct. 14 - 20 tracking data .
Among all likely voters over this period , Obama averaged a 51 % to 44 % lead in the expanded model and 49 % to 46 % in the traditional model .
( Obama 's lead has increased slightly in recent days in both models . )
But what would happen if younger voters do make up a greater share of the electorate this year than what the Gallup likely voter models currently suggest -- as , for example , would happen if there is a surge of younger voters responding to massive " get out the vote " efforts ?
The accompanying table compares the Obama - McCain results among all likely voters 1 ) as estimated by Gallup ; 2 ) assuming 18 - to 29 - year - olds will make up 18 % of the electorate ; and 3 ) assuming a surge of young voter turnout that increases their share of the electorate to a record 21 % ( with the three other age groups ' shares dropping by a point each ) .
These simulations suggest that Obama 's share of the vote would increase only if young voter turnout is much higher than it has been in the past , and at that , he gains only 1 percentage point .
That is the case in both the expanded and traditional likely voter models , even though the expanded model gives young Americans and infrequent voters the same chance of being counted as likely voters as it gives Americans with a reliable voting history .
McCain 's share of the vote could decline by 2 points if turnout is higher among young voters , but only if the assumptions of the expanded model hold -- that is , that new and infrequent voters with strong voting intentions are just as likely to vote as are seasoned voters with the same intentions .
Bottom Line
Gallup
Poll daily tracking suggests that 18 - to 29 - year - olds are not nearly as likely as older voters to be registered to vote , to say they are thinking about the election , or to express strong intentions to vote .
Thus , as of mid-October , there is not convincing evidence in the Gallup data that young voters will in fact vote at higher rates than in past elections .
But even if things change over the next two weeks and many more young adults do become motivated to vote , turnout alone would do little to change the candidates ' overall support , according to Gallup 's likely voter models .
Gallup will continue to monitor the responses of 18 - to 29 - year - olds to the likely voter questions between now and Election Day to see whether the current situation changes .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 7,063 national adults , aged 18 and older , which were conducted Oct. 14-20 as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
For results based on the sample of 604 adults aged 18 to 29 , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 6,508 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
For results based on the sample of 484 registered voters aged 18 to 29 , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±5 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys

Here 's a note I got recently from a friend and former Delta Force member , who has been observing American politics from the trenches : " These bastards like Clark and Kerry and that incipient ass , Dean , and Gephardt and Kucinich and that absolute mental midget Sharpton , race baiter , should all be lined up and shot . "
Suck it up , Kathleen .
You 've been tossing red meat to a caged rabid animal for two decades .
No sympathy when it finally bites you .
Now , she whines :
From the Obama campaign :
JOHN MCCAIN’S 17 LIES TONIGHT
1. MCCAIN PROPOSING NEW HOUSING PLAN .
McCain today said he had a new plan to allow the Treasury to purchase and restructure mortgages .
The truth is that this is not a new proposal and is already part of the rescue plan that was signed into law .
It was Obama , not McCain who called for this move two weeks ago .
2. MCCAIN TAX PLAN IS BETTER .
McCain said , “ It is my proposal not Senator Obama ’s ” that will “ take care of working families . ”
The reality is that even the Heritage Foundation agrees Obama will provide a middle class tax cut that studies have found is three times larger than under McCain ’s plan .
In contrast , the McCain plan ’s benefits would overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest Americans and would leave out 101 million middle class households .
3. MCCAIN ’S PLAN FOR HOUSING CRISIS .
McCain said , “ We have got to give some trust and confidence back to America ” to solve the housing crisis .
But Politifact agrees that McCain was taken by surprise by the mortgage crisis and was “ a latecomer ” to the debate .
He even said “ I do n’t claim to be smart enough ” to solve the housing crisis and newspapers have found that McCain “ overstates ” his past actions on housing regulation .
4. TIES TO FANNIE / FREDDIE .
McCain talked about “ Senator Obama and his cronies and friends in Washington ” and blamed them for Fannie and Freddie , while news accounts have pointed out his “ deeper ” ties to the companies .
His campaign manager Rick Davis fought against greater regulation for years , and then his firm was revealed to be taking $ 15,000 a month until this summer from Freddie Mac , after denying any recent ties .
5. MCCAIN WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE .
McCain said “ We can do them all at once , ” talking about affordability and availability of health care , but he failed to mention that experts say his plan may require some to pay more or get less coverage , that millions would lose their employer - based coverage , and that even he has admitted that his plan will raise taxes on some .
6. SMALL BUSINESS TAXES .
McCain said Obama ’s plan “ will increase taxes on 50 % of small business revenue , ” when the Washington Post found similar attacks “ untrue , ” and studies show 97 % of small business owners would n’t see higher taxes under Obama ’s plan .
Factcheck.org said the attack used “ a false and preposterously inflated figure . ”
7. TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY .
McCain said “ I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy . ”
While he once said that the Bush tax cuts were “ too tilted to the wealthy , ” now he wants to make them permanent .
8. 2005 ENERGY BILL .
McCain attacked Obama for his vote for the 2005 energy bill , saying it had “ billions for oil companies . ”
The truth is that FactCheck.org called this “ an old canard ” and a “ false attack . ”
The non-partisan Congressional Research Service said the bill actually raised taxes on the oil and gas industry .
9. 94 VOTES FOR HIGHER TAXES…AGAIN .
McCain once again repeated the attack that Obama voted 94 times for higher taxes , calling it “ his record . ”
This attack has been debunked by the Associated Press , the Cleveland Plain Dealer , CNN , the New York Times and FactCheck.org , among others .
10 . OBAMA RECORD ON NUCLEAR POWER .
McCain said , “ Obama is opposed to that , ” when the reality is that this attack is “ false ” according to FactCheck.org .
Obama supports nuclear as long as it ’s “ clean and safe . ”
11 . HEALTH COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS .
McCain said his health care plan would let people cross state lines to get plans , suggesting it would improve care and not telling Americans that it would weaken patient protections and does nothing to require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions .
McCain ’s plan would create a situation the GOP chair of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said would cause a “ race to the bottom . ”
12 . HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES .
McCain attacked Obama ’s health care plan , suggesting that Obama will fine small businesses and make health care more expensive for them .
ABC pointed out that he was “ omitting key details about Obama ’s plan to mitigate costs ” for health care for small businesses .
McCain also omitted his record of voting repeatedly against tax credits for small businesses to help with health care costs and that the majority of members of the National Federation of Independent Businesses oppose his plan .
13 . JUDGMENT ON IRAQ .
McCain said that he had “ the judgment ” to make national security decisions , ignoring his record of misguided statements during the course of the Iraq war .
In 2005 he said the war would be over within 18 months .
In 2003 he said “ we will be welcomed as liberators , ” and that “ we will win it easily . ”
14 . RUSSIA AND GEORGIA .
McCain said Obama “ was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia ” when Obama had condemned Russia ’s actions and called for an immediate ceasefire .
15 . SURGE IN IRAQ .
McCain again attacked Obama on the surge , when news accounts show that Obama “ said at the time ” that the increase “ could improve security in certain neighborhoods but that it would not solve the long - term political strife . ”
Meanwhile McCain said only 10,000 troops would do the job .
16 . NEGOTIATIONS .
McCain attacked Obama on diplomatic engagement , but the Washington Post has said McCain is “ distorting history when he suggests that Barack Obama is bucking American presidential tradition in expressing a willingness to meet with the leaders of countries hostile to the United States ” and that McCain is “ incorrect . ”
17 . SOMALIA .
McCain held up Somalia as an example of failed American foreign policy , saying “ we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation . ”
McCain ignored the amendment he introduced in 1993 to cut off funding for troops in Somalia .
As the economic might of Japan faces up to the global banking crisis , a single cat has boosted the finances of a small Japanese city by millions of dollars , according to a study .
Tortoiseshell Tama is the " stationmaster " of the unmanned Kishi train station where she was born and raised on the provincial Kishigawa Line .

Analysis : Palin 's words may backfire on McCain Associated Press
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AP ) â 
By claiming that Democrat Barack Obama is " palling around with terrorists " and does n't see the U.S. like other Americans , vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin targeted key goals for a faltering campaign .
And though she may have scored a political hit each time , her attack was unsubstantiated and carried a racially tinged subtext that John McCain himself may come to regret .
First , Palin 's attack shows that her energetic debate with rival Joe Biden may be just the beginning , not the end , of a sharpened role in the battle to win the presidency .
" Our opponent ... is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough , that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , " Palin told a group of donors in Englewood , Colo .
A deliberate attempt to smear Obama , McCain 's ticket - mate echoed the line at three separate events Saturday .

12 Powerful Life Lessons
Photo by Lucia Holm
Follow your dreams and transform your life
~
As my wife and I were planning our last vacation , one of the first things we did was get out a map and plan our route .
Whether it was online maps or old fashioned paper maps – they all helped guide us to our destination .
As I was looking at the maps spread across our dining room table , I thought , “ would n’t it be great if there was a map of life ” that could guide you along your life ’s journey ?
A personal motivation map giving you those life lessons that one typically learns way too late in life .
Does such a “ map of life ” exist ?
It was then that I stumbled upon a tattered copy of The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in the bottom of my closet .
Paulo Coelho in his wildly popular book ( 65 million copies sold in 67 languages ) tells the story of a shepherd boy and his quest to live his dream .
Along the way , the boy meets an alchemist who has the power to inspire personal transformation .
This Alchemist gives the boy a number of life ’s lessons – lessons that are as fresh and applicable today as they were hundreds of years ago .
The lessons by themselves are interesting , but it ’s only when they are applied , that the power of personal transformation can be unleashed .
So what can Paulo teach us about life and pursing dreams in the face of obstaclesthat caused 65 million people to buy his book ?
1 . It ’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary .
I believe this to be true and have experienced this with my own family .
When I think of the times where we laughed the most or had the most fun – it was when we were doing the simplest things .
Swimming in a pool , combing a beach for shells , playing a board game , or sharing a delicious meal – all simple things making up the best times we ’ve had as a family .
Question :
What were some of the happiest memories from your past ?
What were you doing ?
2. Support your children in pursuit of their dreams .
In the beginning of the story the shepherd boy ( named Santiago ) tells his father he wants to travel and see the world .
The father explains he wants his son to stay in the village and become a priest .
But Santiago persists – being a priest is not his dream .
What does his father do ?
He gives Santiago the small amount of money he had been saving for the boy and wished him well .
How many of us had parents who have – in not - so - subtle - ways – influenced us to take careers that were not in - line with our dreams ?
Be honest now , did you pick your current career because you ’re passionate about the work or were you trying to make your parents proud ?
How do you feel about your career now ?
As a parent , it ’s difficult to accept when your child wants to take a path other than the one you had hoped and planned for them .
But , it ’s ok .
Like my wife keeps telling me “ give them roots and give them wings ” .
Give them a solid foundation of love , but give them the freedom to follow their dreams .
Question :
What were some of your dreams as a child ?
3 . There is nothing to hold you back , except yourself .
There is only one question to ask yourself here : “ What would you do if you were not afraid ? ”
Think about it .
4 . There is only one way to learn , and that is through action .
Trying to learn without doing is like trying to lose weight by watching someone else exercise .
It ’s just not going to work .
We are all fundamentally hands - on learners .
Question :
What would you like to learn ?
What next action step can you take ?
5 . Trust your gut ( or Learn to recognize omens , and follow them . )
Many times our subconscious has already made a decision before we ’ve caught up and made the same decision .
Sometimes we do n’t make the same decision and then ‘ something does not feel right ’ or there is a persistent naggingthat bothers us .
Malcolm Gladwell wrote extensively about this phenomenon in his book titled Blink : The Power of Thinking without Thinking .
Trust your gut – it may be more accurate than you think .
6 . Follow your dreams .
There are many of us who dream our dreams without ever actually realizing any of them .
For whatever reason we get locked in a “ dream state ” and never take action .
We analyze too much and our dreams turn into giant mountains in our imagination that seem impossible to climb .
As a result , we never learned that foreign language we ’ve always wanted to learn , or traveled , or started that business , or written that book .
Just think of the many bestsellers that would have been , but were never written .
The time is now , to awake from dreamland , to live the life we want and to achieve the extraordinary potential within us all .
Question :
What are some dreams you ’d like to realize now ?
Write them down on a piece of paper and make sure the success of their attainment is measurable .
7 . Know what you want .
Set goals and make a plan to achieve them .
It ’s like the saying , “ a goal that is never written down is nothing but a New Year ’s resolution ” – and we all know what happens to New Year ’s resolutions .
8 . Make a decision and dive in with massive action .
The river of life will take you to places that you have never imagined .
Once you make a decision , take action .
You ’ll be surprised to find where it will lead .
9 . Move on – always look forward .
It ’s ok to look back once and a while , but do n’t live in the past .
You can visit “ pity city ” for a short time , but after a while you have to leave it all behind and walk on .
10 .
You will encounter obstacles and take detours while realizing your dreams .
As you strive to achieve your dreams , you can count on there being some setbacks and disappointments .
Do n’t get discouraged , the road to your dreams may not be an easy one .
Think of these challenges as tests of persistence and courage that life throws at you during your quest .
They were necessary and were meant to help you grow as a person .
Learn to adjust the sails of your life to unpredictable winds , while keeping your focus clear on your destination .
11 . Do n’t fear the unknown .
As long as you ’re resourceful and have a few skills , you ’ll be able to provide for yourself ( and your family ) .
Have confidence in yourselfat all times .
12 . Learn to understand the universal language – the language without words .
There is so much more said from a person than just words alone .
You can read the expression on someone ’s face , sense their body language , or hear the tone in their voice – these thingsare all part of the unspoken language .
The more conscious we become at noticing them , the better we become at interpreting them .
Question :
What are some subtle unspoken gestures from the language of love ?
The Alchemist is a deeply moving , yet simple fable about a shepherd boy living his dreams .
Now that Paulo Coelho has taught us his lessons , can we , like an alchemist , change our lives from one of dreaming about our dreams to one of living our dreams ?
It ’s up to us to take action … today !
What are some of your dreams ?
What are some dreams you ’ve achieved , and how did you achieve them ?

Sec. 7 . Funding .

The Fed did not want to cut the Fed Funds Rate below 2 % .
And because Congress recently granted authority for the Fed to pay interest on reserves , Bernanke thought incorrectly that he could keep rates above 2 % .
So much for that academic theory .
Now many are wondering if ZIRP ( Zero Interest Rate Policy ) is coming to the Fed .
The LA Times addressed the question today in The Fed 's rate at zero ?
It 's no longer a far - fetched idea .
Just a day after the Federal Reserve dropped its key short - term interest rate to 1 % -- matching the generational low reached in 2003 - 04 -- the betting is intensifying on another cut .
Trading in futures contracts on the federal funds rate , the Fed ’s benchmark , implies a 51.4 % probability that the central bank will slash the rate to 0.50 % on or before its next meeting on Dec. 16 , according to Bloomberg News data .
Rate expectations may be cueing off the government ’s report today that the economy shrank at an annualized rate of 0.3 % in the third quarter .
Although analysts figured the economy had contracted in the period , the details were ugly -- particularly the 3.1 % decline in real consumer spending , the biggest drop since the vicious recession that began in 1980 .
The Bank of Japan had to maintain its benchmark interest rate at or near zero for most of the 1999 - 2006 period , before policymakers finally felt comfortable that the economy was in a sustainable recovery .
December FOMC Meeting Implied Probability
Rate Cuts Counterproductive
With Fed Funds already trading at 1.00 % prior to the announcement , it will be critical to watch whether other short term indices drop by 50 bps , particularly LIBOR and , probably most importantly consumer deposit rates .
If short term bank liabilities do not reprice down by at least the 50 bps cut in the prime , contrary to public perception , banks will now be worse off than they were before yesterday 's announcement . …
If yesterday 's rate cut in any way squeezes margins , further cuts will only compound the problem . …
I would offer that future Fed Funds cuts are off the table .
Key Interest Rates

Either McCain ’s vetting process was a complete sham .
Or his press operation is the worst in modern presidential politics history .
Or some unholy blend of both .
Campbell Brown is n’t the story – people are underestimating her , as they always have .
No , the story is that Tucker Bounds went on national television without material to answer what is maybe the simplest , most straightforward follow - up question any reporter can ask : “ What ’s your evidence for that assertion ? ”
And I suspect that the reason they canceled Larry King is not to punish CNN ( it does n’t work that way ) it ’s that they still could n’t come up with an answer to the question by the time his show aired .
Now look at this comment from McCain honcho Steve Schmidt to Katie Couric last night : “ Members of this campaign went to off - the - record lunches with reporters today , and they were asked if she would do paternity tests to prove paternity for her last child .
Smear after smear after smear , and it ’s disgraceful and it ’s wrong .
And the American people are going to reject it overwhelmingly when they see her . ”
First of all , that ’s the first time I ’ve heard anyone in the campaign / political press throw out the notion of paternity tests .
So Schmidt is to blame for bringing that issue into the mainstream .
If anyone is smearing the candidate , it ’s Schmidt .
This is as cynical a tactic as I ’ve ever seen in politics .
Secondly , how can it be a “ smear ” if it was during an off the record lunch with McCain campaign aides ?
Thirdly , hey , colleagues , you ’re on notice : Steve Schmidt does not respect “ off the record . ”
Watch your backs , my friends .
“ We ’re on a path to be the company we aspire to be , ” he said .
On the critical measure of gross margin , A.M.D. also beat Wall Street ’s estimates .
Gross margin for the quarter was 45 percent excluding licensing fees , compared with analysts ’ average forecast of 41 percent .
The report was released after the close of trading Thursday .
Shares of A.M.D. rose as much as 19 percent in after - hours trading ; they closed up 21 cents at $ 4.12 in regular trading .
Looking ahead , A.M.D. expects revenue in the fourth quarter to be roughly the same as in the last quarter .
A.M.D. ’s report follows a largely downbeat forecast from its rival Intel .
On Tuesday , Paul S. Otellini , Intel ’s chief executive , warned investors that the global economic crisis could hurt Intel ’s business in the coming months , but he said it was too soon to determine the actual impact .
He said that while Intel experienced some “ softness ” in September , the company ’s profit rose 12 percent during the third quarter , but sales rose only 1 percent .
Last week , A.M.D. announced plans to split into two entities .
One will continue to design microprocessors , while a new company , owned jointly by A.M.D. and a fund controlled by the Abu Dhabi government , will manufacture them .
The announcement of the split - up of A.M.D. , based in Sunnyvale , Calif. , came just as investors were starting to lose confidence in the company .
In the last few years , A.M.D. lost considerable ground as it endured a bruising price war and encountered technical problems that hampered the introduction of its critical new chip , Barcelona .
A.M.D. had long been struggling to pay for capital - intensive plants in order to stay competitive .
The Advanced Technology Investment Company , created by the Abu Dhabi government , said it would invest up to $ 8 billion in A.M.D. ’s factory spinoff in exchange for a 55.6 percent stake in the new company .
After A.M.D.’s seventh consecutive quarterly loss , reported in July , the company ’s board ousted Hector Ruiz from the chief executive job and replaced him with Mr. Meyer , an engineer who had been president and chief operating officer since 2006 .
While Mr Bloomberg 's stint as mayor , which is due to end next year , has generally proved popular with New Yorkers , a recent survey found that 56 per cent of them would not want him to serve a third term .

Image caption Ingrid Betancourt 's rescue in 2008 made international news
The abduction of people , either for political reasons or for ransom , has been common in Colombia in recent decades , earning the country notoriety as the kidnap centre of the world .
By 2001 , it was estimated that some 3,000 people were being seized each year by armed groups and drug traffickers .
Since then , kidnappings have declined , although the exact number of people still in captivity is disputed .
In February 2011 , left - wing Farc guerrillas released several hostages .
The Colombian government has made the release of all hostages a condition for any peace talks with the Farc .
How many people are being held hostage ?
According to Fondelibertad , a department attached to the defence ministry and responsible for co-ordinating anti-kidnapping efforts , 79 people were definitely in captivity as of February 2010 .
Fondelibertad said its research showed that of nearly 2,800 cases recorded in 2007 , more than 1,100 people had been freed , 211 had died , and 614 cases were unclear .
Fondelibertad also documented more than 700 cases of what it termed " forced disappearance " rather than kidnapping .
Its figures were disputed by non-governmental organisations involved in monitoring kidnappings .
Pais Libre and Nueva Esperanza said the dramatic drop in the kidnap figure was hard to believe .
Do we have any idea who is being held ?
The Colombian government says rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) still hold more than a dozen members of the security forces and scores of civilians .
The rebels have long wanted to exchange these " high - profile " hostages for several hundred jailed guerrillas .
Although most of the focus falls on the Farc , over the years kidnappings have been carried out by other armed groups as well as criminal gangs , often for ransom .
What attempts have been made to free the hostages ?
In June 2010 , Colombian security forces mounted a rescue mission in which two senior police officers and a soldier were freed after more than a decade in captivity .
Another police officer fled in the confusion and was later found alive in the jungle .
The most dramatic and high - profile rescue was in July 2008 when 15 hostages were released without a shot being fired after rebels holding them were tricked into handing them over .
They included Ingrid Betancourt , a French - Colombian politician , who was running for president when she was kidnapped in 2002 .
Also among the group were three American military contractors - Marc Gonsalves , Thomas Howe and Keith Stansell - and 11 members of Colombia 's security forces .
It was a major blow for the Farc to lose such high - profile hostages .
Have there been other unilateral releases by the rebels ?
In March 2010 , two hostages were freed - the first such releases for more than a year .
The negotiations were led by an opposition senator , Piedad Cordoba , who has been involved in previous missions to secure hostage releases .
The freed hostages were Sgt Pablo Emilio Moncayo , who was kidnapped 12 years earlier when he was 19 , and Pte Josue Daniel Calvo .
Sgt Moncayo's father , Gustavo , walked across Colombia in chains in 2007 to highlight the suffering of the hostages .
Prior to this , several hostages , including four members of the armed forces and two politicians were freed in February 2009 .
In January 2008 , former congresswoman Consuelo Gonzalez and Clara Rojas , an aide to former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , were released after several years in guerrilla hands .
Ms Rojas was subsequently reunited with her young son , who had been born in captivity .
What about negotiations ?
The Farc guerrillas have long said they wanted to swap police and soldiers they hold for the jailed rebels .
The rebels , who have come under sustained pressure in recent years and suffered widespread desertion from their ranks , have indicated that they seek talks that might lead to peace talks .
President Alvaro Uribe , who left office on 7 August 2010 , had repeatedly ruled out a prisoner exchange .
His successor , former defence minister Juan Manuel Santos , has indicated peace talks can happen , but only if the guerrillas release all hostages and show their readiness to abandon their armed struggle .
Does the plight of the hostages still resonate in Colombia after so many years ?
Definitely .
Colombian radio stations run programmes in which family members and friends can send messages they hope their kidnapped relatives will hear .
And any developments , such as reported moves towards any releases , are covered extensively by Colombian media .
According to a report from blog Joystick Division , one of their staffers was allegedly viciously attacked by a man claiming to be a Kotaku reader .
The writer , Gary Hodges , claims that after being assaulted and told " I ’m gunna teach you to be a Kotaku reader , " a crude " K " was scrawled into his right cheek with a " a toothpick or toenail , I could n’t tell . ”
The victim may have also been sexually assaulted , something we hope was caught on a nearby bank security camera , because that is traffic gold .
For the record , we condemn these attacks and hope that Mr. Hodges and his neckbeard make a full and speedy recovery .
FAKE UPDATE :
It appears that this rumor story could be Joystick Division throwing their credibility out the window as part of a timely " joke . "
Kotaku 's decision to run rumors is always based on the credibility of the site and the information contained within it .
Normally , we would n't post about such obvious linkbait , but it appears that may no longer be the case .
Joystick Division supporter viciously attacked , “ K ” carved in his face [ Joystick Division - thanks , Chris ! ]

I 'm Ashkenazi , and I say that 's bunkum .
I am very suspicious of racialized claims of intelligence .
For one , IQs are not fixed -- despite the claim by many that IQs measure some kind of innate ability , people with better educations regularly do better on intelligence tests than people with less education .
You can make a very solid argument that there are cultural factors that cause Ashkenazim to value education more than some other groups -- and that may well translate into higher IQ scores .
But I do n't think that 's the same as intelligence .

That is not born out by the statistics above , which show Israel having a lower average IQ than the US or European countries .
This shift to the right results in more very bright people in the 160 + range .
Also not true .
A shift to the right in the mean does not also translate to more bright people unless the band of the standard deviation holds .
Asian countires tend to be 1/2 a standard deviation above the European / American median of 100 , but their overall standard deviation is about half as small .
This means that America and Europe have more bright people per 1000 people as measured by IQ than the Asian countries , but the average Asian has a slightly higher IQ than the average European .
This is why top business managers from America and Europe are brought in as behind - the - scenes managers of Japanese enterprises , but the converse does not hold .
It also means there are far more low IQ people in European societies and America than Asian ones .

Additionally , I 'd add that comparing Jews to Muslims is largely irrelevant , because the Jews who have been awarded Nobel prizes live in the former Soviet Union and the developed nations of the West , whereas the vast majority of Arabs and Muslims live in the developing world .
Clearly Germany , Britain , Russia , Israel , France and the United States have more and better educational facilities than other places , and are going to produce more Nobel prize winners as a result .

This political season , more than any other in recent memory , is irony - filled .
So why this incident involving my friend and the wife of UNCOUNTED filmmaker , David Earnhardt , surprises me , I can't tell you .
My wife , Patricia Earnhardt , had an early voting experience here in Nashville , Tennessee , where she saw her vote momentarily flip from Barack Obama to Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney .
She voted on a touch - screen paperless machine .
Here is her story :
" A poll worker directed me to a touch screen voting machine & instructed me how to use it .
I touched " Obama " for president & nothing lit up .
I touched 2 or 3 more times & still nothing lit up .
I called the poll worker back over to tell him I was having a problem .
He said I just needed to touch it more lightly .
I tried it 2 or 3 more times more lightly with the poll worker watching & still nothing lit up .
The poll worker then touched it for me twice -- nothing lit up .
The third time he touched the Obama button , the Cynthia McKinney space lit up !
The McKinney button was located five rows below the Obama button .
The poll worker just kind of laughed and cancelled the vote .
He hit the Obama button again & it finally lit up .
I continued on to cast the rest of my votes .
After completing the process & reviewing my votes , I went to the VOTE page , hit the VOTE button & nothing happened .
Again after several tries , I called the poll worker over & he finally got the machine to register my votes . "
Patricia Earnhardt - Friday , Oct. 17 - Howard School Building - Nashville , Tennessee
I also had similar problems with the machine I was voting on that same day , although no vote flipping .
I would touch the screen numerous times before I could get my various candidate choices to light up .
It was strange and very frustrating .
When I finally got through my slate of candidate choices , I could not get the VOTE button to light up when I touched it .
I finally called over a poll worker and he told me that I needed to touch lightly .
I touched the VOTE button more lightly , but was only able to get it to work after several more failed attempts .

Need more sad irony ?
The machines David and Patricia voted on in Davidson County , TN - ES&S iVotronic - are the same machines used in the West Virginia counties ( Putnam & Jackson ) .
WHAT YOU CAN DO :
Please , if you experience anything unusual , stay at your polling place , ask to speak with the supervisor , call the election commission ( they will have the number ) , and insist that the machine be quarantined until it can be examined .
Bolstered by the fiscal crisis and deep concerns about the direction of the country , Mr. Obama has seemed to solidify the support he has gained in recent months .
When likely voters were asked whom they would vote for in an expanded field that included several third - party candidates , Mr. Obama got the support of 52 percent of them , Mr. McCain 39 percent , Bob Barr 1 percent , and Ralph Nader 2 percent .
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Saturday through Wednesday with 1,439 adults nationwide , including 1,308 registered voters .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .
The poll was conducted as a wide range of state polls have shown Mr. Obama , of Illinois , ahead or tied in several crucial contested states , including some traditionally Republican states that Mr. McCain , of Arizona , must carry to win the election .
The survey suggested that Mr. Obama ’s candidacy  if elected , he would be the first black president  has changed some perceptions of race in America .
Nearly two - thirds of those polled said whites and blacks have an equal chance of getting ahead in today ’s society , up from the half who said they thought so in July .
And while 14 percent still said most people they knew would not vote for a black presidential candidate , the number has dropped considerably since the campaign began .
Mr. McCain ’s heavy focus on taxes in the final weeks of the campaign seems to be having some effect , the poll found .
Forty - seven percent of voters said Mr. McCain would not raise taxes on people like them , up from just 38 percent who said so two weeks ago .
( And 50 percent said they thought Mr. Obama would raise taxes on people like them , while 44 percent said he would not ; both numbers are similar to two weeks ago . )
With just days until Americans choose a new president , the survey found them deeply uneasy about the state of their country .
Eight - five percent of respondents said the country was pretty seriously off on the wrong track , near the record high recorded earlier this month .
A majority said the United States should have stayed out of Iraq .
And President Bush ’s approval rating remains at 22 percent , tied for the lowest presidential approval rating on record ( which was President Harry S. Truman ’s rating , recorded by the Gallup Poll in 1952 ) .
Mr. McCain ’s renewed efforts to cast himself as the candidate of change have apparently faltered .
Sixty - four percent of voters polled said Mr. Obama would bring about real change if elected , while only 39 percent said Mr. McCain would .
And despite Mr. McCain ’s increased efforts to distance himself from President Bush , a majority still said he would generally continue Mr. Bush ’s policies .
Anyone who has watched HBO ’s Hacking Democracy and Recount knows the evidence proving GOP guilty of systemic vote tampering in 2000 and again in 2004 is absolutely overwhelming .
GOP vote tampering , caging and suppression is not a conspiracy theory , but a conspiracy fact resulting in the overthrow of democracy since the start of the 21st century .
The results of this systematic GOP election fraud have obviously been disastrous for not just this nation , but for the entire world .
There ’s no way of knowing how many percentage points GOP gained from all the legal and illegal tactics they engaged in to suppress democratic votes in past elections , but a reasonable estimate might be somewhere between 2 % to 5 % .
This is a percentage that could be referred to as a ‘ built in point spread ’ , or as RFK Jr. and Greg Palast put it in “ Block the Vote “ , the extra margin of GOP vote tampering democrats now need to beat in the 21st century to win a presidential election .
The question America is faced with now is if Obama ’s approximate 8 - 10 point poll advantage is enough to beat a built in fraudulent GOP vote tampering ‘ point spread ’ subject to the level of desperation they clearly express to yet again illegally rule this nation into a state of total ruination .
The extreme desperation from both GOP and their republican base to rule the executive office is more evident now than it ever was in the previous two presidential elections .
GOP has admitted they ’ll continue racist voter suppression tactics in the 2008 presidential election .
Their vote tampering tactics leave democrats four times more likely than republicans to be unable to vote under Florida ’s new voter verification law alone .
The 95 % + in the republican party and its constituency fostering a Christian Identity have taken their anti-communist , [ anti- liberal ] anti-Muslim , racist , and homophobic hate to a new level of extremes never before seen in the history of American politics .
There are various potential outcomes if GOP increases their fraudulent margin of vote tampering , or ‘ vote suppression point spread ’ enough to hand over the presidency to McCain .
All of the outcomes from a 3rd fraudulent GOP presidential election will yet again be devastating to the world , but likely even more so domestically for Americans this time around than even what the unconstitutional Patriot Act did from the first term of Bush ’s illegal presidency .
I suspect if exit polls again evidence a democratic win , this time at even half of the 8 - 10 % average pre-election poll lead Obama shows now , that there will likely be massive nationwide riots and protests over McCain being designated as the illegitimate ‘ winner ’ .
Americans are now more angry than ever after their legislature in cahoots with Bush admin looted $ 2 trillion in taxpayer funds to bailout Wall Street ’s predatory lenders .
Conservatives will most assuredly attribute an Obama loss to the Persistent Myth of the Bradley Effect to dispel accusations of another GOP ‘ fixed ’ presidential election .
Riotous nationwide protests on such a grand scale never seen before over yet another fraudulent GOP election will give reason and purpose to the entire “ homeland Army brigade ” fresh from Iraq that was conveniently deployed for a first time in the US on October 1st .
The Army Times reporting this alarming ‘ homeland brigade ’ states its as of yet unnecessary purpose “ to help with civil unrest and crowd control ” in subduing “ unruly or dangerous individuals . ”
A highly probable potential outcome of an Obama loss from polls this time around accompanied by exit polls showing an even wider democratic win margin than the previous 2 elections would be the imposition of Martial Law resulting from the “ Bush Administration revising Continuity of Government plans , including “ civil disturbance ” contingencies for suspending the Constitution long before the 9/11 attacks . ”
Martial Law would be imposed to insure a smooth transition of a present GOP presidential administration illegally elected twice since the start of the 21st century to the next illegally elected McCain GOP administration .
The Bush Admin recently threatened some members of Congress that America may face martial law if they did n’t pass the bailout bill .
Wayne Madsen reports FEMA sources have confirmed the Bush admin is putting final touches on plans to declare Martial Law .
Can anyone , but so called “ conservatives ” drunk on GOP Kool Aid , really not consider the high probability that It ’s Already Stolen as the indubitable Greg Palast asserts ?
Will a few million Americans stand up in revolt against GOP if they yet again engage in sufficient vote tampering to illegally install a 3rd republican president ?
Would the Democratic Party back such a revolt , or would Obama oddly surrender to a quick loss just like Kerry did , despite overwhelming evidence of 2004 Ohio GOP vote fraud later proven to be true in a court of law ?
If such a possible outcome occurs how many Americans will be angry enough to step forward to be the democratic freedom fighters republicans will designate as domestic “ insurgents ” ?
Will these American “ freedom fighters ” have enough of a firm belief in an honest representative democracy to be able to defend it without flinching against the psychotic “ true believer ” mentality supporting the continued oppression of human rights , freedom and democracy brought to US by God ’s Own Party [ GOP ] ?
If a GOP president is illegally installed a 3rd time in the 21st century would the Democratic party finally do what needed to be done years ago with the RICO act to disband the entire Republican Party as an illegal political organization from proven systemic corruption , fraud , embezzlement , and illegal use of public funds , that has been as systemic as their rampant sex crime convictions and fraudulent vote tampering tactics ?
Political corruption poses one of the gravest threats to a nation ’s economic growth , democracy , and political stability in countries across the globe at all stages of political and economic development .
Corruption scandals have toppled governments in both major industrial countries and developing countries .
The cost to taxpayers is incalculable .
Corruption steals money from social programs and services .
( Bribes , kickbacks and inflated pricing add 5 percent to 30 percent to the cost of public projects , according to various estimates . )
It erodes public confidence in government and undermines the legitimacy of political parties and their leaders .
Many nations across the globe have been forced to disband their corrupt political parties for illegal activities of a similar or lesser nature than the egregious crimes committed by America ’s republican party .
Legislation in many nations has been passed that is far more stringent than in America that limits opportunist political parties and their politicians from engaging in corrupt and illegal activities .
Americans cannot continue to shrug off the rampant corruption evidenced in both parties , but particularly in the republican party as if it is politics as normal that the Italians grew to expect and accept from their politicians for decades .
It ’s gone far beyond slush funds , bribery , extortion and the pedophilia well known in the republican party to fraudulent elections that has brought the death of democracy and the demise of our republic .
If we do n’t fertilize that proverbial [ Boston ]
Tree of liberty Jefferson spoke of , we will have no liberty left to regain the freedoms already lost … .
I do n’t see a possible outcome bey0nd Martial Law from an illegitimate Obama loss as a ‘ race war ’ like many in the radical racist Christian right desperately desire , but more of a virulent and armed “ culture war ” .
A culture war waged by many from the nationalistic 40 % cult of “ True Believers ” in America defending yet another illegitimate election of a republican president as both government and self - appointed “ patriots ” against the rest of US .
Regardless of the outcome of the 2008 election , the poverty and despair from what is now being called a 2nd Great Depression will likely produce ever growing numbers of Christian Fascists in America .
However unlike the the the myriad of US fascist groups resulting from the poverty and despair of the 1st Great Depression , because of Hitler ’s historical legacy the new 21st century US brand of Christian Fascists will continue to vehemently deny their fascist reality and their 1920s and 1930s era racist roots in American fascism .
“ It is the intolerant and blinding hatred of minorities among the religious fundamentalists that binds the fascists groups of the 1930s to today ’s right wing extremist groups .
Much of the hate today can be directly traced back to those 1930 ’s ministries of hate .
The roots of today ’s tele - evangelists can be traced back to the 1930s .
The media may have changed from radio to television but the format is unchanged from the style of format Father Coughlin used in the 1930s .
His radio broadcasts reached millions , as did his followers in his organizations .
His sermons were filled with virulent hate of Jews , communism and Roosevelt .
Pat Robertson ’s , Jerry Falwell ’s or any of the other televangelists programs follow the same format today .
Only today they carefully disguise their hate of Jews and substitute hate of gays , welfare ( read that as the poor ) , abortion , unions or any other and liberal program designed to help the poor or working man and of course Clinton replaced Roosevelt as an object for their scorn [ insert Obama today scorned by the Christian right far beyond Clinton for more obvious racial reasons ] ” [ The 1930s : Nazis Parading on Main Street ; Part 6 : The Pro-Nazis of the 1930s ]
Another more frightful possible outcome of an Obama loss leading to Martial Law supported by a “ culture war ” waged by an armed fundamentalist “ Army of God ” cult of republican Christians defending an illegitimate McCain presidency might also in time lead to the full blown dominionist theocracy the Christian right has been seeking for decades now .
Such a scenario there might be hurried along by a covert VP and fundamentalist Christian supported assassination of McCain just as the JFK assassination has been repeatedly suggested to be the work of LBJ , the CIA and right wing Texans .
My gut tells me that many others also are experiencing internal conflict over growing probabilities to any of these aforementioned potential outcomes from yet another GOP election won by illicit GOP vote tampering .
That same gut feeling also tells me why this election is being referred to by the Media so often as “ the most important election of our lifetime ” .
Regardless of the possible outcomes of another fraudulent election from GOP vote tampering , it remains difficult to foresee any of them as anything but devastating for Americans on either side of this on - going culture war .

Opinion Ireland Punishes the EU for Constitution Trick
The 860,000 Irish voters who rejected the Lisbon Treaty in Fridays referendum arent to blame for the unions latest crisis .
The stalled reforms are the fault of the politicians who for years have been pursuing their own interests at the expense of the European project .

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio urges the public to trash the Valley 's two largest daily newspapers in his new campaign ad ( above ) .
Wonder if the Arizona Republic 's strongly endorsing Democrat Dan Saban , his opponent for sheriff in the upsoming election , had anything to do with this ?
" You can never believe everything you read , " Arpaio says in the ad , holding up copies of the Republic and the East Valley Tribune .
" So when these are delivered to your house , they belong in the trash . "
He then chucks the papers in a blue garbage barrel .
The only thing missing is Arpaio 's squirting some lighter fluid in the barrel and burning the publications that have offended him .
Really , though , there 's no real difference between burning publications you do n't like and throwing them away .
The point Arpaio wants to convey is that he 's the only one you should believe .
We wo n't even get much into the whole report card opener of the commercial being ludicrous , especially the part about the sheriff 's saving taxpayers money .
He seems to have forgotten about the $ 43 million - plus in prisoner - abuse lawsuit payouts he 's cost the county .
Arpaio could have targeted more than just the Republic and the Tribune in his ad .
It almost goes without saying that he thinks New Times belongs in the garbage .
Arpaio or his minions have also singled out for criticism the West Valley View and the Scottsdale Times newspapers , and Channel 12 ( KPNX ) news .
Other media outlets routinely draw his wrath , too .
For instance , an October 12 article by Channel 15 ( KNXV ) reporter Tim Vetscher contains a message from Arpaio 's office that Channel 15 will get no more comments from the sheriff about his re-election campaign until the station " reports the truth " about Arpaio 's opponent , Dan Saban , by using " facts " from court documents that show Saban 's an " immoral and unethical candidate . "
In other words , as far as Arpaio 's concerned , almost none of the news - gathering organizations in the Phoenix metro area ought to be trusted .
And , as his new ad implies , what Arpaio does n't trust needs to be destroyed .
No Data Does n't Mean No Impact
Tech Support And " Deserving "
The Cultural Environment
We Can't All Be Blizzard And Valve
Every time a developer brings up the reality of extensive game piracy on the PC -- and recent examples include not only console - heavy Capcom but also PC - slanted Crytek -- there is a huge contingent of gamers that angrily responds with derision , citing any number of excuses ranging from the general ( " those people would n't be spending money on games anyway " ) to the specific ( " that game was buggy and did n't deserve to be purchased " ) .
Before getting into the meat of those arguments , it should be noted that there are indeed a wealth of factors that contribute to the PC being a difficult platform for developers , completely aside from piracy .
Compatibility and other development issues , the lack of a true central platform - holder marketing role , the perception of the PC as more utilitarian than a dedicated entertainment console , and other such stumbling blocks present their own challenges .
( There are , of course , related benefits , such as the freedom of an open platform , the lack of royalty rates or the need for concept approval and certification , a more direct line of communication to the player base , a wealth of distribution options , and so on . )
Back to the topic at hand , while there is certainly some truth to the notion that not everybody who pirates a game would have purchased it -- " free " is an attractive price point -- it is preposterous to suggest that this axiom can be extended to the full body of pirates .
No , not everyone who pirates a game would have bought it .
But when you can go to any torrent site at any given moment and see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people downloading a game , even weeks after it came out , how can any reasonable person not accept that there were lost sales ?
We do n't know what specific percentage of those pirated copies are lost sales , but a lack of that data does not make those potential sales negligible .
After all , we know from firsthand statements that now - defunct Ritual , just as one example , saw considerably more technical support requests from pirates than from legitimate customers on .
The tailored excuse for that game was that it was too short , or not good enough .
But if those support - seeking pirates actually cared enough about the game working properly to call up tech support and deal with real people ( people who are paid by revenue of game sales ) , they must have thought it was good enough .is just one example .
Every time the topic is raised -- be it by a top - shelf developer , or a less prominent one -- a million reasons appear as to why that particular game or that particular developer just do n't deserve the support of the discerning PC gaming community .
It happens every time , with the excuses tuned for each game .
At that point , they stop being isolated examples , and they become part of a very clear trend .
Even developers who have done amazing things for the PC community have been ridiculed for daring to point out the obvious -- that piracy is a problem on the platform .
In their particular cases , often their games are pinned as being too old and tired , or not innovative enough , or too targeted and demanding .
It is n't that such criticisms are invalid on their own merits , but the reality is that non-innovative games sell well all the time in this industry , and if people do in fact want to play them , developers have a right to take issue with piracy .
Some arguments are more general .
" Nobody wants to play this on PC " or " PC software is buggy and not worth the money " are common .
If people genuinely did n't want to play it or already played it on consoles , they would n't need to pirate it .
If they feel PC software is too buggy across the board , they should n't be playing PC games .
The sad and frustrating part is that the main effect this has is that more and more developers and publishers are simply going to stop bringing their games to the PC .
Why even bother , if the system has so many challenges to begin with , and the community they are overcoming those challenges for is full of so many stubborn idealogues ?
I do n't even accuse the apologists of being pirates , although doubtless some are .
But many PC gamers do have an incredibly quick - tempered reaction as soon as piracy comes up , citing numerous potential factors , always the same ones : it 's too buggy , the game sucks , it 's not right for the PC platform , etc .
At the end of the day , if lots of people are still pirating those games , those arguments are basically meaningless , because in those games the pirates see something there worthwhile enough .
There is also the oft - made observation that PC piracy is a platform - specific cultural thing -- that many people pirate dozens of games and do n't even play them .
If so , that 's hardly a defensible culture .
That huge base of potential pirates , whether players or not , only makes it easier and more likely pirated games will be available and accessible for people who actually plan on pirating the game rather than buying it .
Console piracy exists as well , obviously .
But I would bet real dollars ( the kind you buy games with ) that it 's not remotely as much of a problem on home consoles as it is on PC .
Take the PSP .
There 's a system where piracy is known to be considerably more widespread , and unlike the home consoles it 's much easier to see the effect -- game sales languish , while the hardware itself sells extremely briskly .
Maybe it's that piracy is less convenient harder on home consoles , or maybe it's a psychological thing , in which people do n't associate those systems with piracy .
When it comes down to it , if PC software is consistently pirated more than console software , and it obviously is , it 's going to continue to be a disincentive for full - scale game developers to put their games on the system .
You can point to Blizzard and Valve all you want , and many do , with good reason .
Those PC - oriented developers have clearly not been crippled by piracy .
But not every developer is , or can be , a Blizzard or a Valve .
In the real world , that 's just how it works .
Other companies can't afford to sit around and generate twelve years of goodwill while they hope their games turn out to be some of the best - selling titles of all time .
Not all studios are necessarily capable of that , and they should n't have to be stacked up against two of the top few companies in the entire industry every time this topic comes up .
It 's utterly unrealistic .
If , every time I wrote an article , I was told , " Well , this sure sucks compared to Tolstoy or Vonnegut , " I do n't know if I 'd find that very constructive .
PC gamers can be self - righteous and smug about PC games until the cows come home , but it 's not going to be doing anything good for the platform long - term .
For the record , I love the smaller , more niche , lower - budget PC titles , the ones like Stardock 's that eschew DRM and are less affected by this phenomenon .
Those are great games , and it's proper that their developers be praised for them .
But I also enjoy the bigger - budget titles that , just by virtue of reality , need to sell more to make it worthwhile to put them on PC .
I like being able to use my PC for a wide range of gaming .
I like that companies are starting to take more chances on the PC again these days .
I do n't like that when they do , and they run into the sad reality of rampant piracy , they 're met with nonstop snarkiness .
I 'm not even going to get into arguing against people who defend the piracy itself ( rather than just attacking the developers who cite piracy ) , because those arguments seem self - evident .
I am sure our readers can be trusted to fill in those blanks .
The PC is currently going through a great period of support , with a number of high - quality exclusives and multiplatform games coming to the system .
But in many cases , those games are the result of companies seeing bigger market opportunities on the PC than they had previously thought .
If those opportunities are nullified by unchecked piracy -- with salt poured on the wound by the jeers of PC gamers -- those companies will see little reason to stick around , and PC gamers ( myself included ) wo n't have much to feel superior about .

The following Quicktime Movie was created as part of a research project by Christopher Soghian and Markus Jakobsson , two students at Indiana University .
In this movie , the students demonstrate how easy it is to defeat RSA 's Sitekey product , even to the point of remotely grabbing the challenge questions and secret image from Bank of America 's website and returning it to their phishing website .
If you are unable to view this Quicktime movie , you may download the Quicktime plugin from Apple here .
As part of a research project , two students at Indiana University created a phishing website that appears to be Bank of America 's website .
Note the URL address of the student 's website ( http://sitekey.evil-phisher.com/sitekey.cgi).
The students have previously created a legitimate Bank of America account and registered a secret image and passphrase , as well as answers to several challenge questions .
First , the student enters their Bank of America login ID and location on the phishing website .
When they click the Sign - in button , the phishing website 's cgi script silently queries the legitimate Bank of America website and returns the challenge question from the bank 's website .
The students supply the answer to their challenge question .
When they click the Sign - in button again , the phishing website 's cgi script again silently queries the legitimate Bank of America website and returns the secret image previously uploaded by the students to Bank of America , as well as their " DaMN that works " passphrase .
They enter their passcode ( password ) .
They then highlight their phishing website 's URL and Bank of America 's incorrect statement that , if they recognize their Sitekey image , they are on the valid Bank of America website .
When they click the Sign - in button again , they display a final message informing the user that they have just been duped by a phisher .

Drought conditions have worsened in NSW , with more than 70 per cent of the state now officially drought - declared .
Figures released by the NSW Department of Primary Industries on Saturday show just 10.8 per cent of the state , mostly on the eastern coastline , has enjoyed normal rainfall , and was rated as " satisfactory " in September .
Another isolated region in the west around Bourke ha also escaped the drought .
A further 17.6 per cent of the state is rated as marginal - in the Hunter and around Tamworth plus regions including Wilcannia and Walgett - while the remaining 71.6 per cent of the state is now officially in drought .
Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald said the drought figure had increased from 66.2 per cent of the state in the previous month .

Forget lions , tigers , and sharks .
The billions of tiny parasites that make a living castrating and brainwashing their hosts may be the new kings of the food web .
By Carl Zimmer
Every science has its icon .
Genetics has the double helix of DNA .
Particle physics has the spiraling tracks of electrons and protons .
And if you had to sum up modern ecology in a single picture , it would be the dense mesh of arrows and circles that represents the food web .
The food web ’s structure helps ecologists unravel how ecosystems function — whether species go through wild population swings or stay relatively stable .
On the Serengeti , for example , acacia trees and grasses form the base of the web , with arrows rising to plant - eaters such as grasshoppers , mice , and gazelle .
Each herbivore is in turn eaten by its own set of predators .
You do n’t have to be an ecologist to recognize the lion ’s place in the food web .
It ’s the king of the jungle , the top predator .
Or is it ?
Ecologists are beginning to understand that the traditional picture of the food web is missing a vast menagerie of invisible creatures — creatures that might exercise far more control over an ecosystem than even the top predators .
Every ecosystem is loaded with tiny parasites — viruses , bacteria , protozoans , fungi , and animals — invisibly feeding on just about every living thing .
The Serengeti ’s lions , for example , are the sole host to 31 species of worms and flukes , along with two species of bacteria , two arthropods , six protozoans , and ten viruses .
In fact , a recent study in Nature found parasites to be so plentiful that , in terms of biomass , they actually outweigh predators in some ecosystems — sometimes by a factor of 20 . ( 1 )
Now , for the first time in the history of ecology , a few forward - thinking scientists are pulling parasites out of the shadows and incorporating them into food webs .
When they do , the webs then take on a dramatically new look .
Parasites are often regarded as a scourge on nature , but — as counterintuitive as it may seem — they may actually keep ecosystems healthy .
They may control how top predators coexist with their prey .
And when ecosystems begin to suffer , parasites are often the first ones to feel the effects — leading some scientists to believe the tiny creatures could form an early warning system for ecosystems in trouble .
Ecologists first began to draw food webs in the early 1900s .
The pictures served mainly to summarize what they knew about who ate whom in a particular ecosystem .
But in recent years , scientists have turned food webs from pretty pictures into scientific tools for understanding how species work together as ecosystems .
One of the main challenges to understanding how food webs behave is drawing the web in the first place .
Ecologists need to observe which species are eating which .
In some cases , a single species of prey may be the main source of food for a predator ; other predators may prefer to liven up their diet with many species .
But a perfect picture of a food web would be too difficult to assemble and too difficult to analyze .
So ecologists have had to decide how much detail they can live without .
Until the 1990s , they universally agreed that parasites could be ignored .
Parasites seemed like little more than hangers - on , with no significant effect on the food web of their hosts .
Then , in 1997 , two Canadian biologists , David Marcogliese and David Cone , published a paper titled “ A Plea for Parasites . ”
( 2 ) Parasites , they argued , might well play a pivotal role in food webs .
Some of them were deadly , thus controlling populations of predators and prey alike .
Others did n’t kill their hosts but lived inside them , feeding on their food and diverting energy that might produce more hosts .
And many parasites needed to live in more than one species of host throughout their life cycle — in other words , they moved through the food web .
To say parasites did n’t matter to food webs seemed absurd .
Marcogliese and Cone knew it would n’t be easy to rectify the problem .
Parasites may be the most successful life form on Earth , but scientists know relatively little about them because they ’re so hard to study .
Documenting parasites requires years of dissections , of careful study with microscopes , of experiments .
“ It ’s an enormous amount of work , ” Marcogliese says .
Given how little we know about parasites , answering Marcogliese ’s plea might have seemed like an impossible task .
Unless your name is Kevin Lafferty .
Lafferty , who runs a marine lab at the University of California , Santa Barbara , is a marine ecologist with the US Geological Survey ’s Western Ecological Research Center .
When he read Marcogliese and Cone ’s paper , he did not think it folly .
He thought , “ We can do that . ”
Lafferty — blond , tan , lean — looks like a California surfer .
That ’s because he is — he ’s been surfing the California coast since he was a teenager and still tries to catch a wave most days , now that he ’s a professor .
And when Lafferty was n’t surfing as a kid , he was exploring tide pools , snorkeling , and scuba diving .
It was then that he became fascinated by food webs , from grazing sea slugs to top predator sharks .
But when Lafferty started graduate school at Santa Barbara , his vision was radically changed by a class on parasitology .
Armand Kuris , then his teacher and now his collaborator , revealed to him the vast , complex world of marine parasites that Lafferty could not see on his dives .
Spurred by Kuris , Lafferty set out to understand the parasites in a single ecosystem very well .
He chose the Carpinteria Salt Marsh , a sliver of wetlands along the California coast near Santa Barbara .
Over the years , he and his colleagues created a relatively complete list of parasites in the marsh , thanks not just to their hard work but to the simplicity of the wetland ecosystem .
Most of the photosynthesis taking place in the marsh is carried out by algae , which are grazed by snails and other invertebrates .
A few species of fish live in the flooded areas of the marsh , feeding on the invertebrates , and they in turn are eaten by water birds .
When Lafferty read Marcogliese and Cone ’s paper , he realized that he was in the rare position of knowing an ecosystem well enough to construct a food web complete with parasites .
But despite all their previous research , it still took years for Lafferty and his colleagues to complete the project .
They had to scoop up thousands of snails and dissect them ; they had to analyze sea water for free - living parasites ; they had to figure out which birds ate which invertebrates .
These days , whenever Lafferty talks to an audience about his food web project , he first shows the Carpinteria food web without parasites — a typical maze of arrows between algae and grazer , between predator and prey .
Then he switches to a slide with the parasites added in and the audience is shocked .
“ When you show the parasite links added in , they totally overwhelm the predator - prey links , ” Lafferty says .
Among the parasites that dominate the Carpinteria food web are flukes , flatworm - like invertebrates related to tapeworms .
Flukes start their lives in snails .
In a diabolical twist , they castrate the snails , so that the resources the hosts might direct to reproduction can instead go to sustaining the parasite .
Flukes can take up as much as one - third of the body mass of a snail , and 17 species of flukes in the salt marsh can live in a single species of snail .
After flukes develop , they escape into the water in a free - living stage as cercariae .
Cercariae swim in search of their next host ( in this case , fish ) .
The marsh , Lafferty and his colleagues have shown , positively seethes with these free - swimming parasites .
He estimates that the cercariae outweigh all the birds of the marsh .
In other words , more of the sunlight that strikes the salt marsh ends up as parasite biomass than bird biomass .
It also means that there ’s an important food source for other animals in the marsh that Lafferty never appreciated before : free - swimming flukes .
Now Lafferty and other researchers are investigating other ecosystems to see whether their food webs resemble Carpinteria ’s .
The early results indicate they do .
Lafferty and Kuris have collaborated with Norwegian scientists from the University of Tromsø to draw the food web for a lake in Norway near the Arctic Circle .
They find once more that parasites dominate the links of the food web .
It ’s now clear , Lafferty argues , that if you ignore parasites in an ecosystem , you ca n’t understand the patterns in that system ’s food webs .
The question researchers now want to answer is what effect the parasites have on food webs .
Would ecosystems behave differently if there were no parasites ?
Some research suggests they would .
At the Carpinteria salt marsh , for example , parasites help the predators find food .
Many flukes in the wetlands need to get from fish into birds in order to mate and produce eggs .
The birds , which do not get sick from the parasites , shed the fluke eggs with their droppings .
Lafferty has found that when one species of fluke , Euhaplorchis californiensis , infects a killifish , the fish begins to swim jerkily near the surface of the water , flashing its silver scales .
This behavior makes it easier for birds to spot the fish and catch them .
Lafferty estimates that an infected fish is 10 to 30 times more likely to be eaten than a noninfected one .
Take away the parasites , and you might well make it much harder for birds to find food .
There would be fewer birds in the salt marsh , and the change in their population would affect the population of other animals in the food web .
By killing or castrating other hosts , parasites may also help keep ecosystems from flying out of control .
If the population of a species expands quickly , it may threaten to exhaust its food supplies .
But its parasites will expand their numbers as well , driving down the population of their host .
Yet parasites can rarely drive their hosts to extinction because , once their hosts become rare , they can no longer sustain their own population .
“ Parasites probably increase the stability of free - living species , ” Lafferty says .
Lafferty does n’t deny the risk that parasites can pose to wildlife , particularly when humans ship parasites to new habitats where hosts have not evolved defenses .
In Africa , for example , Ebola viruses are pushing some gorilla populations to the brink of extinction .
A fungus has been implicated in the disappearance of many frog species around the world .
Nevertheless , a healthy ecosystem is usually rife with parasites , and when the parasites begin to disappear , this may foreshadow serious problems .
For example , Lafferty has found that the fish in pristine Pacific coral atolls carry many more kinds of parasites than fish living in nearby overharvested atolls .
Marcogliese has found that when acid rain damages Canadian rivers , the parasites fall out of the river food webs even while their fish hosts seem in good shape .
Pollution can kill delicate parasites outright , while overfishing may wipe out parasites by removing some of their hosts .
All of which could point to the need for an about - face within the scientific community .
With so many ecosystems in turmoil , perhaps parasites ’ absence — not their presence — is what should cause ecologists concern .
“ The time you really ought to be worried , ” Lafferty says , “ is when you go into a system and you do n’t see any parasites at all . ” ❧

It ’s the same sentence as in 2000 : “ Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
Yet the issue that will be put before voters Nov. 4 is radically different .
This time , the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry .
We fervently hope that voters , whatever their personal or religious convictions , will shudder at such a step and vote no on Proposition 8 .
The state of same - sex marriage shifted in May , when the California Supreme Court overturned Proposition 22 , the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago , and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state Constitution .
As such , it could not be denied to a protected group -- in this case , gay and lesbian couples .
What voters must consider about Proposition 8 is that , unlike Proposition 22 , this is no longer about refining existing California law .
In the wake of the court ’s ruling , the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves .
Proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the Constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same - sex marriage .
It ’s a rare and drastic step , invoking the constitutional - amendment process to strip people of rights .
Yet in California , it can be done with a simple majority vote .
All the more reason for voters to weigh carefully what would be wrought by this measure .

Supporters of Proposition 8 insist that the measure is in no way intended to diminish the rights of gays and lesbians , but instead means to encourage ideal households for the raising of children and to put a stop to activist judges .
Besides , they say , domestic partnerships provide all the same rights as marriage .
In a meeting with The Times ’ editorial board , supporters argued at length that children are best off when raised by their own biological , married mothers and fathers .
Even if that were true -- and there is much room for dispute -- this measure in no way moves society closer to such a traditional picture .
Gay and lesbian couples already are raising their own children and will continue to do so , as will single parents and adoptive and blended families .
Using the supporters ’ own reasoning , it would be better for same - sex parents to marry .
Proposition 8 supporters are right that domestic partnerships come exceedingly close to guaranteeing the same rights as marriage , as the state ’s high court recognized .
Still , there are differences .
Some are statutory -- domestic partners must share a residence , while married couples can live separately -- and others are pragmatic -- studies have found that domestic partners do not receive the same treatment or recognition from hospital staff , employers and the public as spouses do .
But it was Ronald M. George , chief justice of the California Supreme Court , who cut through to the essence of the issue in the May 15 opinion he wrote : " [ A ] ffording same - sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will , as a realistic matter , impose appreciable harm on same - sex couples and their children , because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same - sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite - sex couples . ”

In other words , the very act of denying gay and lesbian couples the right to marry -- traditionally the highest legal and societal recognition of a loving commitment -- by definition relegates them and their relationships to second - class status , separate and not all that equal .
To be sure , the court overturned Proposition 22 , a vote of the people .
That is the court ’s duty when a law is unconstitutional , even if it is exceedingly popular .
Civil rights are commonly hard - won , and not the result of widespread consensus .
Whites in the South vehemently rejected the 1954 Supreme Court decision to .
For that matter , Californians have accused the state Supreme Court of obstructing the people ’s will on marriage before -- in 1948 , when it struck down a ban on interracial marriages .
Fundamental rights are exactly that .
They should neither wait for popular acceptance , nor be revoked because it is lacking .
These smears have been floating around in email chain letters , but even still , this really shows just how low and how desperate the McCain campaign is .
Not Larry Sabato :
The LA Times scoops the Virginia media with this column from the McCain campaign 's official Buchanan County representative .
You need to read this column to believe it .
In " humor " he accuses Obama of wanting to paint the White House black , supporting reparations , changing the national anthem to the " black national anthem " , teaching " black liberation theology in all churches " , and replacing the flag with a " star and crescent logo " .
Nothing like a little race baiting four weeks before the election ... why does this guy still have his job ?
Meanwhile , Sarah Palin brings up Bill Ayers at a campaign stop in Carson , California :
" Evidently there 's been a lot of interest in what I read lately , " she said .
" I was reading today a copy of the New York Times .
And I was really interested to read in there about Barack Obama 's friends from Chicago .
Turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man who , according to the New York Times , was a domestic terrorist , that quote ' launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the United States Capitol . ' "
Saturday 's New York Times story , an investigation into whether Obama had a relationship with Ayers , concluded that the men were never close and that Obama has denounced Ayers ' radical past , which occurred when Obama , who was born in 1961 , was a child .
It also found that he has downplayed their contacts .
" This is not a man who sees America as you and I see America , " Palin said of Obama .
" We see America as a force for good in this world .
We see America as a force for exceptionalism .
...
Our opponents see America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who would bomb their own country . "
Classy .
So do you understand ?
As proposed by the best brains the world of ' economics ' can provide , all our governments are going to allow the banks to have money in one form or another , to rescue them from the results of their stupidity .
And where does that money come from ?
Oh , it does n't exist yet , but it will come from us .
This means that the banks are being given our money , to l end to us and charge us interest for , and for us to be dispossessed of all we have if we do not pay them the interest on the money - our money - that our simpleton governments have let them have .
Do you understand that now ?
Well , if you do , are you going to stand for it ?
Furthermore , here is the law as it applies to the scam perpetrated by you know who , which has got us into this fine mess in this mad world .
If you are not good at reading legalese , just read the first and last lines
" Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report , or wilfully overvalues any land , property or security , for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Farm Credit Administration , Federal Crop Insurance Corporation or a company the Corporation reinsures , the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration or successor agency , the Rural Development Administration or successor agency , any Farm Credit Bank , production credit association , agricultural credit association , bank for cooperatives , or any division , officer , or employee thereof , or of any regional agricultural credit corporation established pursuant to law , or a Federal land bank , a Federal land bank association , a Federal Reserve bank , a small business investment company , as defined in section 103 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 ( 15U.S.C. 662 ) , or the Small Business Administration in connection with any provision of that Act , a Federal credit union , an insured State - charte red credit union , any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the Office of Thrift Supervision , any Federal home loan bank , the Federal Housing Finance Board , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the Resolution Trust Corporation , the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation , or the National Credit Union Administration Board , a branch or agency of a foreign bank ( as such terms are defined in paragraphs ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of section 1 ( b ) of the International Banking Act of 197 , or an organization operating under section 25 or section 25 ( a ) [ 1 ] of the Federal Reserve Act , upon any application , advance , discount , purchase , purchase agreement , repurchase agreement , commitment , or loan , or any change or extension of any of the same , by renewal , deferment of action or otherwise , or the acceptance , release , or substitution of security therefor , shall be fined not more than $ 1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years , or both . "
Alright , Reader ?
I will now give you another quote - http://www.911oz.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?
t=2862&goto=newpost
" The diabolical people in and connected to the regime were in for more , a lot more , to steal , and for as long as they could .
Hence they concocted a scheme of Monopoly money on the side , called Derivatives .
The first order of this so - called derivative market was a 32 times leverage , floated by – you guessed it – Paulson 's Goldman Sacks and other crime families .
This paper was issued , held , and traded by wall street , hedge , private equity and sovereign ( e.g. , Chinese , German , Arabs ) funds .
This would give them $ 5t x 32 = $ 160t to float around .
Then they wrote other derivatives , all leveraged , using batches and mix and match of these derivatives .
In one single instance that came to light , S&P , the grate ( sic ) rating agency was paid $ 300 m in bribes – as in under the table , send it to Camen ( sic ) Island bribe - to rank one of these packages AAA , because they knew , and S&P knew , and the buyers ( e.g. , Chinese ) knew that they were highly inflated .
The problem was easily fixed – by Insurance Swaps .
They were ( sic ) supposed to be insurance on these packages , so if they came down in value or the seller had inflated the vale ( sic ) , or Defaulted on the payment , this Default insurance would cover it .
The biggest insurer was IAG ( sic ) , taken over by the FED for an initial $ 85 b .
what did they do ?
Through bribery and other similar legal acts , they got AAA ratings .
So now they could insure something like $ 50 b with an initial capital of $ 1b ; insure $ 500 b with $ 5 b , and so on .
So after stealing all those insurance premiums , when the reckoning , i.e. , payback time , came , these insurers , like AIG , and numerous hedge funds runs by the five big crime families and smaller ones under their wings , were all penniless .
For even a 1 % market down - turn would wipe out their entire capital . "
Understand , Reader ?
Then would n't this seem to indicate that , instead of calling his arrogant tune to the financial world and to all of us , Paulson and his co-conspirators ought to be singing a very different song to the fiscal investigative authorities , and be singing from behind bars of iron rather than of gold ?
Very clearly , what is at this moment being cobbled together is an entirely unworkable scheme of supporting bank debt with public debt , for which we public and our descendants will have to pay for generations to come .
And this will be to supply the banks with our money for which we will have to work and pay taxes , for the banks to lend to us and charge us interest for , and dispossess us if we can't pay . . .
Can you call this even sane ? -
Yet this is what is being put into practice at this very moment by the highest financial minds at our disposal .
Really !
Meanwhile , the other shoe has yet to fall , this being the derivatives debt , which can be anything between five hundred tril lion and a quadrill ion , which , to repay , will nicely enslave the rest of us until Kingdom Come .
Clearly this is unsustainable , and is intended to unseat the existing banks and usher in an one - world Unibank under the authority of . . . yes , them again .
The perpetrators of this greatest of all scams ?
Well , of course , rubbing their hands in the wings while waiting to take over the ruins of our world , which their deliberate maintenance of low interest and profligate lending has brought about , is the family which has carefully planned and engineered the whole mess .
Do I really have to tell you their names again ?
Really , I keep telling you , it is so simple to undo the entire rigmarole , to the satisfaction of everyone except the perverted criminal masterminds .
Does the world really have to turn just to please These Demented Few ?
Do you still insist on letting this criminal crew rule the roost ?

How is it the same rotten ethics people are allowed to contract over and over again , hidden out of public view ?
If America had any ethics , anyone with an ethics problem should never work , contract , or hold a security clearance ever again .
How is it that $ 175 k does so much damage to elections and it's always only after the election we find out .

It 's not surprising .
The only way for McCain to win is by stealing it .
I look at this site - http://www.electoral-vote.com/index.html
- every day .
The mystery for most citizens is how the votes get counted , or what equipment is used and how reliable it is .
If exit polls are way off in some places and right on the mark in others , maybe someone messed with the tabulation .
It would be nice to have a map reflecting the reliability of voting machines available to voters .
I know that may get down to the county level .
And that Ohio for instance , has a dual system this year .
But comparing touch screen voting to paper ballots scanned by older ES&S machines could reveal patterns .
Patterns of electoral theft !

Fraud ?
What about Palin not releasing her medical records ?
She 's supposed to be young and healthy , so where are they ?
Answer - no doctor would tell a so called pregnant patient to take a plane after her " water broke . "
And no doctor would lie about this and risk losing his license .

Date Wed , 15 Oct 2008 17:25:09 - 0700 From Greg KH <> Subject [ RFC ]
Kernel version numbering scheme change
Hi ,
You brought this topic up a few months ago , and passed it off as
something we would discuss at the kernel summit .
But that never
happened , so I figured I 'd bring it up again here .
So , as someone who constantly is dealing with kernel version numbers all
the time with the - stable trees , our current numbering scheme is a pain
a times .
How about this proposal instead ?
We number the kernel based on the year , and the numbers of releases we
have done this year :
YEAR .
NUMBER.MINOR_RELEASE
For example , the first release in 2009 would be called :
2009.0.0
The second :
2009.1.0
If we want to be a bit more " non-zero - counting " friendly : we can start
at " 1 " for the number :
2009.1.0 for the first release
2009.2.0 for the second .
Then the stable releases can increment the minor number :
2009.1.1 for the first stable release
2009.1.2 for the second .
and so on .
Benefits of this is it more accuratly represents to people just how old
the kernel they are currently running is ( 2.6.9 would be have been
2004.9.0 on this naming scheme . )
Yes , we can handle the major / minor macros in the kernel to provide a
compatible number so that automated scripts will not break , that 's not a
big deal .
Any thoughts ?
Let the bike - shedding begin !
thanks ,
greg k-h
Doylestown , Pa .
The Barack Obama campaign occupies a storefront on N. Main Street across from the county courthouse .
A stream of people filters through to pick up buttons or leaflets .
The bulletin board lists a dozen staffers in this office and another in Bristol .
Now try to find a John McCain outpost in Bucks County .
Armed with an address , ...
It seems to have worked .
Thanks in part to the introduction of the ticket , the Massachusetts Lottery achieved a record $ 4.7 billion in sales for the 12 months ended June 30 , compared with $ 4.4 billion for the year before , and sales have continued to rise in the two months since the end of the fiscal year .
Drawing those casino players to the lotteries has been crucial .
Though experts say casino gambling and lotteries have both been historically recession - proof , high gasoline and food prices have contributed to a revenue decline experienced this year by gambling destinations including Las Vegas and Atlantic City .
( Atlantic City did record a slight rise in August . )
“ The lotteries are on every street corner , and you do have to travel a bit to get to a casino as a general rule , ” said John Kindt , a professor of business administration at the University of Illinois who has studied lotteries .
“ The accessibility of the lotteries is a plus for them .
They ’re in everybody ’s backyard . ”
The higher sales of the current economic downturn have generally drawn higher net revenue along with them , in continuation of a longer trend .
A study issued in June by the Rockefeller Institute of Government , a research arm of the State University of New York , found that lottery revenue had grown steadily over the last 10 years , with the highest growth rates during the nation ’s last recession , in 2001 - 2 .
Increased lottery returns do little to offset declines in larger sources of revenue , like sales and income taxes , that have forced some states to impose hiring freezes , layoffs and wage reductions during the current downturn .
“ If your personal income tax is weak or sales tax is weak , the lottery is n’t enough to make up for that , ” said Scott D. Pattison , executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers .
“ But any revenue that is doing well , or at least not too bad , certainly helps . ”
Somewhat incongruously , there is a thought that the hard times contributing to the lottery sales boom may well bring about its demise : if the economic slump continues , or even deepens , the thinking goes , many players may at last have had enough .
No one can know , of course , whether that reversal will be fully realized .
But a survey of regular players by Independent Lottery Research , a consulting firm based in Chicago , found last month that 20 percent of them were already playing less or buying less expensive tickets .
This is a letter I wrote yesterday to the New Director of POTUS 08 , the XM radio station that covers the presidential campaign exclusively …
Scott Walterman Senior Director of News Programming XM Satellite Radio
Hi Scott ,
David LaMotte here .
We ’ve corresponded once before about some POTUS08 programming , and I sincerely appreciated your friendly response .
I ’m a POTUS08 junky and a resident of NC and I just had a fascinating experience about an hour ago – I was push polled , either by the Clinton Campaign or someone in their corner .
A guy named Ed called from Akron , Ohio , and when I asked what polling outfit he works for he said Garin - Hart - Yang , based in DC , which I found online here : http://www.hartresearch.com/about/political.html .
At first I was delighted to be polled , as I ’ve been interested in the race and following the rest of the nation ’s polls closely throughout the campaign .
The questions started out normal enough , but got progressively more ridiculous .
Early in the conversation
Ed asked my preference among the Democratic candidates and I told him I was an Obama supporter .
Then the questions turned to long Hillary - praising and Barack bashing policy statements with the response options being “ Do you consider that a very strong , strong or weak or very weak reason to support her candidacy for president ? ” which is kind of an unanswerable question , and clearly not the point .
At the end of the conversation they asked “ Now based on everything we ’ve discussed , who would you vote for ? ”
The questions were often based on statements that I would n’t agree with in the first place .
It ’s classic push polling as I ’ve read about it , though never experienced it before .
The questions are of the “ Are you still beating your wife ? ” variety .
No way to answer with any sense of veracity and integrity .
Toward the end of the conversation it occurred to me to record it on my old - school tape - based answering machine , so the following is a verbatim transcript of some of the content :
“ Hillary Clinton knows that people are being squeezed by the rising costs of everyday items , especially the cost of a gallon of gas .
People have been paying through the roof and at the pump , and she thinks it is time the oil companies payed their fair share .
She wants to end their special tax breaks and use that money to invest in alternative energy that will create millions of new jobs .
As president she will launch a full - scale investigation of the oil companies ’ price rigging .
Upon taking office as president she will lower gas prices by taxing the excess profits of the oil companies and use that money to cut gas tax .
Do you consider that a very strong , strong or weak or very weak reason to support her candidacy for president ? ”
It goes on a bit later :
“ I ’m going to read you a few criticisms opponents might make about Barack Obama .
For each one please tell me if they give you very major doubts , fairly major doubts , some doubts or no real doubts about supporting Barack Obama for president .
At a time when we need leaders who are clear , strong and decisive , Obama has been inconsistent , saying he would remove all troops , but then indicating that he might not , and pledging to renegotiate NAFTA , but then sending signals that he would not actually do so as president .
He supported George W. Bush ’s 2005 energy bill which payed six billion dollars in subsidies to the oil and gas industry , nine billion dollars in subsidies to the coal industry and twelve billion dollars in subsidies to the nuclear power industry .
It was called ‘ a piñata of perks ’ and ‘ the best energy bill corporations could buy .
Would that leave you with major doubts , some doubts or no real doubts ? ”
And how do I answer that question , given the fact that I dispute some of the premises laid out ?
Did n’t they already get embarrassed about push polling in the midwest early in this campaign and did n’t she repudiate the practice ?
I find this kind of thing pretty shocking , and I think people should know it ’s going on .
It ’s demeaning and disheartening , especially given the fact that my civic pride was piqued by being called in the first place , only to realize I was being manipulated .
I have the actual tape of the end of the call , and I ’d be happy to talk with you about it on the phone if you want to put this out there .
As far as disclosure goes , I have an Obama sign in my front yard and a sticker on my car , but I ’m not a party operative of any kind .
Best ,
David LaMotte
By the way , I just found out from Paul Loeb , who wrote a piece on this for Huffington Post , that Geoff Garin is the head of Senator Clinton ’s campaign team and is one of the partners in this firm , so there ’s no question that it was her campaign making the call .
I ’m going to type up the whole transcript and post it here within 24 hours .

John Troyer , a newly arrived scholar at the University of Bath 's Centre for Death and Society , dug up evidence of a little - unappreciated gap in the law .
His study , called Abuse of a Corpse : A Brief History and Re-Theorisation of Necrophilia Laws in the USA , appears in the only - occasionally - ghoulish journal Mortality .
Troyer spotlights an incident that frustrated the police and the courts of one American state .
He writes : " In September 2006 , Wisconsin police discovered Nicholas Grunke , Alexander Grunke and Dustin Radtke digging into the grave of a recently deceased woman .
Upon questioning by police , Alexander Grunke explained that the three men wanted to exhume the body for sexual intercourse .
In the Wisconsin state court system , the three men were charged with attempted third - degree sexual assault and attempted theft .
None of the men could be charged with attempted necrophilia , since the state of Wisconsin has no law making necrophilia illegal .
" What the Wisconsin case exposed was the following gap in US jurisprudence : many states have no law prohibiting necrophilia . "
Troyer sketches the court 's dilemma : " Since [ the victim ] was already dead at the time of the alleged crime and therefore no longer a person before the law , her body was legally recognised as human remains and not as a victim ... Nicholas Grunke , Alexander Grunke and Dustin Radtke were then charged with the remaining illegal acts , namely , damage to cemetery property and attempted theft of movable property , a category that included [ the victim 's ] corpse .
What shocked many of the case 's observers was that even if the three men had actually succeeded in taking the body from the grave , they could have only been charged with theft of private property since [ the victim 's ] post - mortem body belonged to her parents . "
On March 5 , 2008 , the Wisconsin Supreme Court heard oral arguments as to how it might overcome the legal lacunae .
You can click here to listen to a recording - which begins with a cheery " We are delighted to welcome with us West Salem high school students " .
The 50 American states differ in their legal grasp of ( and on ) necrophilia , and the federal government offers them little guidance .
Some nations are more organised in their view of the subject .
The UK , especially , gives it special focus .
Section 70 of the 2003 Sexual Offences
Act is entitled Sexual Penetration of a Corpse .
Section 70 explicitly , very explicitly , prohibits only the most canonical form of necrophilia .
Troyer notes that " UK law seems to preclude other sexual acts [ Troyer lists several of them ] from being considered criminal . "
The niceties of the law , especially those pertaining to uncommon activities , suffer a reputation for being abstruse , boring , dull .
But Troyer has unearthed an exception .
As his study points out : " Necrophilia is that rare kind of sexual deviancy that truly captures public attention with its abject perversity and titillating , lascivious details . "

Dairy farmers are turning their backs on Britain 's organic milk market as economic pessimism dents consumers ' previously buoyant demand for organic produce .
The organic goods market at large is being " credit crunched " , particularly among new products like organic ready meals and home - delivery vegetable boxes .
Figures show there has been a dramatic reversal in the numbers of dairy farmers converting to organic farming from conventional methods .
Rises of up to 80 per cent in the price of organic feed for dairy herds mean that hundreds of organic milk producers are now running at a loss .
So far this year , farms which were undergoing conversion to organic , and were capable of producing five million litres of milk , have abandoned the process and returned to fertiliser - intensive , non-organic farming .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The situation has prompted warnings of shortages and a " mass exit " by existing organic producers unless retailers agree to increase the farm - gate price paid for milk , to ensure farmers can cover rapidly escalating costs .
For non-organic dairy farmers , joining the organic movement is no longer an attractive option .
The cost of feed – much of it sourced from as far away as China – has increased by between 50 and 80 per cent to about £ 400 per tonne .
The 36 p per litre that an organic farmer receives for milk no longer meets outgoing expenses , while the 28 p per litre received by conventional farmers , which represents a substantial increase from the 16 p they were receiving 12 months ago , makes non-organic dairy production more attractive .
Organic farmers say they need an increase of at least 4 p per litre to return to profitability .
However , retailers warn they have little room for manoeuvre in Britain 's ultra-competitive supermarket sector .
" The costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production , " said Richard Hampton , the sales and marketing director of Omsco , Britain 's largest organic milk co-operative , which accounts for about 70 per cent of the UK 's annual production of 450 million litres .
" The price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production .
There will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive .
" In this context , it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process .
The concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers . "
He added : " There is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly .
If just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non-organic production , we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies . "
The warning comes amid the first signs that the economic downturn is affecting the exponential growth in Britain 's organic food market , which is worth more than £ 1.7bn and has grown by 70 per cent since 2002 .
Despite such expansion , the organic sector still only accounts for about two per cent of all UK food sales .
The Soil Association , which certifies much of Britain 's organic food production , said it expects sales growth of about five per cent this year , compared to 30 per cent in previous years .
The charity pointed out that the lower figure would still outstrip the general grocery market , which expands at between one and two per cent a year .
" Perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers , " said Patrick Holden , the director , adding he anticipated " a plateau rather than a reverse " .
Industry analysts have warned that specific sectors of the organic market are likely to see a sharp reduction in sales .
Organic Monitor , a London - based consultancy , last week predicted a drop in demand for newly established products such as ready meals , frozen foods and confectionery .
An unexpected casualty of price - conscious consumers seeking to do their bit for the environment is the " veg box " home - delivery market .
The expansion of home - grown vegetables and allotment - keeping , which has seen vegetable seed sales rise by 10 per cent in the last 12 months , has resulted in a steep fall in seasonal demand for veg boxes .
Guy Watson , founder of Riverford Organic , based in Devon , and one of the largest delivery schemes , said : " It is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and British produce , people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade .
" We normally see a 20 per cent drop in sales in summer which lasts from July to September but now that period is being extended to from June until November .
" People are still coming to us but it is for more exotic things they cannot produce themselves and that means bigger imports .
We have gone from being 85 per cent British to 78 per cent . "
JERUSALEM - A performer with the famed American Alvin Ailey dance troupe on Tuesday said he was twice forced to perform steps for Israeli airport security officers to prove his identity before he was permitted to enter the country .
Abdur - Rahim Jackson , an eight - year veteran of the African American dance ensemble , said he was singled out by Israel 's renowned airport security because he has a Muslim name .
He called the experience embarrassing and said at one point , one of the officers even suggested he change his name .
" To be greeted like this because of my name , it took me back a little bit , " Jackson said .
Israel is the first stop on a six-nation tour celebrating the New York - based dance company 's 50th anniversary .
Earlier this year , the U.S. Congress passed a resolution calling the group a " vital American cultural ambassador to the world . "
Jackson said he was pulled aside from other members of the troupe when they arrived at Israel 's international airport on Sunday night .
He said he was taken to a holding room , where he was asked about the origins of his name .
When he explained he was part of the dance group , he was asked to perform .
" I stood up .
I asked what type of dance ? " he explained .
" He said , " Just do anything . '
I just moved around . "
Minutes later , he said a female officer put him through a similar interrogation and asked him to dance again .
" The only time I 'm really expected to dance is when I 'm performing , " he said .
Jackson said he received his name because his father was a convert to Islam .
Jackson said he was not raised a Muslim , does not consider himself religious and is engaged to a Jewish woman in the troupe who has relatives in Israel .
Jackson said he did not plan to press the matter further , saying the numerous apologies he has received from American dignitaries and his Israeli hosts is " enough for me . "
The Israel Ports Authority said it had no comment because it did not receive a formal complaint .
The incident was reported in Israel 's largest newspaper and on an Israeli television news and interview program .
" The security guards should be sent home or ( the airport ) will become a mental asylum , " said Motti Kirshenbaum , a veteran commentator and host of the Channel 10 TV program .
Israel is constantly on the alert for attack because of the Israel - Palestinian conflict and extremist Islamic rejection of the Jewish state 's existence .
Security is strict at all entry points and inside the country .
Israel is famous for the effectiveness of its airport security .
But a key element in its security checks is ethnic profiling .
The practice has been criticized by Israeli human rights campaigners as racist because it singles out Arabs for tougher treatment .
Such profiling is illegal in the United States , but Jackson said that the only place he has had a similarly humiliating experience in the past was at a U.S. airport when he returned from a vacation in the Dominican Republic .
Jackson said that since the Israeli airport incident , the reception in Israel has been " amazing . "
" We 're only here to bring positive light to our lives and the people here , " he said , calling the group 's multicultural appeal " an amazing bind you can't touch , you can only experience . "
The future for the BBC lies in the technology that can open it up to the world , just as technology gave it life last century .
In the corporate world , Facebook , Apple and Google have launched platform services that allow external developers and companies to build services using their code - but the BBC is uniquely placed to use those same principles to create a cultural and commercial resource for the nation .
The director general Mark Thompson has directed the corporation to think beyond proprietary rights management to a new era of interoperability that offers consumers wider choice , control and benefits from " network effects " - the virality and interconnectedness of the web .
In post -Hutton 2004 , startup investor and former BBC strategy manager Azeem Azhar proposed a " BBC Public Licence " that would allow both the public and business to use BBC content and code to build on , play with and share .
It seems his vision is finally coming to life .
" Four years on , the BBC is in a much stronger position to do this , " says Azhar .
" It has the opportunity to create a new ecosystem , just as MySQL [ the open source database system ] , as a platform , created an ecosystem around itself . "
Steve Bowbrick , recently commissioned to initiate a public debate about openness at the corporation , thinks empowerment could be as important as the traditional Reithian mantra , " Educate , inform and entertain . "
" The broadcast era is finished , " he says .
" The BBC needs to provide web tools and a new generation of methods and resources that will boost [ its ] capital , but that will also use the BBC as a platform for promoting the individuals , organisations and businesses that make up UK plc . "
What could the BBC create ?
It sits on a vast content resource , much of which is already being digitised under the BBC Archive scheme .
It will take until 2022 to digitise material around each programme , from transcripts , audio , D notices and expenses to letters of complaint .
The most significant part of the archive - 900,000 hours of TV and radio programmes - is likely to be the last thing to be digitised because of the complex rights issues .
BBC internet controller Tony Ageh says the notion of a dusty archive is now redundant ; in the web era , everything is permanent and everything is , or should be , accessible .
He says the BBC should be seen as not simply a programme - maker or a distributor , but as both .
" There must be a way to achieve both of these outcomes , without harming the BBC , that would massively increase the viability of some SMEs and invigorate the entire UK ecosystem .
Given what 's going on in the world , this would be a very good time for such an injection of resources and support . "
The iPlayer is one technology that could be opened up so that startups could build complementary services around it .
In regional news , the BBC could make all its video reports , audio , text and comments available to commercial rivals and trigger a renaissance in local journalism .
And it could allow people to remix BBC news footage for themselves , perhaps for a " day you were born " birthday present or a significant football match .
This new commitment to openness demands both a full and direct conversation with people outside the BBC , and a substantial technological commitment .
The BBC has begun to initiate a more open debate through blogs , but generally its communications are ferociously managed through conventional PR .
The BBC has a number of initiatives including Innovation Labs , during which the BBC works with content - focused startups ; Backstage , which offers a selection of BBC content for developers to build with ; and the hack festival Mashed .
It has already dabbled with a new generation of more flexible , web - native licence agreements , releasing its video compression technology Dirac as an open - source project .
The licence means its code is available for free to be reused and improved .
Mike Butcher , editor of TechCrunch UK , has reinvigorated this discussion in the startup sector .
" People ask why there are n't more startups in the UK , but much of our talent is inside the BBC .
The BBC should be the place that reflects the cultural life of our nation and that should include our technological innovation . "
Bowbrick 's enthusiasm for openness is tempered by his conviction that the UK startup scene is not ready for the tsunami of material that the BBC could unleash .
" We 're really in the first seconds of the first hour of all this , " he says .
" We always assume we 're later than we are , but really - the second era of the BBC starts here . "
See this excellent posting by Robert Higgs , who has an eye for these things .
He looks at the credit markets to find that there is not calamitous shortage .
“ The sky is not falling .
Lenders continue to lend at high rates , and the economy continues to operate reasonably well . ”
I ’m glad that someone has said it .
The only real crisis is the one being created by the response .
As the days have dragged on , it is becoming increasingly obvious that that the Bush administration is attempting to turn a series of business failures in the midst of a downturn –with traceable errors rooted in government policy –into a scary national calamity as a way of looting the country on behalf of the government and its friends .
Another way to say that is that this “ crisis ” is really a big fake that the policy response can turn into something real .
In the same way that the Bush administration turned the criminal events of 9 - 11 into an act of war requiring a globalized military response–which has generated more terrorism and destruction–it is taking some splashy business failures in a few sectors of the economy , failures which signal the existence of an economic downturn , and attempting to turn them into a rationale for full - scale financial socialism that really would be our doom .
Now we have Bush himself getting in on the act , warning that we will have a scary depression unless we all fork over now .
And yet , if we do follow the plan of Paulson / Bernanke / Bush , we will get the very depression of which they warn .
Good thing that they do n’t seem to be persuading the majority .
Here are some charts showing that the “ credit crisis , ” for example , is a hoax :
John McCain , The U.S. Council for World Freedom , the World Anti-Communist League , and Sun Myung Moon
( Updated below )
Meet the Press
UPDATE I :
UPDATE II :
This morning on , when the topic of the discussion was the attempts by the McCain campaign and the right 's media to link Barack Obama to former Weather Underground member William Ayers , Democratic strategist Paul Begala noted that McCain has his own problem with consorting with extremists considering his membership of the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom , an affiliate of the World Anti-Communist League ( WACL ) , headed by former general John Singlaub .
Begala noted that the Anti-Defamation League has documented how the WACL ( now known as the World League for Freedom and Democracy ) “ has increasingly become a gathering place , a forum , a point of contact for extremists , racists and anti-Semites .
” That 's putting it lightly .
I have done some research on the WACL for my Sun Myung Moon blog when I heard that Moon had been a major financial supporter of the League in the 1970's and 1980's .
The definitive book on the League is Scott and Jon Lee Anderson's .
I used information culled from the book for my YouTube video " The World 's Most Powerful Cult . "
What the book documents is shocking .
The League has served as a resource for neo -Nazis ( Roger Pearson , former chairman of the WACL , was expelled when media stories emerged that he been in various neo -Nazi organizations including Willis Carto's notorious Liberty Lobby ) .
The League did what it could to prop up undemocratic regimes and aided Salvadorian terrorist death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson whose nickname " Blowtorch Bob " was coined because of his favorite instrument of torture ( quick aside : D'Aubuisson had also received support from figures beloved by " values voters " : Jesse Helms and Jerry Falwell ) .
The big difference between Obama and McCain : Obama did some educational reform projects with William Ayers decades after his Weather Underground activities .
McCain was affiliated with the WACL at the time in which it was a nest of neo -Nazis and was openly supporting terrorist like D'Aubuisson .
How come I did n't know about McCain 's affiliation with the group until today ?

I guess this building changes the way I understand the “ living space ” concept .
Harmonia 57 is Triptyque ’s office building located in west Sao Paulo , Brazil .
The eco system which allows the vegetation to grow on the walls of the building is heavily sustained by a watering structure running through the concrete walls .
The plants grow in little cavities specially designed for this purpose .
In time , all the concrete should be covered in vegetation .
The Harmonia 57 is in many ways a living organism .
Not only its walls would be covered in vegetation , but also its pipes running trough the walls are like human veins .
The water cycle keeping the vegetation alive and growing captures and reuses the rain water .
The collected water is transported through a system of pipes that ’s pumped up in the walls .
By the time the plants will grow to cover the entire walls surface , it wo n’t be as impressive ( and as strange looking ) as it is now , at its beginning .

A multi-year National Research Council review of data - mining as a means of discovering terrorists has concluded that this just does n't work very well , and that it ends up harming and harassing — and terrorizing — innocents whose only crime is to have a profile that some database - designer thinks is hinky .
The report was written by a committee whose members include William Perry , a professor at Stanford University ; Charles Vest , the former president of MIT ; W. Earl Boebert , a retired senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories ; Cynthia Dwork of Microsoft Research ; R. Gil Kerlikowske , Seattle 's police chief ; and Daryl Pregibon , a research scientist at Google .
They admit that far more Americans live their lives online , using everything from VoIP phones to Facebook to RFID tags in automobiles , than a decade ago , and the databases created by those activities are tempting targets for federal agencies .
And they draw a distinction between subject - based data mining ( starting with one individual and looking for connections ) compared with pattern - based data mining ( looking for anomalous activities that could show illegal activities ) .
But the authors conclude the type of data mining that government bureaucrats would like to do–perhaps inspired by watching too many episodes of the Fox series 24 – ca n't work .
" If it were possible to automatically find the digital tracks of terrorists and automatically monitor only the communications of terrorists , public policy choices in this domain would be much simpler .
But it is not possible to do so . "
In a few years you might have a pill to help you forget your bad breakup just the way Jim Carey did in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .
With a high dose of just one enzyme , scientists can now erase very specific memories while you 're in the act of recalling them .
The enzyme known as CaMKII is linked to learning and memory , and Georgia neuroscientist Joe Z. Tsien and his team used it to induce extremely targeted memory - erasure in mice .
Tsien thinks the process might help humans lay traumatic memories to rest .
The researchers tested mice by shocking them while the mice heard a specific tone .
They evaluated whether the mice remembered the shock by watching to see whether the mouse froze in fear upon hearing the tone again , or upon revisiting the chamber where it had been shocked .
After being dosed with CaMKII while they recalled the fearful memories , the mice ceased to fear the tones and chamber .
In a paper to be published tomorrow in scientific journal Neuron , Tsien proves that these memories were n't just temporarily blocked by the enzyme , but erased .
No memories other than the targeted ones appeared to have been impaired .
Said Tsien :
Given the fact that so many war veterans often suffer from reoccurring traumatic memory replays after returning home , our report of selective erasure of fear memories in an inducible and rapid way suggests the existence of molecular paradigm (s ) under which traumatic memories can be erased or degraded while preserving other memories in the brain .

Of course there might be nefarious applications of this memory - erasing procedure as well .
Soldiers who fear war could be made to un -fear it , and people could be induced to forget political or family ties .
In fact , once memory is malleable in such a granular way , people could literally give themselves personality reboots .
Imagine what you would be like if you did n't have to remember that horrible childhood , or abusive boyfriend , or that you wanted to vote for the pro-science candidate in the election .

Obama and Biden take eight - point lead over their Republican rivals
Tue , 01 Jan 2008 ANI
Washington , Sep 2 ( ANI ) : Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden have taken a lead of eight points over their Republican rivals John McCain and Sarah Palin after the Democratic convention in Denver .
Obama and Biden now lead McCain and Sarah Palin 48 percent to 40 percent .
This is the first CBS News poll to include the vice presidential candidates in the horserace question .
The eight - point lead for the Democratic ticket is up from Obama 's three - point lead before the convention .
But there are still a significant number of voters who have yet to firmly make up their minds .
Before the Democratic convention , McCain enjoyed a 12 - point advantage with independent voters , but now Obama leads among this group 43 percent to 37 percent .
Obama 's lead among women has also grown to 14 points ( 50 percent to 36 percent ) , and the Democrat maintained the lead he had before the convention among voters who supported Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries .
The poll shows an increase in the number of Obama voters who are enthusiastic about him .
Sixty - seven percent of Obama voters say they enthusiastically support him , which is up from 48 percent who said so before the convention .
Sixty - three percent of registered voters say Obama understands their needs and problems , while just 41 percent say that about McCain .
And after the Democratic convention , 58 percent of voters say Obama is tough enough , which is up from 48 percent in early August .
The CBS News started polling the evening after McCain named Sarah Palin as his running mate .
Twenty - eight percent of voters now say the vice - presidential candidates will matter in how they vote , which is up from the 25 percent who said so before Biden and Palin were named to their respective tickets .
This poll was conducted among a random sample of 875 adults nationwide , including 781 registered voters , interviewed by telephone August 29 - 31 .
Phone numbers were dialed from RDD samples of both standard landlines and cell phones .

Turn Firefox into a screen reader with Fire Vox
I ’ve sen Fire Vox mentioned plenty of times but have never had any luck getting it to work on my Mac .
Until now , that is .
Not sure what I ’ve been doing wrong the other times I have tried it , but the other day I gave it another shot and it worked without any problems .
For anyone who has n’t heard of Fire Vox , it is a free , open source screen reader extension for Firefox that works on Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux .
Among other things it has support for WAI - ARIA and the CSS3 Speech Module , and is a good alternative to VoiceOver if you ’re on a Mac and need a screen reader for web browsing ( or testing ) .
One thing that had me a little bit confused at first is that , at least as far as I can tell , you need to tab into a freshly loaded page before the “ Auto Read ” option ( Ctrl +
Shift + a ) will work .
Read Next ( Ctrl +
Shift + f ) and Read Previous ( Ctrl +
Shift + d ) work even if the focus is still in the location bar .
Not sure if that is intentional or not , but if you load up a site and nothing happens when you press Ctrl +
Shift + a to have Fire Vox read the entire page , try using tab or ( Ctrl +
Shift + f ) to move keyboard focus to the loaded page first .
For developers Fire Vox makes it easy to check how their sites work in a screen reader .
Sure , it ’s just one of several available screen readers , but this one is free and cross-platform .
In other words there is no reason for you not to have it installed , so grab a copy right now .
The boy was caught on security camera at the reptile centre
A seven - year - old boy has been filmed going on the rampage at a popular zoo in Australia , killing rare reptiles and feeding live ones to a crocodile .
Footage from the security cameras at Alice Springs Reptile Centre caught the child smiling as he killed a total of 13 animals .
During his 30 - minute spree , he was seen hurling the animals over the security fence into the crocodile enclosure .
Zoo officials described the boy 's actions as " unbelievable " .
They are considering suing the parents as the boy is too young to be prosecuted .
' Difficult to replace '
The attack happened on Wednesday morning after the boy entered the zoo by jumping over the security fence and evading sensor alarms .
Over the next half hour , he bludgeoned some of the animals to death with stones and hurled others over the two fences surrounding the crocodile enclosure .
At one point , he tried scaling the outer enclosure himself to get to " Terry " , the 11ft ( 3.3 m ) saltwater crocodile .
A turtle , four Western blue - tongued lizards , two bearded dragons , two thorny devil lizards and the zoo 's 20 - year - old goanna were among those killed .
Zoo director Rex Neindorf said many of the animals were rare or mature and would be difficult to replace .
" The fact a seven - year - old can wreak so much havoc in such a short time , it 's unbelievable , " he told Reuters news agency .
Mr Neindorf said the boy had " clammed up " when questioned by police .
As children under the age of 10 cannot be held accountable for their actions in the Northern Territory , the zoo would be seeking to take action against the parents .
" We 'll be looking at suing the parents , who were supposedly in control of him at the time , " he said .
Subject to change when I reread the book .
IT IS POSSIBLE to conceive of knowledge as reflecting an eternal order , a way things should best be done .
Knowledge in this case would be linked to Being , whose permanence would be seen in moral laws , aesthetic standards , and intellectual discipline .
Confucian and Victorian mores are of this cloth , their unchanging nature making them conventions attempting to describe the way things truly are .
But another way to think of knowledge is as that which generates change .
To this end , knowledge uses us as a machine : our most passionate desires only find completion in it because it seeks and finds more than we ever will .
The book uses the metaphor of an orgy to bring this out , but what is notable about the orgy is how mechanical the process itself is , not to mention how it is part of a larger mechanism even .
Similarly , the old mores are also machines – not only do they produce like - minded tribe members , but since each tribe uses different nanotech in profusion , the air one breathes is one ’s culture .
Between the two great machines of ‘ knowledge as being ’ and ‘ knowledge as becoming ’ lies the authentically free human , authentic both in the desire to reach beyond oneself to celestial mechanics , and also in finding and loving those caught in the same predicament .
That ’s the core of the book – obviously we can raise questions about many of its contentions , especially specific claims about the consequences of ‘ knowledge as becoming . ’
I want to turn instead to the issues the end of the book raises ( * spoilers ahead * ) .
Those issues can be summarized by one theme : “ authorship . ”
Nell , the most careful and diligent of the Primer ’s readers , exhausts the fairy tales it tells and is encouraged by Hackworth within the book to write her own tale .
Thing is , the interactive technology of the book is so powerful that when it has numerous copies linked up to other readers , as well as an author within the book who is joined to a human supercomputer , it literally begins to generate a new tale with Nell as authoress and protagonist in the actual world .
Nell ’s heroic authorship makes perfect sense – Hackworth wanted the reader to be free , and consistently emphasized the priority of the human over the mechanical .
Thus , the Primer ’s purposeful self - dissolution via Turing machine , and the subsequent interaction and rule over other readers when completed .
What is more curious is Hackworth himself .
He is brilliant yet is depicted as a bumbling clod who ca n’t properly interact with other people .
“ The Diamond Age ” approaches the philosophic through him , despite its frequent humiliations of him .
He ca n’t get laid yet is too slow to realize his pants are down half the time ( readers of the book know I ’m not joking ) .
Hackworth has two strikes against him from the outset : as a staunch Victorian and brilliant engineer , he may be the embodiment of the two inhuman machines simultaneously .
But Finkle - McGraw , despite his wisdom ( he sees almost exactly what happened to the three girls ) , is only a backer .
He says he just wants to fund subversives in the discussion with Hollywood .
He knows of Hackworth ’s background in English literature and skill with artificial intelligence .
It is Hackworth who takes the radical step of designing a book that unravels itself in order for users to communicate with each other , and then use that knowledge in a continuing adventure tale to overthrow the world ’s tyrannies .
It is proper to say Hackworth comprehends fully a world that is mechanical , and that in speaking through his book , the readers who understand him arrive at that comprehension .
He , despite all appearances to the contrary , steps beyond his readers into the depth of his vision .
The most pressing argument against the above is his seeming inability to guide his own daughter properly , even though he speaks to her by reading his own book aloud for years .
Finkle - McGraw ’s observation alone absolves him : the three girls he observed directly turned out just as girls normally do .
The Primer liberates through education at the least , thus allowing one to be normal .
The state of people within tyranny is otherwise debased ; even the best are subject to terrible ironies .
However , Hackworth ’s daughter ’s coming - of - age is directly precipitated by him .
He ’s the one who brings her to the interactive theater Dramatis Personae .
Judging by his discomfort there , and the fact he knew what his daughter likes / dislikes through the Primer , he went there so she would find her calling .
There were no clues about the Alchemist to be had there ; Hackworth ’s theater experience is self - realization .
I realize an argument can be made about the detective work Hackworth is doing before , that the safe reading involves taking the gaps in his immediate recall post - Drummers seriously , but I think Hackworth ’s vast amount of knowledge prior trumps it , as well as the fact a father can never be completely honest with a child .
How is someone so firmly in control so bumbling ?
He can barely handle Dr. X ’s plotting and stumbles blindly into every trap put his way by anyone .
I think the lack of cunning stems from his concern with a still - greater narrative : he ’s not really interacting with the world like the others in the book .
He falls into traps because his bumbling allows him to figure out the trap more exactly than avoiding it .
Dramatis Personae is where he awakens because that is a world of images .
I imagine Hackworth is creating the Seed at the end because he knows at that point the proper users for it – his readers – do exist .
So why is n’t Hackworth Socrates ?
Socrates seems bumbling and incompetent but is always in command of his words .
Hackworth does grow as the novel progresses .
If Socrates had written something , would he have grown too ?
I think the difference here is that Hackworth is a poet , not a philosopher .
He loves stories , especially adventures , and has gleaned wisdom from them .
He sees people as free inasmuch as they participate in narrative .
Technical knowledge – knowing the possibilities of narrative , “ poetics ” – is Hackworth ’s expertise .
A philosopher is akin to this , inasmuch as concern with logos defines him .
But that is a story for another day .

( CNN ) -- California may need a $ 7 billion emergency loan from the federal government to pay for " teachers ' salaries , nursing homes , law enforcement and every other state - funded service " this month , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warns .
Schwarzenegger gave the warning in a letter sent Thursday to U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
The letter , published in Friday 's Los Angeles Times , was written on the eve of an expected vote in the U.S. House on the federal bailout of the financial system .
" The federal rescue package is not a bailout of Wall Street tycoons -- it is a lifeboat for millions of Americans whose life savings , businesses , retirement plans and jobs are at stake , " Schwarzenegger said .
California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer issued a statement a day earlier saying because of the national financial crisis , California " has been locked out of credit markets for the past 10 days . "
" Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis that restores confidence and liquidity to the credit markets , California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal Treasury for short - term financing , " Schwarzenegger wrote .
The governor warned that a number of states are facing the same cash flow crunch this month , but that his state is " so large that our short - term cash flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states . "
Schwarzenegger said his state would attempt to sell " $ 7 billion in Revenue Anticipation Notes for short - term cash flow purposes in a matter of days . "
Lockyer said that unless the national economic crisis subsides and California can secure private short - term loans " the state 's cash reserves would be exhausted near the end of October . "
" Payments for teachers ' salaries , nursing homes , law enforcement and every other state - funded service would stop or be significantly delayed , " Lockyer said .
" And California 's 5,000 cities , counties , school districts and special districts would face the same fate . "
The federal bailout for the financial system is expected to return to the House for a vote Friday after it passed the Senate Wednesday night .
The legislation would permit the Treasury to buy up $ 700 billion of bad assets -- most of which are backed by mortgages -- from banks in an effort to clean up their balance sheets so they can resume lending .
The credit crunch , a decline in state tax collections and a delay in adoption of a state budget have combined to aggravate California 's cash flow troubles .
" The economic fallout from this national credit crisis continues to drain state tax coffers , making it even more difficult to weather the continuation of frozen credit markets for any length of time , " Schwarzenegger said .

The truth is , convincing ghost photos are very rare , and most of the pictures can be explained in other ways — sometimes quite easily .
The following photos are common examples .
They do not show ghosts or other paranormal phenomena ... probably .
( We say " probably " because when we 're talking about paranormal possibilities , nothing can be ruled out definitively .
Yet , we can be 99.9 % sure that these are not paranormal . )
When examining photos for possible paranormal elements , we have to be very careful and skeptical .
So many things can spoil the photographic image , which by its very nature is sensitive .
Stray light , reflections , dust , hair , and insects can all cause photo anomalies .
Just because you did n't see something in the viewfinder that later appears in your photo does not mean it 's a ghost .
For example ...
01 of 07 The Camera Strap J.D.
This is a very common mistake .
Many people see this strange formation in their photos and wonder if it 's some kind of energy vortex or long - dead great - grandma materializing to say " happy birthday . "
A close look at this " vortex " will make it quite evident that this anomaly is merely the strap that is attached to the camera which has fallen in front of the lens .
This often happens when the camera is titled to the side to take a portrait - oriented picture , like this one .
You can plainly see the loop of the strap and its braided texture .
It is illuminated by the flash .
When it 's pointed out that the anomaly is likely a camera strap , some people will outright deny their camera does n't have a strap .
What is the motive of the photographer 's response when it is quite obvious that the photo has captured the camera 's strap ?
There 's some psychology here , I think , that demonstrates how much people want to possess a photo that shows something paranormal — even to the extent of denying the obvious cause .
02 of 07 Orbs J.D. Orbs , orbs , orbs ....
Unfortunately , too many ghost hunting groups still latch onto orbs in their photos as evidence of ghostly activity .
This may be because they desperately want to come away from an investigation with some kind of evidence , and because orbs are so plentiful — and because they cannot be seen with the naked eye — they are regarded as something supernatural .
It 's a good idea to be skeptical of those balls of reflected light .
It has been proved that they are nothing more than particles of dust , insects , and other airborne matter caught in the camera flash .
Try it yourself .
Kick up some dust on a dirty basement floor and take a flash picture .
You 'll see orbs galore .
Or should we assume that the souls of the long departed are passing eternity on our basement floors ?
03 of 07 Double Exposure R.F.
Double exposures were common with old film cameras .
They occur when the photographer neglects to advance the film after exposing a frame and exposes another picture on top of it , resulting in ghosted images .
In the case of this photo , it looks as though the film was only advanced half way .
Although we 've blurred the faces , it is obvious in the original photo that the boy on the bottom is the same boy further up , only in a slightly different pose .
Although it 's a ghosted image , it 's not a ghost .
As film cameras became more sophisticated — even inexpensive point - and - shoot models — they had mechanisms that prevented double exposures .
Double exposures were often used to hoax ghost photos .
The trickery was done either in the camera or later in the film darkroom by combining multiple negatives .
One of the most notorious practitioners of this hoaxing was William Mumler , who in the 19th century created many such photos , sometimes with famous people as ghosts .
04 of 07 Pareidolia , Matrixing , or Simulacrum K.R.
Oh , my God — it 's a demon !
Oh , wait ... no it is n't ... it 's a rock .
The phenomenon of seeing a familiar shape or form in random combinations of shadows and light is known as pareidolia or matrixing , and the thing itself is called a simulacrum .
It 's very common to see what looks like a face in jagged rocks ( like this photo ) , grass , dirt , water , clouds , flames , clouds of dust , visible gas — even a pile of crumpled clothing on the couch .
The human brain seems to be wired to recognize faces .
That 's why it 's so startling to sometimes see them in pictures like this .
Although the rock formation is completely random in nature , gosh darn it that looks like a face !
It must be a spirit !
It 's especially disconcerting to some people when the face , again like this one , resembles the traditional depiction of the Devil .
It freaks them out .
In fact , look closely at all of the rock in this picture and you 'll see several faces .
So either we 're just seeing things or this wall of rock is seriously haunted .
Which do you think is more likely ?
05 of 07 Streaks of Light L. It may not be clear exactly how streaks of light like this are created , but these are not ghosts of dead theater patrons .
You 'll notice that the two streaks of light have the same pattern , which was probably caused by the movement of the photographer 's hands as he or she snapped the picture .
Combined with that movement , the shutter was open long enough to smear the brighest objects in the photo , two lights in the background .
It may also have something to do with the mechanism of the camera 's shutter itself .
06 of 07 Rods D.P. Experiments by many people have show that rods are nothing more than quite conventional bugs and other flying things whose shape has been distorted by the still or video camera .
The phenomenon is created by a combination of the speed of the flying insect , the exposure of the photo , or the way video cameras capture fast - moving objects .
So , rods are not some kind of new species of insect , interdimensional entity , or spirit energy .
They are bugs .
07 of 07 Reflections M.M.
Ghost faces in windows are a common photo , but most are just a reflection of trees , clouds , parts of the building , or other surrounding things .
Such reflections are just other instances of pareidolia or matrixing — seeing faces and other familiar objects in random patterns .
In the case of this photo , the photographer sees the image of President James Madison peering out the window of his Virginia home , and provides a picture of one of his portraits for comparison .
It 's hard to tell anything for sure , but it 's probably just a reflection .
( Natural News ) Botanic Gardens Conservation International has warned that 400 medicinal plants around the world are at risk of extinction if current over - harvesting and deforestation practices continue .
The organization , which has member gardens in 120 different countries , surveyed more than 600 members and university experts to compile a list of threatened medicinal plants .
Among the most threatened are magnolias , with half of the world 's species at risk due to deforestation .
Magnolia has a 5,000 - year history as a traditional Chinese medicine for cancer , dementia and heart disease .
Also at risk is the yew tree , source of the popular cancer drug paclitaxel , which is synthesized from the tree 's bark .
But the bark from six trees must be used to create a single dose , placing the yew at risk of over - harvesting .
The medicinal properties of hoodia , a Namibian native , have also placed it at risk of over - harvest , with large quantities being " ripped from the wild , " according to the report .
Because the plant suppresses appetite , drug companies in search of miracle weight - loss medications are harvesting more than the species can bear .
In contrast , autumn crocus is being over - harvested mostly due to its ornamental appeal .
But the plant is also a highly effective treatment for gout , and is being investigated for its leukemia - fighting abilities .
More than 50 percent of prescription drugs use chemicals originally derived from plants .
Even though many of the medicinal chemicals found in the 400 threatened plants can be synthesized in the laboratory , that does not mean the original plants no longer have medical benefit , the report emphasized .
The vast majority of the five billion people on Earth still rely on traditional , plant - based medicine as their primary form of medical care .
" It is not an overstatement to say that if the precipitous decline of these species is not halted , it could destabilize the future of global healthcare , " said report author Belinda Hawkins .
The lesson of the 1930s is that any country trying to reflate in isolation will be punished .
The crisis will ricochet from one economy to another until every one is crippled .
We are seeing it play again in this drama as our leaders fail to rise above their narrow , parochial agendas .
With all the advantages of office work , working from home is a more suitable option for single parents .
This is an opportunity for self - realization and earning money .
You can pay more attention to your kids , have time to drive them to school and hobby classes and control what they do after school .
So , a lot of single parents choose a freelance career .
A home office is convenient — no need to waste time traveling and getting ready .
You make yourself comfortable in the furthest corner of the home , turn on your favorite playlist , and … Stop !
Who let the children into your office ?
And most importantly , what to do now ?
check out these great ideas .
When working from home plan your day
This is a must , write down everything in your planner by the hour , primarily when you are working from home with young children .
Walking , cooking lunch , checking email , classes with kids , the work itself .
Without a clear plan for the day , it is easy to lose track of time and spend an entire day doing housework and playing with a child or go headlong into work , and in the evening , find a ruined house and hungry kids without the parent ’s attention .
Plan , plan , and again plan !
Play with your child
If your child does not go to kindergarten yet and you are working from home , try to devote more time to them , so that they , in return , give you time to work .
Firstly , the child “ feed ” on the parent ’s attention , with whom they regularly play , read , walk , will gradually learn to let the parent work in peace .
Secondly , children can tell when someone wants to get rid of them and will do anything to change that .
Try to come to an agreement with your child : now we are watching your favorite movie together , we will put together this puzzle , and then I will go to work , and you will draw .
You can set a timer for your child to understand when your working time is up and hang on with them again .
Many parents experience a lot of stress : combining remote work with the care , education , and entertainment of even one child , let alone several .
We agree .
That can be very difficult .
But , panic will not help ; it is better to think over a plan of action , games , and activities and follow it .
If your child is 3 to 5 years old
Children , especially small ones , read emotional queues their parents are giving off and easily become infected by it .
Try not to perceive the current situation as punishment or torture ; use it as an opportunity to spend time together .
The most important thing for preschoolers is the active participation of the parent , who can enrich any activity with his comments , stories , and emotional involvement in interacting with your baby .
Play role - games and construction games .
Children of middle preschool age are very fond of plot activities , where they try on various roles .
From the floor construction set , play the scenes : “ Road , ” “ Farm , ” “ Princesses Castle . ”
At this age , children have a special love for rhythm and rhymes .
The repetition of syllables is suitable for funny rhyming .
Parents can suggest syllables , and the child can compose a continuation to them , then switch places .
Come up with lines on a specific topic or in a mix .
Create your own book of fairy tales .
Five - year - olds are fascinated by ​​creating a book of fairy tales , adventures , and funny stories .
Family photographs , pencil drawings , gouache or watercolors , or colored paper appliqués are suitable as illustrations .
Watch family movies and cartoons together .
The primary value of such activity is the opportunity to gain a shared emotional experience of empathizing with the heroes , discuss what they have seen , and , thanks to this , learn something new .
If you do not have the opportunity to spend time together in front of the TV during the working day , try to choose the content your child is watching carefully .
Just do n’t teach your child to spend all the free time looking into TV or tablet screens .
If your child is 6 to 8 years old
At this age , the main thing is actively playing .
But during the working day , it is impossible to devote all the time to children .
So try to be creative and include as much activity into your day as possible .
Get a “ magic bag . ”
Draw or write the activities with your child .
Put the pieces of paper in the bag and take them out at the right time to decide what to do : you can bake a cake or cook soup , wash and hang things , vacuum , disassemble your grandmother ’s box together , or sort old photos into albums .
Initiate the game , start it together , and then leave the child to himself , explaining that you are busy with specific tasks .
It is essential to indicate that after a while , you will be back .
Then update the plot of the game , throw in some idea , organize leisure activities , and again allow the child to work out independently .
After that , be sure to discuss what each of you did and why it brings you joy .
If your child is between 8 and 12 years old
Read books together .
Choose a compelling story and read it one by one : one page — parent , one — child .
Or arrange the text according to roles : the parent reads for the author and one of the characters , and the child reads for the favorite character .
Be sure to discuss the work and the actions of the characters after reading .
Design a photo book or travel book .
It ’s time to focus on something pleasant , for example , remembering your impressions from a recent trip and creating a special book dedicated to it .
Tickets , receipts , memorabilia , and photographs can be posted there .
Do n’t forget to sign important details or add fun travel stories to the album .
Create your own , “ I am very busy ! ” sign .
There are times when you need to get involved in the severe and urgent work so that no one distracts — fix the jamb that hangs on the site and beholds thousands of clients ; you need to arrange an interview with someone whom you hunted for a month or discuss a significant issue with the boss .
For such cases , we advise you to come up with some kind of your sign — you can wear a bright cap , or you can draw together a sign “ STOP ! ” or some funny picture that will represent that you are busy and should n’t be disrupted if something is not essential .
Along the way , discuss in which situations you will use it .
And when you have moments , “ this is very urgent and important , step back everyone ” — you can put that sign on your desk , or wear that red hat .
The main thing here is to use your sign honestly — only in the most extreme cases , and only for work ( and not when you want to drink tea in silence or watch a movie ) and infrequently .
Do n’t forget to take care of yourself when working from home .
You may find this advice selfish , but to take care of others , you need to take care of yourself first .
Do n’t abuse your phone .
No need to hang out in the news feed , especially in front of children .
Take time each day to do something that pleases and relaxes you : yoga , meditation , reading , or any other favorite hobby .
Morning workout
Start your morning with exercising .
It seems that everyone knows about this , but not everyone is ready to make it a habit .
Now is the right time .
The fact is that morning exercises simultaneously energize you and tire the children who will , after half an hour of exercise , be calm and wo n’t distract you .
Put aside your pajamas .
Even if it ’s raining outside and you do n’t plan to go anywhere , dress up .
Working from home is very relaxing .
You do n’t have to wear makeup or a dress ; you can spend the whole day at home in pajamas on the computer .
At first , especially after office work with a strict dress code , this is perceived as a huge plus .
But this “ negligent ” style does n’t help your working spirit .
You will notice that when you brush your hair , put on comfortable home clothes , and put yourself together , work is way more productive .
Coffee and snacks
A lot of people put on a few extra pounds in their first year freelancing .
The opportunity to have a snack at any time , the inspection of the shelves in the refrigerator in anticipation of the muse , and new ideas can do their dirty work .
You can quickly solve this problem .
In the morning , make yourself a good morning coffee that will prepare you for work and keep you awake .
It is a blessing to have a good quality coffee machine in the kitchen that will make it for you .
So , no unhealthy sodas or such .
Prepare a box of healthy snacks — peeled and chopped carrots , bell peppers , apples , grapes .
And keep it in the kitchen in the refrigerator .
Then , when you want to “ walk ” away from the computer and have a snack , you go to the kitchen and grab not crackers and sweets , but healthy snacks .
Do n’t stay online 24/7
When you work two meters from your bed , it seems that life has become work and work — your whole life .
An exhausting state .
It can only be overcome by limiting the time to work .
Do n’t sacrifice sleep for anything .
Get enough sleep !
Your brain , your nervous system , your immunity will thank you .
Your employer or customer will be satisfied with your excellent results .
You wo n’t be tired all the time ; you ’ll have the energy for yourself , your working tasks , and , most importantly , your loving child .
Conclusion | Working From Home
Working from home , being a single parent is not easy , but possible .
The main thing is to remember that you wo n’t be able to do everything in one day .
The most important thing is to plan your activities , take care of yourself , and spend quality time with your kids .
Follow these rules , and you ’ll do great !
Saturn 's icy rings shine in scattered sunlight in this view taken by the Cassini spacecraft wide - angle camera on July 4 , 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers ( 770,000 miles ) from Saturn .
Saturn 's rings may be much older and more massive than previouslythought , according to a new study .
The study 's computer simulation showed how theplanet 's rings could date back billions of years ago to the early ages ofthe solar system , rather than only 100 million years ago ( during Earth 's Age ofDinosaurs ) , as previous observations suggested .
The calculations are consistentwith recent observations of the rings by the Cassini ?
Huygens spacecraftcurrently studying Saturn and its moons .
Larry Esposito and Joshua Elliott , both at the University of Colorado , modeled how meteorites smash into the rings , shattering the ring particles and coating each one in a layer of ice and dust .
Before , scientists had assumed that this shattering led to the eventual dissipationof the rings , but a new simulation , created by Glen Stewart and StuartRobbins of the University of Colorado , shows that after breaking up , theparticles could again clump together in a perpetual recycling process .
Previously , researchers had thought the rings were relativelyyoung because they appeared bright and pristine , not covered with the detritusof billions of years of meteorites smashing into them .
But the new calculationsshow that if the effect of this clumping and re-clumping is taken into account , the dust would also be recycled through the rings and would n't appear as darkas might be expected .
Many scientists had assumed that we just happened to becatching Saturn at a relatively rare time when it had rings .
Now it would seemSaturn , and maybe lots of other large planets in the universe also , could haverings for much of their lives .
" Both Cassiniobservations and theoretical calculations can allow the rings of Saturn tobe billions of years old , " said Esposito , principal investigator ofCassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph ( UVIS ) instrument .
" This meanswe humans are not just lucky to see rings around Saturn .
This would lead us toexpect massive rings also to surround giant planets circling other stars . "
Our own Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune each have rings , and evenEarth might have had them once .
Earlier estimates of Saturn ?s rings ' mass had come fromobservations of how much starlight is blocked by the rings .
But the newcalculations indicate that these measurements underestimate the mass by about afactor of three , since they do not account for the clumping effect .
If the rings are really more massive than thought , thatcould also help explain why the rings appear so bright and clean .
The moreindividual pieces of mass in the rings , the more material there is to spreadthe pollution around , so the less noticeable it would be to outsideobservations .
Esposito will present these findings at the EuropeanPlanetary Science Congress in Muenster , Germany , on Sept. 23 .

Gutting Big Government
Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr wants to lower taxes and slash the federal budget
Bob Barr says the Republican Party has lost its way .
The Libertarian presidential candidate and former member of Congress is fed up with the party he once aligned himself with .
" I believe in liberty and smaller government — principles the Republican Party used to stand by and practice , " Barr says .
" Now it 's become even more big government - oriented than the Democratic Party . "
The former CIA employee speaks quickly and forcefully about his plans to lower taxes and limit the role of government .
As president , Barr says he would slash the federal budget .
He would cut funding for social safety net programs like welfare , Medicare and Social Security .
He says he would also reduce military and education spending .
For Barr , the less influence the federal government has on the lives of its citizens , the better .
He would pass along the savings from a shrunken federal government to every taxpayer .
" All Americans are paying too much because their government is spending too much , " Barr says .
" I believe in a much fairer , much less complex and cumbersome tax system . "
Barr would like to institute a national " consumption tax , " which would be applied to goods and services much like a sales tax .
I believe in liberty and smaller government — principles the Republican Party used to stand by and practice .
Now it 's become even more big government - oriented than the Democratic Party .
Presidential candidate Bob Barr
The former congressman from Georgia sees problems with both major party presidential candidates ' tax proposals .
He 's against the corporate subsidies Sen.
John McCain supports , and he 's especially critical of Sen.
Barack Obama 's call to increase taxes on high - income Americans .
" I do n't play class envy games like Sen. Obama , " Barr say .
" He would reduce taxes for most , but increase them for those who are most productive in economic terms . "
Barr says the federal government should leave it up to the states to determine which drugs it chooses to make illegal .
He takes the same stance on whether abortion should be against the law .
" That 's a matter for the states to decide , " Barr says .
Barr authored and sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act , which passed in 1996 .
The law says only marriages between men and women can be federally recognized .
He has since changed his view and says states should decide whether to allow same - sex marriages .
Crisis on Wall Street
The turmoil created by the demise of financial institutions like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch is a serious concern for Barr .
But he is opposed to the billion - dollar bailouts issued by the Federal Reserve .
Obama and McCain have said the bailouts are unfortunate but necessary to keep the American economy as strong as possible .
Barr says he does n't think the Fed should have the authority to give out large sums of taxpayer dollars ; especially since its members are not elected by the populous .
“ We need to go after terrorists who are trying to do us harm .
But I do n't think it 's a matter of sending more troops . ”
Presidential candidate Bob Barr
" The Federal Reserve Bank is unaccountable to the American people , " Barr says .
" I have serious questions about the constitutional and legal authority of the Reserve to issue these seemingly arbitrary bailouts of selected industries . "
Both Obama and McCain have also pushed for greater regulation on Wall Street — something Barr is against .
Out of Our Backyards and Out of Other Countries
Barr heaps criticism on Obama and McCain for their support of warrantless wiretapping .
He says he would keep government surveillance of its citizens to a bare minimum .
" Certainly , the government must be able to confront crime and terrorism , " Barr says on his campaign website .
" But its powers must be limited to those truly necessary to protect Americans and which are consistent with the Constitution . "
America 's foreign presence needs to shrink , according to Barr .
He 's advocated a withdrawal of troops from Iraq and says he would probably not support sending more military forces to Afghanistan — something Obama and McCain have said they would push for .
" We need to go after terrorists who are trying to do us harm , " Barr says .
" But I do n't think it 's a matter of sending more troops . "
Another way Barr would reduce military spending is to get American troops out of nations they have no business being in , he says .
" We maintain tens of thousands of troops overseas in countries perfectly capable of defending themselves , " Barr says .
" We need more focused military operations . "
Stealing Votes
The conventional wisdom is that Libertarian presidential candidates tend to attract more conservative voters to their campaigns .
Some political pundits have voiced speculation that Barr could steal votes from McCain .
If that 's the case , Barr says , it 's not his problem .
" If Sen . McCain is worried about losing votes , he should do a better job of gaining votes , " he says .
When the dust settles , Barr contends he will have attracted voters from both sides of the political spectrum .
" I think we 'll have gained votes from people who were not inclined to vote for McCain or Obama , " Barr says .
" We 're also attracting young voters who are not wed to the status quo parties like their parents . "
Barr says he knows he and all other third - party candidates are at a financial disadvantage compared with the major party nominees .
He 's also frustrated he has n't been allowed to participate in the presidential debates .
Even so , Barr remains upbeat .
“ We 're polling in double digits in some states , and I 'm doing better than any Libertarian candidate has done , " he says .
The most successful Libertarian presidential candidate was Ed Clark , who ran in 1980 .
He pulled in slightly more than 1 percent of the vote .
Many polls show Barr winning 2 percent or more .
“ It ’s a long shot , ” he says .
“ No doubt about it . ”
" I consider Russia to be a Western country and my plan is for the Russian Federation to be able to become a member of the EU in the coming years , " he said .

By all accounts , Mike McCormick minded his own business and never hurt another soul .
He lived off the land , hunting , digging clams and cutting his own firewood .
And he grew pot .
Lots and lots of pot .
In fact , when police stumbled across McCormick 's shack in the woods behind his house , there were 243 plants growing inside it .
That 's a lot of dope , yet police found none of the usual evidence that McCormick was peddling the stuff .
No baggies .
No scales .
No paper trail of transactions .
Nothing .
Police valued the pot at almost $ 400,000 in keeping with their usual way of calculating the value of marijuana by tallying what it would be worth should it be sold in the most expensive manner possible , by the joint or by the gram .
While that bears no relation to the actual value of the dope ( who sells $ 393,000 worth of pot $ 5 at a time ? ) the courts accept this method without question , and so be it .
What does one do with $ 393,000 worth of pot ?
Why , they smoke it .
McCormick is a daily dope smoker , much like another person might get home after a hard day at the office and relax with a six pack .
His wife also uses it to ease the pain of her multiple sclerosis -- it 's the only thing that works , she says .
McCormick 's pre-sentence report was quite favourable , except for the fact he'd been busted for pot before , a highly aggravating factor along with , of course , the sheer volume of the stuff he got caught with , something McCormick said was because he had lost an entire previous crop and wanted to lay in ample stores to last him a long time .
Given the law and legal precedents , the judge sentenced McCormick to 15 months behind bars .
The bottom line : a victim of MS has lost her only means of support for more than a year and two kids have lost their father for that time .
Society is out close to $ 1 million , accounting for the full cost of the trial , legal fees , the investigation and the cost of incarcerating the man as well as that of maintaining his name on a firearms - ban database for 10 years .
We wo n't include the cost of putting his family on welfare because there 's no indication if they 've applied for it .
Now , flip this around as if Canada realized long ago that its war on pot was a waste of time , money and precious policing resources .
McCormick would be home , tending to his family .
The tax on his and his wife 's daily pot intake would have added mightily to tax coffers .
Two kids and a sick wife would n't be missing their dad / husband until late 2009 .
McCormick 's jail cell would be empty and the ensuing costs would have been saved .
Canada would have one less man branded for life as an ex-con .
If we want to save society from itself , far better to throw drinkers in jail , if anyone , than pot smokers .
And to push drug abuse education on both consumers .
And to tax the heck out of both .
Anyone with a little insider knowledge can probably find enough funny mushrooms on their own front lawn to get them high for a week .
Or they can pop ' round to some of Moncton 's smoke shops and ask about Salvia .
If you think pot gives your head a twirl , you ain't smoked nothing yet from what I can read about it .
And that stuff 's perfectly legal .
So why pick on only the pot smokers ?
Putting someone in jail for smoking pot is akin to Napalming your lawn because you saw an ant .
Meanwhile , the harvest season is upon us again in New Brunswick .
To get some sort of scope of how mainstream marijuana has become in this province , consider that potatoes are the most lucrative legal crop in New Brunswick , accounting for about one - quarter of the province 's total farm receipts .
Pot is worth at least five times that , according to the police 's own best guesses , and the quality of it surpasses that of the famous " BC Bud . "
Some smarty pants once defined insanity as doing the same things over and over again but expecting different outcomes .
You 'd think someone would take that to heart .
After almost a century of a war on pot , weed is now more accessible and lucrative than ever before in our history .
I 'm not sure legal pot is a good thing .
Not a bit .
Not for a minute .
But it 's got to be better than what we are doing now , hunting people down at huge human and taxpayer expense , solely because their drug of choice comes from a cigarette paper instead of a bottle , because the revenue goes elsewhere than government pockets , something that is easily fixed .
Other than lawyers , who benefits from criminalizing pot smokers ?

Mr Rynja , who is described by friends as " taking on projects where others fear to tread " has published several books by controversial authors including Alexander Litvinenko , the former Russian spy who was poisoned in London after becoming an outspoken critic of the country 's prime minister and former president Vladimir Putin .
The opium trade is helping bankroll the Taleban insurgency , the US says
Nato has agreed its troops will be allowed to attack opium factories for the first time in Afghanistan .
Alliance spokesman James Appathurai said troops will act with Afghan forces " against facilities and facilitators " using drugs to finance the Taleban .
Afghan forces have taken the lead in the fight against the drugs industry until now .
The US wants more aggressive tactics against the opium trade .
Nato defence ministers reached agreement at a meeting in Budapest .
With regard to counter - narcotics ...
Isaf can act in concert with the Afghans against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency
Nato spokesman James Appathurai Nato's International Security and Assistance Force ( Isaf ) and US - led troops have until now concentrated on eradicating poppy crops , rather than attacking opium factories and distribution networks .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says anti-drug efforts by the Afghan National Army and police have been largely ineffective so far , but the Nato move could end up aggravating the security situation .
While not the focus of this new strategy , many Afghan farmers could see a drop in income .
And a number of senior Afghan officials who are heavily involved in the drugs trade will not take kindly to any interference in what for them is a lucrative business , our correspondent says .
Afghanistan supplies more than 90 % of the world 's illicit opium , the main ingredient of heroin .
See a map of opium production Nato is stressing this is only a temporary expansion of its mission until Afghan security forces are deemed able to do the job on their own .
Some Nato members have been wary of any anti-drug role , fearing that a crackdown would prompt a violent backlash against allied troops .
Mr Appathurai said participation would be " subject to the authorisation of respective nations " .
He gave few further details .
Nato defence ministers will review the mission in February .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates welcomed the Nato decision .
" Secretary Gates is extremely pleased that ...
Nato has decided to allow Isaf forces to take on the drug traffickers who are fuelling the insurgency , destabilising Afghanistan and killing our troops , " said Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell .
On Thursday Afghanistan 's Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak addressed the Nato meeting .
" We 've asked Nato to please support us , support our effort in destroying the labs and also the interdiction of the drugs and the chemical precursors that are coming from outside the country for making heroin , " he told reporters afterwards .
' Scourge ' Nato 's top operations commander , Gen John Craddock , also attended the Budapest talks to push for more concerted action by alliance members .
Germany has been reluctant to commit troops to such missions
He told them the Afghan opium trade is bankrolling the Taleban insurgency to the tune of $ 100 m ( £ 57 m ) a year .
" You cannot have a safe and secure environment with a scourge of narcotics rampant , " he told Reuters news agency on Thursday .
His remarks come amid anxiety that opium production far exceeds global demand and that international drug cartels must have stockpiled huge quantities .
The head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , Antonio Maria Costa , is urging the international community to " find the missing opium " .
" These stockpiles are a time bomb for public health and global security , " he has said .
It is estimated that bumper poppy harvests have yielded twice as much opium as needed to satisfy every known heroin user on the planet .
For the past three years , production has been running at almost twice the level of global demand .
The numbers just do n't add up

Read Mark 's thoughts in full British law enforcement officers working undercover in southern Afghanistan are reporting seizures of " enormous quantities of precursors " - the chemicals required to process opium - suggesting vast amounts of heroin may be hidden in the lawless region .
The UN said in August that poppy production in Afghanistan was down this year after a record - breaking harvest in 2007 .
But the southern region of Helmand , a Taleban stronghold , accounts for nearly 66 % of all Afghan opium .

US faces the F - 16s it supplied Pakistan Text Size : | WASHINGTON : The United States is suddenly faced with the uncomfortable scenario of confronting the very same weapons and military hardware , including F - 16 fighter jets , it has armed Pakistan with for decades .
The unsavoury prospect of having to take a crack at the its one - time ally has surfaced most starkly in the skies over the Afghan - Pakistan border this weekend after the Pakistan Air Force deployed its US - supplied F - 16s to challenge the violation of its airspace by US drones , and in one case , an airborne assault that landed US Navy Seals inside Pakistani territory .
The turnaround of Pakistan from an ally to a potential enemy has alarmed lawmakers , some of whom are now questioning the continued supply of arms to Islamabad .
On Tuesday , a Democrat - controlled House Foreign Relations panel has scheduled a hearing whose snarky title -- '' Defeating al - Qaida 's Air Force : Pakistan's F - 16 Program in the Fight Against Terrorism '' == betrays the unease over the Bush Administration���s relentless arming of Pakistan .
Al - Qaida has no known air force .
Some lawmakers and analysts have long questioned the need for Washington to arm Pakistan with sophisticated fighter jets to counter Al - Qaida���s and Taliban���s diffused militants , many of whom are in Pakistan���s towns and cities and are patronised by Islamabad���s intelligence agencies .
'' The panel will look at how the F - 16 program fits into the broader US strategy in the fight against terrorism as well as into the overall US relationship with Pakistan , '' a notification from the sub - committee read .
The House sub - committee is lead by Gary Ackerman , a known critic of the administration���s relentless pandering of Pakistan with military supplies .
He and other lawmakers have questioned the administration���s recent decisions to provide funding for mid-life upgrades to F - 16s , especially after government audits said Pakistan has been using US military aid to bulk up its forces against India rather than use it for counterterrorism .
In July , the Bush administration sought to shift $ 226.5 million in US counterterrorism aid for the F - 16 upgrades .
Ackerman said the subcommittee will seek witness testimony about the ' ' complete scope of the F - 16 program with Pakistan including the number of planes , updates made to existing planes , proposed armaments , schedule of delivery and source of payment . ''
In addition , because Congress has previously provided Pakistan with significant amounts of Foreign Military Financing ( FMF ) for counterterrorism and law enforcement activities against al - Qaida and the Taliban , the subcommittee will seek testimony on how these planes contribute to Pakistan���s efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremism , and how the use of additional FMF to pay for mid-life updates to Pakistan���s existing F - 16 fleet enhances those efforts .
The subcommittee is also expected to examine what counterterrorism equipment or programs were foregone as a result of the July 16 , 2008 , reprogramming request .
Fearful of a Congressional squeeze on further F - 16 supplies and upgrades , an unnamed senior Pakistani official in Washington briefed US and Pakistani journalists on Friday on the central role the jets were playing in the war on terror .
Pakistan , he said , has flown nearly 100 missions during three weeks in August that produced some 500 - 550 Taliban casualties .
But the PAF needed night - flying capability because the militants were regrouping in the night .
There is a great deal of skepticism about Pakistan using F - 16s against militants , and the body count it keeps producing .
Several accounts from the region describe friendly , fraternal ties between the Pakistani military and Taliban fighters .
On Sunday , the Pakistani media reported tribal sources as saying a PAF jets were seen patrolling the skies on the country���s western borders with Afghanistan in the afternoon , soon after a US predator was seen flying in the area .
'' Neither the CIA - operated Predator nor the Pakistani jet fighter took any offensive action as the two planes didn���t encounter each other , '' a report in the Pakistani newspaper The News , said .
Pakistan���s army chief Pervez Kiyani has vowed to defend the country against US incursions '' at all costs . ''
The scientific method is a painstaking process of observing nature , asking questions , formulating testable hypotheses , conducting experiments and collecting data … and then sometimes just making stuff up when reality does n't match your expectations .
Or maybe it just seems that way when you 're reading through the retraction notices that scientific journals are posting with greater and greater frequency .
There has been a 10 - fold increase in the percentage of scientific papers retracted because of fraud since 1975 , according to a study published in 2012 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Among the more than 2,000 retracted life science papers that researchers reviewed in this study , only about 20 percent were retracted because of honest errors .
A whopping 70 percent were pulled as a result of scientific misconduct — that is , lying , cheating and / or stealing .
A retraction implies that the paper is flawed , that it should never have been published and that the presented results should n't be considered trustworthy .
Unfortunately , while you can scrub a paper from a journal , you can't always erase it from public consciousness .
One of the most notorious papers that has been retracted is the fraudulent 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield proposing that the MMR vaccine might cause autism .
A blog called Retraction Watch follows the occasionally humorous — and sometimes scandalous — world of scientific retractions in great detail .
Below are some notable retractions from 2015 , some inspired by Retraction Watch .
5 . Plagiarism guidelines retracted for … plagiarism
You can add this one to annals of irony , along with the fire station that burnt down .
The Indian Journal of Dermatology wanted to take a tough stance against plagiarism , but the editors hardly scratched the surface with a paper containing a set of plagiarism guidelines for scientists .
The paper was " written " by Indian researcher Thorakkal Shamim , but it contained a generous amount of text lifted from a dissertation by an Iranian graduate student named Mehdi Mokhtari .
Apparently , several years ago , Mokhtari had sent Shamim , an international expert on plagiarism , a series of questionnaires to gather information he needed for his dissertation , according to Retraction Watch .
It was the first of these questionnaires that became the basis of Shamim 's article .
One of Mokhtari 's professors , Kamran Yazdani , noticed the act of plagiarism , and the journal promptly retracted this piece in March 2015 .

4. Nein , Nicht Mit Meinem Software ( No , Not with My Software ! )
Sometimes papers are retracted not for scientific misconduct but rather for what a journal considers to be poor sportsmanship .
That seems to have been the case when the publisher BioMed Central retracted a paper by German scientist Gangolf Jobb after he announced on his website that , as of October 2015 , he would no longer license his software for use by scientists working in countries that he deemed to be too friendly to immigrants .
Irony alert :
The software , called Treefinder , tracks the evolutionary relationships among species — relationships that exist , of course , because nature knows no borders .
Immigrant - friendly countries , in Jobb 's mind , include France , Great Britain and the fatherland , Germany .
What about the United States ?
Jobb banned U.S. scientists from using the software back in February 2015 , citing U.S. imperialism .
Jobb described his software in a 2004 article in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology .
The paper has been cited hundreds of times by other scientists , a clear indication of its importance to the field of evolutionary biology .
But Jobb's October announcement — affecting scientists also in Austria , Belgium , Denmark , the Netherlands and Sweden ( but mercifully sparing Lichtenstein ) — was the last straw for BioMed Central .
The publisher 's retraction notice states that Jobb 's decision " breaches the journal 's editorial policy on software availability which has been in effect since the time of publication . "
In his defense , Jobb explains on his website that it is his software ; he can license it any way he pleases ; and he is frustrated by the current academic culture , which he thinks makes it difficult for young researchers to establish a career and make a decent living .
Scientists residing in the offending countries can still use the software , Jobb explains .
They merely need to ( warning , irony alert # 2 ) move to a country less accepting of immigrants .
3. Grizzly details of bears with diabetes
Grizzly bears become diabetics during hibernation , which enables them to survive on the fat reserves they accumulate in the summer and fall … maybe .
The fascinating and widely reported results of this study , published in the prestigious journal Cell Metabolism , are now being called into question with the revelation that one study author at the biotech company Amgen manipulated data .
The journal retracted the article in September 2015 at Amgen 's request .
Six of the paper 's 12 authors are from Amgen , including senior author Kevin Corbit , and it is not clear who the offending person was ; the retraction notice merely says that that person " is no longer employed by Amgen . "
The Wall Street Journal reported that Corbit was let go from Amgen for fabricating data on what Corbit himself described as " another matter . "
Amgen is concerned about this , and The Wall Street Journal is reporting on this , because the findings , if true , could have significant implications for understanding both the evolutionary cause for diabetes and a drug pathway to treat it .
The co-authors on the study from Washington State University and the University of Idaho have said they remain confident of the core result and are now repeating the study .
The outcome certainly bears watching .

2. Shroud lifted on colorful Italian engineer
Alberto Carpinteri has n't garnered much international attention , but he 's infamous in Italy for a series of fantastical papers with topics as disparate as the Shroud of Turin and cold fusion .
As the director of the Italian National Institute of Metrological Research ( INRIM ) in Turin , Carpinteri had planned to put some of his institution 's funding toward a disputed form of nuclear fission called piezonuclear , in which compressing solids can result in nuclear fission without producing nuclear waste or gamma rays .
More than 1,000 scientists disagreed with the idea , and the Italian government backed down from funding the project , as reported in 2012 in the journal Nature .
Those dissenting scientists may be reassured by the fact that 11 of Carpinteri 's papers were retracted this year .
All are from a journal Carpinteri once edited , called Meccanica , and , according to the retraction notices , all have been pulled because " the editorial process had been compromised . "
Among the papers were four that support the theory of piezonuclear energy , including one that attempted to marry the piezonuclear concept with the similarly disputed theory of cold fusion : " Cold Nuclear Fusion Explained by Hydrogen Embrittlement and Piezonuclear Fissions in Metallic Electrodes . "
Among the more widely reported of Carpinteri 's retracted studies was his revelation that the Shroud of Turin — a piece of linen that some believe was the burial shroud of Jesus , but which , based on radiocarbon dating , appears to be from the 13th century — does indeed date back to the year of Jesus ' death in 33 A.D. Carpinteri claimed to have determined that an earthquake in 33 A.D. of at least 8.3 magnitude could have generated neutron radiation from the earth 's crust ( again , based on the piezonuclear theory ) to produce the image from the crucified man 's body .
The same earthquake would have increased the amount of carbon - 14 isotopes found on the linen , thus throwing off the radiocarbon dating , he said .
No word yet on whether cold fusion could have produced the shroud 's image .
1. Gay canvassers change minds
The highest - profile retraction of 2015 comes from the journal Science , for a paper stating that gay door - to - door canvassers could sway the opinions of voters who are opposed to same - sex marriage with just a short , face - to - face discussion about the issue .
[ I Don't : 5 Myths About Marriage ]
It 's worth noting up front that most results from psychology - based studies either can't be reproduced or are flat - out wrong .
That 's not an opinion , but actually the result of a study published in August 2015 in Science — by psychologists ! — that found the majority of published psychology studies are plagued by poor methodology and statistics .
If the results sound too good to be true , they probably are n't .
The study on gay canvassers , published in December 2014 , made the remarkable suggestion that long - standing bias and prejudice could be overturned in just a few minutes of conversation .
As such , the results were widely reported in the news media , including Live Science .
But the whole thing had imploded by May 2015 , when other researchers not only could n't replicate the study but also found evidence that the data were cooked .
The first author , Michael LaCour , was a graduate student at the University of California , Los Angeles , and the study was his graduate thesis .
The senior author was LaCour 's advisor at Columbia University , Donald Green .
Green called for the retraction once he learned that LaCour could n't provide him with much of the raw data in question .
" There was a mountain of fabrication , " Green told The Huffington Post in May , distancing himself from the work .
Prior to the retraction , Princeton University had offered LaCour a position as an assistant professor , but it has since revoked that offer .
LaCour subsequently told the New York Times that he may have erred in methodology , but not in the results .
In any case , it likely will take more than a short conversation to convince skeptics that most psychology studies are robust .

Until a few days ago , Britain was admired and respected by the average Icelander .
But the UK's moves to seize the assets of this isolated European state have provoked a backlash of feeling and escalating resentment .
" They treated us like terrorists . "
You would n't like him when he 's angry Talk to the people , the government , the media , in fact anybody in Iceland , and that is the overwhelming feeling about Britain these days .
The collapse of Iceland 's banking system - one in which many Britons had a stake - is the reason for this resentment .
In a bid to claw back some of the money , the British government seized Icelandic assets in the UK under the Anti-terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 .
The die was cast .
Your average Icelander draws the line at being called a terrorist .
Within days the British have gone from being friends to arch foes .
British folk may have been too preoccupied to notice but sharp words have been flying across the North Atlantic .
" It 's really simple , " says a lawyer in Iceland .
" Those that I have spoken to are determined not to go to the UK any time soon , if ever . "
Icy words Public enemy number one is the UK Prime Minister himself .
A few days ago , Iceland 's health minister threw diplomatic convention to the wind when he attacked Gordon Brown on public radio .
Bemusement on the streets of Reykjavik last week " Gordon Brown made the calculated decision that to raise his ratings in the polls , it would be ideal to attack Iceland .
This has been made very clear , " said the minister , Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson .
And in an echo of the cod wars that blighted relations between these two countries between the 1950s and the 70s , Icelanders have started fighting back .
" Ordinary Icelanders are no more responsible for the risk - seeking businessmen who happen to hold our passport than the people of north London are responsible for the destructive behaviour of the talented Amy Winehouse , " said Icelandic professor Eirikur Bergmann Einarsson in the Guardian .
" And even though most of us still enjoy most things British , we are furious with the UK government . "
For Icelanders , it is all about reputation .
This small country of 300,000 people feels it has spent years building a name for itself and is finally being taken seriously by the rest of the world .
It 's even hoping to get a seat on the next UN Security Council .
Rebirth of cool Many British people had been seduced by the charms of this exotic , distant Nordic neighbour .
The Blue Lagoon is a tourist magnet As an Icelandic journalist working in the UK , I 've become used to the mutual admiration that has grown between the two countries .
Icelanders liked Britain and flocked here for the culture , shopping , football and the people .
In turn , young Brits have developed a curiosity about this far - flung European nation .
It has become a mini - break destination and British stag parties - often reviled by foreign host countries - were largely welcomed because Icelanders are known as party animals .
Icelandic music - with street cred stars such as Bjork and Sigur Ros - and culture is being exported to the UK like never before .
Now London , the once - popular destination for intrepid Icelanders , is bottom of the list .
Those who do make the journey will find British intrigue has turned to pity .
Where once people were impressed to meet an Icelander ( there are not that many of us ) , now we are greeted with a sorrowful " poor you " .
In just a few days all the good in the relations between the two nations in three decades disappeared
Blogger Stefan Fridrik Stefansson
More reaction from Icelandic bloggers
But there 's no chance of these compassionate sentiments being returned .
To this self - declared peaceful nation it is incomprehensible that the UK government used anti-terrorism laws to freeze the assets of its banks in Britain .
They even blame the British for precipitating the downfall of its biggest bank , Kaupthing , by their hasty and draconian actions .
Icelanders are not blind to the fact that this mess they find themselves in is largely of their own making .
And there is sympathy for the British savers who have been locked out of their bank accounts .
But for Iceland it is about survival - many inhabitants have lost not just savings but jobs and pensions and now face years of paying back the banks ' debts .
Gunboat fire
For those with long memories , there 's a sense of deja vu about the fallout .
1976 : Foreign Office minister Roy Hattersley meets Iceland 's prime minister to talk about the cod war
The cod wars between the two countries that started in the 50s came to a head in the mid-70s when an Icelandic gunboat opened fire on a British ship after a clash of boats within Iceland 's territorial waters .
Iceland eventually came out on top , winning the right to keep British fishing vessels outside its 200 - mile exclusion zone .
Gudni Th Johannesson , a history professor at Reykjavik University , says there are parallels between the fishing and the financial crises .
The hostilities between the two nations dominated the agenda in Iceland then as it does now , and there is the same anger on the streets that this tiny nation is being attacked by the might of the British , he says .
THE COD WARS Series of confrontations between 1958 and 1976 over fishery rights
Ships rammed in third and last cod war , Nov 75 - June 76 Ended when UK accepted expansion of Iceland 's territorial waters UK felt forced to accept after pressure from Nato In the 70s , the UK embassy in Reykjavik received threats from angry Icelanders .
Now it is the turn of the Icelandic embassy in London to be the recipient of rude and threatening phone calls from British savers and investors .
But there 's a long way to go before any shots are fired .
Mr Johannesson stresses the situation is a far cry from the anger of the cod wars .
" It is a miracle that the UK did not sink one of Iceland 's ships and lives were not lost .
Now of course it is all about the money . "
While some seem to harbour resentment against Britain per se , he says most Icelanders are capable of making the distinction between the authorities and the man in the street .
" Anyone who gets to know the British people knows they are gentle souls with a great sense of humour . "
It 's an important distinction and many Icelanders are at pains to stress they do not bear any ill feelings towards the British public .
In fact , with the economy in a critical condition , Icelanders will welcome Brits with pounds to spend .
The cost of flights has risen slightly but with the currency , the krona , in freefall this once cripplingly expensive destination has become more affordable .
At £ 3 for a pint of beer , your average Londoner and Reykjaviker might even feel kindred spirits .
Below is a selection of your comments .
As an Icelander living in the Netherlands I have been able to view these events from afar and I must say that the British tabloids ( and the PM ) have conveniently forgotten to correct a misunderstanding ( read : " lie " ) on behalf of Alistair Darling :
The Icelandic government never stated that they would not honour their obligations to the owners of the Icesave savings accounts .
We are all mad at the greedy bunch that owned the banks and we are all mad at the government for not keeping a better control of them .
However , we are furious at the UK government for kicking us while we are down and that we will not forget in a long time .
We will not forget the treatment some Icelandic nationals are receiving in the UK these days :
One woman received threats from her neighbours , just for being Icelandic and my cousin got verbally abused by the staff of her phone company when she wanted to change her subscription from pre-paid to account .
I hope you never have to feel so disgraced and insulted as these women .
Arna Hrund , Groningen , Netherlands
It was NOT anti-terror legislation used .
The legislation used was from the Anti-terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 .
I believe the specific laws were from the Crime section of that bill .
Vinny R , London Perhaps the UK need to start looking at the education system a bit more if you lot and your politicians are unable to grasp the simplest of English .
If at any point our PM said we had no intention of paying our debts , that must have happened in a parallel universe , because since this happened the message from Reykjavik , and in the Queen 's English no less , has been , that Iceland is not and will not now , or ever , walk away from its debts .
So once again the gullible English public has fallen for a cheap stunt by the man who ironically as chancellor presided over this bank mess and allowed this to happen on his watch .
Jon Gunnarsson , Reykjavik
The British government made the right move in freezing the Landsbanki assets .
Icelanders had " no intention of honouring their compensation obligations " - this is theft in the day light .
Valery , Aberdeen , Scotland
What do the Icelandic people think we should have done ?
Many thousands of ordinary people in the UK sank their life savings or a good proportion of them into Icelandic banks which , I clearly remember , gave guarantees of repayment in the event of default .
Whatever legal instrument Brown used to freeze Icelandic assets is irrelevant because he did the right thing .
Any talk from some quarters about him doing it for his poll ratings is just pure claptrap from political opponents .
If Icelanders wish to turn it into a personal thing then so be it .
Bruce , London I was an Icesave customer until about 10 months ago newspaper stories indicated that Iceland was in trouble - their credit rating ( Standard and Poor ) was reduced .
But , people liked their high interest rates and ignored the warning signs .
If people took the risk , they should take the responsibility , and not blame Iceland .
Helen , Devon
To say that I was surprised when Mr Brown acted in such a manner would be an understatement - to see T - shirts with threats to attack my peaceful country makes me horrified .
Why did Mr Brown decide to take this action , a typical bully 's reaction to any problem : pick on the smallest kid at school ?
Especially since the Icelandic government had every intention of honouring their obligations towards the banks and their customers .
See , there was never any talk of not doing so - someone has either made a huge translation error or misunderstood things on purpose .
Somehow the latter seems more likely .
I think Mr Brown made a calculated choice and decided that it would be a good political move to attack Iceland publicly - " see how big and brave I am " - and it seems to have worked for him , at least no - one is pointing out just how badly he has messed up in his own country .
Gudrun , Reykjavik , Iceland
It seems to be a common misconception that the Icelandic government refused to hold up to their obligations regarding savings in foreign branches of our banking system .
They have never said anything of that kind so how Brown and Darling could " misunderstand " it so horribly is simply beyond my understanding .
A plot by desperate politicians to divert anger from themselves is my guess .
Sunna , Reykjavik , Iceland I was in Iceland last week , as I am frequently .
On the crucial Sunday , when the sterling exchange rate leapt to 278 and beer became affordable , the Icelanders were dazed and bewildered .
When Gordon Brown came out with his astonishing threat - bypassing the advice from the Foreign Office as usual , and prompting a very dignified riposte from the Icelandic PM - he became public enemy number one and the blitz spirit took over .
When the daughter of a friend reported in distress that there were T - shirts in London emblazoned with " Bomb Iceland " I had to explain that this too was anti-Brown - he does n't have the Falklands or Iraq to win points from , so he is taking it out on our closest friend .
I am with Icelanders in Edinburgh this week , and the blitz spirit has turned to steadfast determination .
This tiny country has survived worse crises , and we are still good friends .
Tom Burnham , Jedburgh , Scotland Surely the tourism cuts both ways ?
We have not had a holiday this year , so my wife and I were actually planning to book a long weekend visit to Iceland in November or December .
However , our our entire savings were in an Icesave account , so we cannot book anything now until at least we find out what is happening with our savings .
I 've heard that it may take up to three months to reclaim our savings , so it looks like we will not be going anywhere soon .
Angus , Scotland
To the people of Iceland :
We do n't like the Brown government 's use and abuse of anti-terrorist laws any more than you do - please accept the apologies of normal free - thinking British people .
Howard , London , UK So Icelanders think they have nothing to do with what their government does ?
Ignoring what politicians do and not being politically active is giving them freedom to do what they want .
We are all responsible for our governments , an ugly truth , like it or not .
Sandra , Gloucester Sandra , the Icelandic public was held in the dark of how the system was running .
There were multiple red alerts going on which our government and the wealthy hushed down .
We are ready to take fair responsibility towards those failures .
Having the UK PM treat us like terrorists and devalue the assets / investments the Icelandic nation has to get out of this mess however does not go down well and is by far from fair .
Your PM alone has caused us years to come of suffering and blatantly just for a few more votes .
I have noticed many despicable politicians through my life but Gordon Brown just jumped up to number one on that list .
Gunnar , Kopavogur , Iceland
As someone who transferred funds out of Icesave on the Friday before it went bust , had the transaction " cleared and processed " and then saw the funds transferred back by way of " posting correction " , I do not have a particularly high regard for Icelandic bankers .
I would not have minded so much if they had not actually stated that the transaction would be processed ; that would at least have been honest .
As I have said jokingly to a number of people since , if there was a plug on the island , I think we should pull it out and scuttle it into the bottom of the Atlantic .
Neil , Aberdeen
We went on our honeymoon to Iceland in June and without exception we found the Icelandic people to be friendly and welcoming .
It is a beautiful country too .
I moved my ISA ( £ 10 k ) to Icesave in August because they were good rates and I had faith in Landsbanki , when the news of problems emerged I did not move my money because I thought I was covered by the Bank Guarantee scheme .
The Icelandic Government then said that they would not honour this , so I believe our government had to step in and guarantee those savings .
It is also obvious that Iceland has a tiny population and its people should not have to be paying for this for years to come .
This was a problem created by all the wealthy nations not regulating finance properly , therefore we should all chip in so there is not a disproportionate impact on any one nation .
Ryan Taylor , Clapham , London , UK Having grown up in the Grimsby area and having fishing connections , bad feeling between Iceland and ourselves is the norm rather than a newsworthy exception .
Mike Gott , Grimsby For many Brits ( and other nationals ) war has commenced against Iceland .
Telling our Chancellor that they had " no intention of honouring their compensation obligations " did not endear them or the entire Icelandic nation to the world .
They had the nerve to send me a tourist board e-mail begging me to come over to visit at the weekend .
Fat chance of that !
I wo n't knowingly put any money into the Icelandic economy from now on .
Not while they have £ 6 k + of my money sitting in their coffers .
Barry , Peterborough , England Barry : " You ca n't renege on deals " .
And we did n't .
Our government said it would not assume obligations in foreign countries * beyond * its legal obligation of deposit insurance .
It did say it would honour that legal obligation .
In response , Brown guillotined our remaining functional , solvent and liquid bank - doubling our catastrophe and the damage to UK depositors , and scoring political points for himself .
Brown notably did not seize JP Morgan 's assets in the UK in retaliation for the US government not assuming all liabilities of the failed Lehman Brothers .
Why not ?
Because the US is big and brawny , can seize British assets in return , and is not as easily vilified as Iceland is .
Gunnlaugur Briem , Reykjavik , Iceland What Icelanders fail to understand is that the tsunami spreading from Kaupthing 's woes has damaged Iceland 's reputation worldwide , not because of the financial disaster , but because the new owner of Kaupthing ( the Icelandic government ) has disowned an irrevocable and binding guarantee to cover every penny held in Kaupthing 's Isle of Man subsidiary , opening the prospect of years of international litigation against Iceland and inevitable asset seizures of Icelandic assets around the world .
One only needs to look at the frosty treatment of Iceland by Norway , Sweden and Denmark to realise the depth to which Reykjavik 's reputation has plunged .
Rory MacKay , Canada Come on Iceland !
Do n't tarnish us all with the same brush .
I love Iceland and could n't give a monkey 's about the banking system .
Ca n't we all just get along and show the politicians how it should be done ?
Mark , London , UK Many Scots feel just as angry like the Icelanders with Mr Brown and Mr Darling for the disgraceful treatment of the Scottish Banks and how they sank the Bank of Scotland and put it under English control with the HQ in London not Edinburgh .
They are acting like 19th Century Imperialists sending in the gunboats and bankers to save London and English interests and the Union .
Neil Brown , Newtonhill I 'm with you on that one Neil .
Why not let the Scottish parliament rescue the Scottish banks ?
And let the Scots taxpayer pay for the privilege .
Martin Pallister , Whitstable Neil , there are no Scottish banks .
There are UK banks , now owned by the UK government .
Just be glad the profitable bits were n't sold to Spain like Bradford and Bingley .
Chris , London Neil , they 're trying to save our - the UK's - economy .
Open your eyes .
It 's either that or RBS goes to the wall .
Reykjavik - pay up or shut up , you can't renege on deals , especially when you have man on the street 's savings in your banking system .
Andy Jones , London
This very interesting human interest topic is highly relevant right now , however , why do foreigners constantly talk of " Londoners " when referring to the British ... there are another 50 million or so of us who live and prosper outside of the capital .

Like we all know , the word “ miracle ” has become overused in the past few years when it comes to diet supplements – but it ’s accurate to use with garcinia cambogia extract !
Everyone wants to find the quick fix to their weight loss problems , especially around the holidays .
It ’s one of the latest supplements , but you ’ll find this one is very different .
Especially if you get the best garcinia cambogia .
Even with this remarkable supplement you ’ll find reviews of the product vary .
However if you get specific to the quality of the supplement that was used by the reviewers you ’ll find there are many different products available .
The ones that work remarkably well are those that use pure undiluted extract .
While the pure dietary supplement may cost a bit more you will always get what you pay for at Elysium Health
.
While the undiluted variety is always the best make sure you ’re getting a supplement that contains at least a 60 % Hydroxycitric Acid ( HCA ) .
If it contains less than that you wo n’t be getting the recommended dosage and it will be slower in working .
A good dosage of the extract should also contain potassium and calcium .
Recommended dosage per day should be 500 to 1000 mg before each meal .
What about the side effects ?
It ’s a fruit that comes from South America where it ’s been used for centuries as part of the eating habits of that area .
In the past few years scientists have taken note as to the health of those that used this fruit in their daily diet .
Therefore the fruit itself as well as a supplement can be used for a healthy diet if you so choose .
This fruit and the supplement has been found to give the user a feeling of being full much quicker than normal .
Thus the user wo n’t eat as much during their meal .
The advantage of the supplement is that you do n’t have to continually go to a market that sells the fruit to stock up .
You can take it quickly and easily with every meal to get the benefits .
Many dieters like it because it does all the work for them .
Without restricting their usual diet users have found that they can lose weight because they feel full much quicker .
Because Garcinia Cambogia use has taken off in the past few months there are many advertisers that are selling a form of this product .
Make sure you choose wisely before buying into the product to make sure you are getting the correct daily amount .
The best research on Garcinia Cambogia for weight loss is below :
Several studies have shown that Garcinia cambogia plays an important role in the regulation of endogenous lipid biosynthesis .
This effect is specially attributed to ( - ) - hydroxycitric acid ( HCA ) inhibiting the enzyme ATP - dependent citrate lyase , which catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl - CoA .
Although several studies have found that the administration of G. cambogia extracts is associated with body weight and fat loss in both experimental animals and humans , we should be cautious when interpreting the results as other randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials have not reported the same outcomes .
Furthermore , most studies in humans have been conducted on small samples and mainly in the short term .
None of them have shown whether these effects persist beyond 12 weeks of intervention .
Therefore , there is still little evidence to support the potential effectiveness and long - term benefits of G. cambogia extracts .
With regard to toxicity and safety , it is important to note that except in rare cases , studies conducted in experimental animals have not reported increased mortality or significant toxicity .
Furthermore , at the doses usually administered , no differences have been reported in terms of side effects or adverse events ( those studied ) in humans between individuals treated with G. cambogia and controls .
INTRODUCTION
Garcinia cambogia , also known as Malabar tamarind , originates in Southeast Asia and is a small to medium - sized tree of the Guttiferae family , of which over 180 species are known .
These are distributed throughout Asia , Africa , and the Polynesian islands ( 30 of them in India ) .
Its fruit , of approximately 5 cm in diameter , has been used for centuries ( particularly in East India ) for culinary and therapeutic purposes .
Tamarind extracts have been used to enhance the flavor of food such as meat , shellfish , and some beverages and even as preservative for fish .
It has also traditionally been used to achieve a feeling of satiety after eating , and even for some bowel disorders due its possible bacteriostatic effect ( due to its low pH ) and , in veterinary medicine , for mouth diseases in livestock .
The fruit pulp and rind ( a small reddish - yellow ovoid pumpkin ) have traditionally been the most commonly used parts for therapeutic purposes ,

as they contain high amounts of ( - ) - hydroxycitric acid ( HCA ) , one of the components to which beneficial effects have been attributed as reported in several different studies on body weight regulation .
The dried fruit contains approximately 10 to 30 % citric acid , most of which is HCA , whose structure is almost identical to citric acid ( Lewis and Neelekantan , 1965 ) .
HCA has 4 isomeric forms : (-) - HCA , (+ ) - HCA , (+) -allo-HCA and (-)-alloHCA ( see Figs. 1 a-d , respectively ) .
(-) - HCA is the main acid found in the fruit of G. cambogia .
Although HCA can be isolated through different methods in its free form , as a calcium or potassium salt or as lactone , natural tamarind extracts are currently marketed as calcium / potassium salts of ( -) - HCA ( HCA - SX ) , containing approximately 60 % HCA .
ACTION MECHANISMS , EFFICACY , AND TOXICITY STUDIES
There are several published studies investigating the action mechanisms that might explain the possible beneficial effects in the extramitochondrial synthesis of fatty acids .
Through this mechanism , it has been observed both in vitro and in vivo experiments that HCA induces a reduction of Acetil - CoA , thus limiting the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol in a variety of tissues ( Lowenstein , 1971 ; Sullivan , 1974 ) .
In a double - blind , placebo - controlled randomized cross-over study performed on ten sedentary lean male subjects , Kovacs and Westerterp - Plantenga ( 2006 ) examined whether the HCA may reduce de novo lipogenesis after 7 - day high - carbohydrate , a low - fat diet with ingestion of HCA , or a placebo .
The authors reported an increase of net fat synthesis as de novo lipogenesis , calculated as the difference between fat balance and fat intake , which tended to be lower in subjects treated with HCA than in those in the placebo group , although differences between the two groups were not statistically significant .
Furthermore , it has been proposed that the inhibitory effect of HCA on glycolysis increases rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis .
Thus , glycogen influences glucoreceptors in the liver inducing satiation via the vagus nerve ( Sullivan et al. , 1974 ; 1984 ) , contributing to the suppression of food intake and decreasing body weight gain .
In this regard , several studies have shown that HCA can improve the release and availability of serotonin , a neurotransmitter involved in the control of appetite .
Ohia et al. , ( 2001 ; 2002 ) evaluated the in vitro acute effects of the administration of 1 mM HCA on the cerebral cortex of rats .
These results showed increases in serotonin release and availability .
Subsequently , clinical trials conducted by Preuss et al. , ( 2004 ; 2004 ) reported the same results in humans .
Other authors have attempted to explain the action of HCA on body - weight regulation through the ability and efficiency of this acid in the modulation of genes involved in the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and cell communication ( Roy et al. , 2004 ) .
Treatment of human adipocytes with HCA - SX resulted in a significant down - regulation of 348 and induction of 366 fatand obesity - related genes such as hormone sensitive lipase , Peroxisome Proliferator - Activated Receptors gamma ( PPAR γ ) coactivator 1α , leptin , and Hypoxia - Inducible Factor - 1 genes .
Taken together , these results support the antilipolytic and antiadipogenic role of HCA - SX ( Roy et al. , 2007 ) .
More recently , it has been suggested that the effect of HCA intake on body weight regulation might be partially explained through its regulation of leptin and insulin plasma levels .
It has been reported that in mice treated with an extract of G. cambogia for four weeks , plasma insulin and leptin levels tended to be lower than those of the control mice , and the decrease in insulin was found to be statistically significant ( Hayamizu et al. , 2003 ) .
ANIMAL TOXICITY STUDIES
The aim of this section is to provide the information currently available on the evaluation of the safety of using HCA in animals .
Different studies have been published evaluating short and long - term acute toxicity effects of HCA .
Several studies have also been conducted to analyze the specific effects of direct skin
C (+)- allo-Hydroxiycitric acid D ( -) - allo - Hydroxiycitric acid Figure 1 Chemical structures of stereoisomers of hydroxycitric acid .
associated with the intake of HCA , particularly in relation to body weight .
Several studies on humans have also been conducted in order to evaluate its efficacy in different situations and the safety of its ingestion .
However , one of the main difficulties in evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of HCA is that , in many of the studies published , the authors do not sufficiently identify the isomer used , presumably using ( -) - HCA ( Soni et al. , 2004 ) .
Bioavailability
The bioavailability of HCA - SX was evaluated by Loe et al. ( 2001 ) in four healthy adult volunteers .
These authors administered 2 g of HCA - SX under fasting conditions and measured plasma concentrations of HCA - SX every 30 minutes for a total period of four hours .
HCA - SX plasma concentrations were 0.8 μg/mL 30 minutes after administration and 8.4 μg / mL two hours after intake .
The maximum post - administration peak ranged from 4.7 to 8.4 μg/mL .
Although plasma levels of HCA - SX began to decrease at 2.5 hours after ingestion , these remained substantially higher than pre-administration values .
This study shows that after an acute intake of HCA - SX absorption is relatively fast , and the product remains available in plasma for several hours .
Possible Action Mechanisms
HCA was identified by Watson and Lowenstein ( 1970 ) as a potent competitive inhibitor of the extramitochondrial enzyme adenosine triphosphate - citrate ( pro -3S ) - lyase , which is involved and eye exposure to HCA .
Finally , research has also been carried out on genotoxicity and reproduction .
These studies have been conducted in different animal species , mainly rats and rabbits .
In a previous review , Soni et al. , ( 2004 ) analyzed various safety issues related to the use of HCA .
In this paper , the studies reviewed by Soni and coworkers are re-evaluated , in addition to others that have not been discussed or published since 2003 .
Short and Long - Term Effects
Ohia et al. , ( 2002 ) evaluated the acute effects of the use of HCA - SX for 14 days .
They studied Albino rats ( 5 females and 5 males ) fed ad libitum and receiving a dose of 5000 mg / kg through a gastric probe .
They evaluated mortality , clinical signs , and weight or anatomic and histopathological changes of the craniocerebral , chest , and abdominal systems through a necropsy performed at the end of the intervention period .
The authors did not report any deaths or significant clinical changes except on day three of HCA - SX administration , when a rat was found to have a pustule on the back of its head .
No significant weight changes or tissue injuries were observed during the necropsy .
The authors , therefore , concluded that the administration of HCA - SX was not associated with any acute adverse events .
Thus , the LD50 of HCA - SX administered orally to rats was estimated to be over 5000 mg / kg weight .
Several studies of variable time length ( from 4 to 30 days ) and doses administered ( 150 mg to 1500 mg ) have been conducted by different authors , although none of them assessed HCA intake toxicity as their primary objective .
Of the studies analyzed , none of them have mentioned possible adverse events recorded after HCA intake during treatment ( Leonhardt et al. , 2001 ; 2004 ; Rao and Sakariah , 1988 ) .
Furthermore , no adverse effects were found in animal studies comparing different chemical forms or preparations ( Regulator⃝R , Citrin K⃝R , Super Citrimax⃝R ) containing HCA ( Louter - van de Haar et al. , 2005 ) .
Leonhardt and Langhans ( 2002 ) analyzed the effects of the oral administration of HCA on food intake and the recovery of weight loss in 23 rats .
After a period of ten days of energy restriction and weight loss , rats were fed ad libitum for 22 days with diets containing 1 % or 12 % of weight as total fat and supplemented with 3 % HCA ( 1500 mg/kg ) .
Rats in the HCA group showed a significantly lower body weight regain compared to the control group .
However , long - term suppression of food intake was only observed in rats fed the 12 % fat diet with a significant reduction in the number of meals , not in meal size .
But because treatment with HCA did not affect plasma levels of β- hydroxybutyrate in rats , this study does not support the hypothesis that food intake suppression might be mediated by an increase in hepatic fatty acid oxidation .
No adverse effects on animals were reported during HCA administration .
Several clinical trials with similar characteristics , in terms of dose and time of exposure to HCA but using other experimental animals , showed similar results .
Chee et al. , ( 1977 ) did in vitro and in vivo research into the influence of HCA on the synthesis of fatty acids in chicken and rat livers , and in rat adipose tissue .
Although in vitro they observed a reduction in the synthesis of fatty acids in the animal ( though there were differences between the two animal species ) , in vivo they failed to demonstrate this inhibition of the synthesis with a diet containing 52.6 nmols / kg of HCA .
With regard to the in vivo study , the authors reported an increase in the peripheral levels of triglycerides , which was not found in rats .
They did not report undesirable effects to the animals during the study .
Some studies have shown toxicological effects of HCA in animals when administered for over 30 days , although the results are extremely contradictory .
Shara et al. , ( 2003 ; 2004 ) analyzed the effects of HCA intake on weight , testicular and liver lipid peroxidation , and DNA fragmentation , in addition to possible histopathological changes in seven Sprague - Dawley rats .
The animals received 0 , 0.2 , 2 , and 5 % HCA ( 0 –2500 mg/kg ) in their diet .
The rats were killed at 30 , 60 , and 90 days of treatment .
At 90 days of HCA administration the investigators found weight loss in the rats studied , with no changes in liver or testicular lipid peroxidation or in DNA fragmentation .
No hematological or biochemical disorders ( hemoglobin , hematocrit , albumin , lymphocytes , cholesterol , glucose , calcium , phosphorus , potassium , sodium , and iron ) or significant histopathological changes were seen in the different vital organs studied ( brain , heart , kidneys , liver , prostate , spleen , and testes ) , attributable to the use of HCA .
Also , no mortality differences were seen among the different animal groups treated .
However , Saito et al. , ( 2005 ) researched the ability of HCA to inhibit body fat deposition in obese Zucker rats ( 5 groups of 6 rats ) and the safety of taking high amounts of HCA .
The animals received supplements for 92 or 93 days with different doses of HCA ( 0 , 10 , 51 , 102 , and 154 mmol / kg of feed ) .
The authors did not see changes in total body weight .
However , the intake of high doses of HCA ( 154 mmol /kg of feed ) resulted in an inhibition of fat storage in the epididymus .
Furthermore , it was shown that diets with a high HCA content ( ≥102 mmol /kg of feed , equivalent to 778 – 1244 mg/kg body weight ) were associated with testicular atrophy and toxicity , while low - HCA diets ( ≤51 mmol / kg of feed , equivalent to ≤ 389 mg /kg of body weight / day ) were shown to be safe .
Discrepancies between the two studies could be related to the lactone content of HCA affecting its solubility .
The lower levels of testicular testosterone production associated with obese male Zucker rats in comparison to lean rats , and the effect of dietary imbalances that may have contributed to the observed testicular toxicity which , as Burdock et al. , ( 2005 ) have pointed out , was not clearly described in the Saito study ( 2005 ) .
However , Saito and coworkers suggest that doses 10to 16 times greater than those recommended as dietary supplements do not cause testicular atrophy .
Various long - term studies conducted in experimental animals ( > 4 weeks ) have also found that HCA favorably affects glucose metabolism , blood pressure , lipid peroxidation , and bodyweight ( Hayamizu et al. , 2003 ; Talpur et al. , 2003 ; Roy et al. , ( 2004 ) .
The variability in the results obtained seems to depend particularly on the chemical form of HCA used .
However , none of the studies mentioned have described an increase in animal mortality , or other toxicological changes induced by HCA .
Effects on the Skin
Some studies suggest that HCA applied directly to the skin may cause acute skin injuries ; however , the chronic oral use of HCA has not shown effects to the skin either in studies carried out in humans or those performed in experimental animals .
Ohia et al. , ( 2002 ) studied the acute effects ( 24 hours of exposure ) of the administration of a dose of 2000 mg / kg of HCA on the skin of Albino rabbits ( 5 females and 5 males ) .
They evaluated mortality , emergent clinical signs , body weight changes , and histopathological changes in the craniocerebral , chest , and abdominal systems after a necropsy performed at the end of the study period .
The authors did not report any deaths during the study under the experimental conditions .
Between days 0 and 2 of the intervention only one rabbit had mucoid feces , without any other clinical findings .
All rabbits had slight erythema on the skin but none of them had edema .
Desquamation was noted on eight sites out of ten animals after seven days of exposure .
During the autopsy , skin reddening was seen at the site of exposure in two animals , and pale kidneys were found in one animal .
There were no other significant histopathological changes in any of the examined tissues at the terminal necropsy .
Oikawa et al. , ( 2005 ) also studied the effect of HCA on different skin properties ( collagen and triglyceride content , thickness of skin , collagen layers , and subcutaneous tissue ) .
These authors observed that animals receiving diets supplemented with 3.3 % HCA show a decrease in the total number of adipocytes with no adverse effects on the skin properties tested .
Effects on Erythropoiesis
Recently Oluyemi et al. , ( 2007 ) assessed the erythropoietic effect of a G. cambogia extract in rats .
Twenty - one adult male rats were randomized into three dosage groups of G. cambogia ( 0 , 200 , and 400 mg / kg ) for five weeks .
The study reported a significant increase in red blood cell count and a decrease in animal weight in the treated groups .
The increase in hematocrite found by the authors might be partly explained by high G. cambogia iron content and the presence of antioxidants , which preserve the average life span of red blood cells .
Also , the flavonoid component of G. cambogia is known to increase the level of peripheral testosterone , which may stimulate erythropoiesis in humans .
Effects on the Eyes
Few clinical trials have investigated the potential toxicological effects of HCA on the eyes .
However , Ohia et al. , ( 2002 ) evaluated it in a safety study , so it is worth mentioning .
These
researchers administered 54 mg of HCA into the conjunctiva of the right eye of six Albino rabbits , while the left eye was used as control .
Acute ocular reactions were examined after 1 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours and at 4 , 7 , 14 , and 21 days of exposure .
After seven days they reported discharge and inflammation in the conjunctiva of half of the rabbits , as well as an increase in the presence of small blood vessels .
In two of the three affected rabbits , the injuries persisted until day 21 of exposure .
Inflammation that did not affect the cornea was also seen in the eye .
The results suggest that in some animals HCA can induce inflammatory reactions both in the iris and the conjunctiva .
This study indicates that the direct application of HCA into the eye may cause eye irritation .
However , whether the oral administration of HCA could cause undesirable effects on this organ has not yet been studied , but it is unlikely as nobody has reported it in the studies performed in animals or humans .
Genotoxicity
The mutagenic properties of HCA were studied ( Aujoulat , 2003 ) in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test .
Five strains of Salmonella typhimurium ( TA98 , TA100 , TA102 , TA1535 , and TA1537 ) were used to evaluate the effects of HCA on the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Different doses of exposure to HCA were used ( 52 , 164 , 512 , 1600 , and 5000 μg/ plaque ) .
Using an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test , the authors concluded that HCA has no mutagenic effects either with or without metabolic activation ( Soni et al. , 2004 ) .
Similarly to the previous study , in vitro bacterial genotoxicity studies carried out with citric acid or its sodium and tripotassium salts did not show mutagenic effects either ( EPA , 2001 ) .
Reproductive Studies
During the fetal development period there is a high demand on lipid production for growth .
The lipids produced by the mother are transferred through the placenta to the fetus for tissue synthesis .
HCA inhibits the synthesis and storage of lipids and therefore may be critical for gestational development .
This hypothesis was tested by Jones and Ashton ( 1976 ) through a study conducted in pigs in which they concluded that neither the synthesis nor the fetal storage of lipids is affected by HCA intake .
Likewise , in rat fetuses , Xu et al. , ( 1990 ) found that the synthesis of fatty acids is not affected by HCA intake .
Some authors suggest that lipid synthesis in fetuses and adult rats may differ , which would explain the lack of HCA action observed in the synthesis of fatty acids in the fetus ( Watson and Lowenstein , 1970 ; Lowenstein , 1971 ; Jones and Ashton , 1976 ) .
Calorie restriction ( 20–35 % total intake ) and body weight loss ( > 20 % ) were associated with a reduction of fertility and reproduction in rats ( Fan et al. , 1997 ; Wu et al. , 2002 ; Terry et al. , 2005 ) .
Because HCA intake has been associated with the control of body weight it would be interesting to study the

effects of HCA intake on animal reproduction .
Unfortunately , we have not found any studies that test this hypothesis .
EVALUATION IN HUMANS Materials and Methods
Data for this review were obtained by searching Medline or PubMed and the ISI Web of Science with the key words : “ Garcinia cambogia in humans , ” “ body weight loss and Garcinia cambogia , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and body weight , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and body fat , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and cholesterol , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and triglycerides , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and lipids , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and adverse effects , ” “ Garcinia cambogia and safety , ” “ Hydroxycitric acid , ” and “ Garcinia cambogia and blood . ”
The criteria for selecting the studies were the following .
They had to be a ) randomized , clinical trials , controlled with placebo , b ) carried out in humans , c ) published in a scientific journal in the database of Science Citation Index or Medline between January , 1990 and January , 2010 , d ) original , and e ) they must have evaluated changes in weight , body composition , plasma lipid profile , adverse clinical , or biochemical effects .
We finally selected 16 randomized placebo - controlled studies .
Once the articles had been selected , the following significant data were extracted : author and year , number of participants ( randomized / completed trial ) , type of individuals studied ( normoweight , overweight , or obese ) , length of intervention , G. cambogia extract or HCA dose administered ( mg/day ) , use of other antiobesity substances associated with the intervention , control of food intake and physical activity , placebo used , changes in weight and / or blood lipid profile , changes in satiety , and undesirable clinical or biochemical effects .
Efficacy in Body Weight and Composition
After extensively reviewing the literature , we found 15 studies ( see Table 1 ) that appeared in peer - review literature and that evaluated the effect of G. cambogia extracts on human body weight .
These are eleven randomized , double - blind , placebocontrolled , parallel studies involving 738 subjects ( Conte , 1993 ; Ramos et al. , 1995 ; Girola et al. , 1996 ; Heymfield et al. , 1998 ; Antonio et al. , 1999 ; Thom 2000 ; Mattes and Bormann , 2000 ; Preuss et al. , 2005 ; Opala et al. , 2006 ; Toromanyan et al. , 2007 , Vasques et al. , 2008 ) , one randomized , single - blind , placebocontrolled , parallel clinical trial ( Hayamizu et al. , 2001 ) , two chronic cross - over studies ( Kovacs et al. , 2001 ; WesterterpPlantega and Kovacs , 2002 ) , one randomized single - blind acute study ( Gatta et al. , 2009 ) , and one re-examination ( Preuss et al. , 2005 ) of the data from two previous randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel studies ( Preuss 2004 ; 2004 ) .
Studies published in the form of abstracts have been excluded from this review ( Thom 1996 ; Rothacker and Watman , 1997 ; Kaats et al. , 1998 ; Preuss et al. , 2002 ) .
The largest study with the higher number of subjects ( n = 144 ) was that of Girola et al. , ( 1996 ) .
However , the duration of the experiment in this study was only a period of four weeks .
The study showed that groups treated with one or two capsules of a product containing G. cambogia extract , chitosan , and chromium decreased their body weight by 7.9 % and 12.5 % , respectively , versus a 4.3 % reduction in the placebo group ( p < 0.001 ) .
Several authors have used G. cambogia extracts alone ( Ramos et al. , 1995 ; Heymfield et al. , 1998 ; Mattes and Borman , 2000 ; Hayamizu et al. , 2001 ; Opala et al. , 2006 ; Gatta et al. , 2009 ) or in conjunction with other potential antiobesity components ( Conte 1993 ; Girola et al. , 1996 ; Antonio et al. , 1999 ; Thom , 2000 ; Kovacs et al. , 2001 ; Preuss et al. , 2005 ; Toromanyan et al. , 2007 ; Vasques et al. , 2008 ) , and the study administered it with tomato juice ( Westerterp - Plantega and Kovacs , 2002 ) , which has made it difficult to determine the isolated effect of G. cambogia .
Preuss et al. , ( 2004 ; 2004 ) analyzed the effect of supplementation using optimal doses of a highly bioavailable form of hydroxycitric acid ( HCA - SX ) alone , in combination with niacin - bound chromium and with a standardized Gymnema sylvestre extract .
The authors found significant body weight loss in the groups treated with G. cambogia , but the changes were not significantly higher than those found in the placebo group .
However , after combining their data with data from two previous studies ( Preuss et al. , 2004 ; 2004 ) they observed statistically significant differences in weight loss between groups , confirming that HCA - SX plus niacin bound chromium and Gymnema sylvestre extract can reduce body weight and BMI more effectively than a placebo ( Preuss et al. , 2005 ) .
In most of the published studies , both the treated and the placebo groups received lifestyle recommendations , except in two studies where the subjects were asked to maintain their regular diet and level of physical activity ( Toromanyan et al. , 2007 ; Vasques et al. , 2008 ) .
Many times , low - calorie diets were used ( associated or not with physical exercise or low fat content ) ( Conte 1993 ; Ramos et al. , 1995 ; Girola et al. , 1996 ; Thom , 2000 ; Mattes and Bormann et al. , 2000 ) or a high fiber content ( Heymfield et al. , 1998 ) .
In some cases a normocaloric diet was prescribed during the intervention ( Antonio et al. , 1999 ) , or a diet ad libitum ( Westerterp - Plantega and Kovacs , 2002 ; Toromanyan et al. , 2007 ; Gatta et al. , 2009 ) .
It is important to note that most of the studies analyzed7 break ; ( n = 9 ) were conducted with small sample sizes ( ≤60 subjects ) and frequently on overweight or obese subjects .
In most of the studies we reviewed the groups receiving G. cambogia extract ( associated or not with other possible active ingredients ) tended to have a greater weight loss compared to the control group or placebo group .
However , in only six studies ( Ramos et al. , 1995 ; Girola et al. , 1996 ; Thom , 2000 ; Mattes and Bormann , 2000 ; Preuss et al. , 2005 ; Toromanyan et al. , 2007 ) was weight loss found to be significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group .
Several authors have described higher fat loss in subjects treated with G. cambogia extracts compared to those who were not treated , without significant differences in body weight ( Hayamizu et al. , 2001 ; Opala et al. , 2006 ) .
Likewise , a randomized , double - blind clinical trial revealed significant decreases in body fat in overweight subjects who had received the dietary supplement over a 12 - week period in comparison with a placebo group ( Opala et al. , 2006 ) .
However , the results of the Heymfield et al. , ( 1998 ) study show that treatment with G. cambogia did not produce significant weight and fat mass loss beyond that observed with a placebo .
Although several studies in humans have shown a significant effect on body weight or fat associated with the intake of G. cambogia extracts , none of them have examined whether these effects persist beyond the 12 weeks of intervention .
Several of the studies reviewed here have also evaluated the effect of the administration of G. cambogia on appetite and satiety , and some of them have shown a significant favorable effect on the treated group with regard to these variables ( WesterterpPlantega and Kovacs , 2002 ; Preuss et al. , 2005 ; Gatta et al. , 2009 ) .
Effect on Lipid Profile
A total of 8 of the 16 studies revised have investigated the effects of the administration of a G. cambogia supplement on lipid profiles .
Ramos et al. , ( 1995 ) in a randomized , placebocontrolled clinical trial conducted on 40 obese patients , showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in the group treated with 1.5 g of G. cambogia extract .
Likewise , Girola et al. , ( 1996 ) analyzed the effect on the lipid profile of a formula containing G. cambogia administered to 150 obese subjects for four weeks .
These subjects were randomized to take 0 , 1 , or 2 capsules of a mixture containing 240 mg of chitosan , 55 mg of an extract of G. cambogia , and 19 mg of chromium per day .
The authors found a statistically significant higher reduction in low - density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations , and a significant increase of high - density lipoprotein levels in the group treated with two capsules per day .
Preuss et al. , ( 2005 ) reported that after eight weeks groups treated with HCA - SX alone or HCA - SX combined with niacin - bound chromium and standardized Gymnema sylvestre extracts showed significant decreases in low density lipoprotein and triglycerides levels , while the levels of high - density lipoprotein were found to have increased more than in the placebo group .
The remaining studies in our review did not measure lipid profiles , and the majority reported no significant differences between groups , although a tendency for higher cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride levels was reported in the G. Cambogia treated group in three of them ( Hayamizu et al. , 2001 ; Opala et al. , 2006 ; Toromanyan et al. , 2007 ) .
Recently , in a double - blind randomized 12 week trial , 32 subjects were assigned to a treatment group ( 2.4 g of G. Cambogia plus 1.5 g of Konjac ) and 26 subjects to a placebo group .
The results of the study show significant reductions in total cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , but
no significant effect on triglycerides levels in the G. Cambogia group compared to the placebo group ( Vasques et al. , 2008 )
Adverse Events in Human Studies
In this section we analyze the adverse events reported in the literature on clinical trials carried out in human subjects after the administration of G. cambogia extract .
A total of 13 studies were found in the literature that analyzed the mid-term effects of the administration of HCA isolated from G. cambogia .
These studies included a total of 930 subjects .
In all but five of them ( Girola et al. , 1996 ; Antonio et al. , 1999 ; Thom .
2000 ; Kovaks and Westerterp - Plantenga , 2001 ) , the amount of Garcinia extract used in the studies ranged between 1500 and 4667 mg / day ( 25 – 78 mg / kg body weigh / day ) .
The equivalent dose of HCA ranged between 900 and 2800 mg / day ( 15 – 47 mg/kg body weight / day ) .
In these clinical trials it was possible to analyze both tolerance to the supplement and the safety of taking it , though in the majority of cases that was not the specific objective of the study .
Hayamizu and coworkers ( 2008 ) specifically investigated the possible adverse effects relating particularly to reproductive toxicity after G. Cambogia supplementation in humans .
The authors concluded that the intake of a G. Cambogia extract at dose levels commonly recommended for humans does not affect serum sex hormone levels and routine blood parameters .
Recently , there has been controversy regarding the hepatotoxicity of the Hydroxycut dietary supplement .
On the basis of one case series , Lobb ( 2009 ) hypothesized that the putative hepatotoxicity of this supplement may be due to its HCA component .
Conversely , other authors claim that there is no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that such hepatotoxicity is associated with HCA consumption ( Stohs et al. , 2009 ) .
Additional studies should be conducted in the future to demonstrate this possible adverse effect and to determine its cause .
Table 1 summarizes the adverse events and the tolerability found in each of these studies .
None of them reported serious adverse events attributable to the intake of G. cambogia extracts .
In most of the studies no adverse events were seen or reported with the administration compounds containing HCA .
The studies relevant to safety or tolerability issues are described below .
In a randomized , placebo - controlled study , Ramos et al. , ( 1995 ) studied the effects of the administration of a lyophilized G. cambogia extract in overweight patients .
The subjects were randomized to receive an extract of G. cambogia ( 500 mg capsules ) or placebo before each main meal for eight weeks .
The authors observed headache and nausea in two of the patients in the treated group and one in the placebo group .
The authors did not report significant changes in various biochemical parameters , including serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) , or blood glucose .
In the study conducted by Girola et al. , ( 1996 ) , the incidence of adverse events ( nausea or headache ) in the two groups treated with G. cambogia extract was not higher than the incidence seen in the placebo group .
Moreover , no significant changes attributable to supplements containing the active ingredient were found in hematological or biochemical parameters .
In 1998 , Heymsfield et al. , used a randomized , placebocontrolled parallel design to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of a G. cambogia extract ( 50 % HCA ) on body composition .
One hundred and thirty - five overweight patients were randomized to receive 1.5 g of HCA or a placebo , in both cases in conjunction with a low - calorie , high - fiber diet .
Fortytwo patients in the active treatment group and 42 patients in the placebo group completed the study .
A total of 19 patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms ( 6 from the control group vs. 13 from the treated group ) , 21 reported headaches ( 12 vs. 9 , respectively ) , and 29 reported effects to their upper airways ( 13 vs. 16 , respectively ) although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance .
The authors did not study changes in biochemical parameters or the full blood count between groups .
Hayamizu et al. , ( 2001 ) , in a randomized , placebo - controlled study , investigated the effect of HCA on body composition in 40 overweight or obese patients .
The subjects were randomized to receive 1 g of HCA or placebo for a period of eight weeks .
The treated group experienced a higher reduction ( p < 0.01 ) in visceral fat area measured by computerized axial tomography than the placebo group .
The authors did not observe adverse events that could be attributed to the use of the active supplement .
Several hematological ( white blood cells , granulocytes , hemoglobin , hematocrit , and blood platelets ) and biochemical parameters ( SGOT , SGPT , γ - glutamil transpeptidase , lactate dehydrogenase , blood ureic nitrogen , creatinine , glucose , insulinemia , and ketone bodies ) were also measured at weeks 4 and 8 of the study .
A significant reduction in hemoglobin levels was observed in both groups , and was therefore not attributable to the treatment .
Finally , the human studies conducted by Preuss et al. , ( 2004 ; 2004 ; 2005 ) did not report serious adverse events in any of the subjects and no subjects were removed or dropped out of the study due to adverse events .
But in one study , several adverse incidents such as leg cramps , heartburn , diarrhea , gas , increased appetite , headaches , stomach burn , and menstrual disorders were observed .
However , the number of patients reporting light adverse events was not significantly different CONCLUSIONS
Although there have been several studies reporting the effects of supplements containing G. cambogia extracts on body weight in both experimental animals and humans , we should be cautious when interpreting these results as there have been other randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials that have not had the same outcome .
Most studies in humans have been conducted on small samples and mainly in the short term .
There is still little evidence to support the potential effectiveness and long - term benefits of Garcinia cambogia .
With regard to toxicity or safety , it is important to note that G. cambogia has traditionally been used in human diet or as a supplement ( as a therapeutic preparation ) for centuries , without
reports of adverse effects from its use .
Except in rare cases , studies conducted in experimental animals have not reported increased mortality or significant toxicity .
And no differences were found in humans in terms of side effects or adverse events ( those studied ) between groups treated with G. cambogia and the placebo groups at the doses used .
Further research into animal reproduction and particularly into long - term efficacy and safety in humans would be appropriate .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
While the global credit crunch is clearly beginning to bite hard , there are some positives to the financial turmoil that it has wrought .
The U.S. election is no longer leading the news .
Whatever your brother - in - law 's brilliant financial move was last year probably looks pretty boneheaded now .
Wall Street bigwigs are exposed as blubbering hypocrites in congressional hearings .
You probably did n't do anything as embarrassing as the head of Iceland 's central bank , who issued a statement announcing a 4 billion euro loan from Russia when Moscow had n't actually agreed to it .
The world will no longer have to spend trillions of dollars to cut carbon emissions since the crisis will do more to reduce greenhouse gases than all the government initiatives , wind farms and cap - and - trade schemes combined .
Capitol Hill bigwigs are exposed as blubbering hypocrites in congressional press conferences .
You probably did n't do anything as embarrassing as Germany 's KfW Bankengrouppe , which transferred 300 million euros to Lehman Bros .
just before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
Instead of foreign aid programs or the United Nations , your tax dollars will now go to fund assistance where it 's really needed -- Wall Street .
Gasoline 's back down to merely extortionate prices from obscenely extortionate prices .
It 's as good a distraction as any from the Chicago Cubs ' abject playoff failure .
- Tom Bemis , assistant managing editor
Bob Herbert Head for the High Road
Sarah Palin is the latest GOP distraction .
Shes meant to shift attention away from the real issue of this campaign -- the awful state of the nation after years of Republican rule .

MapReduce is a programming model for processing vast amounts of data .
One of the reasons that it works so well is because it exploits a sweet spot of modern disk drive technology trends .
In essence MapReduce works by repeatedly sorting and merging data that is streamed to and from disk at the transfer rate of the disk .
Contrast this to accessing data from a relational database that operates at the seek rate of the disk ( seeking is the process of moving the disk ’s head to a particular place on the disk to read or write data ) .
So why is this interesting ?
Well , look at the trends in seek time and transfer rate .
Seek time has grown at about 5 % a year , whereas transfer rate at about 20 % [ 1 ] .
Seek time is growing more slowly than transfer rate – so it pays to use a model that operates at the transfer rate .
Which is what MapReduce does .
I first saw this observation in Doug Cutting ’s talk , with Eric Baldeschwieler , at OSCON ( see BlogStarter ) last year , where he worked through the numbers for updating a 1 terabyte database using the two paradigms B - Tree ( seek - limited ) and Sort / Merge ( transfer - limited ) .
( See the slides and video for more detail . )
The general point was well summed up by Jim Gray in an interview in ACM Queue from 2003 :
… programmers have to start thinking of the disk as a sequential device rather than a random access device .
Or the more pithy : “ Disks have become tapes . ” ( Quoted by David DeWitt . )
But even the growth of transfer rate is dwarfed by another measure of disk drives – capacity , which is growing at about 50 % a year .
David DeWitt argues that since the effective transfer rate of drives is falling we need database systems that work with this trend – such as column - store databases ( similar to MySQL databases used with WordPress theme installation ) and wider use of compression ( since this effectively increases the transfer rate of a disk ) .
Of existing databases he says :
Already we see transaction processing systems running on farms of mostly empty disk drives to obtain enough seeks / second to satisfy their transaction processing rates .
But this applies to transfer rate too ( or if it does n’t yet , it will ) .
Replace “ seeks ” with “ transfers ” and “ transaction processing ” with “ MapReduce ” and I think over time we ’ll start seeing Hadoop installations that choose to use large numbers of smaller capacity disks to maximize their processing rates .
SARAH PALIN ’S 18 LIES TONIGHT
1. FANNIE MAE / FREDDIE MAC : Palin said “ it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures , ” but fact checkers say that ’s “ Quite A Stretch ” And “ Barely True , ” and that McCain was a “ latecomer ” to the discussion .
2. FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRONG : Palin tried to say “ John McCain saying our economy was strong ” but McCain has used the phrase “ The Fundamentals Of The Economy Are Strong ” At Least 16 Times This Year .
3. PARTISAN POLITICS : Palin said McCain is “ known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done , ” but he has voted with Bush 90 % of the time in the Senate and bragged about his support for Bush on important issues .
4. TAXES ATTACK : Palin repeated the attack that Obama voted for higher taxes 94 times , which the New York Times says is “ false , ” CNN says is “ Misleading , ” and FactCheck.org says is “ inflated . ”
5. TOBACCO REGULATION : Palin said to “ look at the tobacco industry ” as an example of McCain pushing for even harder and tougher regulations .
But McCain opposed expanding the SCHIP children ’s health insurance program for 5.8 million children because it would increase tobacco taxes .
6. SPENDING INCREASES : Palin said Obama is is proposing “ nearly a trillion dollars in new spending , ” but did n’t mention that he has also proposed cuts to balance it out , an attack CNN has already debunked as “ misleading ” and that ignores the far larger cost of McCain ’s tax cuts and spending hikes .
7. HEALTH CARE : Palin claimed Obama ’s health plan is “ government run ” which has been widely debunked as a “ canard . ”
8. HEALTH CARE .
Palin says taxes would n’t go up under the McCain health care plan , a fact even his own campaign has acknowledged is n’t true .
9. TROOPS : Palin repeated what the AP called the “ highly misleading ” attack that Obama opposed funding for the troops , and Factcheck.org notes that the same methodology would lead to the same conclusion for McCain .
10 . GLOBAL WARMING : Palin said “ I do n’t want to argue about the causes ” for global warming , when she has clearly taken the position that she does n’t not believe it is man-made .
11 . MCCAIN IS CONSISTENT : Palin said McCain ” does n’t tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group , ” when that is exactly what he has done on immigration , telling Hispanic leaders he was for comprehensive reform instead of the enforcement focused approach he has taken with conservatives .
12 . MCCLELLAN NOT MCKIERNAN : Palin referred to the US commander in Afghanistan , David McKiernan as “ McClellan . ”
13 . MCKIERNAN ON “ SURGE : ” Palin said that [ McKiernan ] did not say a surge would n’t work in Afghanistan , when just yesterday he said “ The word I do n’t use for Afghanistan is ’ surge , ’ ” McKiernan stressed , saying that what is required is a “ sustained commitment ” to a counterinsurgency effort that could last many years and would ultimately require a political , not military , solution
14 . KILLING CIVILIANS .
Palin said “ Obama had said that all we ’re doing in Afghanistan is air raiding villages and killing civilians and such a reckless , reckless comment and untrue comment again hurts our cause .
That ’s not what we are doing there . ”
Unfortunately , the Associated Press says that Obama was right in discussing a critically important point about avoiding civilian casualties .
15 . TEACHING : Palin said we need to make sure “ that education in either one of our agendas , I think , absolute top of the line , ” when McCain has repeatedly favored tax cuts for the wealthy over funds for more teachers and class size reduction .
16 . PARTISAN APPOINTMENTS : Palin said “ You do what I did as governor .
And you appoint people regardless of party affiliation .
Democrats , independents , Republicans , you walk the walk , do n’t just talk the talk ” when she repeatedly appointed friends and supporters to positions for which they were n’t qualified .
17 . FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE : Palin falsely claimed that she was the first governor to form a climate change subcabinet , when at least 28 states had already taken action .
18 . DARFUR DIVESTMENT : Palin claimed that “ when I and others ” found out that the state had money invested in Sudan that “ we called for divestment , ” when the reality is that Palin ’s appointees worked to kill a Darfur divestment plan .

BBC News , Sao Paulo
Riot police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo have clashed with other police officers who are on strike .
The confrontation happened when the striking officers tried to force their way past barriers to reach a building used by state governor Jose Serra .
Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to keep back the demonstrators and 15 to 20 injuries have been reported .
Mr Serra later said many protesters had not been police , but members of other unions and political groups .
Heated exchanges
The clashes happened in the Morumbi district of Sao Paulo as the police officers , who have been on strike for a month , tried to reach the building used by the governor .
The strikers wanted to meet him in order to negotiate a 15 % pay rise .
In a statement , the authorities said the trouble began when strike leaders accepted a proposal to receive an official representative in the area where they were staging the protest .
Live television picture showed pushing and shoving and some punches being thrown as the protesters pushed forward .
Riot police dressed in black then began firing tear gas , stun grenades and rubber bullets .
In one incident , a marked police vehicle could be seen trying to force its way through a police cordon , and there were a number of heated exchanges .
Police officers on horseback were also brought in to try to restore calm .
Hospitals nearby received a small number of people with slight injuries , including a senior officer who had been involved in the negotiations with the protesters .
The striking officers are from the branch of the state police responsible for detective work and criminal investigations , while those trying to hold the demonstrators back are from the military police , whose role is broadly to maintain law and order on the streets .
However , Governor Serra has claimed many of those taking part in the protest were politically motivated and were not in fact police officers .

What are these ?
Only candidates seeking nomination by a political party to the office of President are eligible to receive primary matching funds .
A presidential candidate must establish eligibility by showing broad - based public support .
He or she must raise more than $ 5,000 in each of at least 20 states ( that is , over $ 100,000 ) .
Although an individual may contribute up to a specific limit to a primary candidate , only a maximum of $ 250 of each individual ’s contribution is counted in determining whether a candidate has met the $ 5,000 threshold in each state .
This means that a candidate must receive contributions from a minimum of 20 contributors in each of at least 20 states in order to establish eligibility for primary matching funds .
Presidential candidates also must agree to :
Limit campaign spending for all primary elections combined to $ 10 million plus a cost - of - living adjustment ( COLA ) .
This national spending limit was $ 48.07 million in 2016 .
Limit campaign spending in each state to $ 200,000 plus COLA , or to a specified amount based on the number of voting age individuals in the state ( plus COLA ) , whichever is greater .
In 2016 , state limits ranged from $ 961,400 in Wyoming to $ 23,092,100 in California .
Limit spending from personal funds to $ 50,000 .
The campaign finance law exempts the payment of some expenses from the spending limits .
Certain fundraising expenses ( up to 20 percent of the expenditure limit ) and legal and accounting expenses incurred solely to ensure the campaign 's compliance with the law do not count against the expenditure limits .
Even if they no longer campaign actively in primary elections , candidates may continue to request public funds to pay off campaign debts until the first Monday of March of the year following an election .
However , to qualify for matching funds , contributions must be deposited in the campaign account by December 31 of the election year .
Eligible candidates may receive public funds equaling up to half of the national spending limit for the primary campaign .
On my way from the convention hall in St Paul to the press filing room , I walked past an information booth .
I was definitely in need of some information .
I was tempted to ask the two forlorn women staffing it : " What was John McCain intending to accomplish with that speech ? "
Upon reflection , I think maybe I 've got it .
Given that hating on the media has been such an incessant theme of this convention , I now suspect that the speech was intentionally awful , in order that it generate negative reviews in the press the better to fire up the base against the press .
I really can't think of another explanation .
Okay .
I 'm a liberal in my political beliefs .
But I 'm also an analyst .
I 've watched 82,000 political speeches , by speakers from far left to far right .
I know a good one when I see one and I can call them as I see them - ideology completely to the side .
In 2004 , I thought John Kerry 's acceptance speech was ghastly .
I also thought , as I wrote last night , that Sarah Palin gave a very good speech .
Rudy Giuliani gave a very good one too .
John McCain sounded like the vestry board chairman speaking at the church social about the success of the raffle .
Or , as a colleague just put it : he looked like the guy who'd been the office accountant for 40 years giving his retirement address .
After he 'd eaten a little too much Chicken Kiev .
I kept thinking , am I wrong ?
Am I missing something ?
I kept getting emails from friends and colleagues as I checked my BlackBerry during the speech .
They asked : Am I wrong ?
Am I missing something ?
Those in the hall wondered : Maybe this is coming across better on television ?
Those watching on television asked :
Is this coming across better in the hall ?
Substance , you ask ?
Well , he did make about a three - minute nod toward discussing what he would do about the economy .
But it was thin , superficial .
A feint toward demonstrating that he understands the problems working people are facing .
A dollop of rhetoric about job retraining .
But that , I suspect , sounds perfunctory and insincere to the average person , because the average person thinks that Democrats are more sincere about things like that , just as it probably sounds insincere to the average American when Democrats talk about being tough on the crime .
Crime is the GOP beat .
Job retraining is the Democrats ' turf .
Beyond that , it was lower taxes ( with an outright lie about Obama 's tax proposals ) and reduced spending .
But there was n't … well , there was n't anything .
There were no specifics and worse , there was no passion .
To say that he will have to sharpen his economic message is akin to saying that Britney has a little work to do to restore her reputation .
Even on foreign policy , McCain was n't assertive .
He went through the motions on Iraq and the surge , but , a vision for the world , or anything like that ?
He spelled out nothing .
The crowd .
It was weird .
A protestor got into the hall and disrupted the speech a bit at first .
The crowd kept shouting the protestor down by chanting , ever more loudly , " USA ! USA ! "
The chant had a martial and even nasty quality to it and created a strange vibe in the hall .
But more than that , the chanters drowned out their own candidate .
He had to plead with them for quiet at one point .
At other points , the audience sort of forgot they were supposed to cheer for a few seconds before they remembered and lugubriously put their hands together .
As McCain finished up , the applause drowned out the words , but not because the crowd had been driven to an ecstatic frenzy .
They seemed to be saying , " Thank God he 's done ! "
In the speech 's last three or four minutes , he did present the lineaments of a coherent theme about country and sacrifice , and how – yes , inevitably – his time in the Hanoi Hilton had taught him to put away childish things and love his country in a more profound way .
That is an experience he has that Barack Obama obviously does not , and it works to his benefit .
If he were running at a " normal " time , whatever normal is , it would be enough .
And it still might be , given race and other hurdles Obama must jump .
But this is n't a normal time .
His party 's standing is lower than it 's been in decades , 80 % of Americans think the country is seriously off on the wrong track and people want answers .
He certainly did not offer them .
I doubt the women in the information booth could have been much help .
From the people who brought you the Terri Schiavo spectacle , the stem - cell research stalemate and the atrocious waste of tax money on abstinence - only sex education that has been shown not to work , comes a sequel : a proposal to redefine abortion to include some of the most common forms of birth control , and to potentially penalize with funding cuts hundreds of thousands of doctors , hospitals and other health care providers who expect their employees to give women full reproductive care .
This parting gift to the religious right comes in a proposed rule by the Health and Human Services Department , which says it is merely revising existing federal rules that allow health care personnel to opt out of performing an abortion if they have a moral or religious objection to the procedure .
From that minimalist and unobjectionable clause , a monster grows .
The draft regulation would redefine abortion to include “ any of the various procedures — including the prescription , dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action — that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth , whether before or after implantation . ”
The right wing has failed to win approval of a “ human life ” amendment to the Constitution that would declare that life begins at conception .
It has failed to get even conservative - leaning courts to go along with the most extreme elements of its anti-abortion agenda .
It failed to block approval of the RU - 486 pill that produces a medical abortion .
It failed to block government approval of emergency contraception — the “ morning after ” pill long promoted by the medical profession — which is taken whether or not a woman even knows she is pregnant .
Seven years ago , when the first Bush administration budget included language that would drop a requirement that federal workers ’ health insurance plans offer contraception if the plan includes coverage of prescription drugs , a bipartisan storm extinguished the idea .
And so , having failed to keep American women from having access to basic birth control , the right is trying to use the guise of an existing “ conscience ” requirement to achieve what it cannot accomplish through an open political process .
You could , if you were taken to an emergency room after being raped , be told by a worker invoking the conscience clause that you cannot have a drug to prevent a possible pregnancy .
“ Women would be totally subject to the luck of the draw when they went to get reproductive health care , ” says Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
Administration officials say they cannot comment in detail on the proposal because it is a draft .
They insist it is being promoted merely because the agency has an obligation to enforce the existing conscience rules .
Yet the document reveals its own origins :
In recent years , as religious conservatives have tried to get pharmacies to allow employees to refuse to dispense birth control pills to women , states have responded with laws that require the prescriptions to be filled .
Six states have laws ensuring that pharmacies will fill birth control prescriptions and 27 have laws guaranteeing equity in insurance prescription coverage for contraception , according to Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y .
Fourteen states currently have laws guaranteeing rape victims access to emergency contraception .
The draft rule , in fact , singles out New York , California , Colorado , Illinois , Connecticut , New Jersey and Massachusetts for actions they took to ensure that women , especially rape victims , would have access to birth control .
It estimates that about 504,000 recipients of federal funds — including any hospital or doctor who participates in Medicare and Medicaid — would have to allow its staff to exercise its individual birth - control conscience .
It defines a health care “ entity ” to include health maintenance organizations and other insurance plans — language indicating that federal employees who receive insurance through the government also could be affected .
Clinton and other senators have written to Secretary Michael O. Leavitt in an effort to stop the proposal ; so have scores of public health and women ’s groups .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has called the proposed redefinition of abortion “ inconsistent with all established medical authorities ” and “ an affront to health professionals and American women . ”
The religious right has only six months left in President Bush ’s term to continue its war on science and its war on women .
The latest sneak attack has been exposed .
Congress has a duty to beat it back .

F# is already a great language .
The CTP version was a big step for F# , but , of course , there 's still room for improvement .
Here are some of my wishes .
Compile - time meta- programming
With CTP , quotation library has been improved .
It 's a very nice way to manipulate code at run time , evaluate it or compile it .
I really enjoy this feature , which reminds me some Lisp ( and the ' operator ) , but I wish I could do this code manipulation at compile - time .
This would make meta - programming much easier , it would improve performances .
I guess it 's possible to find many uses of this feature .
Lisp , OCaml ( with camlp4 ) already have similar features .
Suggestion : First , the user writes a transformation function , with type Quotations .
Expr <'a > -> Quotations .
Expr <'b >.
Then , he compiles it into a library .
Finally , he tells the compiler to call his function on the source code .
With attributes , it would be possible to call transformation functions on a particular piece of code .
[ < Transform ( " trace " ) > ] let foo x = // ...
The " trace " function would be called to transform the foo function at compile - time .
I also believe such a feature would allow a stream fusion implementation .
Remove type annotations for objects , when possible
The following function is valid :
let f x = x + x
The type of x is determined by the context ( i.e. how the function is called in the source code ) .
I wish the following function was accepted as well :
let f ' x = x.
Length
Unfortunately , it requires explicit type annotations .
It 's the same behavior for inlined versions :
let inline g x = x + x let inline g' x = x.
Length
Only g is accepted by the compiler .
The generic solution for this uses an ugly syntax ( see FSharp .
Core / prim - types.fs for details ) .
Automatic code duplication
let f x = x + x
This function accepts either an int argument , or a float ( or other types ) , but not both .
Thus , this gives a type error :
f 2 , f 2 . 3
A workaround is to duplicate the f function :
let f x = x + x let f' x = x + x f 2 , f ' 2 . 3
I wish the compiler duplicated the code itself , as C++ templates do .
Of course , it 's possible to use the " inline " keyword , but it 's not always a good thing : it duplicates the code on every call , and some functions can't be inlined ( e.g. recursive functions ) .
String interpolation
F# is often compared to scripting languages .
String interpolation is a feature found in most dynamic languages .
In most Unix shells , Perl and PHP , the syntax is :
" x = $ x " or " x = $ {x } "
In Ruby , it is :
" x = # {x } "
For backward - compatibility , string interpolation should be exlicit in F#. I suggest we add a $ prefix to strings with interpolation .
For instance :
print $ " x = $ x " print $ " 1 + 2 = $ { 1+2 } "
By the way , I 'd like to see a " print " function in F# standard library : let print = print_any .
This feature is not very hard to implement , it can be syntactic sugar ( which calls fprintf ) .
I 'm surprised most compiled languages do n't have this feature .
Binary / unary operators
Some operators can be used only prefix , e.g. (! ) , (!! ) , (?+ ) .
Some operators can be used only infix , e.g. (+ ) , ( --) , ( % % ) .
Why not allow every operators to be used both infix and prefix ?
I 'd like !! 2 to be parsed as ( !!) 2 , and 4 !!
5 to be parsed as ( !! ) 4 5 .
Operators precedence
Precedence rules are quite hard to master and not very flexible .
For instance , I 'm always confused with the sformat library : how is parsed the expression a $ $ b -- c @@ d ++ e ?
Some languages ( e.g. Haskell ) allow the user to change operators precedence .
I 'd like to see this in F# too .
Duck typing
It 's possible to have duck typing in F# , but the syntax is n't pretty .
We often do n't need duck typing in F# , thanks to the great type system , but I believe it would be sometimes nice to have it .
Boo language is a statically typed language , but it has syntactic sugar for duck typing .
Have a look at this page for details : http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing
Extension methods
Extension methods are great , but they sometimes do n't work .
let inline f x = x + x
f works for any type with a (+ ) operator .
If you define a new type with a (+ ) operator , it will work with f .
But , if you use extension methods to add a (+ ) operator to an existing type , f does n't accept it .
type A ( ) = static member ( + ) ( x:A , y: A ) = 3 type System .
Boolean with static member ( + ) ( x:bool , y: bool ) = 3
Then , A ( ) + A ( ) is allowed , but true + true is n't .
FSI
I also have a few ideas to improve FSI ( improve history , see the list of bindings , etc. ) .
As FSI is somewhat outside the compiler , it seems to be quite easy to modify and improve it .
I might give a try ( feel free to send me suggestions for a better FSI ) .
An official statement is released :
This morning we woke up to some very serious and troubling news from Wall Street .
The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that are generating enormous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets .
This turmoil is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good - paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills , save for their future , and make their mortgage payments .
The challenges facing our financial system today are more evidence that too many folks in Washington and on Wall Street were n’t minding the store .
Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections , loosened oversight and regulation , and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle - class Americans have brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression .
I certainly do n’t fault Senator McCain for these problems , but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to .
It ’s a philosophy we ’ve had for the last eight years – one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
It ’s a philosophy that says even common - sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise , and one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises .
Well now , instead of prosperity trickling down , the pain has trickled up – from the struggles of hardworking Americans on Main Street to the largest firms of Wall Street .
This country can’t afford another four years of this failed philosophy .
For years , I have consistently called for modernizing the rules of the road to suit a 21st century market – rules that would protect American investors and consumers .
And I ’ve called for policies that grow our economy and our middle - class together .
That is the change I am calling for in this campaign , and that is the change I will bring as President .

Second , Washington could impose a national requirement that every state move its utilities to a system of “ decoupling - plus . ”
This is the technical term for changing the way utilities make money  shifting them from getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to consume to getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to save .
Several states have already moved down this path .
Third , an idea offered by Andy Karsner , former assistant secretary of energy , would be to modify the tax code so that any company that invests in new domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy technology  or procures any clean energy system or energy savings device that is made by an American manufacturer  can write down the entire cost of the investment via a tax credit and / or accelerated depreciation in the first year .
“ I ’m talking about anything from energy efficient windows to water heaters to industrial boilers to solar panels , and the job creating , manufacturing facilities that produce them  anything that makes us more efficient , lean and economically competitive and comes from a domestic , American source , ” said Karsner .
He also suggests using some of the money from any stimulus package to directly incentivize and support states ’ efforts to implement and intelligently modernize their building codes to get already well - established national “ best practices ” quickly into their marketplaces .
Lastly , we need the next president to be an energy efficiency trendsetter , starting by reinventing the inaugural parade .
Get rid of the black stretch limos and double - plated armored Chevy Tahoes inching down Pennsylvania Avenue .
Instead , let the next president announce that he will use no vehicles on inauguration day that get less than 30 miles per gallon .
He could invite all car companies to participate in the historic drive with their best available American - made , fuel - efficient , innovative vehicle .
Finally , if Congress passes another stimulus package , it ca n’t just be another round of $ 600 checks to go buy flat - screen TVs made in China .
It has to also include bridges to somewhere  targeted investments in scientific research , mass transit , domestic clean - tech manufacturing and energy efficiency that will make us a more productive and innovative society , one with more skills , more competitiveness , more productivity and better infrastructure to lead the next great industrial revolution : E.T.  energy technology .
C&Ler Bill G reminded me of this clip by Max .
It 's " Blumenthal 's latest that takes us on a shocking and at times bizarre tour of right - wing Pastor John Hagee 's annual Washington - Israel Summit " .
Hagee introduces Liebermann by saying that he supports Joe 's vision of attacking Iran .
Hagee :
Therefore it is time for America to embrace the words of Senator Joe Lieberman , and consider a military preemptive strike on Iran to prevent a nuclear holocaust of Israel .
Lieberman : I want to take the liberty of describing Pastor Hagee in the words that the Tirah uses to describe Moses .... he is a man of God .
How long has Joe Lieberman known Pastor Hagee anyway ?
We do know as far back as July of 2007 , that 's almost a year ago --- Lieberman was hanging with Hagee , comparing him to Moses and knew nothing of his extreme positions ?
Will the press finally ask Joe about his relationship with Hagee now ?

Toronto ranks as the world 's fourth best city to experience culture , behind only London , Paris and New York , a new study on globalization has found .
Washington , D.C. - based Foreign Policy magazine 's inaugural Global Cities Index , in the November / December issue , assesses 60 urban areas around the globe in five broad categories : business , human capital , culture , global political influence and the centrality of the city to global information flows .
The " cultural experience " category tallies cities ' international sporting events and international travellers , and assesses their restaurants , museums and performing arts .
Toronto received praise for the quality and cosmopolitan nature of its cuisine – 94 per cent of our top restaurants are " international " – and the city 's place in the North American touring circuit .
The survey 's data also cites Massey and Roy Thomson halls and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra .
Toronto placed 10th overall out of the 60 , edging out Washington , D.C. , which came in 11th .
But Toronto ranks lower in international business and global political influence , 26th and 24th respectively .
Toronto fared better as a place of international learning , as the 13th best place to take a university degree .
In that category , it 's sandwiched between Bangkok and Madrid – and distant from London , Tokyo and Singapore , all in the top five .
The top business cities were New York , Tokyo , Paris , and London , while Washington , D.C. placed first in terms of international political influence .
Kolkata , India , ranked 60th , placed close to last in every category .
Four of the top 10 " global cities " were in North America , four in Asia and two in Europe .
" The term itself conjures a command centre for the cognoscenti .
It means power , sophistication , wealth , and influence .
To call a global city your own suggests that the ideas and values of your metropolis shape the world , " the authors wrote .
Foreign Policy has published indexes measuring countries ' levels of globalization , and ranked the world 's top 100 public intellectuals .

A pilot 's license and a torn $ 100 bill found Monday by hiker Preston Morrow in California appear to belong to Steve Fossett , the adventurer who vanished on a solo flight more than a year ago , authorities said Wednesday .
MAMMOTH LAKES , California 
Search teams have found the wreckage of the plane piloted by missing adventurer Steve Fossett , who vanished more than a year ago , Madera County , Calif .
Sheriff John Anderson said Thursday .
An aerial search late Wednesday spotted the wreckage in the Inyo National Forest near the town of Mammoth Lakes , Anderson said at a news conference , and searchers confirmed it was Fossett 's single - engine Bellanca plane .
It was the first development since authorities announced Wednesday that a hiker in rugged mountain wilderness found items belonging to Fossett .
A pilot license and a membership card in the Soaring Society of America found off a trail in eastern California belonged to the multimillionaire , said Erica Stuart , a spokeswoman for Madera County .
Preston Morrow also found other IDs , ten $ 100 bills and a $ 5 bill on Monday .
Morrow , 43 , said he was hiking off regular trails when he spotted money on the ground on a steep ridge at about 10,000 feet .
" Wow , hundred dollar bills , " Morrow recalled .
He did not realize initially that the items , which bore the name James Stephen Fossett , were linked to the famous aviator and adventurer .
He turned them over to police Wednesday after unsuccessfully attempting to contact the Fossett family .
He returned to the area with his wife and three friends in search of other items and the wreckage .
His wife found a pullover fleece , but they saw no sign of a plane or human remains , Morrow said .
Fossett 's widow , Peggy , said she was aware of the discovery .
" I am hopeful that this search will locate the crash site and my husband 's remains , " she said in a statement .
The discovery prompted a renewed effort to locate Fossett and the single - engine plane he borrowed Sept. 3 , 2007 , from a Nevada ranch owned by hotel magnate Barron Hilton .
A search team headed into the wilderness about noon Wednesday .
Jeff Page , emergency manager of Lyon County , Nevada , who worked on the original search , said a California Highway Patrolman and a commercial pilot had both reported seeing what they thought was Fossett 's plane in the Mammoth Lakes area .
An extensive effort to locate Fossett included aerial searches over this area , about 90 miles south of Hilton 's ranch .
The most intense searching was in areas to the north .
Fossett , who made a fortune trading futures and options on Chicago markets , gained worldwide fame for more than 100 attempts and successes in setting records in high - tech balloons , gliders , jets and boats .
In 2002 , he became the first person to circle the world solo in a balloon .
He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in July 2007 .
He also swam the English Channel , completed an Ironman Triathlon and climbed some of the world 's best - known peaks .

A new method of house construction is in the final stages of development and you could well be seeing signs stating “ Beware Contour Crafting in progress ” sometime soon .
Boffins at the University of South California have developed a robotic gantry that builds up walls to almost any shape and specification without any manual labour , plans are input into a computer and the concrete laying machine goes about its duty , able to finish an entire house within a day without a single tea break .
Behrokh Khoshnevis is the brainchild behind this building machine after looking into methods of rapid construction as a way to reconstruct areas devestated by natural disasters such as earthquakes which have plagued his native Iran .
Not only a labour saver of note but the machine is environmentally sound too as reports claim up to seven tonnes of waste are produced by convential house building and the machine would also negate the need for heavy vehicle usage too .
Khoshnevis has also had interest from NASA in his machine as a potential builder of a lunar habitat .
Thrainn Eggertsson writes to the FT :
The government of Iceland has now been offered foreign loans that roughly equal the country ’s gross domestic product .
The annual interest payments , say 3 - 4 per cent , approximately correspond to the country ’s annual economic growth .
Additionally the loans must be paid up .
I believe Thrainn is being generous with that growth estimate .
Then he compares Iceland to Germany in 1919 and predicts similar consequences ( I do n’t think he means that as a threat , however ) .
Instead , I wonder what it is like for a country to be truly , permanently bankrupt .
And a further difficulty lies on the horizon .
Circa 2000 , fish accounted for 70 percent of the country ’s export earnings .
Here are many articles on dwindling cod stocks , the number one item sold by Icelandic fishermen .
I genuinely cannot imagine what the endgame looks like .
An urban legend to comfort America : oil is oil , even if it is not oil
This is the fourth post in a series examining “ urban legends ” about energy that comfort Americans .
These five myths are :
I . Our massive reserves of unconventional oil .
II .
We ’ll run crash programs to solve peak oil , just as we mobilized for WWII .
III .
Demand creates supply , by raising prices .
IV .
Oil is Oil , even if it is not oil
V. Demand creates supply , from new technology .
(4) Oil is Oil , even if it is not oil
A common reply to warnings about peak oil is that we have vast reserves of oil .
True , but misleading and of limited significance over short - and medium - term horizons .
When the world relied mostly on oil from the wonderful super - giant fields , the distinction between different types of oil was trivial except to those in the oil business .
Sweet , sour , deep — these were technical terms .
Now that these conventional sources are peaking , we must turn to unconventional sources .
Calling unconventional sources “ oil ” leads to serious confusion .
More accurately seen , there is a spectrum of petroleum resources beyond conventionals .
Peak oil is a transitional period during which we move …
from reliance on relatively scarce , cheap , and easily tapped conventional oil
to more abundant , expensive , and difficult to exploit unconventional sources ( and alternative energy ) .
Another way to see this : extraction of conventionals are constrained by their limited abundance .
Unconventionals are constrained by our ability to produce them , due to their greater operational complexity and lower energy - return - on - investment ( EROI ) .
The result : the price of the oil products increases over time .
No matter how frequently said , the development of unconventionals probably will not lower the price of oil .
I believe that technological breakthoughs eventually will produce new energy sources — a faith - based statement — but that might be years or even generations in the future .
The difference in EROI is esp important and often ignored .
Conventionals require investment of little energy to yield a lot .
Unconventionals require substantial input of energy for extraction and processing .
This also makes it difficult to rapidly increase output , as their net energy gain scales differently than do conventionals .
One step further along the spectrum
Petroleum resources lie along a spectrum , as there is no bright line between conventional and unconventional resources .
For example , oil found deep under the ocean or in the polar regions is oil in a chemical sense , but economically quite different — due to the greater cost , technical hurdles , and time required for extraction compared to drilling conventional oil wells .
So they are somewhat arbitrarily considered unconventionals .
Further along the spectrum , Venezuela ’s heavy oil is chemically oil — but with far greater processing requirements and a far lower EROI than regular oil .
Two steps further into fantasy
(1) Bitumen ( aka “ oil sands ” )
Conflating bitumen is misleading ( at best ) .
This is often done when calculating global oil resources , giving Canada the world ’s 2nd largest reserves .
Its economics are radically different than for conventional oil , mined and processed rather than pumped and refined .
Both capital costs and operating costs are far higher than for conventional oil .
Note that comparison of “ operating costs ” and “ breakeven points ” are useless unless they include amortization of capital costs ( which they seldom do ) .
Also , the massive infrastructure required to mine , transport , and process the ore makes scaling up operations difficult and slow — as companies are finding in Alberta .
Current plans call for Alberta to be producing 5 million barrels / day of synfuel by 2020 .
That is probably insufficient to replace the decline of North America ’s production by 2020 , might exceed the available water and energy ( natural gas or nukes ) resources , and would leave much of Alberta looking like a moonscape .
For more information about mining bitumen see the following studies of the oil sands industry .
They provide balanced looks at the challenges and costs of expanding production in Alberta .
Excerpt from article # 5 , one of the few calcuations that include all costs and list most of the assumptions :
A new report found the break - even oil price required by new mining projects in the oil sands has jumped to $ 85 a barrel , an increase of $ 20 or 31 % in barely more than a year .
In the report , National Bank Financial senior vice - president Peter Ogden said the break - even price– which assumes an 8 % rate of return , capital costs of $ 120,000 per flowing barrel and operating costs of $ 27 a barrel — has crept up because of climbing labour and material costs and higher royalties in Alberta under a new fiscal regime beginning in January .
The break - even price in May , 2007 , was $ 65 a barrel , assuming an 8 % rate of return , capital costs of $ 100,000 per flowing barrel and operating costs of $ 20.50 a barrel .
Excerpt from the report described in article # 6 :
At the revised costs for Fort Hills , we believe a typical made - in - Alberta oil snads project generates a 10 % IRR ( after - tax ) at approximately $ 100 / bbl versus our previous view in the $ 80 / bbl range . …
This ugly combination of events mean we are likely at the breaking point for some oil sands development ( including Fort Hills ) .
(2) Kerogen ( aka “ oil shale ” )
Conflating deposits of kerogen with conventional oil reserves is outright deception , as there is as yet no proven large - scale commercially feasible process for mining and refining shale oil ( although some are under development ) .
It is not just a question of cost , but of developing the necessary technology .
Most estimates show that decades will be required to perfect and scale - up extraction and refining of these reserves — assuming the many problems can be overcome .
I believe the largest running plant today is that of Fushun Mining Group in China , scheduled to produce 7,400 barrels / day in 2008 and 14,000 b/ day at some point in the future ( source ) .
For more information about mining kerogen see WiIkipedia on shale oil and shale oil extraction , and the Congressional Research Service report on Shale Oil dated 13 April 2006 ( 32 pages ) .
Conclusions
Now these distinctions are often ignored , as easy assurances of our vast energy resources are used to cloud our minds to the risks ahead .
As we come to rely more on unconventional energy resources , understanding these distinctions might mean the difference between prosperity and poverty .
Can we increasing production from such sources sufficiently rapidly to replace declines from super - giant fields like Mexico ’s Cantarell and Kurwait ’s Burgan fields ?
Based on our experience to date , probably not without crash programs on a scale like that of major wars .
Avoiding a crash following peak oil might require starting these crash programs well before peaking — meaning research and planning on a scale far greater than today’s .
Just because we can does not mean that we will .
Optimists often confuse the two .
Much of the literature about Peak Oil seeks to create a sense of urgency so that we start work now , while rebuttals tend to urge ( by result if not intent ) complacency — starting tomorrow , next year , or whenever .

Two More Bio-Chemists Murdered Two French students , working on the real origins of bird flu , tortured , killed in London By George Kadar Two French biochemical students , Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez , were murdered by Israeli Mossad - British intelligence assassination teams on June 29 , 2008 .
Both Bonomo and Ferez were studying at the prestigious London Imperial College researching the origins of bird flu and the link to the alleged vaccines .
The murders were first revealed by France ’s Directorate for Internal Security , not by Britain ’s Scotland Yard , making it likely that the students were French intelligence officers .
London police arrested Daniel Sonnex , 23 , and Nigel Edward Farmer in the killings .
A joint French - U.S. Intelligence anti-terrorist task force in Paris , headed by former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former head of French intelligence Jean Crouté , for years has monitored the activity of the Israeli mercenaries .
The patriotic American - French team has allegedly prevented various scripted terrorist attacks , i.e. false flags , on both the United States and Europe , with the planning of the attacks actually originating inside the compromised intelligence agencies of the United States , the United Kingdom , Israel and Germany , according to task force sources .
The two researchers had discovered that the alleged bird flu vaccine , H - 7 , which was designed to neutralize and stop the H5N1 avian flu virus , had been spliced using DNA to actually create a vaccine and an illness producing virus at the same time .
The French students had also discovered that the bird flu vaccine , i.e. a virus , had links to U.S. , British and Israeli laboratories associated with the noted Mossad agent , Dr. Philip M. Zackerie .
Israeli microbiologist Zackerie , known as “ Dr. Zack , ” worked for the U.S. bio-weapons lab at Ft. Detrick , Md. , where he was photographed handling the strain of anthrax used in the post 9 - 11 attack according to published reports .
He was a consultant at the FBI linked company Gilead Sciences Inc. of Boulder , Colo .
Gilead Sciences has been linked to the 9 - 11 anthrax strain and to the bird flu vaccine .
The two French students , who had their apartment broken into one week before their brutal assassination , also had their lap - top computer stolen and their apartment fire - bombed .
The operation has been traced to a team of 10 Israeli Mossad and British MI5 agents .
The two individuals currently under arrest in the United Kingdom were witnesses to the murders , according to task force sources ,
and their lives are in jeopardy .
The assassination of Bonomo and Ferez happened just after the recent meetings that took place in Northern Ireland between President George Bush , former President Bill Clinton and current British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
The two murders also may be related to the recent alleged assassination attempt on French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel .
Officially , an Israeli border patrol officer who was a member of the Druze community shot himself as Sarkozy and his wife were mounting the stairs to their plane .
The man ’s body then fell from the top of the building where he had been perched .
Many believe he was an Arab patsy - to - be before the assassination attempt went awry .
Sarkozy was also aware of the bird flu treason and plans to use it against France as well as the Israeli Mossad hacking of French INTERPOL Internet portals using the U.S. National Security Agency and a headquarters in Amsterdam .
George Kadar is a Hungarian national living in England .
He acts as one of AFP ’s European bureau chiefs .

Staving off crack dealers is n’t usually a concern for rock stars of Mr. Coyne ’s stature .
His band has toured the world ; released 12 albums , including “ The Soft Bulletin ” and “ Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots , ” which combined have sold nearly two million copies ; and influenced a generation of artists , from Radiohead to Coldplay .
And his latest project , “ Christmas on Mars , ” a film he was the co-director of and stars in with bandmates and friends  and which he filmed largely at the compound  will be released next month .
Yet Mr. Coyne , 47 , still lives a few blocks from where he grew up , in a neighborhood of mostly one - story shotgun shacks with chipped paint and weedy yards .
Large dogs standing guard on sagging porches suggest the crack reference was n’t a colorful metaphor .

Living here , he says , gives him freedom .
“ You can do what you want  when we rehearse , nobody ever complains about the noise . ”
And anywhere else , he added , “ you could n’t shoot a movie in your yard . ”
He built the sets for “ Christmas on Mars , ” a “ freaked - out druggy movie ” about a group of astronauts spending the holiday on a space station , in the backyard and other parts of the compound , he said , often using household items .
The result is a marvel of ingenuity : hot tubs flipped on their sides became space - station walls ; a Williams - Sonoma gelato maker served as the machine the astronauts used to make snow .
“ There ’s a thing called big junk week here , where people throw out large items , ” Mr. Coyne said .
“ I ’d drive around and stuff would spark my imagination . ”
Mr. Coyne is clearly a lover of imagination - sparking items , which are on display , in one form or another , throughout both the film and the compound  and which lends them the same whimsical , childlike brio that his band is known for .
Flaming Lips songs eschew standard pop music themes  in the group ’s hit “ She Do n’t Use Jelly ” ( 1993 ) he sings about a girl who dyes her hair with tangerines  and the band revels in playful experiments like the “ Zaireeka ” album ( 1997 ) , four separate discs intended to be played simultaneously on four stereos in infinitely varying combinations .
Flaming Lips concerts , meanwhile , are transcendent pop-art events : Mr. Coyne encourages fans to come in costume ( sometimes as specific animals , or as Teletubbies , or as Santa Claus ) and at some point during each concert , he rolls over the crowd encased in a plastic bubble .

Police say inconsistencies in McCain staffer 's story
Friday , October 24 , 2008
By Jerome L. Sherman , Pittsburgh Post - Gazette
Police say there are inconsistencies in the story of a McCain campaign staffer who told them she was mugged in Bloomfield on Wednesday night by a man who etched a " B " on her cheek when he saw a McCain sticker on her car .
Ashley Todd , 20 , of College Station , Texas , spent five hours with robbery detectives last night at police headquarters , where she took a polygraph test .
She told police that a man robbed her as she tried to take money from an ATM machine at Pearl Street and Liberty Avenue around 9 p.m. Wednesday .
Ms . Todd told police she then began walking to her car , which had McCain stickers on it .
She told police that although the robber had moved away from her , he became agitated when he saw her car , punched her in the back of the head , pushed her to the ground and carved the letter into her face .
Yesterday , she said the man sexually assaulted her , a detail that police said she did n't mention in the initial report .
Police today said that security camera footage from the Citizens Bank does n't show the incident , but it could have happened outside the camera 's range .
Police also said they have found no witnesses to the attack .
Ms. Todd has said she will return for further interviewing today and will help police create a composite sketch of her attacker .
He is described as a 6 - foot 4 - inch , 200 - pound black man , with medium build and short black hair .

Have you ever wished you could go back in time and have a conversation with one of the greatest minds in history ?
Well , you ca n’t sorry , they ’re dead .
Unless of course you ’re clairaudient , be my guest .
But for the rest of us , we can still refer to the words they left behind .
Even though these great teachers have passed on , their words still live , and in them their wisdom .
I ’ve made a list of seven what I believe are some of the greatest teachings by the world ’s greatest minds .
1. Realizing Your Dreams
“ If you do n’t know where you are going , you ’ll end up someplace else . ”
– Lawrence J. Peter
In order for us to achieve our dreams , we must have a vision of our goals .
Writing down our dreams and creating a list of actions helps us stick to our plan .
As it ’s said “ if you ca n’t measure it , you ca n’t manage it ” .
When we turn our goals into measurable actions , we gain clarity and are able to see the necessary steps we must take in order to achieve them .
Action : Visualize a life of your wildest dreams .
What did you dream of doing when you were a child ?
What would you do if you had a million dollars ?
Create a vision for your goals and start breaking them down into small actions that you can take on a day by day basis .
2. Overcoming Fear
“ It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young person , “ Always do what you are afraid to do . ”
– Ralph Waldo Emerson
The best way to learn something is to dive right in to it .
When we overcome our fear of failure , we learn that only those who are asleep make no mistakes .
Fear is the only thing keeping us from experiencing a life of love and fulfillment .
If we make a commitment to an uncompromisable quest for truth , we will realize that as we grow more into the truth , our fears start to disappear .
Action :
You must define your fears in order to conquer them .
Create a list of everything you ’re afraid of and start facing them one at a time .
Make a commitment to yourself now to not let fear rule your life .
3. Intention and Desire
“ All that we are is the result of what we have thought .
The mind is everything .
What we think , we become . ”- Guatama Buddha
Our thoughts determine our reality .
When we stop thinking about what we do n’t and begin thinking about what we do want , our lives begin to transform .
Instead of working against our desires and intentions , we move into alignment with them .
Action : Create a list of your intentions and desires .
Wherever you go , take this list with you .
Read it when you wake up and before you go to sleep .
4. Happiness
“ Happiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances . ”
– Benjamin Franklin
Happiness comes from an inner peace , understanding and acceptance of life ; a perspective of truth that opens your eyes to the beauty of life all around us .
Happiness cannot be achieved by external status , it must be an internal state that we realize when we see our innate perfection .
Action : Realize that happiness is a choice .
In every decision you make ask yourself “ how can I respond to make myself happy and fulfilled ? ”
5. Self Acceptance
“ If a house be divided against itself , that house cannot stand . ” – Jesus
When we stop trying to be what we are not , we realize our authenticity .
Before we had knowledge , we were completely authentic .
We learn to use knowledge to measure and judge , which is a powerful tool we have as humans .
However we create an image of perfection in our mind of what we should be , but are not .
We confuse knowledge for nature .
We believe in the lie of our imperfection .
When we realize this we can reclaim the truth of our perfection and live in love and acceptance .
Action :
Make a commitment to never go against yourself .
Practice non-judgment and realize that the same part of your mind that condemns you is the same voice that caused you to take the action in the first place .
We do n’t even have to believe what we say to ourselves .
6. Appreciation and Gratitude
“ So much has been given to me , I have not time to ponder over that which has been denied . ”
– Helen Keller
How many times do we count our misfortunes rather than our blessings ?
When we take time to open our eyes to the miracle of life we can see the many gifts that have been given to us .
Remembering all the beautiful aspects of life and all the reasons you are blessed can immediately shift our mood .
We can move from sorrow and despair to appreciation and hope .
Action : Each time you find yourself complaining about something , re-direct your focus to something you are grateful for .
Make a habit of transforming your awareness of troubles into an awareness of abundance .
7 . The Art of Simplicity
“ I made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it short . ”
– Blaise Pascal
Perfection is not when there is nothing to add , but when there is nothing more to take away .
As Bruce Lee once said “ the height of cultivation always runs to simplicity . ”
True mastery of our lives is realizing the simple joys of life , removing distractions and clutter from our lives .
Action :
The art of simplicity is knowing what to take away .
Practice recognizing when you ’re spending your time on unimportant tasks and re-focus on the important .
This list is by no means exhaustive .
There are other many great teachings that I did not include here because I felt like they were already expounded on thoroughly elsewhere , such as Einstein and Gandhi ’s timeless classics .
There are also great teachings to be found from our parents or friends .
If you have any lessons to add , I encourage you to share them with us in the comments below .
Also , I want to give a special thanks to Manu for inspiring me with his “ 10 Golden Lessons from Albert Einstein ” .
Sharing is caring !

Here , in this shattering new interview , Stephen Spoonamore goes into harrowing detail about the Bush regime ’s election fraud , past , present and –if we do n’t spread the word right now –to come .
Since he ’s the only whistle - blower out there who knows the perps themselves , and how they operate , we have to send this new piece far and wide .
Here Spoon tells us that McBush ’s team–i.e. , Karl Rove and his henchpersons– have their plan in place to steal this next election : by 51.2 % of the popular vote , and three electoral votes .
He also talks about the major role played by the Christianist far right in the electronic rigging of the vote .
And he defines our electronic voting system as a major threat to US national security , calling for it to be junked ASAP , in favor of hand - counted paper ballots .
Since Spoon is a Republican and erstwhile McCain supporter , as well as a noted specialist in nosing out computer fraud , his testimony is essential–not only for its expertise , but , no less , for the impact that his views will surely have on those Republicans who have been loath to see what Bush & Co. has done to our election system .
That whole story ’s just about to break .
In fact , tomorrow there will be a number of articles appearing , on a recent breakthrough in the lawsuit that Spoon ’s testimony has enabled , and on other aspects of that all - important case .
Spoonamore says that the GOP wanted e-voting to steal elections but now foreign governments will be hacking and the winner will be determined by the best hackers .
He says that if the GOP wins the hacking competition , McCain will win 51.2 percent with three electoral votes over Obama , and it will be a stolen election .
Spoon also makes a crucial point about the people who have been implicated in much of the election theft : “ They are religious extremists . ”
He names those who know about stolen elections , and he insists that the only way to protect this election is with paper ballots , hand - counted .
Cyber Security expert Stephen Spoonamore discusses electronic voting vulnerabilities , and says the 2008 election WILL be stolen , in this ten part series :
Part 1 – “ It ’s a network people . ”
Part 2 – “ Electronic voting machines are a national security threat . ”
Part 3 – “ The genie is out of the bottle … ”
Part 4 – “ Fifty ways to steal an election . ”
Part 5 – “ Mike Connel : Bush IT Guru . ”
Part 6 – “ The Rapp family : Ohio election coverup . ”
Part 7 – “ Evangelical Christians and electronic voting machines . ”
Part 8 – “ What part do n’t you understand … paper ballots please . ”
Part 9 – “ McCain / Palin by … ”
Part 10 – “ People should doubt the vote … because it ’s being stolen . ”

For another 8 part series ( video ) interviewing Stephen Spoonamore ( equally as interesting – and important to help you understand how this works ) :
Part 1 – Part 2 – Part 3 – Part 4 – Part 5 – Part 6 – Part 7 – Part 8
I watched all of these videos this morning .
I found this second series even MORE interesting than the 10 part series from above .
Every American who cares about living in an actual democracy , not just the illusion of a democracy , with full , fair , and transparent elections , should watch these videos .
This man is a cyber security expert , and he is also a longtime conservative Republican .
He is clanging the warning bells , and explaining with absolute clarity and detail , that our elections ARE being stolen , and warning that we must do something to stop it .
Mark Crispin Miller is author of “ The Bush Dyslexicon “ , “ Fooled Again “ , and “ Loser Take All ” ( along with many other collaborative books ) .
He also wrote the introduction for Edward Bernays book “ Propaganda “ .
I promised to follow up on our recent Which Came First – Pests , or Pesticides ?
story with some info on how these nasties can affect your environment , and you .
We ’ll do so , specifically , by looking at the meaning of the term bio-magnification .
How many have heard the term ?
Hmm … , a few raised hands .
How many of you can explain its meaning to others in the class ?
Okay , not so many .
It ’s actually a pretty simple concept to understand , and it ’s a little frightening to realise the implications once you have .
Clear Lake , California
A classic story of bio-magnification was observed at Clear Lake in California , and well illustrates the deadly process .
In 1949 they sprayed DDD , a form of DDT , to kill a non-biting gnat .
They met with success , initially … .
Two years later the gnat was back , so they repeated the treatment ( readers of our previous pesticide story will understand the term ‘ pesticide treadmill ’ in this context ) .
Sprays continued at more frequent intervals until 1954 .
Over the course of these seasons , however , the carcasses of increasingly large numbers of grebes began to accumulate in the lake – hundreds of them … .
Autopsies of the birds showed incredible concentrations of DDD in their systems , but a check of the lake confirmed the water only contained .02 ppm ( not at all a toxic amount ) .
So how on earth could these birds be dying at all – let alone in such large numbers ?
Remember , this is back in the 1950s – at a time when , despite early warnings that natural systems wo n’t take kindly to being doused in toxic chemicals , there was as yet no historical record to prove their dangers .
It did n’t take long to figure out what happened , however .
Examining various creatures in the lake brought the following results :
While the water contamination level was a paltry .02 ppm , the plankton population had accumulated levels of 5 ppm
Small fish , feeding on the plankton over the course of their lives , had accumulated significantly more at 40 - 300 ppm
Predatory fish , which eat many of these smaller fish over the course of their lives , were found to contain 2,500 ppm
Then along come the unsuspecting grebes – gulping down dozens of highly toxic ‘ treats ’ , each containing approximately 125,000 times more DDD than the water from which they were pulled .
In other words , the higher up the food chain the poison travelled , the more it accumulated , or ‘ magnified ’ , and this magnification can be exponential .
Now , how does this relate to you , you ask ?
It ’s simple – we ’re at the top of most food chains .
Consider that the ‘ further from the sun ’ your dietary habits are , the more our current poison - oriented agricultural practises are likely to impact upon your health .
I have heard people reject the idea of vegetarianism with the rebuff : “ those fruit and vegies are covered in pesticides – give me a steak any day ! ”
Hopefully the above will help these people to see that they ’re trading the risk of a small amount of chemical contamination with a greatly magnified option .
An animal that has spent its life eating fertilised and pesticide - sprayed grass and grains , along with dousings of antibiotics , etc. , can make that T - bone positively dangerous .
Pesticides and other chemicals are stored mainly in body fat and tend to concentrate in breast milk fat .
They can thus be passed on to children during breast feeding , or to unborn babies through the placenta .
If human breast milk came stamped with an ingredients label , it might read something like this : 4 percent fat , vitamins A , C , E and K , lactose , essential minerals , growth hormones , proteins , enzymes and antibodies .
In a healthy woman , it contains 100 percent of virtually everything a baby needs to survive , plus a solid hedge of extras to help ward off a lifetime of diseases like diabetes and cancer .
Breast milk helps disarm salmonella and E. coli .
Its unique recipe of fatty acids boosts brain growth and results in babies with higher I.Q. ’s than their formula - slurping counterparts .
Nursing babies suffer from fewer infections , hospitalizations and cases of sudden infant death syndrome .
For the mother , too , breast - feeding and its delicate plumbing of hormones afford protection against breast and ovarian cancers and stress .
Despite exhaustion , the in - laws and dirty laundry , every time we nurse our babies , the love hormone oxytocin courses out of our pituitaries like a warm bath .
Human milk is like ice cream , Valium and Ecstasy all wrapped up in two pretty packages .
But read down the label , and the fine print , at least for some women , sounds considerably less appetizing : DDT ( the banned but stubbornly persistent pesticide famous for nearly wiping out the bald eagle ) , PCB ’s , dioxin , trichloroethylene , perchlorate , mercury , lead , benzene , arsenic .
When we nurse our babies , we feed them not only the fats , sugars and proteins that fire their immune systems , metabolisms and cerebral synapses .
We also feed them , albeit in minuscule amounts , paint thinners , dry - cleaning fluids , wood preservatives , toilet deodorizers , cosmetic additives , gasoline byproducts , rocket fuel , termite poisons , fungicides and flame retardants .
…
Some of the chemicals I ’m mainlining to my 1 - year - old daughter will stay in her body long enough for her to pass them on to her own offspring .
PCB ’s , for example , can remain in human tissue for decades .
On a body - weight basis , the dietary doses my baby gets are much higher than the doses I get .
This is not only because she is smaller , but also because her food — my milk — contains more concentrated contaminants than my food .
It ’s the law of the food chain , and it ’s called biomagnification .

The problems of pesticide usage do not end with you alone .
Accidents in manufacturing plants are extremely dangerous and can be deadly .
In 1984 , a malfunction at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal , India , killed thousands of people outright and maimed tens of thousands more .
While this has been the most serious accident so far , it has not been the only one .
The widespread dioxin contamination of the area around Seveso , Italy , and the severe contamination of the Rhine following an accident at the Sandoz plant in Basel , Switzerland , are two other recent examples .
Perhaps even more worrisome are the routine releases of toxic wastes from pesticide plants – events that do not make the newspapers .
The Sandoz accident was followed by the deliberate release of toxics from other plants along the Rhine , including the BASF plant at Ludwigshafen .
Every year , the health of millions of farm workers is directly threatened by pesticides .
People working in the fields inhale poisons during and after application and ingest them in their food and water .
Again , the situation is particuarly severe in the South , where labels and warnings are often unintelligible , and where relatively few workers are provided with the recommended protective equipment .
However , even when manufacturers ’ instructions are followed precisely , poisoning is still common .
In 1983 the United Nations Economic and Social Committee for Asia and the Pacific estimated that between 400,000 and 2,000,000 farmers worldwide are poisoned by pesticides each year , 20,000 to 40,000 of whom die as a result .
Another estimate suggests that as many as 300,000 farm workers in the United States alone may be suffering from pesticide - related illnesses .
Direct causal links between pesticide exposure and subsequent long - term illness are extremely difficult to establish .
However , the evidence is mounting .
Out of 426 chemicals named in 1988 by the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries , and Food as ingredients in pesticides cleared for use in England , 164 had been implicated in causing cancer , genetic mutations , irritant reactions , or reproductive problems ranging from impotency to birth defects .
A 1986 National Cancer Institute study reported that farmers exposed to herbicides – espectially 2,4 - D – for more than twenty days per year were six times as likely to develop non-Hodgkins lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system .
In the prime agricultural region of the San Joaquin Valley of California , where 35 % of the wells are contaminated with DPCP , the State Department of Health Services found an increased mortality rate for stomach cancer , the primary site for tumour induction in animals used in testing DPCP .
In the small farm community of McFarland , California , thirteen children have developed cancer since 1981 , and six have died ; miscarriages , fetal deaths and low birth weights are common .
A definitive causal link has not been established , but pesticide contamination in the region is a likely factor .
Other recent studies link agricultural chemicals to an increase in birth defects .
…
Scientists are finding higher and higher levels of pesticides in people throughout the world .
The effects are poorly understood , but the increased use of pesticides and other industrial chemicals has been followed by increased cancer rates .
Since chronic health problems are usually slow in developing , it may well be that the most serious effects of pesticide contaminaton are yet to come .
Pesticide use in the less industrialised parts of the world is particularly disturbing .
Seventy percent of the pesticides used in India are banned or severely restricted in the West .
Although regulation on permissible levels in food do exist , they are poorly enforced .
A recent survey of vegetables in a Delhi market revealed pesticide residues twenty times above legal limits , while a World Health Organization ( WHO ) survey in India found 50 % of samples contaminated .
In a survey in the estate of Punjab , DDT and BHC , both banned in the West , were found in all seventy - five samples of human milk .
– From the Ground Up , Rethinking Industrial Agriculture , p. 18-20 .
As some of you may have noticed ( ! ) , I often come down hard on large corporations that put profits before people .
The following passage is an exemplary example of why some are fully deserving of censure :
The United States produces between 100 and 150 million pounds of pesticides which are considered too dangerous for use within the country ’s borders .
These chemicals are exported for use in other nations with less stringent environmental safeguards .
– From the Ground Up , Rethinking Industrial Agriculture , p. 23 .
Where ’s the logic ?
A chemical is outright banned .
So what do we do with it ?
WE SELL IT !!
But , as they say , what goes around , comes around :
Yet these same banned and restricted agricultural chemicals find their way to the dinner table in homes all across the United States , in the form of residues on imported beef , cheese [ bio - magnification , remember ] and vegetables .
While inspectors at US borders check food imports for certain chemicals , they are only able to sample 1 - 2 % of all shipments , and test for less than 40 % of the pesticides on the market .
In many cases , pesticides which cannot be legally used in the US – but which are manufactured domestically and exported overseas – are among those for which inspectors do not test .
According to the US Department of Agriculture figures for 1990 , illegal residues on imported food were four times as common as residues on domestic foods .
It is not known how much of this contamination originated from pesticide factories operating within the US .
– From the Ground Up , Rethinking Industrial Agriculture , p. 23 .
A potentially ( even ) more troubling worry is our water supply .
Because chemicals move very slowly through the soil , even if , today , we were to make a complete shift back to organic systems of agriculture , our water tables , wells and aquifers would continue to be drip - fed ongoing deliveries of chemicals for years to come .
There is no way to speed up nature ’s water purification systems , so these chemicals may remain with us for decades after their use has ceased .
This has often been shown to be true when water tests discover wells contain chemicals that have been banned several years prior .
Do you realise that virtually none of the poisons we spray on our fields actually end up on their target – the ‘ pest ’ ?
But , they do end up everywhere else .
Pesticides are designed to kill .
They are released deliberately into the environment and onto food .
Only about 1 % of a pesticide actually reaches its target .
The rest is released into the environment , exposing innocent people and wildlife .
– WWF
But , as mentioned in our previous pesticide post , the use of chemicals is not slowing up – we ’re using more and more , and , they ’re getting stronger :
According to David Pimentel , entomologist at Cornell University , over the past 50 years pesticide use has increased 30 times ( and toxicity of pesticides more than a hundredfold ) …
And for what ?
… many pesticides are losing their effectiveness as the bugs and plants they are designed to eradicate develop resistance .
( Already 504 insect and mite species , 150 plant diseases , and 188 weed species have developed resistance . )
Farmers still lose about 20 per cent of their crops to weeds and insects , the same proportion as they lost in 1930 .
– WWF … twice as much of the harvest is lost to insects today .
Chemical warfare is not only destructive to the environment and bad for your health , it ’s a losing battle .
– Vegsource
The terminology there is more than fitting : “ Chemical warfare … it ’s a losing battle “ .
That ’s exactly what we ’re doing – fighting against nature .
The war mentality underlying military - industrial agriculture is evident from the names given to herbicides … .
Monsanto ’s herbicides are called “ Round up ” , “ Machete ” , “ Lasso ” .
American Home Products which has merged with Monsanto calls its herbicides ` Pentagon ’ , ` Prowl ’ , ` Scepter ’ , ` Squadron ’ , ` Cadre ’ , ` Lightening ’ , ` Assert ’ , ` Avenge ’ .
This is the language of war , not sustainability .
Sustainability is based on peace with the earth .
– Virdana Shiva
The same mindset embedded in present politics is found in our industrial systems – violence and heavy - handedness rather than observation and symbiosis .
We are as much a part of this great interconnected web of life as any other organism , so as we destroy and poison our environment , we are of course poisoning ourselves .
How long will we continue this warfare ?
I fear we ’ll persevere to our dying breath .
The corporate thirst to extract is undeniable , and determined , but you can be sure that in a battle with nature , we ’ll lose .
The last several decades has seen increasingly frantic attempts by agribusiness to plug the enormous holes in their ability to maintain order out on the field ( battleground ? ) .
These failing efforts are resulting in a dangerous and obstinate tinkering with the building blocks of life – desperate and futile attempts to get nature to work the way we want it to .
What ’s the way forward ?
A return to pesticide - free agriculture can only come through improved soil fertility .
Given that we ’ve been ‘ soil mining ’ for decades , taking without giving back , this will not be an overnight move in many places , and it can never happen while we ’re using the modern day large - scale Cargill / Monsanto monocrop farming model .
This corporate system needs to be recognised for what it is – a failed exercise promoted for the profit of a few , and not for the public good .
This short - sighted , arbitrary , destructive and reductionist approach has marched across our social , cultural and actual landscape , uprooting traditional sustainable and , might I add , more efficient family farms with every stride .
Why do we subsidise all the wrong things ?
To change course there is a critical epiphany that needs to take place in the minds of certain people that have the means and opportunity to make a difference .
The subsidies that favour corporate agribusiness and long - distance trade and force family farmers into cities to become factory workers and Wal - Mart - type employees must cease .
The current conviction that the health of a nation is determined by its bottom line , its fiscal state , and an unending growth in consumerism must give way to the realisation that the true measure of wealth in a society can only be based on the health , wealth and well - being of its individual members .
Through changes in agricultural policies we would begin a gradual dismantling that would promote and encourage smaller , bio - diverse family farms – making them once more an attractive and viable prospect .
Large - scale monocrop farming must become a dying breed , and give way to the rebuilding of localised farming communities .
“ Agripower , ” it will be noted , is not measured by the fertility or health of the soil , or the health , wisdom , thrift , or stewardship of the farming community .
It is measured by its ability to produce a marketable surplus , which “ generates agridollars . ”
It is to be measured by “ productivity , combined with processing and marketing efficiency . ”
The income from this increased production , we are told , is spent by farmers not for soil maintenance or improvement , water conservation , or erosion control , but for “ purchased inputs ” : “ household appliances , farm equipment , building supplies , and other capital and consumer goods . ”
I do not mean that we should necessarily begrudge the farmer these purchases ; I am only noticing that , to Mr. Bell [ a former Assistant Secretary of Agriculture ] the farmer does not prosper to become a better farmer , but to become a bigger spender .
The assistant secretary was applying to farming a standard of judgment that is economic , not agricultural .
Farming is defined here purely to suit the purposes of a businessman .
It is the nature of the soil to be highly complex and variable , to conform very inexactly to human conclusions and rules .
It is itself a pattern of alien patterns .
Out of the random grammar and lexion of possibilities – geological , topographical , climateological , biological – the soil of any one place makes its own peculiar and inevitable sense .
It makes an order , a pattern of forms , kinds , and processes , that includes any number of offsets and variables .
By its permeability and absorbency , for example , the healthy soil corrects the irregularities of rainfall ; by the diversity of its vegetation it protects against both disease and erosion .
Most farms , even most fields , are made up of different kinds of soil patterns or soil sense .
Good farmers have always known this and have used the land accordingly ; they have been careful students of the natural vegetation , soil depth and structure , slope and drainage .
They are not appliers of generalizations , theoretical or methodological or mechanical .
Nor are they the active agents of their own economic will , working their way upon an inert and passive mass .
They are responsive partners in an intimate and mutual relationship .
Because the soil is alive , various , intricate , and because its processes yield more readily to imitation than to analysis , more readily to care than to coercion , agriculture can never be an exact science .
There is an inescapable kinship between farming and art , for farming depends as much on character , devotion , imagination , and the sense of structure , as on knowledge .
It is a practical art .
– The Agricultural Crisis : A Crisis of Culture , Wendell Berry
For what has been , in history , a mere fleeting moment , we have managed , at great cost , to feed 95 % of the people through the labour of the remaining five .
The cost for both groups has been enormous , and unsustainable .
We ’re living in a dream , flogging a dead horse if you will , if we think we can perpetuate it .
But then , why would we want to ?

The family were looking after the hamster for a friend Eight firefighters have been called in to help find an escaped hamster in East Lothian .
Two crews used a chocolate - covered camera and a vacuum cleaner to try and locate missing Fudgie at six - year - old Zoe Appleby 's home in Dunbar .
Fire crews spent five hours trying to recover the pet after it scuttled down a hole in the kitchen floor .
But , the hamster , who was being looked after for a friend during the holidays , is still refusing to come out .
Zoe 's mother , Angela Appleby , a nursery nurse , told BBC Scotland how she had to reassure neighbours when two fire engines from Dunbar and Newcraighall pulled up outside their house on Monday afternoon .
My manager 's fiance is in the fire brigade and the conversation snowballed into the fire brigade coming round to the house
Angela Appleby
In the search for Fudgie , firefighters took the family cooker and gas pipes to pieces .
They also dropped a mini-camera coated with chocolate underneath the floorboards .
They then hoped to suck out the furry rodent using a vacuum cleaner with a sock over the nozzle .
Mrs Appleby said : " We came down for breakfast and discovered Fudgie had opened the top lid of her cage and she had made her way into the kitchen and we reckon she has gone through the smallest of holes in the kickboards where the units are .
" I had been on a week 's holiday and had gone back to work , my manager 's fiance is in the fire brigade and the conversation snowballed into the fire brigade coming round to the house .
" There was eight firemen and also a special care unit so they had a camera to locate where Fudgie was . "
Failed attempt Despite their efforts , they failed to recover Fudgie and called in the Scottish SPCA .
Mrs Appleby added : " Zoe has been really keen on having a pet but it has n't put her off , we would just do it a bit differently and we just hope Fudgie comes out . "
A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue said : " The call related to a hamster that was trapped behind a wall .
" They got a Fibroscope camera and put that down under the floorboards to see if they could find it .
" In the end we left it in the hands of the SSPCA . "

… investors are also unnerved by the aftermath of the five - day war in early August .
Russian shares have lost about a third of their value since hitting record highs in May .
Russian and Western bank analysts polled by Reuters have cut forecasts for Russia ’s gold and foreign exchange reserves .
As much as $ 25 billion in foreign capital may have left Russia since the Georgia conflict started , they said : while their growth forecasts were little changed at 7.5 percent , the crisis sharply cut the liquidity of the banking system .
Intel 's new integrated , dual - core nettop Atom 330 solution has launched ; the updated motherboard / CPU combo should be available from retail outlets in the immediate future .
Atom 330 ships with an improved version of Intel 's original Atom board ; the D945GCLF2 includes support for DDR - 2 667 ( up from DDR2 - 533 ) , adds six - channel HD audio , and features gigabit Ethernet instead of the 10/100TX solution that its predecessor offered .
Atom 330 and Atom 230 share the same feature set and clockspeed , but Atom 330 is a HyperThreading - enabled dual - core part .
The performance difference between the two processors could be significant —
Atom 230's performance in any given benchmark varies by up to 50 percent depending on whether or not HT is enabled .
Adding a full second core should improve performance by an even greater amount , though the exact benefit will always vary from scenario to scenario .
It 's safe to assume , however , that Atom 330 will generally outperform
Atom 230 while consuming only slightly more power ( as measured at the wall ) .
As we 've mentioned before , the Atom 330 + D945GCLF2 motherboard is strictly a desktop / nettop solution .
Intel will undoubtedly release a low - power dual - core Atom N370 ( assuming Intel keeps to its current naming conventions ) at some point , but it may not do so for some months yet — netbooks , it seems , will continue to use the single - core , low - power N270 up through Christmas .
As far as the netbook market is concerned , Intel 's N270 has no current peer , but both the Atom 230 and Atom 330 could face significant competition in the coming months .
Sales of systems in this space only comprise a small fraction of total Atom sales , but for the two companies in question ( AMD and VIA ) even a fraction of sales in a fraction of a given market can translate into meaningful revenue .
In order to effectively compete against Atom — even desktop Atom — both AMD and VIA must overcome challenges of their own .
VIA 's Nano outperforms Atom 230 ( we 've not compared it against Atom 330 ) , but we 've yet to see even one Nano - powered device , motherboard , or system .
VIA initially indicated that such systems would be on the market late in the third quarter ; if the company intends to keep that goal it has precious little time left in which to do it .
As for AMD , it reportedly intends to fight back against Atom with a series of ultra-low - power Athlon 64 processors .
The question , in this case , is n't whether AMD can manufacture and supply said processors , but to what degree OEMs and motherboard manufacturers will choose to back AMD 's nettop / desktop solution over Intel's .
As things stand today , the only company with a shipping , available solution in this market area is Intel , and Atom 330 should offer significantly improved performance over Atom 230 .
To date , Atom has exceeded all expectations ;
Intel always thought the chip would do well , but the company has repeatedly revised its estimates for total Atom shipments in 2008 upward as the netbook craze has shown no signs of slowing .
These new chips may not directly drive netbook sales , but they could prove strong ( and cheap ) enough to entice buyers who were put off by Atom 230's low performance .
Like passengers on the Titanic trying to get on the last lifeboat over the side , Republicans are beginning to ditch John McCain , with the Republican former governor of Michigan questioning the nasty tone of McCain 's campaign and saying he is " … not the McCain I endorsed .
" Former Governor William Milliken had previously endorsed McCain during the Republican primary season .
" He is not the McCain I endorsed , " said Milliken , in an interview with .
" He keeps saying , ' Who is Barack Obama ? '
I would ask the question , ' Who is John McCain ? ' because his campaign has become rather disappointing to me . "
" I 'm disappointed in the tenor and the personal attacks on the part of the McCain campaign , when he ought to be talking about the issues .
"
In addition , former GOP Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island , has said he is voting for Obama , is urging others to do the same and said of McCain " that 's not my kind of Republicanism . "
" I saw what Bush and Cheney did .
They came in with a ( budget ) surplus and a stable world , and look what 's happened now , " said Chafee , who was ousted in 2006 by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse .
" In eight short years they 've taken one peaceful and prosperous world , and they 've torn it into tatters .
" Added Chafee about Sarah Palin : " There 's no question she 's totally unqualified .
" Another Republican , former Kent County GOP Chairman Bob Eleveld , is not supporting McCain or Obama , and says that he is not alone among Republicans abandoning McCain .
" Suffice it to say there are a number of people who have been strong Republicans in the past , including party chairs , who feel as I do , " he said .
" I think the straight talk is gone .
I think he 's pandering to the Christian right .
That 's some straight talk from me .
" And Milliken , who at 86 has no problem with McCain 's age , can't help but be bothered by the thought of a President Palin .
" I know John McCain is 72 .
In my book , that 's quite young , " said Milliken , who then addressed the Palin choice .
" What if she were to become president of the United States ?
The idea , to me , is quite disturbing , if not appalling . "

The Boss says , " STOP MAKING MEDIOCRITY SOUND BAD ! "
Dilbert says , " Sorry . "
The banking crisis of 2008 evokes memories of the Savings and Loan crisis from the 1980s .
John McCain played a central role in both crises .
John McCain ’s good friend and campaign donor , Charles Keating , with a little too much help from John McCain , helped precipitate the earlier crisis .
This means Keating is now a central figure in the 2008 elections .
As we reported below , a top McCain aide told the Washington Post “ We ’ve got to question this guy ’s associations . ”
Since “ associations ” are an issue for Team McCain and the economic crisis is THE issue for the American people , lets combine them for John McCain and recall Charles Keating :
Way back in the late 1980 ’s there was a similar banking scandal involving billions of taxpayer dollars , that time in the savings and loan industry .
Eventually , scores of small thrift banks failed and the government ended up creating a special unit to buy up toxic debt and slowly over years salvage what they could and get rid of the rest .
The reason why it ’s topical now is n’t just because the federal government is using a similar rescue model to bail out Wall Street but also because of presidential nominee , John McCain ’s involvement both then and now .
Back then , the bank at the center , Lincoln Savings and Loan , was a subsidiary of American Continental Corporation and was owned by Charles H. Keating , Jr. , a prominent real estate developer who was eventually found guilty of 73 counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison .
He served only 50 months before the conviction was overturned on a technicality .
Wrapped up in the debacle were a series of unusual meetings two years before the collapse between banking regulators and five prominent US Senators , including John McCain .
The meeting was at the behest of Keating who was calling in chits to get the regulators to back off of the ill - fated Lincoln .
The regulators who were present would later say how much they were intimidated by the entire proceeding and Lincoln ended up with a little more time before eventually imploding .
The Senate Ethics Committee held hearings over 23 days in November of 1990 to investigate the meetings and the Keating Five , including McCain , as they came to be known .
There was a good slap on the wrist passed out to all concerned and the taxpayers ended up with the billion dollar savings and loan hangover .
Trading cards were briefly sold displaying Keating with each of the Senators .
During that time , it also came out that the Keating Five had accepted campaign contributions from Keating topping $ 300,000 with McCain receiving the lion ’s share .
McCain had also made at least nine trips with his family at Keating ’s expense at a cost of over $ 13,000 .
Not all of it was reimbursed by McCain until after Lincoln was in serious trouble .
And in 1985 , a year before the meeting between the regulators and US Senators , McCain ’s wife Cindy and his father in law invested over $ 350,000 in a shopping mall development with Keating .
None of it was in any way criminal , just a question of judgment .
Extraordinary satellite images show an ordinary day in Britain - as seen from space
This is Britain - but not as we know it .
These extraordinary satellite images reveal what our nation looks like from the skies .
From flight paths and road networks to telephone exchanges across London , the stunning aerial shots paint a striking new perspective on the British Isles .
Everything from London taxi journeys to internet activity across the nation are replicated in the breathtaking images .
Using the latest satellite technology and innovations in aerial photography , the pictures will be shown for the first time on ' Britain from Above ' , a new BBC series that starts this Sunday .
A satellite image over the UK showing aircraft flight paths activity
Presenter Andrew Marr takes to the skies by plane , helicopter , microlight and even parachute to give viewers a bird 's eye view of landmarks across the UK .
The programme uses satellite data and the latest computer generated imagery to demonstrate how Britain keeps moving - tracking the planes that enter our airspace , the ships that cross the English Channel and the cars that travel our streets , all in the space of a single day .
London Taxi activity - proving how difficult it is to get a taxi south of the river
Series director Cassian Harrison , said : ' It has been amazing to work with cameras mounted on so many helicopters and planes .
' The one disadvantage is that when we film we 're contending so much with the weather .
' It has been a battle with the elements , but a brilliant one , working out how many different ways it is possible to get up in the sky and look down at the nation .
' In a way , though , the biggest privilege is being able to look down on the world you know .
' It 's like Google Earth , but for real . '
' Britain From Above ' begins on BBC1 on Sunday at 9 pm .

Do n't change the default encoding
It will come back to bite you ...
What you to do is to declare the source encoding at the top of the file ( which will then cause Python to decode string literals in your source correctly ) .

Re : Do n't change the default encoding
You mean the
# -*- coding : utf-8 -*-
at the top of the file ?
This does n't work for me .
It still fails the ( " %s " % u'ü ' ) expression test , with the same " ' ascii ' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 43 : ordinal not in range ( 128 ) " error .
I think what 's happening is this : the left string " %s " is of basestring class , while the u'ü ' is unicode string class .
The coding line at the top of the file tells python that the left string is encoded in utf - 8 , but it still is of basestring class .
Then , when the % operator gets evaluated , it goes into the python source , where there is no coding statement .
There it tries to stick a unicode string into the basestring , and tries to re-encode the unicode string in ascii .

No it does n't .
That works just fine when you state the source encoding .
What does n't work is printing the result , and it does n't work because it thinks the terminal is ASCII .
I think what 's happening is this
Sorry , your guesswork is way off .
How about reading the documents you are ridiculing before resorting to speculation ?

No .
It 's a str , not a basestring .

This is simply fantasy .
Do you have any basis for suspecting this , or are you just making things up ?
The representation of strings in your source and the way those strings are treated during execution are two entirely different things .
Encoding declarations in the Python source are simply not necessary or relevant unless that source contains non-ASCII literals itself .
Such encodings wo n't make a blind bit of difference to your own strings in your own source .
No it does n't .

While ascii as a default encoding in python is asswards , setting source encoding as utf - 8 is the correct way to make your problems go away .
If the input data for some reason is in unicode string , not str , you need to convert it to utf - 8 before output .
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding : utf-8 -*-
unicode_str = u'pītōn ' # < type ' unicode '>
plain_str = ' pītōn ' # < type ' str ' >
print ( ' unicode : %s ' % unicode_str.encode( 'utf - 8 ' ) )
print ( ' plain : %s ' % plain_str )

Hmm , this is getting more interesting , because this example works , but
# -*- coding : utf-8 -*-
is not enough to make things work in my program .
Could it be that my problem is that the ultimate source of utf - 8 is n't a python source file , but the database ?
What I actually have is a Django model object , whose __unicode__ function is being called .
I am assuming that the coding needs to be in the file where I am doing the " %s " % ... operation .
Not only that , but
tmp = " object %s " % obj # this works
tmp = " object %s other %s " % ( obj , other ) # this produces a ascii encoding error
tmp = " object %s other %s " % ( " My object name is Schröder " , other ) # this again works
Very strange .
Seems like something buggy with Python , honestly .

A surprising number of the truly frustrating problems I 've encountered over the years have been caused either by character encoding issues or newline character issues .
From : lonely_squirrel
2008-09-11 02:25 pm ( UTC )
I 'm starting to understand that there are two separate things that are commonly confused :
byte streams
character streams .
Character streams require an encoding in order to be interpreted .
A character stream with no encoding is ambiguous at best .
The key facet of a character stream is the size of one character may not be fixed , and it the stream may have a particular byte order .
Byte streams have no encoding , because the key facet of a bytestream is that the size of one byte is fixed .
There is no big / little endian , and reading X bytes always gives the same result everywhere .
ASCII streams lie in the intersection of the two .
In fact , I think that ASCII is the ONLY format that is both an unambiguous character stream AND a bytestream ( excepting EBCDIC and historical encodings ) .
Though ASCII text is UTF - 8 text , an ASCII bytestream cannot be considered a UTF - 8 bytestream ; for instance , strncpy ( char * , char * , len ) is n't going to do what you think it will with utf - 8 text .
I think , though I 'm not sure , that this is where Bad Things will happen if you make python bytestrings utf8 encoded .
Simple things like len( str ) for a utf8 string depends on if you 're writing it to a socket , to a terminal , or to memory .
From : eichin

( here via reddit / programming , hi ) actually , len on a utf8 string is well defined - it 's just defined in terms of bytes , not characters .
It might help to realize that an encoded string does n't actually carry the encoding with it , so len could n't possibly know how to make characters out of it ...
Where you may be seeing ambiguity is the difference between a unicode string and a utf - 8 string .
There was a good talk on this entire issue at pycon2008 ; the " sane " way to think about it appears to be to
* work in unicode ( * not* utf - 8 , unicode ) everywhere
* the OS hands you bytes ; convert to characters ( unicode ) as soon as you can
* the OS wants bytes ; convert back from characters ( unicode ) as late as you can
( And of course , " if you find library bugs in this regard , report them " :-)
To help with this model , python 2.6/3 k introduce an explicit bytes type , which ( aside from other features ) helps the developer keep track .

( welcome reddit ! )
At this point I would guess that the length of ' ö ' is 2 , and the length of u'ö ' is 1 .
Because the first is considered to be a bytestream , and the second a character stream .
Indeed , the first can't know that the data is utf - 8 , not until I explicitly encode it to a unicode object and specify the encoding .
But see , if you change the default encoding to utf - 8 , then python kind of does know that ' ö ' is utf - 8 .
So I wonder if the length of the bytestream changes if you change the default encoding ?
I 'm trying to explore why changing the default encoding is a bad idea .
The difference between " unicode " as a python object and utf - 8 as a unicode encoding was precisely where my understanding was falling short .
I did notice that my problem seemed to go away by changing a string literal into a unicode literal .
It 's just , from a practical standpoint , I find this to be a bad solution .
It 's tedious , and yet if I miss a string somewhere , it will still work most the time but occasionally throw exceptions .
My server 's default encoding is utf - 8 , as well as my terminal , the database tables , and my source files .
Ideally , on this system if there is a bytesting which needs to be converted to a unicode string , python would use utf - 8 by default .
Frustrating that I can not safely change that .
Such a headache , I can see why just having a unicode instead is recommended !
Thanks for your comment .

Well , I did eventually figure out what was going on , with some help from the Django Users group .
The issue was that my objects ' __unicode__ functions were returning utf - 8 encoded data , but in the bytestring class .
Even though the data is the utf - 8 data I intended , python believes the data is in the default encoding -- ascii .
Hence , changing the default encoding fixed the problem .
The correct fix is to return a unicode - typed string from the __unicode__ method .
Indeed , the ( " %s " % " ü " ) example * does * work with the coding cookie .
What does n't work is when a method ( all methods I think , but perhaps just the __unicode__ method ) returns " ö " instead of u'ö ' .
A very important difference , not to the underlying data , but to the container the data is in .
My default encoding is back to normal .
Mojibake Averted !
Madeleine Albright , who became the first female U.S. Secretary of State and highest ranking woman in government in 1997 , is frightened by the possibility that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , Republican John McCain 's running mate , could assume the presidency .
Asked today in an interview with Plain Dealer editors and reporters if she is scared by the prospect of Palin being a heartbeat away , Albright , who has endorsed Democrat Barack Obama , responded without hesitating , " Yes. Yes . "
" Having served two presidents , I think the job of the president is the most difficult job in the world , " said Albright , who advised President Carter on national security and foreign policy and later President Clinton as secretary of state .
" What you need in a vice president -- and I 've felt this for a long time because I 've watched [ Vice President Walter ] Mondale and [ Vice President ] Al Gore -- is that you need a partner .
The job is huge and needs somebody not only for the heartbeat part but in the day - to - day governance .
" Gore went a step further of being almost like a prime minister ... taking away the underbrush of issues to do with how two countries relate to each other .
So you need somebody that actually knows what they are doing .
I see that with the Obama - Joe Biden relationship .
I certainly do n't see it in the McCain - Palin relationship . "
Palin 's inarticulate answers on foreign policy questions in recent interviews have become fodder for critics and comedians , especially Tina Fey , who received wide attention for her uncanny caricature of Palin on NBC's " Saturday Night Live . "
" I have to say I feel sorry for her for being made fun of on ' Saturday Night Live , ' " Albright said .
" We all who have been in public have had moments where somebody has caricatured us ... and kinda , you think , ' That 's not really me . ' "
Albright , who endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the primary , was in Cleveland to give a speech on foreign policy at Cleveland 's City Club .
UPDATE :
Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright told a packed Cleveland City Club audience Tuesday that America 's next president should draw a short list of goals for his first term in office .
Dealing with the current economic crisis and pulling troops out of Iraq should be on that list , Albright said .
Iraqi's , who are pushing for U.S. troops , need to defend themselves , Albright said .
" American muscle cannot substitute for Iraqi spine , " she said .
Albright , who was also campaigning for Obama today , said other countries are watching to see how we will deal with the credit and financial crises .
" We need foreign help , " she said .
" Restoring confidence in the economy will be the main goal . "
She described McCain , as someone whose dated foreign policy experience would not serve him well in the White House .
" He is really knowledgeable about yesterday , " Albright said .
" We need to an approach about today and tomorrow . "
McCain 's criticism of Obama for saying he would talk directly with foreign leaders was misplaced in this new century , she said .
She said five former secretaries of state met recently and all agreed that the U.S. should talk to Iran without preconditions .
" I happen to believe you should talk to people you do n't like , " Albright said .
She was asked what she thought of the " Bush Doctrine , " which calls for preemptive strikes to protect American .
Albright focused quickly on a key problem with that stance .
" The real problem with the whole issue of preemption is the Achilles ' Heel of intelligence , " she said .
A preemptive strike based on bad intelligence can cause major problems , she said .
In her only direct reference to McCain 's vice presidential running mate , Sarah Palin , Albright said she did n't blame Palin for being confused about the " doctrine . "
Albright said the U.S. needed to move away from preemption , with out surrendering the right to use it altogether .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
As many as 3,800 U.S. car dealerships could fail this fall and into 2009 -- nearly one in five -- because of weak sales , increased operational costs and the credit crunch , according to a forecast released on Wednesday .
“ An increasing number of dealers are simply closing their doors because sales have plummeted , credit has dried up , the overall retail environment is increasingly challenging and potential investors are sitting on the sidelines , ” said Paul Melville , a partner with Grant Thornton LLP , which issued the forecast .
“ In addition , the domestic automakers who badly need retail consolidation are not spending much of their scarce capital on the problem because the economy is doing it for them , ” he said .
Bill Heard Enterprises
Inc , one of the biggest General Motors Corp Chevrolet dealerships , filed for bankruptcy on Sunday , citing operating losses , decreased demand for vehicles and lack of credit .
At its peak , Alabama - based Heard ’s revenue was about $ 2.5 billion per year , according to the bankruptcy filing .
With U.S. light vehicle sales predicted to drop to the 13.7 - million - unit range in 2009 , the study said that about 3,800 dealerships , about 18 percent of the total number of U.S. car dealerships at the end of 2007 , will need to close .
U.S. vehicle sales are expected to be flat next year with any recovery in demand expected only in 2010 , as consumers struggle with tight credit , high gasoline prices and a housing market slump .
The drop in demand has been particularly hard for Detroit - based automakers GM , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC .
GM ’s sales were down 18.5 percent in the first eight months of 2008 while Ford ’s sales declined 16 percent and sales at Chrysler , controlled by Cerberus Capital Management , dropped 24 percent .
Thornton said apart from new car sales , other sources of revenue for dealers , such as used car sales and financing profits , are also falling .
Here 's a club no country wants to join , yet its ranks are swelling :
The 50 % - Off ( Or Worse ) Stock Market Club .
Today brought another huge wave of selling in equity markets worldwide , as investors , understandably , keep focusing on the long list of negatives -- including still - severe credit market woes , forced asset sales by hedge funds as their clients bail out , and the likelihood of a deep recession ahead that will slash corporate earnings .
The wealth destruction around the globe from falling stock prices now has reached massive proportions .
Remember all that talk about " de- coupling , " and how foreign economies and markets would hold up even if the U.S. took a tumble ?
Instead , even though America is the source of the credit debacle that is ravaging the global financial system , many foreign markets -- both developed and emerging -- are faring much worse than Wall Street .
I tallied up how much some major and minor markets have fallen from their recent highs , most of which were reached in the second half of 2007 .
Here ’s a sampling ( not meant to be all - inclusive ) :
Markets down more than 70 % : Vietnam ( - 70.5 % ) , Peru ( - 73.2 % ) , Ireland ( - 73.4 % ) , Russia ( - 73.9 % ) , Iceland ( - 88.7 % ) .
Markets down between 60 % and 70 % : Hong Kong ( - 60.1 % ) , Poland ( - 62.6 % ) , China ( - 69.8 % ) .
Markets down between 50 % and 60 % : South Korea ( - 54.5 % ) , Italy ( - 55.2 % ) , Egypt ( - 56.9 % ) , Brazil ( - 57.2 % ) , Japan ( - 58.1 % ) , Singapore ( - 58.2 % ) , Turkey ( - 58.5 % ) , India ( - 58.3 % ) .
Markets down between 40 % and 50 % : Great Britain ( - 42.3 % ) , Australia ( - 43.3 % ) , U.S. - S&P 500 ( - 44.0 % ) , Spain ( - 46.4 % ) , Germany ( - 47.0 % ) , Mexico ( - 48.3 % ) .
Note that , for U.S. investors who own foreign stocks , the losses in many cases are worse because the dollar has rallied against most foreign currencies in recent months .
A strong dollar means stocks denominated in foreign currencies have even less value when translated into dollars .
For example , the average European blue chip stock is down 45.6 % year - to - date in euros , but down 53 % in dollars .
The euro today plunged to a two - year low of $ 1.262 from $ 1.285 on Thursday .
Given the huge rush by Americans into foreign equities during the boom years of 2003 - 07 , investors who never took any of their paper profits now are seeing them wither .

According to a pointless piece of eye - rolling anti-EU extrapolation that appeared in a number of newspapers , a smattering of MEPs are calling for the introduction of strict new advertising guidelines that could eventually lead to Eva Herzigova 's breasts being taken out and shot .
At least that 's the gist of it .
As far as I can ascertain , the story largely represented a brilliant excuse to print the supermodel 's infamous Wonderbra ad for the 80 millionth time , on this occasion under the headline " Goodbye Boys " .
Even though the Hello Boys campaign ran 14 years ago , editors just can't let it lie .
Rather than fading into obscurity it has , if anything , grown to represent some kind of sexual Year Zero which still haunts their collective mind 's eye to this day .
Just as Philip E Marlow from Dennis Potter 's Singing Detective was obsessed by visual memories of his mum enjoying a bit of off - piste afternoon dick in a forest , so the image of a semi- naked Eva gawping with awestruck joy at her own overflowing cups is forever frozen in their consciousnesses , and they 're doomed to reproduce it again and again in a bid to help themselves and their readers come to terms with its sheer psychological impact .
It was n't just an advert .
It was the 9/11 of tits .
And now some killjoy EU busybodies want to travel back in time and ban it !
Or something like that !
Boo ! Typical !
Let 's bomb Brussels !
Or maybe just France !
Etc !
But wait , it does n't end there .
As the Daily Mail goes on to explain , " This being the EU , it is not simply raunchy advertising that is in danger ...
It wants anything which promotes women as sex objects or reinforces gender stereotypes to be banned ...
Any campaigns which are deemed sexist might have to go ... [ such as ] the bare - chested builder with a can of Diet Coke in 1996 ...
Even famous adverts such as those featuring the Oxo family , with Lynda Bellingham as the housewife , might be deemed sexist . "
Inevitably , the minuscule conker of reality at the heart of this shitcloud is markedly less interesting than all this talk of a wild banning outbreak might suggest .
Once you remove all the " mights " and " coulds " and other weasel words from the article , you 're left with nothing but a report from the EU women 's rights committee ( doubtless a barrel of laughs at parties ) , which merely suggests governments should use their existing equality , sexism and discrimination laws to regulate advertising .
Nonetheless , " The EU vote on the report is not legally binding but it could be used by governments to justify the biggest shake - up in the industry for years . "
Or it could not .
Who knows ?
Uh-oh , we 've accidentally printed that photo of Eva again .
Argh !
Only one thing for it : we 're all going to have masturbate our way back to sanity together .
Right , readers ?
Three ... two ... one ... go !
It 's safe to predict this " shake - up " will have as much impact as all the other quasi-fictional EU bans and regulations the press enjoys harping on about in pieces headlined " OXYGEN TO BE OUTLAWED " or " NOW EU BUSYBODIES SAY MILK MUST BE SERVED IN CLOGS " , and so on .
Partly because all such stories ultimately turn out to be knitted from wisps of translucent flimflam , but mainly because the only way to ban advertising that " reinforces gender stereotypes " is to ban all advertising whatsoever .
What 's the alternative ?
Only allow commercials that actively challenge gender stereotypes ?
I can scarcely picture what kind of patronising hell we'd be creating for ourselves there .
And what if it worked ?
What if all our ads were suddenly filled with ladylike men eating chocolates and butch ladettes swigging beer , and these images proved so influential that everyone started behaving that way in real life , until these brave new anti-stereotypes had become stale old actual stereotypes , so we had to start all over again by subverting our old subversions ?
And so on and so on .
Do n't know about you , but I 'd shoot myself some point around 2011 .
Probably while wearing a dress .
And besides , anyone with more than four atoms of cranial glop in their skull already knows that adverts do n't provide a realistic field guide to the genders .
In adverts , women are carefree sex kittens .
In reality , they 're just annoying .
Especially the ones who whine on and on about gender stereotypes through the strange flapping hole they use for expressing simple - minded notions which is apparently located somewhere above their chests .
( The Guardian has asked me to point out that this is a joke .
Which indeed it is .
Although , cleverly , it 's also an optical illusion , because to uptight enemies of fun , it does n't look like a joke at all , but a heinous slur .
Still , at least complaining about it will give them something to do before they all die early of joylessness , leaving the rest of us to swap off - colour gags at their spartan little gravesides . )
When it comes to being objectified in ads , men lag way behind women , although they 're gradually inching closer thanks to the aforementioned Diet Coke hunk and the Aero Bubbles guy and so on .
Mainly , though , they 're portrayed as gurgling dimwits whose sole reward in life is to be occasionally granted the opportunity to stare at a football through a pint of piss - coloured beer .
In other words , both genders are routinely insulted in adverts , but that 's because adverts are inherently insulting to anything more sentient than a footstool .
Of course they 're demeaning , dum -dum .
They 're adverts .
That 's what they do .
And attempting to regulate them further would be as big a waste of adult time and resources as telling a four - year - old not to make giggly jokes about poo .
Just as well that is n't going to happen , then .
Cue Eva Herzigova photograph .

Anyone who has read a good economics book would be quickly reduced to laughter and tears by George Bush 's ridiculous economic address to the nation .
He put on his 9 - 11 suit and tried to warn Americans about the impending disaster : that their access to an infinite stream of paper money might be imperiled if they do n't cough up hundreds of billions immediately .
It is very tempting to go line by line and shout back .
I 'm a strong believer in free enterprise , so my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention .
I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of business . "
And this is why he nationalized airport security , created huge new bureaucracies , spent more than any president in American history , centralized control of education , put up more protectionist barriers than Clinton and Bush Sr. combined , bailed out airlines , presided over the Sarbanes - Oxley reign of terror , unleashed antitrust regulators , intensified health - care controls , and pretty much used every headline as an excuse to demand more money and power ?
The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years , and no one has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit , and this will not change .
But the penny itself has lost 94 % of its value in those 75 years precisely because of institutions such as the FDIC and the Fed .
Does he really think we are that foolish ?
Here is my favorite :
The problems we 're witnessing today developed over a long period of time .
For more than a decade , a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad because our country is an attractive and secure place to do business .
So those nasty foreigners did it to us , huh ?
Maybe it was Bin Laden who sneakily tried to create a credit bubble by investing in US stocks !
And here is his description of the grave calamity we face :
As uncertainty has grown , many banks have restricted lending , credit markets have frozen , and families and businesses have found it harder to borrow money .
Imagine that !
We might have to live within our means for a bit .
That would actually be a wonderful thing .
Maybe a recession would last a year or 18 months , and then we would be back on solid footing again .
He very nearly admits that too much credit is what created this mess .
So he proposes more credit so that we can continue to live on too much credit .
And then what happens next time ?
Ever more credit ?
This path ends in Weimar - level inflation and total destruction .
What is striking here is the level of public opposition .
Polls show it somewhere between 55 and 90 percent , depending on the way the question is worded .
Also , it is wide and deep opposition .
It is made up of Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives , blacks , whites , rich , poor , men , women — just about everyone , with no systematic bias among the polled groups .
In other words , we have here a wonderful thing : a clash of group interests , as Mises would say .
It is the state and its friends vs. the American people .
That does n't mean that Congress wo n't pass something or other .
The administration is prepared to pay off every member .
And yet the proximity to the election complicates matters .
A lost election means no payoff , no matter what .
If public anger is intense enough , these guys might balk in the end .
This would be a glorious result .
The " credit crisis , " as Bush describes it , is nothing more than the kind of crisis a college kid faces when his parents cut back on the deposits to his checking account .
It means less high living , a few more nights moping in the dorm rather than going out with his drinking buddies .
It does not mean the end of the world .
The market is working now to make things right , to eliminate bad debt and get us back on a sound economic footing .
The government can help by legalizing alternative monies , cutting regulations , cutting spending and taxing and wars ( as Ron Paul says ) , but otherwise by doing absolutely nothing .
Lehman failed on its own and yet life goes on .
The same should happen to Goldman , Morgan , Bear , GM , and all the rest .
Free enterprise is a profit and loss system .
This is a time of losses , stemming from an overinflated credit sector — one that the Austrian economists have warned about for many years .
Listen to the Austrians now and permit the failures to occur .
By the way , since when has it been an article of our national religion that the economy must never , ever , under any circumstances , be permitted to fall into recession , even slightly ?
This is completely insane .
The books you need to get to your congressman and staff now are America 's Great Depression and The Mystery of Banking .
The first explains that it was credit expansion and the attempt to keep prices high that prolonged the Depression , which would otherwise have ended by 1931 or 1932 .
On this point Bernanke is all wet .
The second book explains how money and banking work in a free market , as opposed to a subsidized , fiat - money , centralized system .
These are the two most essential books of our time , because they completely overthrow the prevailing theory behind the bailout .
Our choice is this .
We can buckle down for a year - long recession and then get on the path to financial and economic soundness .
Or we can set off a calamity that will last a decade or more , and perhaps even wreck civilization as we know it .
That 's our choice .
Leaders vow to maintain targets amid economic and political pressure from some member states to do otherwise .
On Thursday , European heads of state meeting in Brussels decided to stick to previously set climate action targets despite pressure from several member states to loosen the December target , which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
Last week , a Polish - led group of eight poorer EU member states threatened to block any resolution that kept the existing targets in place , siting the current economic downturn and market turmoil as the primary obstacle .

The group , which also includes Bulgaria , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania and Slovakia , picked up support from Italy .
“ We do n’t think this is the moment to push forward on our own like Don Quixote , ” said Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
“ We have time . ”
Under voting rules for EU governments , the alliance of eight eastern European countries would fall short of the votes needed to block the package without Italy ’s support .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he did n’t expect Italy to try to block the legislation , calling Berlusconi a pragmatist who is open to compromise .
“ The objectives remain unchanged , the calendar remains the same , ” Sarkozy said at a news conference at the end of the two - day summit .
“ The deadline on climate change is so important that we cannot use the financial and economic crisis as a pretext for dropping it , ” he said .
As part of the plan to tighten annual quotas on power plants and factories currently in the EU emissions - trading system by 11 percent on average , the draft legislation would also allocate fewer allowances that make up those quotas for free .
So far , fifteen EU countries are on track to meet Kyoto Protocol goals of 8 % carbon emission reduction by 2012 .
Additional CO2 reductions will be achieved because of the action EU energy ministers took last week of banning the incandescent light bulb , a decision that will go into effect for 500 million people across Europe beginning next year .

Have you ever been told that you drive like a grandma ?
If so , good for you !
If not , after reading this , you might want to change your ways .
At first glance this should seem like an insult , however , I fully believe it should be taken as a compliment .
What “ you drive like a grandma ” really means is that you ’re a cautious driver that gets the most out of your vehicle ’s gas mileage .
However , for those of you who drive like speed demons , here are the top five reasons why your grandma gets better gas mileage than you :
She goes from 0 to 60 in 12 seconds .
While it ’s certainly annoying to gets stuck behind a little old lady that takes a while to get up to the speed limit , it ’s probably a heck of a lot better for your gas mileage than the way you usually drive .
Using moderate acceleration , as opposed to simply flooring it or accelerating so slowly that you bog down the engine , is a great way to maintain peak gas mileage .
She obeys the speed limit .
According to FuelEconomy.gov , for every 5 mph you drive over 60 mph , you ’re essentially reducing your car ’s gas mileage by 8 % .
While in most instances you ’re probably not going to drive right at the speed limit , the slower you drive the better your gas mileage tends to be .
She never leaves the right hand lane .
According to Edmunds.com , weaving in and out of traffic does not significantly reduce your travel time , so not only does this mean that she ’s not driving at Mach 4 zig - zagging through traffic ( and subsequently saving gas ) , it also means that her drive is probably a lot less stressful .
She keeps the inside of her car immaculately clean .
She does n’t carry around golf clubs in the trunk of her car , there are n’t three or four CD books lying around , any of that extra stuff that needlessly adds weight to her car .
She does n’t drive a truck or an SUV .
As I ’m sure you ’re well aware , SUVs and trucks , due to being less aerodynamic and heavier than “ regular ” cars tend to get relatively bad gas mileage .
Because your grandma never felt the need to be cool and get a Hummer H2 , she ’s probably getting much better gas mileage than those of us who went ahead and purchased a gas guzzling vehicle .
I guess the phrase “ you drive like a grandma ” is n’t so bad after all , especially when it means you ’re improving your car ’s gas mileage between 5 % and 15 % .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Inflation hit a 16 - year high of 5.2 percent in September , but that is likely to be the peak and interest rates are still expected to come down sharply over the next few months in order to prevent a deep recession .
The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday rocketing utility bills pushed inflation higher by half a percentage point in September to way more than double the central bank ’s 2 percent target .
Analysts had predicted a rise to 5 percent .
Bank of England policymakers had already factored in the latest jump when they cut interest rates by half a percentage point last week in an emergency move last week to shore up the economy in the face of a global financial crisis .
They are worried the economic outlook has got a lot worse over the last month and two separate surveys on Tuesday showed house prices falling faster in September and retail sales posting an annual fall for a fourth straight month .
Analysts expect interest rates to come down from their current 4.5 percent very , especially as lower oil prices should mean inflation will fall sharply .
“ September ’s figure will be the peak in inflation and the key issue now is just how far it will drop back as the food and energy effects which have pushed it up so sharply finally fade or go into reverse , ” said Jonathan Loynes , chief European economist at Capital Economics .
“ Needless to say , steep falls in inflation will help to restore households ’ spending power and allow the Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates very sharply .
We continue to expect rates to drop to 2.5 percent or less . ”
ECONOMIC GLOOM
The British economy already ground to a halt in the second quarter even before the cataclysmic events in financial markets of the last month sent consumer confidence plummeting and sparked widespread talk of recession around the world .
Like - for - like retail sales fell 1.5 percent on the year in September , according to the British Retail Consortium , as furniture store sales recorded their worst performance in eight years .
And homewares are unlikely to do any better anytime soon as another survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed the decline in house prices accelerating and sales at a record low as the credit crunch has hit the market hard .
The ONS said the chief driver of the spike in inflation came from gas and electricity bills .
Electricity prices were 30.3 percent higher on the year and gas prices were 49.9 percent higher .
However , food inflation , another key source of price pressure this year , eased to 12.7 percent from 14.5 percent as the cost of dairy products fell .
But meat prices , especially bacon , continued to rise and were 19.1 percent higher in September than a year ago .
The chief driver of inflation .
Economists calculate that falling petrol prices could easily lop off a full percentage point off the inflation rate in the coming months .
MPC member David Blanchflower , who has been calling for interest rate cuts for months , has even warned that inflation could even fall below 1 percent .
For now , however , the RPI measure of inflation , often used in wage bargaining , rose to 5 percent , up from 4.8 percent in August .
While this could still put upward pressure on wage demands , rising unemployment is expected to keep a lid on pay .
The Rossi index , on which many benefits payment rises are based , is also calculated in September and showed a rise of 6.3 percent on the year .

In Warsaw , Missouri , there 's a ghost who keeps talking to me through the mouths of strangers .
He is the ghost of slavery past , and he casts a long shadow , even across the streets of this cheerful little lakeside town on a sunny autumn day .
A local Obama campaign volunteer tells me about a woman she had canvassed who said she personally would vote for Barack but that her daughter would n't - and then the mother lowered her voice - " because he 's black " .
Nor would her son : " he 's even more racist " .
How horrible to feel impelled to say that of your own children .
The jokey - scary commercial paraphernalia of Halloween is all around , but here are America 's real ghosts and witches .
Missouri matters .
It is a national weathervane .
Located bang in the middle of the American heartland , where east meets west and north meets south , over the past hundred years it has chosen the winner in every presidential race except one .
In the opinion polls , it 's among the few states that are still too close to call .
That 's why Obama was here speaking to massive rallies a fortnight ago , and why both he and Joe Biden are back here again this Thursday .
That 's why the Obama organisation in Missouri plans to use its 25,000 volunteers to knock on some 1.3 m doors during the last four days of the campaign .
Most of those key swing voters are in the sprawling , laundered suburbs of St Louis and Kansas City , but every vote from these rural areas , whose native sons include one of the greatest Democratic presidents , Harry Truman , will count too .
And I'm in the heart of the rural heartland : beautiful , gently rolling country , with dawn mist rising from cattle ponds , trees turning every impressionist 's shade of autumn russet , yellow and red , cows picturesquely munching lush grass , and roadside signs proclaiming Dirt For Sale , and Jesus Is Lord .
On the corner of Van Buren and Kosciusko street ( Tadeusz Kosciuszko , that is , the Polish freedom fighter who inspired the town 's name ) , I notice a neat , white - painted house with a sign in the window saying " This House Protected by God " .
Out front , a guard dog barks .
( A dog called God ? )
And there 's another sign on the lawn : For Sale .
The Lord may provide , but people have housing and money worries here as everywhere .
And they do n't just hunt for the sport .
A good shot can put a nourishing turkey or quail on the table for dinner .
So the Republicans claim Obama wants to take away your gun .
A McCain advertisement on the local country music radio station declares , in a deep countryman 's voice , " We love our God and we love our guns " - and you can almost hear a second capital G . And , it goes on , " liberals " want to take them away , being " out of touch with our America " .
I had expected race to be an issue here , but I 'm struck by how close to the surface the old wounds and prejudices are .
I do n't even have to ask ; it just keeps coming up .
At the local headquarters of the McCain campaign , four warmly hospitable local ladies tell me about their enthusiasm for Sarah Palin .
When the talk turns to the inevitable subject , one of them says people are afraid of being thought racist if they come out against Obama .
Another recalls how in her childhood , not so far from here , the Ku Klux Klan was still active , and there were roads a black man could not safely walk .
They add that 19th - century Warsaw was a slave town , but Cole Camp , founded by German Lutherans just a few miles to the north in the same county , was not .
So Missourians fought about it during the civil war , in the course of which Warsaw was several times burned and razed to the ground .
Up the road in Sedalia a former army officer , for many years a staunch Republican , tells me he will vote for Obama .
He 's disgusted at the way the Bush administration lied to them about Iraq .
But it would be easier if Obama were white .
In fact , he would find it difficult to vote for him if he were really African - American " That 's black slave American " , he helpfully explains to this foreigner .
Those people are so " mad " inside , he says , using the word in the colloquial American sense .
Fortunately , Obama 's not really an African - American , just an American with an African father .
But still , he feels " queasy " about that .
Now do n't get me wrong .
I 'm emphatically not here as a condescending urban liberal , a cultural tourist from the Guardian , hellbent on sneering at these sad , backwoods rednecks , and maligning them as racists .
Far from it .
These were decent , honest , warm - hearted people I met , and they were acknowledging and frankly wrestling with the problem of residual racism , not propagating it .
Nor am I leaping to any conclusion so simplistic as " race will decide this presidential race " .
Mine was a wholly unscientific sample of about 1 % of the population ( which is 2,070 , according to the road sign ) of one small town in the conservative rural area of one swing state .
Two impressions , however , I do want to share with you .
First , for all the consensus of perhaps the most sophisticated pollsters and pundits in the world that Obama is firming up a solid lead in the electoral college , it seems to me that there are unknowns unique to this election , known unknowns and unknown unknowns , which could still swing it either way .
If there are too many secret doubts in too many hearts about the otherness of Obama , McCain could just scrape in .
If the superbly organised Obama ground campaign gets out voters whom the pollsters may never have reached - young , poor , ethnic minority , even homeless ( a judge in Ohio has just allowed homeless voters to register a park bench as their address ) - it could be an amazing landslide .
I know only enough to doubt the wisdom of any who say they know .
You did not read it here first .
Next week we will all be wise after the event .
The other thing about this election is that , because of the extraordinary Obama and his extraordinary neighbour - to - neighbour campaign , it has become a vast national conversation , not only about the US 's future but also about its difficult past .
The map of Missouri is weirdly strewn with old European names : Warsaw , Dresden , Windsor , Odessa , Versailles ( correct pronunciation : Ver-sails ) .
Old European cities with a lot of history , including much bloodshed and ethnic conflict .
But I doubt that in any of them today , perhaps not even in Warsaw , Poland , the wounds of old wrongs still go as deep or throb as hard as they do in their quiet Missourian homonyms , where nice middle - aged Republican ladies can tell you at once who did what to whom nearly 150 years ago .
The Obama campaign may prefer to concentrate on the future , but this difficult conversation about America 's past is itself also about its future .
It 's painful and may even be a little risky , but it brings the possibility of healing , especially if enough Americans overcome their secret doubts , their " queasiness " , and follow Obama 's intriguingly worded appeal to " come together as one nation , one people , and once more choose our better history " .

Despite setting extremely low expectations , Republicans showed relief that Sarah Palin did n’t blow the vice presidential debate .
The difference between the two candidates was glaring .
Senator Biden has participated in many momentous decisions since entering Congress in 1972 .
Being mayor of a town of 6300 at the remote edge of the U.S. and the governor of Alaska for 20 months pales in comparison .
“ My experience as mayor will be of great use to the country , ” Sarah said , before she gushed excitedly over meeting Biden at the end of the debate .
Agree or disagree with his positions , Biden was elegant in his arguments .
Sarah was a Lulu .
Hearing the debate on the radio missed Sarah ’s winks and frozen smiles , but focused on what was said .
Sarah sounded like a bright , if immature , 19 - year - old on the college debate team .
She avoided questions , changed or evaded the subject , delivered well - rehearsed statements , and went off on totally unrelated subjects .
She avoided details and gave vast platitudes about “ victory , ” “ mavericks , ” “ greed , ” “ U.S. exceptionalism , ” and “ energy independence . ”
With John McCain refusing to release his medical records that include malignant melanoma , Sarah Palin could be a malignant mole away from the White House .
Americans must ask themselves , “ Should this woman become president ? ”
Even the staunchly conservative William Buckley publication , National Review , urged her to resign as a candidate because “ Palin is a problem . ”
She wooed voters with folksy language and mentioned the “ Talibani . ”
Is this a nickname for a terrorist organization in insular Alaska ?
I liked her pledge for total “ victory , ” especially , “ McCain knows how to win a war ! ”
Wow , did he learn in Vietnam ?
A more thoughtful and experienced person would look at the cost of victory and ask whether the sacrifice was worth it .
Unfortunately , there ’s no way to achieve victory in Iraq or Afghanistan .
They want to rule themselves and bombing them wo n’t change that .
Sarah upheld McCain ’s position of refusing to talk to leaders of countries that we have conflicts with .
Most of us resolve conflicts by understanding differences and reaching an agreement .
Can we agree on a settlement ?
McCain ’s policy of never talking to someone you disagree with is like getting divorced , “ and never speaking to the ‘ SOB ’ again . ”
Not productive if your well being depends upon ending the conflict .
Sarah ’s pandering to the Jewish vote – she ’s against “ a second holocaust ” – were melodramatic , especially after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert resigned days after he admitted taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from an American political supporter .
Olmert said Israel should withdraw from “ almost all ” of the land it seized in a 1967 war if it wants peace with Syria and the Palestinians .
Sarah did n’t even mention peace .
Sarah ’s insistence on escaping the past and only looking to the future ignores the possibility of learning from our mistakes .
It also overlooks criminal malfeasance in Bush ’s deregulation machinery .
Claiming she ’s different from Bush and harping on ignoring the past and forging blindly ahead , does n’t speak well for determining what went wrong and fixing it .
Nor bring justice to those wronged .
Biden ’s insistence that McCain does n’t disagree with any significant polices of the Bush Administration stumped Sarah .
She changed the subject ; she could n’t think of any differences .
You had to love her “ dog - gone - it ” moment , evidently a folksy Christian curse in her Wasilla Assembly of God Church .
Lucky for her , the moderator did n’t ask her to describe her belief in “ The Rapture , ” which she promotes in the Third Wave / New Apostolic Reformation movement .
Her pleas to increase the power of the vice president echoes Dick Cheney ’s creation of secret domestic and foreign military operations , torture , spying on Americans and lying to Congress .
Biden , who has long called for firing Cheney , pointed out the evil of Cheney ’s tenure .
Sarah , on the other hand , would give Cheney even more power .
Does she foresee more power for herself under an aging McCain ?
Biden devastated McCain ’s claim to “ maverick , ” by pointing out “ McCain has been no maverick on what matters to people ’s lives , ” including voting for Bush ’s debt - burdened budgets , as well as supporting his war in Iraq and voting against healthcare , education , and programs for the poor .
Carefully protected from press interviews , Palin sports a pregnant teenage daughter while advocating parental responsibility , no birth control , no abortion and abstinence .
She has a mentally retarded baby yet her husband takes off to race snowmobiles while she hits the campaign trail .
She ’s against “ earmarks , ” but leads all states in the U.S. for earmark dollars per citizen .
She “ knows foreign policy ” because some people in her state can see Russia on the horizon .
She had n’t left the U.S. until last year , visited New York once , and was recently introduced to Henry Kissinger .
She ’s ready to become president ?
Americans are notorious for being anti-intellectual , opposing reasoned arguments and relying on faith and intuition .
They loved Bush because they would rather have a beer with him than his opponent .
They need to reconsider .
If Americans elect Sarah to be next in line to become president , we are in serious trouble .
Her nomination already makes us the laughing stock of the world .
There has been plenty of debate lately about how Firefox handles self - signed SSL Certificates .
Instead of just whining about it , some researchers at Carnegie Mellon have released a white - paper titled " Perspectives : Improving SSH - style Host Authentication with Multi- Path Probing " .
As part of this research they have released a Firefox extension that changes how Firefox handles SSL Certificates .
This is what they have to say about it on their website :
We have developed an extension to the popular Firefox browser that contacts network notaries whenever your browser connects an HTTPS website .
For an overview of how Perspectives works , see our main page .
The extension provides two primary benefits :
If you connect to a website with an untrusted ( e.g. , self - signed certificate ) * , Firefox will give you a very nasty security error and force you to manually install an exception .
Perspectives can detect whether a self - signed certificate is valid , and automatically overrides the annoying security error page if it is safe to do so .
It is possible that an attacker may trick one of the many Certificate Authorities trusted by Firefox into incorrectly issuing a certificate for a trusted website .
Perspectives can also detect this attack and will warn you if things look suspicious .
*
The same is true for HTTPS sites with certificates that contain mismatched domain names ( e.g. , www.gmail.com uses a certificate for mail.google.com ) or certificates that are expired .
They also explain their method of authenticating called " Trust on First Use " :
“ The popularity of “ Trust - on - first- use ” ( TOFU ) authentication , used by SSH and HTTPS with self - signed certificates , demonstrates significant demand for host authentication that is low - cost and simple to deploy .
While TOFU - based applications are a clear improvement over completely insecure protocols , they can leave users vulnerable to even simple network attacks .
Our system , Perspectives , thwarts many of these attacks by using a collection of “ notary ” hosts that observes a server ’s public key via multiple network vantage points ( detecting localized attacks ) and keeps a record of the server ’s key over time ( recognizing short - lived attacks ) .
Clients can download these records on - demand and compare them against an unauthenticated key , detecting many common attacks .
Perspectives explores a promising part of the host authentication design space : Trust - on - first - use applications gain significant attack robustness without sacrificing their ease - of - use .
We also analyze the security provided by Perspectives and describe our experience building and deploying a publicly available implementation . ”
I think Michael Kassneron TechRepulic explains how it works the clearest :
How Perspectives works Perspectives consists of three distinct components : the notary authority , notary servers , and notary clients .
In order to understand the process , let ’s take a look at each individual component :
The notary authority is the overall controller that determines which notary servers are authorized to service notary clients .
The notary authority creates a daily listing of authorized notary servers and their public keys .
This listing is signed using the notary authority ’s private key and pushed out to all of the notary servers that it ’s responsible for .
The notary server consists of two components – a probing module and a database storage module :
The probing module constantly monitors the Internet ; looking for services that use certificates .
If one is found the probing module pretends to be a client wanting to set up a secure link .
The probing module takes the connection setup only to the point of where it receives the service ’s public key .
At that point , the probing module drops the connection , since it has the information it needs .
constantly monitors the Internet ; looking for services that use certificates .
If one is found the probing module pretends to be a client wanting to set up a secure link .
The probing module takes the connection setup only to the point of where it receives the service ’s public key .
At that point , the probing module drops the connection , since it has the information it needs .
The database storage module is a repository containing signed ( notary server ’s private key ) entries for each service that the probing module is monitoring .
Each entry consists of certificate information , the type of protocol used , and ways to contact the service .
After time , the entry builds a history of observed parameters .
The notary client is a Web browser add - on that contacts the notary server for one of two reasons .
The certificate for the contacted Web site is n’t in the Web browser ’s database or it does n’t match an existing certificate .
The following diagram ( courtesy of the Carnegie Mellon researchers ) depicts the interaction between the notary client and the notary server as well as the interaction between the probing module and network services such as Web sites that use SSL .
Though this method has some advantages over the current method , it suffers from some of the same problems and also has several drawbacks .
The authors admitted weakness about one issue :
So in sum , the issue of legitimate key change is a tough one for perspectives .
I think we can handle it pretty well , but in the end if you 're the kind of site that needs extremely high uptimes , you 're likely better off using a root - signed cert .
I see the main value of perspectives as allowing any site to use HTTPS with out the server owner paying the cost ( in dollars and management complexity ) of participating in a PKI .
I still think that major websites will ( and should ) continue using root - signed certs , with perspectives then acting as a second layer of security to prevent
attacks .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
In a groundbreaking meeting , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia recently hosted talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban militant group , according to a source familiar with the talks .
King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia hosted meetings between the Afghan government and the Taliban , a source says .
The historic four - day meeting took place during the last week of September in the Saudi city of Mecca , according to the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations .
King Abdullah broke fast during the Eid al - Fitr holiday with the 17 - member Afghan delegation -- an act intended to show his commitment to ending the conflict .
Eid al - Fitr marks the end of Ramadan , the Muslim holy month of fasting .

Taliban leader Mullah Omar was not present , the source said .
It marks a significant departure by the Saudi leadership to take a direct role in Afghanistan , hosting some delegates who have until recently been their enemies .
In the past , Saudi Arabia has generally dealt with Afghanistan through Pakistan .

The desert kingdom's current foray marks a significant shift and appears to recognize the political weakness of Pakistan and the need to stem the growth of al Qaeda .
Watch CNN 's Nic Robertson report on the meeting »
The current round of talks is anticipated to be a first step in a long process .
According to the source close to the talks , it has taken two years of behind - the - scenes meetings to get to this point .
The talks took place between September 24 and 27 and involved 11 Taliban delegates , two Afghan government officials , a representative of former mujahadeen commander and U.S. foe Gulbadin Hekmatyar , and three others .
It was the first such meeting aimed at bringing a negotiated settlement to the Afghan conflict and for the first time , all parties were able to discuss their positions and objectives openly and transparently , the source said .
Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban leadership during its rule over Afghanistan in the 1990s , but that relationship was severed over Mullah Omar 's refusal to hand over al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
While Mullah Omar was not present at the talks in Mecca , the source said the Taliban leader has made it clear he is no longer allied with al Qaeda -- a position that has never been publicly stated but emerged at the talks .
It confirms what another source with an intimate knowledge of the Taliban and Mullah Omar has told CNN in the past .
During the talks , all parties agreed that the only solution to Afghanistan 's conflict is through dialogue , not fighting .
The source described the Mecca talks as an ice - breaking meeting where expectations were kept necessarily low .
Further talks are expected in Saudi Arabia involving this core group and others .
The reasons for Saudi Arabia 's involvement are numerous , including having the trust of the United States and Europe to play a positive role at a time when the conflict appears to be worsening and the coalition 's casualty toll is climbing .
Also , Saudi Arabia may fear that Iran could take advantage of U.S. failings in Afghanistan , as it is seen to be doing in Iraq .
Several Afghan sources familiar with Iranian activities in Afghanistan have said Iranian officials and diplomats who are investing in business and building education facilities are lobbying politicians in Kabul .
The Afghan sources wish to remain anonymous due to their political roles .
Coalition commanders regularly accuse Iran of arming the Taliban , and Western diplomats privately suggest that Iran is working against U.S. interests in Afghanistan , making it harder to bring peace .
Saudi sources say perceived Iranian expansionism is one of Saudi Arabia 's biggest concerns .

The two stories about the cleansing of the temple and the cursing of the fig tree may be Mark ’s best use of his common technique of “ sandwiching ” stories in a manner that allows one to serve as an exegesis on the other .
Both stories are probably not literal , but the story of the fig tree is even more abstract and reveals a deeper meaning to the story of Jesus cleansing the Temple — and vice - versa .
15 And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ; 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
17
And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ?
but ye have made it a den of thieves .
18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
19
And when even was come , he went out of the city .
Compare : Matthew 21:12 - 17 ; Luke 19:45 - 48 ; John 2:13-22
After cursing the fig tree , Jesus and his disciples re-enter Jerusalem and proceed to the Temple where “ moneychangers ” and those selling sacrificial animals are doing a lively business .
Mark reports that this infuriates Jesus who overturns the tables and chastises them .
This is the most violent we have seen Jesus yet and is quite uncharacteristic of him thus far — but then again , so was cursing the fig tree , and as we know the two events are closely linked .
That 's why they are presented together like this .
Fig Trees and Temples
What is meant by Jesus ’ actions ?
Some have argued that he was announcing that a new age was close at hand , an age where the cultic practices of the Jews would be overturned like the tables and transformed into prayers that all nations could join in .
This might help explain the anger experienced by some those targeted because this would eliminate the Jews ’ status as God ’s special chosen nation .
Others have argued that Jesus ’ purpose was to overturn the abusive and corrupt practices at the Temple , practices which ultimately served to oppress the poor .
Rather than a religious institution , there is some evidence that the Temple may have become more concerned with how much profit could be made by exchanging money and selling expensive items which the priestly hierarchy said were necessary for pilgrims .
The attack , then , would be against an oppressive aristocracy rather than against all of Israel — a common theme with many Old Testament prophets , and something that would make the anger of the authorities very understandable .
Perhaps like the cursing of the fig tree , though , this is n’t a literal and historical event either , even though it is less abstract .
It might be argued that this incident is supposed to make concrete to Mark ’s audience that Jesus has come to render the old religious order obsolete because it no longer serves purposes .
The Temple ( representing in the minds of many Christians either Judaism or the people of Israel ) has become a “ den of thieves , ” but in the future , the new house of God will be a house of prayer for “ all nations . ”
This phrase references Isaiah 56:7 and alludes to the future spread of Christianity to the Gentiles .
Mark ’s community probably would have been able to identify closely with this incident , feeling that Jewish traditions and laws would no longer be binding on them and expecting that their community was the fulfillment of Isaiah ’s prophecy .

Kalle watching soap bubbles .
Buildings have light - weight roofs in the shape of soap films .
Video ( 8.6MB , 2.3MB ) A magical fascination arises from seeing colorful soap bubbles flying in the wind .
The observer is immediately attracted while watching the beautiful creations and he can imagine touching them with a satisfying childlike curiosity .
Yet behind these aesthetically pleasing shapes lie deep mathematical problems , as well as practical applications in architecture , physics and chemistry - which one can understand and appreciate , in spite of their complexity , via the amusing story that unfolds in this video .
Young Boy Kalle .
The shape of a round bubble is only the simplest example of an incredible wealth of shapes that arise with soap films .
Imagine a simple experiment with soap films in the kitchen :
dip a curved metal wire into a mixture of water and dish - washing detergent , and , when you cautiously pull it out , a soap films forms .
With amazing elegance and simplicity , this soap film solves a historic mathematical problem , namely , the soap film finds the least surface area amongst all imaginable surfaces spanned by the wire .
Therefore , mathematicians call them " minimal surfaces " since they minimize area .
Mitsubishi Adopts Fuel Cell Unit for Electric Wheelchairs
September 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Last week , Mitsubishi Gas Chemical exhibited a fuel cell - based power supply unit that is small enough to be used in an electric wheelchair .
The microwave oven - sized unit , which weighs 22 kg , has an output of 300W and can run for eight hours with a 4 - liter fuel tank .
Hitachi exhibited a similar power supply unit in July , but it only had an output of 100W with a running time of 2.5 hours .
Interestingly , Mitsubishi and Suzuki are jointly promoting the development of an electric wheelchair using the fuel cell unit .
The long - lasting fuel cell provides an advantage over traditional rechargeable batteries , which are prone to exhaustion .
Wheelchairs only require a 300W unit since they move relatively slowly .
The electric wheelchair / fuel cell combo is still in testing stages , but look for it on the market in the near future .

Until now , research into canine aggression has almost exclusively involved analysis of dog bite statistics .
But the researchers said these were potentially misleading as most bites were not reported .
Big dogs might have acquired a reputation for being aggressive because their bites were more likely to require medical attention .
More than 30 million Internet users have fallen victim to fake antivirus programs that snatch up people 's money and personal information , security research firm PandaLabs has announced .
The phenomenon may not be a new one , but it 's growing more and more popular as the scammers are getting more crafty .
There are now over 7,000 variants of this type of adware , says PandaLabs , and the number of infections caused by it is increasing rapidly .
Users can get infected with this fake antivirus scam in the same manner as any other type of virus or malware — by downloading questionable content from P2P networks , opening e-mail attachments from unknown addresses , or visiting malicious web pages .
As most of us already know ( probably by servicing the computers of our parents and other less - tech - savvy family members ) , users are often duped by seeing the software pop up windows that claim the machine is infected , fake bluescreens , or cause other annoyances ( PandaLabs notes one where cockroaches crawl all over the desktop ) .
Many users are motivated to fork
over money to get rid of this ASAP Many users are motivated to forkover money to get rid of this ASAP
While many Internet users know not to hand over private information or credit card numbers just because of a few pop-ups , PandaLabs estimates that three percent of them have provided personal details to the purveyors of products that claim to disinfect computers .
" Extrapolating from an average European price of € 49.95 , we can calculate that the creators of these programs are receiving more than € 10 million per month , " writes PandaLabs .
That is , of course , ignoring the greater financial implications of users handing over their credit card numbers to scammers — the firm notes that , if those numbers are being used fraudulently , then the cost to consumers is obviously quite a bit higher .
Of course , the fact that 30 million users may have fallen for such a scam does n't surprise us too much .
A recent study by the Psychology Department of North Carolina State University revealed that most Internet users do n't exercise much caution when presented with fake dialog boxes and pop-up windows with obvious warning signs of malware .
Additionally , security software maker AVG found earlier this year that men tend to be much more confident about their online security knowledge than women , but they both end up suffering from identity theft in equal amounts .
It just goes to show that even when users talk the talk , they do n't always walk the walk when it comes to being safe online .

For the last 36 days , you ’ve watched Conservative leader Stephen Harper , the Greens ’ Elizabeth May , the Liberals ’ Stéphane Dion , and the NDP ’s Jack Layton , as well as your local candidates , make their case for your vote .
Tomorrow ( October 14 ) , it ’s your turn to have your say .
In the Vancouver area , along with the rest of British Columbia falling within the Pacific Time Zone , you can vote between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. at your local polling station .
You can find the location on your voter information card , if you received one in the mail .
If you did n’t get one of these , use your postal code to look up your polling station on the Elections Canada Web site .
For the first time , you ’ll need to prove your identity and address in order to cast your ballot .
A driver ’s licence containing your current address is sufficient .
Your other options include presenting two pieces of identification meeting Elections Canada ’s requirements , or having a neighbour or roommate in the same polling division vouch for you .
Preliminary election results from across the country will begin rolling out as soon as the polls close in B.C .
According to preliminary figures from Elections Canada , 1,459,253 people already voted at advance polls earlier this month .
Update : the bill has since been approved on a 14 - 4 vote .
The United States Congress returned to work this week , and senators appear to have copyright on the brain : A broad intellectual property enforcement bill introduced in July is slated for markup by the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday , and another aimed at cracking down on piracy overseas was introduced Wednesday .
As Ars reported in July , the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008 , sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , enacts a potpourri of measures long sought by content industries .
Most significant of these is a provision allowing for the Department of Justice to bring civil suits against IP infringers , with any damages won to be turned over to content owners .
It would also expand civil forfeiture powers in IP cases , create a federal copyright czar to " harmonize " IP enforcement between state and federal agencies , and establish liaisons to foreign IP " hot spots " where piracy is rampant .
In a letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday , a coalition of library associations and consumer advocacy groups criticized the bill , warning that an " unbalanced approach to enforcement would lead to unintended harms " that could stifle innovation .
The letter blasted the law 's civil enforcement provisions as an " enormous gift of federal resources to large copyright owners with no demonstration that the copyright owners are having difficulties enforcing their own rights . "
It also raised privacy concerns about the legislation 's civil forfeiture language , noting that the seizure of servers or other large digital storage devices , often holding data belonging to multiple users , could compromise sensitive personal information .
Legislators may already have remedies for some of these concerns in the works .
Sherwin Siy of Public Knowledge , one of the signatory groups behind yesterday 's letter , told Ars that sources on Capitol Hill have described a series of changes to the bill likely to be made in markup Thursday afternoon .
While the civil forfeiture provision will remain , a series of procedural safeguards may be added to prevent the disclosure of private information on seized devices , and language permitting seizure for violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 's controversial " anticircumvention " provisions will probably be excised .
Also likely to end up on the cutting - room floor is language targeting goods in " transshipment " — that is , passing through the US on their way to a final foreign destination — that infringe American IP laws .
These changes would make the bill " a bit better , " said Siy , " but they do n't make it good , especially as long as this deputization of the federal government as a private attorney is still in there . "
Siy suggested that the Justice Department is itself less than sanguine about being asked to serve as legal pit bull for copyright holders .
A second IP enforcement bill introduced Wednesday by Sens. Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) and Max Baucus ( D - MT ) would target foreign countries whose lax IP enforcement has landed them on the US " priority watch list , " direct the US Trade Representative to develop country - by - country " action plans " for stepping up enforcement , and authorize the president to impose a variety of sanctions on noncompliant nations , ranging from curtailment of financial aid to revocation of favorable trade rules .
The carrot to accompany those sticks is the authorization of " development assistance " to poor countries that need help cracking down on piracy .
Though the full text of the International Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement
Act of 2008 was not yet available at press time , the proposed legislation has already won plaudits from the US Chamber of Commerce , as well as the RIAA , which called the bill " a welcome verse in a great song . "
Public Knowledge 's Siy , by contrast , called both bills symptoms of a " skewed worldview " promoted by content industry lobbyists , which gives undue priority to IP issues .
" Of all the things we want to focus DoJ attorneys on , it 's going to be this ? " asked Siy .
" Of all the things we could to threaten to cut off trade for , it 's going to be this ? "
Herbert Stoyan was next to talk at the conference .
He covered many obscure details of the earliest days of Lisp .
My notes are pretty sparse , but I remember him showing several pictures of McCarthy and Minsky – he said , “ Marvin Minsky , he has n’t ever changed .
But if I were to show you twenty pictures of McCarthy , he ’d be completely different in each one ! ”
Somewhere in there Richard Gabriel ( I think ) stood up and said that , “ John McCarthy is the worst programmer on the planet .
He calls me up for the simplest things ! ”
I ’m pretty sure it was some sort of strange Lisp - type humor , as everyone laughed .
Stoyan has a Lisp museum in Germany , but he’s in the process of moving everything to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California .
Everyone with Lisp artifacts needs to contact this guy and find a home for them .
( The guy to talk to is Paul McJones . )
As a cautionary tale , he noted that we ’ve already lost the first Lisp compiler– the guy who made it was actually a mathematician and did n’t even get a PHD in Computer Science !
( Stoyan had a slide of the guy ’s photo . )
During the questions after the talk , JonL recalled McCarthy talking about one of the newer machines in the early days .
When questioned about its memory limitations , McCarthy said , “ You ca n’t possibly cons too much on this new machine ! ”
This story got a good laugh from the crowd .
Pascal Costanza was up next .
He spoke on his research about Context Oriented Programming .
The basic idea is that the computer should behave differently depending on the situation– for example , if the computer “ knew ” the user was angry due to heart rate , etc . then it should maybe not do certain things .
He noted that you can implement this sort of thing naively by having lots of if - then blocks everywhere .
That ’s no fun , though .
Then he made what I thought was a bombshell of a point : Model - View - Controller spreads code dealing with a single object ’s behavior and spreads it all over the system .
( He had a slide showning a UML diagram raging out of control . )
He said the original idea of OOP was that behavior is defined just in the class where it belongs .
With behavior spread all over the object model , objects no longer “ know ” how to behave !
Here ’s how Costanza makes that point in his paper : “ Among prominent domains to motivate object - oriented programming , graphics and people are the most widely used examples .
A reason for their popularity is the fact that one can easily introduce the idea that objects know how to behave , that is how to react to messages … .
However , when programs become more complex , the code for displaying objects is usually not contained in the classes to be displayed because there is a need to have different views on the same objects , often at the same time .
Therefore , such code is separated into view objects that need to be notified of changes to model objects ( such as instances of Rectangle or Person ) , leading to variants of the well - known Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) framework originally introduced with Smalltalk .
Unfortunately , this distribution of responsibilities that conceptually belong to a single object complicates the original simplicity of the object - oriented paradigm .
For this reason , some more recent object systems like Self and Squeak have even changed their frameworks for presenting objects on the screen back to the original idea that objects maintain their own knowledge about how to display themselves .
However , with that they lose the desired property to offer different views of the same objects .
ContextL provides an alternative approach that both keeps the conceptual simplicity that all of an object ’s behavior is indeed associated with that object and still allows an object to be viewed in different ways depending on the context . ”
Costanza then fired up Lispworks Professional Edition and started hammering out code .
This was all CLOS code .
He wrote some commands to define a class : define - layered - class , define - layered - function , define - layered - method , and deflayer .
To call an object in a given context , you call with - active - layers and pass it a list of layers , and method expression against your object : ( with - active - layers ( employment ) ( display * pascal * ) ) .
He then paused for questions and the crowd went a little crazy .
People wanted know how these features interacted with inheritance and how to code it to know that other layers are active given certain conditions .
Gregor Kiczales was floored : “ We in the CLOS community have failed to explain why multiple inheritance is important .
The problem is complicated , but our code is simpler . ”
He wanted to know what we could do to actually win the “ political ” argument .
Pascal responded , “ I do n’t care about the political discussions .
I think we should be focused on science . ”
( In an informal discussion out in the hall , someone noted that the Kiczales did n’t think ideas in the lab actually proved anything– in order to really demonstrate the validity of an idea , you have to have a base of users that are actually applying it in a real situation . )
[ Note : Gregor Kiczales is one of the co-authors of The Art of the Metaobject Protocol .
Can you imagine presenting a paper about CLOS and having him ask you questions afterward ?!
Costanza did not flinch ….]
The Ruby coder that had jumped in the DSM fishbowl the night before returned right about then .
From the back of the room he asked ( somewhat agitatedly , no less ) how you could possibly save the contexts in the case of a real web application .
( I thing he was coming from a… what is it … a Spring or a Hibernate standpoint or something .
Something like that . )
Costanza responded that if you knew what you were doing , you could get at everything .
Ruby guy also wanted know how you could possibly handle exceptions with this stuff .
Costanza put up a slide showing some benchmarks .
Inexplicably , he actually made the code faster in some situations just by adding contexts !
Everyone wanted to know how this could be , and Costanza responded that it did n’t mean anything .
He said to never optimize on the basis of guesses ; efficiency is not important– give us more flexibility , he declared !
Kiczales could n’t handle this – in most of the meetings he ’d ever been in , a 1 % loss of efficiency would mean he ’d get shown the door .
“ We can not ship something that is less effective than the thing we shipped before , ” he said .
Costanza said that most of our machines are idle– who cares ?!
Ruby and Python very popular and they are dog- slow … .
One percent ?
People these days do n’t care about a ten percent performance hit !
JonL closed the final remarks with a word of caution about benchmarking .
The competitive impulse magnifies trivial differences .
Back in the day , a meaningless difference would mean that a Lisp hacker would be dead in the water and have to go back to C. JonL said there should be no more papers on Garbage Collectors unless you had an example .
There should be no more benchmarking without theory and no more theory without benchmarking – it ’s not the magnitude , it ’s the “ why ” that matters .

It is an old maxim and a very sound one , that he that dances should always pay the fiddler .
Now , sir , in the present case , if any gentlemen , whose money is a burden to them , choose to lead off a dance , I am decidedly opposed to the people ’s money being used to pay the fiddler … all this to settle a question in which the people have no interest , and about which they care nothing .

REAL NEWS - CONGRESS IS BIGGEST PROBLEM
REAL NEWS - CONGRESS IS BIGGEST PROBLEM
from : REAL NEWS < thenewsman@ij.net >
( Common sense , politically incorrect newsletter )
TO HECK WITH JOHN McCAIN AND BARACK OBAMA -- OUR CORRUPT CONGRESS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM !
Regardless of who gets elected president , their hands will be tied by our corrupt Congress unless voters wake up and vote all their own U.S. Representatives and U.S. Senators out of Congress .
Our term - limitless , sovereign - acting Congress is " taking the USA down the drain " .
Since only Congress can pass laws to control themselves , you can't expect " the fox to guard the henhouse " or for Congress to change .
There is no one to take away the bloated benefits they give themselves .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can not invoke term limits ( which worked so well state - wide ) on their own members of Congress .
The only remedy is to vote them all out of office .
But each Congress member is bribing their own voters with just enough pork bills to ensure re-election .
Only Congress can create spending bills , but they accuse the president of over - spending when he signs their spending bill .
President George W. Bush shirked defending his reputation as he became the " whipping boy " victim of our politicized Congress who criticize and insult everything he does or does n't do , and says or does n't say , without giving a logical alternative solution .
They fight with each other for power , protect and pass legislation for their bribers , and just concentrate on getting re-elected ( Potomac fever ) .
Many in Congress continuously sabotage the war effort at every opportunity , encourage terrorists to ambush our troops , harrangue our POW prisons , and belittle the war results .
A president with any guts would imprison them for sedition .
The Congressional Republicans are guilty of getting just enough bribes to keep them from " blowing the whistle " on Congressional Democrats who have been getting huge bribes for many years to protect embezzlers like in the financial institutions .
The House of Representatives and the Senate have this conspiracy when the people are protesting so loud for an issue that they have to do something -- but their bribers wo n't allow them to do it .
The House passes an appropriate bill and the Senate passes a different appropriate bill .
But neither house gets around to voting on the bill from the other house .
So both houses are heroes for passing a bill -- but nothing ever happens because approval is required by both houses .
The good people in the Democratic Party should be ashamed of malicious liars like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who are without integrity .
Has your U.S. Senator or Representative in Washington presented any legislation or voted for any legislation that you liked ?
Are they doing what 's good for you and the nation , or too busy benefitting themselves and lobbyists who want to bribe them ?
Are you going to vote for a decent , qualified new candidate , or blindly vote for an obvious immoral , lying , slandering bribe - taker just because you favor his political party ?
Are voters stuck on stupid ?
Most of the campaign promises made by Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama are impossible for them to fulfill because their plans must first be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
Presidents can't pass tax bills or budget bills , they can only sign or veto bills , and sometimes their own suggested bills are passed with so many changes and pork added that they have to veto and send them back in hope of cleanup .
Senator Obama told a Philadelphia audience Saturday that he personally would exam to approve every item in every spending bill .
He must have forgot that the president does n't have " line - item - veto " power .
Obama really gave a wonderful speech , promising every thing people wanted to hear .
I would vote for anyone who could do all those wonderful things -- but most issues were obviously impossible for any president to have the power to do .
Why has n't Obama already initiated these issues while he had the power to do so in the Senate ?
Perception of Obama 's winning personality and silver - tongued oratory outshine the reality that his meager government experience has been " just going along for the ride " while awaiting his predestined run for president .
Senator McCain 's campaign is too low key and has n't satisfied conservative voters -- mainly about illegal immigrants and oil drilling in desolate , treeless ANWR , Alaska .
IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR EVERYONE TO DECIDE WHO TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT .
If you want a socialist government with high taxes to provide for all your needs , Obama is your man .
If you want a government that encourages personal responsibility , McCain is your man .
If you want to vote your conscience , look at the minor parties .
I used to blame the people for electing poor quality candidates .
Now I know better .
The media and the elite establishment hide the good candidates from the public so that they can publicize their chosen candidates .
Goodbye Mitt Romney , Fred Thompson and Evan Bayh !!
They figured McCain was beatable so Obama could be their mouthpiece in the White House .

" A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious .

Nineteen former military officers have received Letters of Inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission regarding allegations that they received favors from the Pentagon to spin the war on Iraq .
Letters went out to five TV networks as well .
The disclosure comes from FCC Commission Jonathan Adelstein , who revealed the move on Tuesday .
" I 'm glad we are looking into these allegations that there was a possible attempt to deceive the American people concerning one of the most controversial issues facing the country today , " Adelstein said in a statement .
" We have an obligation to pursue this investigation , and to conclude it quickly . "
In April of this year , two Capitol Hill Democrats responded to a New York Times exposé by requesting an FCC investigation of a Department of Defense - coordinated media blitz .
The Times report revealed how then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recruited dozens of former military officers to become TV news show cheerleaders for the war in Iraq .
Courtesy New York Times
Publicly promoted as " objective analysts , " the Times article revealed that many of these retirees consulted for military contractors that profit from the ongoing conflict .
They also had access to regular Pentagon briefings — so long as they hewed to the Rumsfeld line on key issues such as Guantanamo prison , weapons of mass destruction , and the overall success of the occupation .
In May , House Energy Committee Chair John Dingell ( D - MI ) and House Agriculture Subcommittee chair Rosa L. DeLauro ( D - CT ) sent FCC Chair Kevin Martin a letter asking for an investigation of the campaign .
" The American people should never be subject to a covert propaganda campaign but rather should be clearly notified of who is sponsoring what they are watching , " they wrote .
The Reps invoked a section of the Communications
Act that , in their letter 's own words , " prohibits those involved with preparing program matter intended for broadcast from accepting valuable consideration for , including particular matter in , a program without disclosure . "
The FCC interprets the law this way : " When anyone provides or promises to provide money , services or other valuable consideration to someone to include program matter in a broadcast , that fact must be disclosed in advance of the broadcast , ultimately to the station over which the matter is to be aired . "
Martin said the FCC would look into the matter shortly after the Dingell / DeLauro letter .
Broadcasting & Cable reported on Monday that the FCC was continuing to pursue the inquiry .
Adelstein made his announcement a day later .
He has been pushing hard to move the probe along .
In June , Adelstein spoke at a conference urging the agency to " conclude this investigation quickly . "
He also criticized the length of an earlier inquiry into the Department of Education 's decision to pay conservative commentator Armstrong Williams $ 245,000 to promote President Bush 's " No Child Left Behind Act " over television and radio .
That investigation took two and a half years .
The FCC ultimately cited Williams and proposed fines against several broadcasting groups that aired Williams ' commentaries for breaking the Commission 's sponsorship identification rules .
" The good news is that in the end , we finally declared the obvious : [ Williams ] violated the law , " Adelstein said .
" This investigation need not , and should not , take that long .
There is no excuse for delay . "
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Oil ’s sharp two - month decline is likely to end soon as producer cartel OPEC will probably cut production once prices dip below $ 100 a barrel , the head of commodities research for Credit Suisse said on Wednesday .
Production curbs should keep prices between $ 100 and $ 110 for the rest of this year , while grain markets should rally as traders look past positive short - term weather conditions towards the bigger longer - term risks to world food supplies , Tobias Merath told Reuters in an interview .
“ On oil , I think the bulk of the correction is behind us , ” Merath said .
“ We think it can test $ 100 or drop slightly below it in a couple of weeks , but it should not remain below $ 100 on a sustained basis . ”
Oil has tumbled more than $ 6 since Friday , touching its lowest in five months after early signs that a weakened hurricane Gustav caused little damage to U.S. oil installations .
On Wednesday , U.S. crude fell 52 cents to $ 109.19 a barrel , extending its nearly $ 40 slump since its July 11 record high of $ 147.27 .
Merath said weaker demand for crude oil from the United States and OECD countries in recent months has offset higher demand from emerging markets , keeping overall consumption flat .
“ At the same time , OPEC countries are producing quite a bit of oil since March and that is apparently working .
But the moment oil drops below $ 100 , they will be quick to cut back production , ” he said .
“ We expect a recovery in oil prices in 2009 .
We expect prices to hover between $ 115 and $ 120 in 2009 . ”
The OPEC next meets on September 9 in Vienna .
Most commentators have predicted it would leave formal output targets unchanged , but there have been calls from within the group to rein in production above official ceilings .
FOOD CRISIS NOT OVER YET
Merath added that the outlook for grains and oilseeds remained positive , with gains of more than 10 percent expected by the end of next year , while industrial metal prices would remain weak until the end of this year and would start recovering only when world economic growth started picking up next year .
“ We think that the food crisis is not over yet .
The market is reading in too much into the positive effects of good crops .
Yes , there are good crops in the pipeline but we should forget that we have floods in the Midwest and adverse climatic conditions in Australia , ” he said .
“ For wheat , corn and soybeans , we expect the market to be at least 10 percent higher than the current levels by the end of next year , ” he said .
On gold , Merath said the sharp fall in the price of gold has generated interest in physical buying among jewellery makers , which , along with relatively lower interest rates , should be able to support prices at current levels .
Spot gold has rebounded to around $ 800 an ounce after striking a nine - month low around $ 773 in mid-August , but is still well below a lifetime high of $ 1,030.80 hit in March .
“ We do n’t expect any interest rate hikes anytime soon .
Australia is the most recent example of countries cutting rates .
Lower yields will be positive for gold , ” Merath said .
“ Prices of around $ 800 is seen as a bargaining opportunity for physical consumers .
We see the market recovering to $ 900 by the end of the year , and the market will be between $ 950 and $ 1,000 by the end of next year , ” he added .

The definition of science poses some problems for people .
Everyone seems to have an idea of what science is , but articulating it is difficult .
Ignorance about science is n't a viable option , but unfortunately it 's not too hard to find religious apologists spreading misunderstanding .
Because science is best defined by scientific methodology , an accurate understanding of science also means understanding why science is superior to faith , intuition , or any other method of acquiring knowledge .
Science & Definition
The classical definition of science is simply the state of " knowing " — specifically theoretical knowledge as opposed the practical knowledge .
In the Middle Ages the term " science " came to be used interchangeably with " arts , " the word for such practical knowledge .
Thus , " liberal arts " and " liberal sciences " meant basically the same thing .
Modern dictionaries are a bit more specific than that and offer a number of different ways in which the term science can be defined :
The observation , identification , description , experimental investigation , and theoretical explanation of phenomena .
Methodological activity , discipline , or study .
An activity that appears to require study and method .
For many purposes , these definitions can be adequate , but like so many other dictionary definitions of complex subjects they are ultimately superficial and misleading .
They only provide the barest minimum of information about the nature of science .
As a consequence , the above definitions can be used to argue that even astrology or dowsing qualify as " science " and that 's simply not right .
Science & Methodology
Distinguishing modern science from other endeavors requires focusing on scientific methodology — the means by which science achieves results .
It is , after all , the results which help distinguish science as one of the most successful endeavors in all of human history .
Fundamentally , then , science can be characterized as a method of obtaining reliable ( though not infallible ) knowledge about the universe around us .
This knowledge includes both descriptions of what happens and explanations of why it happens , thus leading to predictions of what should happen in the future .
Knowledge acquired through the scientific method is reliable because it is continually tested and retested — much of science is heavily interdependent , which means that any test of any scientific idea entails testing other , related ideas at the same time .
The knowledge is not infallible , because at no point do scientists assume that they have arrived at a final , definitive truth .
It 's always possible to be mistaken .
The knowledge acquired through science is about the universe around us , and that includes us as well .
This is why science is naturalistic : it is all about natural processes and natural events .
Science involves both description , which tells us what has happened , and explanation , which tells us why it happened .
This latter point is important because it is only through knowing why events occur that we can predict what else might occur in the future .
Science can also at times be characterized as a category or body of knowledge .
When the term is used in this manner , the speaker usually has in mind just the physical sciences ( astronomy , geology ) or biological sciences ( zoology , botany ) .
These are sometimes also called " empirical sciences , " as distinguished from the " formal sciences , " which encompass mathematics and formal logic .
Thus we have people talking about " scientific knowledge " about the planet , about stars , etc .
Finally , science is often used to refer to the community of scientists and researchers who do scientific work .
It is this group of people who , through practicing science , effectively define what science is and how science is done .
Philosophers of science attempt to describe what an ideal pursuit of science would look like , but it is the scientists who establish what it will really be .
In effect , science " is " what scientists and the scientific community " do . "
This brings us right back to science being the scientific methodology — the method and practices used by scientists to acquire reliable knowledge about the world around us .
The superiority of science over other attempts to acquire knowledge lies in that methodology .
Developed over the course of many decades , the scientific method provides us with information that is more consistently reliable and useful than any other system that humans have ever tried to develop — including especially faith , religion , and intuition .
The miniskirt is a skirt with a hemline well above the knees ( generally 20 cm , or more , above knee level ) .
The mini was the defining fashion symbol of " Swinging London " in the 1960s .
The miniskirt 's existence in the 1960s is generally credited to the fashion designer Mary Quant , who was inspired by the Mini Cooper automobile , although the French designer André Courrèges is also often cited as its inventor ( the French referred to it as la mini- jupe ) , and there is disagreement as to who invented it first .
Some give the credit to Helen Rose who made some miniskirts for actress Anne Francis in the 1956 science fiction movie " Forbidden Planet " , but examples of midresses appeared in previous sci- fi movies , like the minidress of Dale Arden in 1940s movie " Flash Gordon " .
Recently , Marit Allen , a Vogue " Young Ideas " editor at the time , has stated that " John Bates , in particular , has always been completely unappreciated for his contribution to the innovation and creativity he brought to the London design scene . "
He bared the midriff , used transparent vinyl and , Marit Allen asserts , was responsible for " the raising of the hemline .
It was John Bates , rather than Mary Quant or Courrèges , who was responsible for the miniskirt . "
Bates ' costumes and accessories for Diana Rigg , as Emma Peel in the ABC TV series , The Avengers , from 1965 - 7 , helped to define " Mod style " .
As The Avengers ' filmed episodes were made several months before screening , Avengers producer Brian Clemens confirmed in interviews that the miniskirt designed by Bates had to be used as a " gamble " , since they did not know if it would catch on in public or be seen as a fashion failure by the time the episodes aired .
However , Emma Peel 's fashions were accepted by the public and even spawned a line of replicas of her clothes for public sale .
Another , more " immediate " proponent of the miniskirt on television was Cathy McGowan , who introduced the weekly rock music show , Ready Steady Go! ( 1964-66 ) .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Mr Splash leaps from a platform 35 ft 4in ( 10.76 m ) above a paddling pool Do n't try this at home .
The bellyflop is not a dive for the faint - hearted .
Let alone from 35 feet up into 12 inches of water , a new world record .
Arms outstretched , Darren Taylor propels himself off a platform high above a pool .
If this were the Olympics , he would perform a series of tucks and spins before blading cleanly into the water , making as little splash as possible .
But Taylor is a professional shallow diver , and he executes the " mother of all bellyflops " into a paddling pool holding just 30 cm of water .
His latest jump is the new world record and this month he hopes to do a 40 ft dive .
How does he do this and survive , let alone walk away with just bruising to his chest and legs ?
By making a massive splash when he lands , with arms wide , chest expanded , back arched , chin aloft .
It 's all about increasing the time during which he decelerates from 30 mph to 0mph , says physicist Caitlin Watson , by maximising the body surface hitting the water surface .
THE ANSWER
Make a big splash by spreading body wide This reduces deceleration and cushions the body
She makes the analogy of driving a car into an obstacle .
" If you hit a brick wall , that 's an instant deceleration and it may kill you .
But if you drive into an enormous bag of feathers , that slows you down more gradually , " says Ms Watson , of the Institute of Physics .
So rather than assume the dive - bomb tuck familiar from childhood - a position which is too streamlined - Taylor spreads himself out .
" He has a lot of kinetic energy [ energy of motion ] , and that energy will be transferred to the water as the noise you hear , the water splashing out of the pool and the heat created on his body .
The skin on his belly and legs will get warm , in the same way that if you clap your hands together hard , they feel warm . "
And the mattress underneath the 10ft by 5ft paddling pool - a safeguard to comply with Guinness World Records regulations - also absorbs some of the force of his landing .
" That 's not concrete he 's landing on . "
Ripple control
High divers , by contrast , aim to enter the pool with barely a ripple - their deceleration comes under water , which is why diving pools are so deep .
The kinetic energy of their fall converts not to a splash , but a roil of bubbles beneath the surface .
High divers punch a hole in the surface Having executed a series of mid-air somersaults , a high diver 's body must be as vertical as possible on entering the pool , arms overhead , body straight , toes pointed .
Taylor 's build may also help , being thickset and muscular like a wrestler , rather than having the lithe physique of a champion high diver .
" Wrestlers are big chaps , muscular , used to absorbing a lot of force , " says Ms Watson .
" And holding his chin up helps prevent whiplash - the head is already back .
If he landed face down , that would expose the delicate face to the full force of the landing . "
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines Taylor , 47 , of Denver , Colorado , has spent more than two decades perfecting his shallow dives .
And unlike the amateur bellyfloppers at the local swimming baths , he also understands the mechanics , having been a champion high diver in his youth .
Perhaps Team GB has a future record - breaker in 14 - year - old Olympian Tom Daley , who surely knows how to reverse his usual high board techniques in order to perfect the bellyflop .

Twenty three universities have agreed to share and combine their digitized content , including millions of scanned books and documents , in one gigantic , 78 - terabyte library that launched Monday .
Called the HathiTrust , the depository contains digital content from 11 University of California libraries and a 12 - university consortium that forms the Committee on Institutional Cooperation , which includes the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago .
Before the HathiTrust launched , digital content was isolated to each university library , according to John Wilkin , associate university librarian of the University of Michigan , who was named the executive director of HathiTrust .
“ This effort combines the expertise and resources of some of the nation ’s foremost research libraries and holds even greater promise as it seeks to grow beyond the initial partners , ” Wilkin said in a press release .
HathiTrust is similar to Google 's Book Search project , which has formed partnerships with several major universities and public libraries who have lent their materials to the search - engine giant for digitization .
However , while Google Book Search 's seemingly altruistic mission is to provide " a tool that can ... help remove the barriers between people and information and benefit the publishing community at the same time , "
the corporation profits from advertisements displayed near digitized pages .
HathiTrust , by contrast , exists purely for universities to share their information with one another , with the goal of fostering advancements in research .
Nonetheless , the HathiTrust project will likely encounter controversy regarding copyright infringement , as Google has in the past .
Critics of Book Search have said the service commits " massive copyright infringement , " even though Google argues its digital content sharing is considered Fair Use .

Harry Reid was his usual blunt self talking about John McCain with Nevada reporter Jon Ralston .
Reid has worked with John McCain for 26 years , so he speaks with experience .
This is why we like Harry Reid .
He says it like it is :
“ I just think he does n’t have the temperament to be president , ” Reid told Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston during the taping of “ Face to Face , ” in Denver on Wednesday .
The show airs on a Las Vegas , Nev. , cable channel .
“ I ’ve served with the man 26 years , ” Reid said .
“ Do I have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone he ’s dealt with ?
Someone who does not have the temperament to be president , who ’s wrong on the war , wrong on the economy , wrong on nuclear waste .
What am I supposed to do ?
Walk around talking about what a great guy he is ?
I do n’t believe that . …. “
“ There is n’t a Republican serving in the Senate that ’s happy he ’s the nominee .
Now , they ’re all supporting him , but I ’ll tell you they have told me .
I ’ve had Republican senators tell me they do n’t think they ’ll vote for him , ” Reid said .
When Ralston asked if Reid thought it would be “ dangerous ” to let McCain be president , Reid answered : “ Well , if you said it , I would n’t correct you . ”
“ Is that right ? ” Ralston asked .
“ You really think that ? ”
“ That ’s right , ” said Reid , who predicted that Democrat presidential candidate Barack Obama would carry the battleground state of Nevada by 5 percentage points .
Barack Obama was tougher than John McCain on foreign affairs , clearer than him on remedying the sick economy , and drew a devastating comparison between his health plan and the frightening scheme offered by the Republican presidential nominee .
As was the case in their first debate , Obama emerged from Tuesday night ’s confrontation in Nashville , Tenn. , in command of the situation .
The Democratic nominee looked calm , confident and presidential as he won their second contest .
McCain disregarded his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who said he should “ take the gloves off . ”
Neither was he the surly campaigner he had been on the stump when he demanded to know “ Who is the real Barack Obama ? ”
He still appeared amazed at Obama ’s effrontery for even running against him .
He grumbled and grouched .
But somebody must have said , “ John , be more civil , ” and he took the advice , leaving Palin the job of tossing dirt , which she undoubtedly will eagerly accept .
McCain even came up with one pretty good idea in the debate .
If elected , he said , “ I would order the secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes — at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those … those payments and stay in their homes .
“ Is it expensive ?
Yes .
But we all know , my friends , until we stabilize home values in America , we ’re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy .
And we ’ve got to give some trust and confidence back to America . ”
This was McCain ’s best moment of the evening .
But the plan conflicted with something he had said just moments earlier : “ We obviously have to stop this spending spree that ’s going on in Washington . ”
What was most striking about the debate was the difference between the two on chasing down Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan hiding place .
Obama was clear and strong , showing determination and mastery .
McCain was rambling .
It was a bad moment for a candidate who boasts of his foreign affairs expertise .
Obama said , “ If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights , and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out , then I think that we have to act and we will take them out .
We will kill bin Laden ; we will crush al - Qaida .
That has to be our biggest national security priority . ”
That was too strong for McCain , and maybe for some of Obama ’s more dovish supporters .
McCain reflected the muddy thinking of the foreign policy establishment and the policy that led the United States to give billions to Pakistan ’s then - President Pervez Musharraf while he made deals with the Taliban .
Also important were the candidates ’ sharp disagreements on health care policy .
They had disclosed their contrasting plans many months ago .
They have discussed them in speeches and in policy papers .
But for a long time , nobody was listening — until the economy crashed .
On a Tuesday when the stock market dropped by 500 points and when retirement accounts faded away , thoughts of medical bills and unforgiving hospital bill collectors suddenly seemed more important .
Obama laid out his plan , a combination of affordable public and private insurance with companies forced to cover pre-existing conditions .
McCain offered his : ending tax subsidies to employers offering health insurance .
Those receiving employer benefits would have to pay taxes on them .
Instead , Americans would get tax breaks of $ 2,500 a person and $ 5,000 a family to use to purchase insurance .
Unfortunately , such plans run more than $ 12,000 for a family .
And with the economy in such deep trouble , there will be fewer businesses offering health care .
Good luck to anyone shopping for McCain - style health insurance .
This is a powerful issue for Obama and he ought to hammer McCain with it for the rest of the campaign .
At the end , the combatants got together .
McCain did n’t shake Obama ’s hand , but he guided his foe toward his wife , Cindy McCain , and she seemed friendly enough .
Now , the dirty stuff will resume .
The Rev. Wright , Bill Ayers , the snide comments about Obama ’s name , the unsubtle references to him being different — also known as African - American — abortion , the makeup of an Obama Supreme Court , each hit tailored to appeal to a different group of voters .
But all this seems small and unimportant compared to the calamities now reaching down into millions of American homes and businesses .
FURTHER UPDATE 10:40
The transcript of Tuesday ’s hearing , including Judge Urbina ’s oral ruling , can be found here .
The government ’s appeal focuses on the oral decision and on the minute entry summarizing that order .
Judge Urbina , however , promised that “ a formal opinion ” would follow .
UPDATE 5:50 p.m .
The White House filed a swift appeal of the judge ’s release order , and said it would seek “ emergency relief ” from the D.C. Circuit Court tonight .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said the order , “ if allowed to stand , could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay , including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 , who may also seek release into our country . ”
Perino ’s statement is here .
A Justice Department statement is here .
The notice of appeal is here .
Lawyers for the detainees filed papers to spell out the services that would be provided to detainees once they were in the U.S. , treating them as refugees .
Those papers can be found by those with PACER accounts on the District Court ’s website , under docket 05 - 1509 , entry 178 .
The detainees ’ lawyers also filed a proposed order , available here .
— — — — — — —————-
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the government to release a group of 17 Chinese Muslims held at Guantanamo Bay into the United States , and to present them in his courtroom at 10 a.m. this Friday for a handover to local caretakers .
At a hearing this morning in U.S. District Court in Washington , Judge Ricardo M. Urbina said whatever authority the government possessed to detain the Uighurs – whom the government has conceded are not enemy combatants but cannot be returned to China for fear of potential persecution – had “ ceased . ”
Urbina also ordered a subsequent hearing for October 16 , at which members of the Department of Homeland Security could speak to the conditions they wish to apply to the Uighurs ’ presence in the country .
With regard to Friday ’s hearing , Urbina said he wanted to question the Uighurs himself , and asked lawyers for the detainees to bring the individuals expected to provide temporary shelter to the exchange .
In advance of the October 16 hearing , Urbina said immigration officials are to neither question nor detain any members of the group .
“ That is not how the three branches of government work together , ” Urbina said .
“ Nothing will happen to these people . ”
The ruling came in the case of Kiyemba , et al. v. Bush ( 05 -1509 ) .
A copy of the minute order is available here .
Lawyers for the Uighurs had originally asked that Urbina “ parole ” them into the country , a temporary — and revocable — form of immigration relief frequently extended in humanitarian situations .
Having instead granted the Uighurs outright release into the United States , Urbina said the request for parole was “ moot . ”
It was not clear from Tuesday ’s developments , however , what immigration status the Uighurs would possess upon their arrival in the country .
Delivering a summary of his ruling from the bench , Urbina said his order was based on the fact that the Uighurs ’ detention had become effectively indefinite , that the government conceded they would not return to the battlefield , and that the government had provided no alternative grounds for detention .
He noted the government ’s “ extensive diplomatic efforts ” had yet to find a country willing to accept the Uighurs , and rejected the government ’s argument that the Executive branched possessed authority to “ wind - up ” their detention .
Urbina denied a Justice Department lawyer ’s request to stay the order for a week so that the government could review its options .
In advance of Friday ’s deadline , the government is expected to seek a stay of the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit .
The case may ultimately end up before the Supreme Court , presenting a clash between the judiciary ’s power to end unlawful government detention , and the power of the political branches to set admissions standards for aliens entering the country .
During a spirited hearing in advance of the ruling , Justice Department lawyer John O’Quinn repeatedly contended that Urbina could not order the Uighurs , held at Guantanamo for some seven years , to be released into the country .
But Urbina said the principal case on which the government relied , Shaughnessy v. Mezei ( 1953 ) , had been “ undermined ” by the Supreme Court ’s more recent decisions in Zadvydas v. Davis ( 2001 ) and Clark v. Martinez ( 2005 ) .
The Court ’s decision in Mezei permitted the government to indefinitely detain at Ellis Island a green - card holder whom immigration officials deemed a security risk following an extended visit to then - Communist Eastern Europe , but which no country was willing to take back .
Nearly fifty years later , the ruling Zadvydas said that the prospect of indefinitely detaining previously admitted aliens that were subject to deportation , but that no country would accept , would pose grave constitutional concerns .
O’Quinn also contended during the hearing that while the government had removed the Uighurs ’ label as “ enemy combatants , ” officials had not deemed them non-dangerous .
He said the group had been captured in 2001 in Tora Bora in Afghanistan , near to where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding at the time , and had been trained to automatic assault rifles .
But Urbina was unpersuaded .
“ What is the security risk to the United States should these people be admitted to live here ? ” he asked .
O’Quinn said Congress , through a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act , has barred the admission of individuals who had engaged in terrorist activities , and that the Uighurs were believed to be affiliated with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement , which the United States lists as a terrorist organization .
After the ruling , Sabin Willett , a Boston lawyer representing the Uighurs , noted the presence of numerous individuals in the courtroom that could ease the group ’s transition in the country , including Rebiya Kadeer , the president of the World Uighur Congress and former political prisoner in China , and a representative of Lutheran Immigration & Refugee Service in Baltimore .
Willett also said a former software executive , whom he declined to publicly name , had made a “ substantial ” financial commitment to any resettlement effort .
Scientists who have determined how much carbon is stored annually in upper Midwest forests hope their findings will be used to accelerate global discussion about the strategy of managing forests to offset greenhouse gas emissions .
In an era of competing land use demands , the researchers argue that forests help stabilize the climate and are abundant sources of other ecological goods and services – such as cleansed air , fertile soil and filtered water .
Quantifying the amount of carbon that forests can keep out of the atmosphere is one way of showing forests ’ value to energy policymakers , the researchers suggest .
“ Demonstrating that forests have economic value because they offer carbon offsets might also help citizens have an appropriately broad appreciation for the things that forests do for them beyond providing recreation or wood used for construction or paper pulp , ” said Peter Curtis , professor and chair of evolution , ecology and organismal biology at Ohio State University .
Curtis is the senior author of a paper published in a recent issue of the journal BioScience that quantifies annual carbon storage capacity in forests in the upper Great Lakes region and details how historic land use , climate patterns and tree turnover influence forests ’ carbon storage trends .
The researchers ’ calculations suggest that carbon storage in Midwestern forests could offset the greenhouse gas emissions of almost two - thirds of nearby populations , and that proper management of forests could sustain or increase their storage capacity for future generations .
Based on measurements taken between 1999 and 2005 at a forest study site in northern Michigan , the scientists have determined that similar upper Midwest forests covering an estimated 40,000 square miles store an average of 1,300 pounds of carbon per acre per year .

Factoring in effects of climate , history and tree type , the researchers developed an equation suggesting that a heavily forested region in northern Michigan could store more than 350,000 tons of carbon per year .
With the area population emitting about 573,000 tons of carbon annually , the forests would sequester approximately 62 percent of the region ’s human - caused carbon emissions – the equivalent of yearly emissions from about 225,000 cars .
Curtis said the concept of using forests to store carbon has steadily gained attention among policymakers , especially since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 as a global program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Curtis is a believer in approaching carbon dioxide stabilization in the atmosphere through what he calls “ small wedge ” efforts .
“ Biological carbon storage , mostly in forests , is one of those little wedges along with other ones you might think of , such as increased energy efficiency , using fluorescent light bulbs and the like .
There is not one silver bullet , ” he said .
Effective use of forests for carbon storage requires knowing more than current storage statistics , he noted .
Curtis and colleagues also have outlined historic factors that offer clues about what forests can be expected to store and release over future decades .
The research team conducted the measurements at the University of Michigan Biological Station ( UMBS ) .
The composition of this small forested region is representative of the forests stretching about 40,000 square miles – the equivalent of the land mass of Ohio – across the entire upper Midwest .

Most carbon in the UMBS forest is contained in the wood mass and soil organic matter – which , Curtis said , points to the importance of considering underground carbon reservoirs in carbon budgeting .
Stem wood , leaves and debris contain about 42 percent of carbon in the forest .
The storage assessments for the past five years resulted from combining ecological and meteorological measurements at the Michigan forest site .
Ecological estimates are based on the carbon content of wood , leaf litter , debris and roots as well as the release of carbon that occurs when soil and plants decompose .
The meteorological measurements analyze the ongoing carbon exchange between the forest and atmosphere using instrumentation available at only a select few labs in the world .
In the case of the Michigan forest , carbon storage capacity is also affected by the repeated clear - cut harvesting and fire disturbance that occurred a century ago as well as climate variations that the scientists have documented and the species and age of trees the forest comprises .
These conditions can be used to project future carbon storage trends in similar forests in the United States and around the world .
The scientists have recorded a rising average air temperature of almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.1 degrees Celsius ) and decreased solar radiation of 5 percent over the past 25 years at the Michigan study site .
The current average temperature is about 45 degrees Fahrenheit .
Extending such changes to 2030 , the researchers suggest the annual carbon storage affected by these climate changes will be reduced by between 1.3 percent and 28.5 percent , to a possible low of about 980 pounds of carbon per acre .
“ We were n’t surprised by the annual temperature increase , because that ’s happening everywhere , but the decline in solar radiation was very surprising , ” Curtis said .
“ It might seem like a small difference , but it ’s important from the standpoint of plants . ”
Plants use the energy from sunlight to manufacture carbohydrates and release oxygen through photosynthesis .
Curtis said scientists believe the rising temperatures combined with the presence of water led to the increase in cloudy days .
The Michigan forest ’s storage capacity also is affected by its land use history .
A period of deforestation between 1880 and 1920 was followed by abandonment of the land and a rash of wildfires .
Forests with similar histories store significantly less carbon than stands without that kind of disturbance because of a resulting lower forest canopy and reduced soil fertility .
“ Nothing this drastic would ever happen in the United States today .
However , it ’s going on all the time in developing world , and a less damaging pattern of harvest and fire is increasing in the western United States .
And there are lasting consequences of that , ” Curtis said .
“ The persistent legacies of poor management practices on forest carbon storage in northern Michigan should serve as a caution to contemporary forest managers . ”
Finally , the age and species of trees in forests also affect carbon storage capacity .
Old growth forests store relatively little carbon .
More carbon is stored in older wood , but the rate of accumulation decreases over time because a higher rate of decomposition in soil and dead wood lowers the net gain of carbon storage .
Curtis noted that some policymakers are concerned that aging Great Lakes forests will show a decline in carbon storage capacity .
“ We contend the situation here is different because of the nature of the land use .
We consider them ‘ old young ’ forests .
Aspens are aging , but underneath the aspens , waiting for them to die , are lots of young pine , oak , beech and maple .
Once they get their turn , they will rejuvenate these forests in terms of carbon storage , ” he said .
The scientists are accelerating this phenomenon – called succession – in a segment of the Michigan forest to test this hypothesis .
“ If we ’re right , this will give people incentive to hold onto forests and not cut them down .
Though a younger forest might be considered more productive , we contend cutting would set things back because it would cause a lot of disturbance , ” Curtis said .
He hopes the combined assessments can be used for global policy discussions about forests ’ ability to store carbon .
“ We now know where carbon is in a forest – it ’s very important , if you ’re managing carbon , to know where it is .
Now that we can document where carbon is , how it gets in there and how it leaves , what we have is an accounting problem , ” Curtis said .
“ Now we just have to do the bookkeeping . ”

The gasoline shortage in parts of the Southeast is nationwide news .
Everyone has an opinion :
It 's hurricane Ike .
It 's refineries being off - line .
It 's dumb car owners " topping off . "
It 's gas companies restricting supply .
It 's the media spreading the story .
It 's crowd behavior .
It 's irrational panic .
Robert Prechter answers some questions about the gas shortage .
Q : Is the gas shortage in the Southeast due to recent hurricanes ?
A : No .
There have been a thousand hurricanes , not to mention earthquakes and tornados , over the past hundred years and they do n't tend to cause gasoline shortages .
Q : Are greedy gas companies restricting supply ?
A : If they 're greedy , they 're selling as much as they can .
Q : How about this quote in USA Today ( 9/29 , p.3A ) saying that the panic has been " fueled by media coverage of the shortage " ?
A : If there were no newspapers , radio or TV , drivers would still see the " No Gas " signs all down the highway .
It 's not exactly something you can hide or would want to hide , for that matter .
Q : Is n't " topping off " contributing to the gas shortage ?
A : For a day or two , maybe , but continued topping thereafter uses no more gas than would be used otherwise .
Q : What about other types of hoarding ?
A : Most people do n't have much capacity for hoarding .
Maybe they 've filled up a 10 - gallon gas can .
But that 's a tiny amount compared to overall gas usage .
Hoarding is not a fundamental cause of the gas shortage ; the shortage is the cause of hoarding behavior .
You can prove this point :
If you could somehow stop hoarding , it would not relieve the gas shortage , but if you could relieve the gas shortage , hoarding would stop immediately .
Q : So what 's our problem ?
A : The shortage is due to the disruption of the free market by the state .
Q : You mean such as the EPA 's mandates that distributors can bring only a certain type of gasoline to some of those areas , or the government 's regulations that prevent oil companies from building new refineries ?
A : Both of these decrees reduce available supplies of gas .
But they are insufficient by themselves to cause a shortage .
Q : Does n't reduced supply — scarcity — create shortages ?
A : No .
In a free market , shortages are impossible ; there is only a price .
Rubies and Picassos are scarce , but there 's never a shortage of them .
You can buy all you want any day of the week .
Just pay the price .
Q : So how is the state causing a shortage ?
A : The overriding cause of the shortage in the Southeast is state legislatures ' mandates that anyone selling gasoline at market prices will be labeled a " gouger " and fined $ 10,000 to $ 25,000 .
Q : That 's it ?
That 's the reason ?
A : That 's all there is to it .
Only government can create shortages .
If the price for gasoline had been allowed to fluctuate freely and rise to $ 5 a gallon locally , it would have provided plenty of incentive for truckers to siphon gas from other states and haul it to Georgia , Tennessee , North Carolina and Alabama .
But as it stands , every one of these states has an " anti- gouging " law , and every one of their governors stood up to announce that he would vigorously enforce it .
They may as well have said , " I demand a gas shortage . "
Q : What should they have said instead ?
A : It depends .
If the governors want votes , they should threaten retailers , just as they 've been doing .
But if they want plenty of available gas , they should encourage retailers to sell gas at the highest price they can get .
Q : Would that help the supply and demand pictures ?
A : Yes , both .
On the demand side , high prices for goods and services curb consumption in an orderly way .
If gas were more expensive , some people would postpone that trip to the country club for dinner .
People who really needed gas to get to work or close a $ 50 million real - estate deal in Atlanta would pay the price .
A higher price would also help supply .
People would n't be burning gas waiting a half hour in line to buy it .
And no one would be " topping off . "
On the contrary , people would hoard as little as possible and wait for the price to come back down .
Q : Would the price come down ?
A : Of course .
As wholesalers realized they could make an extra dollar a gallon in Georgia , they would burn rubber hauling gasoline there .
Pretty soon , there would be lots of gas , and the price would drift back down .
Other areas , from which the gas came , would experience a slight rise in the price .
Prices would equalize across states , and there would be no shortage and no outsized high prices .
Q : How long would it take to get ample supplies to the stations ?
A : With a sufficient profit incentive , probably about 48 hours .
Certainly no more than a week .
Q : But do n't some other states with anti-gouging laws have plenty of gas ?
A : Sure .
Suppose you 're a wholesaler stationed in Texas .
You 're not allowed to get any more for your limited supply of gasoline in north Georgia than you can in the Florida panhandle .
Where are you going to ship it ?
To the easiest , closest destination .
Under price controls , gasoline gets allocated not by price but by other market factors — whatever reduces the cost of delivery — so the sellers can maximize profits .
In the severest cases , price controls create a black market .
Q : It seems that gasoline is n't the only shortage .
A : Oh , no .
There 's health care , another area where the state caps prices .
Sometimes the state creates surpluses , such as in housing , where government programs encourage massive mortgage indebtedness .
Either way , it ends up a mess .
Q : You study crowd behavior .
Are n't the public 's recent actions — lining up at the pump , topping off and so on — due to irrational panic ?
A : Not at all .
People have good reason to line up and to hoard , which is that the state has decreed a price below the market rate .
And they have a good reason to fear , too , because when the state controls a price , there is no basis upon which a person can rely on future supplies .
Topping off is simply a rational reaction to disrupted supplies .
So it is incorrect to charge everyday people with thoughtless anxiety in this case .
Q : You attribute many social trends to unconscious herding .
But you 're saying it's not the main factor in this case ?
A : It would be the main factor if people were treating gas as a financial market — speculating on the direction of prices — but the current problem is economic .
If some people can't get to work next week , maybe they can't afford food .
So fears about the gas shortage are inherently individual , not inherently social .
If the government closed all grocery stores but one , you would see huge lines .
But that 's not herding ; it 's politics and economics .
People definitely are receiving information by watching others line up at the pump , but it is accurate information about the availability of gasoline , not uninformed mimicking behavior .
People in Atlanta understand why cars are lined up : there 's a gas shortage .
Q : Well , other people who study human behavior seem to disagree .
I just read in the Atlanta Journal - Constitution ( " Why We Ran out of Gas , " 9/24 ) that a local professor says the panic at the pumps is all just " herd behavior : they see other people afraid and it snowballs . "
He says they 're " sheep . "
A : I see .
Q : He says the clamor for gasoline is simple to fix .
For one thing , all we have to do to is " mandate a minimum of say , 10 gallons . "
A : What does he want government to do ?
Put a policeman at every station to enforce this mandate ?
Jail people who misjudge and buy 8½ gallons ?
Administration would cost way more than simply letting the market function .
And it will function , anyway , ban or no ban : People would start paying retailers to fudge sales receipts , buying gas from the back of a tanker at midnight , bribing the cops , and who knows what else .
Q : He says , " That would prevent topping off . "
A : Right .
Just as drug laws prevent drug use and blue laws prevent prostitution .
Q : He says , " You ban that and the problem will go away . "
A : Bans do not fix problems .
They exacerbate old problems and create new problems .
For example , people down eight gallons would drive around furiously burning up two more gallons so they could top off .
And where did the " 10 gallons " amount come from ?
This sounds like ad hoc political interference , the kind politicians dream up every day .
Q : There 's more .
He suggests we must " have people stand up and socially ostracize people who are topping off . "
A : Get people yelling at each other ?
That 'll bring peace in the valley .
Besides , the idea is inconsistent .
If the herd is topping off due to irrational panic , how is the same herd going to start calmly ostracizing its members ?
Who 's going to begin this movement , anyway ?
Q : Well , according to him , " You need a leader to stand up and say that this is bad behavior , you are being bad citizens . "
A : Public blaming is how McCarthy got started .
I do n't think we need to see leaders who caused the problem bashing people for behavior that their own actions induced .
If our leaders were n't pandering to the crowd , we would n't have a gas shortage to begin with .
Q : Does n't it look like herding when we watch the cars line up ?
A : It sure does .
But appearances can be deceiving .
A specialist must be careful not to attribute every aspect of crowds to one theory of behavior .
Q : Do n't you advocate that in many situations unconscious social mood is fundamentally causal to behavior ?
A : Absolutely .
Under socionomic causality , unconscious social mood trends are a powerful motivator of social behavior , but they pertain only in contexts of uncertainty .
For example , social mood regulates trends in the stock market , macroeconomics , the social environment for peace or war , and trends in fashion and entertainment .
It can even lead to expansions and contractions in supplies of commodities .
But it does n't make the commodities unavailable .
The theory also allows for collective behavior aside from unconscious herding .
Much crowd behavior is nonrational , but some of it is perfectly sensible .
Q : For example ?
A : Such as going to the store when it has a big sale .
Q : How about when fear is a factor ?
A : You mean like leaving the World Trade Center when it was burning to the ground ?
That 's group fear , and it was rational .
If you acted contrarily , you died .
Q : But this professor says that in the case of gas lines , " reality is irrelevant . "
A : Reality is entirely relevant .
Q : So there is a difference between rational fear and nonrational fear ?
A : Exactly .
Q : Some people think the ivory tower is to blame for antimarket thinking .
A : Academia makes room for all kinds of views .
Matt Zwolinski of the University of San Diego has just posted a paper called " The Ethics of Price Gouging , " which is due to be published in Business Ethics Quarterly .
He concludes that so - called gouging — selling at market rates — is practical and serves " morally ethical goals . "
Q : Will the gas shortage go away ?
A : Sure .
It 'll be off the front pages when supplies catch up to the artificially low price or when the market is freed up .
Q : Politicians try to please voters .
Would n't this imply that voters are ultimately at fault for wanting politicians to ban high profits ?
A : Many people are envious of those who receive a windfall .
If a retailer were smart enough or lucky enough to order gasoline before supplies contracted , he might make some extra money .
I 'm perfectly fine with that , but many people can't stand the idea .
So they appeal to politicians to make sure it does n't happen .
These are the same people , by the way , who would not want anyone to get in the way of their seeking a higher income for their labor .
Ironically , by banning so - called excess profits , they insure higher prices later , because the marketplace is n't allowed to communicate to producers the need for more gasoline , pipelines , and refineries .
Q : You sound as if this has happened before .
A : There were price controls on gas in 1973 under Richard " we 're all Keynesians now " Nixon .
The state mandated something called " odd/ even rationing . "
Do n't ask .
I was there , and it was monumentally annoying .
If you want details , Google " 1973 gasoline shortage . "
It happened again in 1979 .
There were caps on " old " and " new " gas , another unnecessary restriction .
There was a " windfall profits " tax .
Carter told us to wear sweaters .
Q : So what 's the solution ?
A : Get out of the way .
Let the market work .

One of the most promising “ save the world ” vehicles is the plug - in hybrid .
Â
Much of the allure of these cars comes from the fact they ’re not borne of some super technology or some untested alternative fuel , but from the fact that at their very core , all they are is essentially a combination of the best features of both electric and gasoline powered cars .
After charging , plug - in hybrids have the ability to run for long periods of time exclusively on batteries , which obviously reduces gasoline consumption and harmful emissions .
Â
They are also able to drive as “ regular ” fuel efficient gas powered cars , so you do n’t have to stop every 200 miles to recharge the car ’s batteries .
For as cool as these cars are , will people actually buy them once they hit the market ?
Â
After all , there have been a countless number of products that consumers thought were neat , but were n’t really interested in purchasing .
So , is it worth it for the reeling auto industry to invest in infrastructure necessary to mass produce these cars ?
Â
According to a recent poll , not only is it worth it for car makers to do so , but it would probably stupid for them not to do so .
When asked , “ Will you consider purchasing a plug - in hybrid when they become widely available ? ” nearly 200 Daily Fuel Economy
Tip readers responded in the following manner :
52 % said yes
19 % said probably
14 % said not sure
10 % said no
5 % said doubtful
Before you leave an angry comment , I do realize these results are slightly skewed due to the fact this poll was conducted on a site frequented by people who are interested in getting the best fuel economy possible .
Â
However , the fact that over 70 % of these respondents showed pretty strong interest in plug - in hybrids says a lot .
In fact , it ’s not just Daily Fuel Economy Tip readers who are sold on the idea of of plug - in hybrids .
Â
For example , part of each Presidential candidate ’s energy policy focuses on getting more plug - in hybrids on the roads through the use of hefty tax credits and business incentives .
Â ( Click here for Barack Obama ’s ideas .
Â Click here for John McCain ’s ideas . )
Additionally , the current administration is about to approve $ 25 billion in low interest loans for the American auto industry in an effort to help them convert truck and SUV plants into facilities which produce smaller , more fuel efficient cars .
Â
Hopefully the Big 3 will take the hint and use much of this money to churn out a bunch of plug - in hybrids .
After all , I ’m pretty sure we can all agree the days of people lining up to buy trucks and SUVs are coming to an end pretty rapidly .
Â
Hopefully the days of people lining up to buy mass produced plug - in hybrids are right around the corner !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Bush administration is poised to withdraw an agreement with Russia on nuclear trade as punishment for Russia 's military action last month against U.S. ally Georgia , a State Department source said Friday .
President Bush and Condoleezza Rice have been critical of Russia 's use of military force against Georgia .
The pact , known as the 123 Agreement , would clear the way for more trade of nuclear goods , along with services and technology , between the United States and Russia .
Both countries had accepted the agreement , but it is awaiting congressional approval .
But as early as next week President Bush could deep - freeze the agreement , withdrawing it from congressional deliberations , the source said .
Russia analyst Jon Wolfsthal at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington noted that the 123 Agreement has been having trouble winning approval on Capitol Hill and said , " I think they are making a virtue out of a necessity .
" It was unlikely Congress was going to approve the agreement this year , " he said .
" It was too tempting a target for the administration not to pull it back . "
In general , Wolfsthal said , the administration needs to move carefully , signaling to Russia that its behavior in Georgia is unacceptable but that cooperation on mutual issues such as Iran and combating terrorism should continue .
" We have to be careful to calibrate our actions , " he said .
The United States is frustrated that Russia is dragging its feet on the Georgia cease - fire agreement brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Watch Russia 's foreign minister discuss the Georgia conflict »
There is also new friction between Washington and Moscow over U.S. emergency aid shipments to Georgia .
That heat was seen again Friday when the Russians protested against a top - of - the - line U.S. warship coming into the Georgian port of Poti , where Russian forces are still stationed .
The ship , the USS Mount Whitney , is the Navy 's only Joint Command Ship and is considered to be the most sophisticated ship ever commissioned in terms of communication , control , command , computers and intelligence capabilities , according to the Navy 's Web site .
State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood brushed off the Russian accusation that the U.S. warship was bringing in arms .
" The USS Mount Whitney has arrived in Poti , " Wood said at his midday briefing .
" It 's bringing humanitarian supplies such as , I believe , 4,000 blankets , juice , diapers , hygiene products .
There 's absolutely no foundation to this Russian charge . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been vague about how the United States could signal its displeasure with Moscow without ratcheting up tensions too far .
Again Friday she said the United States and Europe find it extraordinary that Russia is refusing to live up to its cease - fire obligations .
" I am quite certain that Russia will understand that it is deepening its isolation and that it will have no way out unless it honors its commitments and unless it begins to change its behavior , " Rice said in Portugal on her way to North Africa .
" I 'm also confident , by the way , that the Russians are beginning to understand that there are costs to this kind of behavior , in rallying the world against this kind of behavior . "
On August 25 , asked specifically about the 123 Agreement with Russia , she would only say , " we 're going to continue to review what we will do about the various elements of the relationship with Russia . "
The " 123 " refers to the section of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 about what the United States must do before it can engage other countries in commercial nuclear activities .
Meanwhile , the United States continues to work through a similar civilian nuclear agreement with India .
A 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group has been meeting in Austria over whether to clear the way for the United States to sell India nuclear material and technology for civilian use .
Before she left for North Africa , Rice held a formal announcement ceremony of a $ 1 billion aid package for Georgia , the latest signal that the U.S. would stand by its ally and stand up to Russia .

Several hours before the brunt of Hurricane Ike was to arrive , fire destroys homes along the beach on Galveston Island , Texas on Friday , Sept. 12 , 2008 .
Update : The Latest News of Ike's Impact
Image Gallery : Ike's Fury
As Hurricane Ike pummels the Texas coast , the only thing standing in the way is a thin stretch of land called Galveston .
Galveston is a barrier island , a narrow landmass made mostly of sand that extends along a coastline parallel to the land .
These islands , common along the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States , are some of the most fragile and changing landforms on Earth .
And they are particularly vulnerable to storms .
" Barrier islands are exposed to the open ocean , and the waves and storm surges generated by hurricanes , " said Bob Morton , a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey 's Center for Coastal and Watershed Studies in St. Petersburg , Fla .
" As a storm makes landfall they 're the ones that are going to receive the strongest winds and the highest wave actions . "
National Hurricane Center officials have warned residents of Galveston to evacuate or else face " certain death , " though several thousand are thought to be staying put .
Wisdom questioned
Barrier islands like Galveston are particularly vulnerable to storm damage because they are made of sand , as opposed to the hard bedrock that underlies larger islands and the mainland .
They also tend to have very low elevations , making it easy for water to wash over and submerge the island .
Many have questioned the wisdom of choosing to build on and develop barrier islands , given their risks .
" Every year there 's reporting on the foolishness of building on barrier islands , but people are going to do it anyway , " Morton told LiveScience .
" We do n't learn from the past .
If you look at the barrier islands on the Mississippi coast in particular , after both Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Katrina , what did they do ?
They rebuilt .
It 's a perfect example of a coastal area that did get hit as bad as it can get , and they just go back and rebuild . "
Barrier islands tend to be even riskier places to live than coastal areas , because they bear the brunt of any approaching storm impact .
" If you think about their location , they 're basically lonely sentinels that serve as barriers for the mainland , " said Clark Alexander , a marine geologist at Georgia 's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography .
" Basically you 're in a vulnerable spot , because you 're located where you get the first effects of anything coming in off the ocean . "
Setting up residence in these vulnerable spots is particularly perilous .
" From a safety standpoint , it 's silly , " Alexander said .
" Because the lifespan of a typical house is something like 60 years .
But if you live on a barrier island , you can't guarantee you 'll have land under your house in 60 years .
It 's trying to put something permanent in a place that ’s very dynamic . "
As a result of Hurricane Katrina , a number of barrier islands off the Mississippi coast were completely wiped off the map .
Even when storms are n't enough to raze islands completely , barriers often suffer severe damage from storms .
The 1989 Hurricane Hugo wreaked massive havoc on Pawleys Island in South Carolina .
Isles Dernieres off the coast of Louisiana was devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 .
Often , after these storms , people move back and set themselves up for disaster again .
St. George Island on Apalachicola Bay off the Florida coast " has been washed away five or six or eight times and people just keep building back their houses , " Alexander said .
For many people living on barrier islands , there is no amount of structural support that can ward off the worst .
" It 's important to note that in the big storms , the category 4 or 5 hurricanes , it really does n't matter how well - constructed your building is , " said Orrin Pilkey , a professor emeritus of geology at Duke University , of homes on barrier islands .
" And it does n't matter whether you have a seawall or not .
The chances are pretty good that if you have beachfront property , it 's history . "
Outlook for Galveston
Though Ike might not completely destroy Galveston Island , it could inflict major damage .
Already Friday afternoon , the island was being pounded by high waves and flooding .
How much depends on how the hurricane develops and what part of the island the eye of the storm passes over .
The eastern part of Galveston Island ( also the more densely inhabited ) has a strong 18 - foot sea wall in place to deflect some of the incoming waves , so it should be more protected than the western half , depending on the extent to which the storm surge overtops the wall .
Galveston was hit hard by Hurricane Alicia in 1983 , and was devastated by the " Great Storm " of 1900 , when thousands died .
After that disaster , a major effort went into fortifying the island against future storms .
" They went in and literally raised the city , propped up houses on stilts , " Morton said .
" They brought a huge dredge in from Europe and dredged up material and pumped it into the land to build it up .
It was an amazing engineering feat for the time .
No other place has done something like that . "
The city also erected a seawall .
Constantly changing
Other well - known U.S. barrier islands include the Outer Banks of North Carolina , the islands along the Eastern Shore of Virginia , and even New York 's Long Island ( though Long Island 's northern position makes it less vulnerable to storms than barriers in the Gulf of Mexico and southern Atlantic coast ) .
The ultimate fate of barrier islands varies , with many gradually retreating landward as eroded sand is pushed back to deposit in the lagoon behind it , and ultimately joining the coast .
But some barrier islands with high dunes can avoid this fate .
Galveston is not yet migrating toward the coast , but is in what Morton calls a " narrowing stage , " with sand on both sides of the island gradually eroding away .
Many barrier islands wax and wane , with sand shifting around and sometimes reducing the land area , but most inhabited barriers are not at risk of being completely destroyed .
" Barrier islands are constantly changing , " Morton said .
" The barrier islands as a whole are some of the most dynamic landforms on the surface of the Earth . "

Helio Castroneves Indicted by Miami Federal Grand Jury
33 , may have danced his way into the hearts of America on Dancing with the Stars , but he 'll be doing a different dance tomorrow when he appears for his arraignment in Miami .
He has been charged with conspiracy and six counts of tax evasion from 1999 - 2004 .
The maximum penalty is 35 years in prison if he is convicted .
The U.S. Attorney 's Office has accused Castroneves of siphoning millions of dollars to offshore companies .
He reportedly diverted income from a sponsorship deal as well as his contract income as a driver for Penski Racing .
He and his sister are also accused of filing false income tax returns .
The famed Brazilian race car driver is a member of Team Penske and has reportedly failed to pay more than $ 5 million in taxes over a four year period .
Not an oversight to be sure - he allegedly schemed with his 35 year old sister Katiucia ' Kati ' Castroneves , who serves as his business manager , and his 71 year old attorney Alan Miller .
Castroneves has a mansion in Coral Gables , Florida .
The three defendants will surrender to authorities and will make their initial appearance in front of a Miami judge on Friday in federal court .
Helio Castroneves won the Indianapolis 500 in both 2001 and 2002 and finished second in 2003 .
In the IndyCar Series this year , Castroneves won the Sonoma Grand Prix in late August and has finished in second spot seven times .
He is poised to win the 2008 IndyCar Series driver championship on points - just 30 points separate Helio and Scott Dixon .
It would be his first points title .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The New York attorney general ’s office is issuing subpoenas to several Bank of America Corp executives as the state broadens its probe into the bank ’s marketing of auction - rate securities , a person familiar with the investigation said on Wednesday .

Despite recent market chatter that Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the bank were nearing a settlement , New York officials intend to continue their probe after initial efforts raised new questions .
According to the source , Cuomo ’s office wanted to speak with “ several ” bank officials to learn more about Bank of America ’s handling of auction rates .
Subpoenas will be sent out late on Wednesday or Thursday , the source said .
By targeting individuals , Cuomo ’s office is turning the heat up on BofA , one of several banks under investigation as Cuomo and other states pursue a sweeping probe of how Wall Street marketed auction - rate debt to small and institutional investors .
Auction rates are debt instruments issued by funds or municipalities which for years were widely marketed as liquid , cash - equivalents .
Yet it has been nearly impossible to cash out of them since auctions for the instruments broke down in January , at which point $ 330 billion were outstanding .
Tens of thousands of investors have been unable to sell the securities at weekly or monthly auctions .
In recent weeks , several leading auction - rate underwriters and distributors settled with Cuomo , agreeing to quickly repurchase about $ 50 billion of the debt from their customers .
BofA , with sizeable investment banking and brokerage arms , is one of several banks still under scrutiny by New York , the SEC and other states .
A spokesman for Cuomo could not be reached immediately for comment .
Charlotte , North Carolina - based Bank of America declined to comment on whether it received subpoenas .
In a written statement , the bank said it “ continues to cooperate with regulators and our focus remains on serving our clients .
We fully recognize the impact this is having on some of our clients and we are committed to working with those clients during this difficult period . ”
In related news on Wednesday , Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin threatened legal action against BofA , noting his office has been unable to complete a settlement after negotiating with the nationwide commercial bank .
Last month UBS AG , Citigroup Inc , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase & Co , Wachovia Corp , Merrill Lynch & Co Inc , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Deutsche Bank AG all settled allegations that they fraudulently sold the long - dated securities as cash - like even as underwriters saw market demand was waning .
" Gentlemen , I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country .
When you won , you divided the profits amongst you , and when you lost , you charged it to the bank .
You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter , I shall ruin ten thousand families .
That may be true , gentlemen , but that is your sin !
Should I let you go on , you will ruin fifty thousand families , and that would be my sin !
You are a den of vipers and thieves . "

One of the most chilling things I ’ve ever read was a description of the dual crisis that farmers and the urban poor faced during the Great Depression .
During the period , the ability of the poor to pay for food dropped like a stone .
At the same time , farmers could n’t afford to transport food to markets .
While there was more than enough food produced in the US during the whole of the Depression millions went hungry , and a surprisingly large number actually starved .
Consider this testimony given by Oscar Ameringer before Congress in 1932 .
“ During the last three months I have visited … some 20 states … .
In the state of Washington I was told that the forest fires raging in that region all summer and fall were caused by unemployed timber workers and bankrupt vfarmers in an endeavor to earn a few honest dollars as firefighters .
The last thing I saw on the night I left Seattle was number sof women searching for scraps of food in the refuse piles of the principal markets of that scity .
A number of Montana citizens told me of thousands of bushels of wheat left in the fields uncut on account of its low price that hardly paid for the harvesting .
In Oregon I saw thousands of bushels of apples rotting in the orchards because of the cost of transporting them to market .
… At the same time there are millions of children who , on account of the poverty of their parents , will not eat one apple this winter .
While I was in Oregon , the Portland Oregonian bemoaned the fact that thousands of ewes were killed by sheep raisers because they did not bring enough in the market to pay the freight on them .
And while Oregon sheep raisers fed mutton to the buzzards , I saw men picking for meat scraps in the garbage cans of New York and Chicago .
I talked to one man in a restaurant in Chicago .
He told me of his experience in raising sheep .
He said he had killed 3,000 sheep this fall and thrown them down the canyon , because ti cost $ 1.10 to ship a sheep to market and then he would get less than a dollar for it .
He said he could not afford to feed the sheep and he would not let them starve , so he just cut their throats and threw them in the canyon .
The roads of the West and Southwest teem with hungry hitchhikers .
The camp fires of the homeless are seen along every railroad track .
I saw men , women and children walking voer the hard roads .
Most of them were tenant farmers who had lost their land and been foreclosed .
Between Clarksville and Russellville , Ark. , I picked up a family .
The woman was hugging a dead chicken under her ragged coat .
When I asked her where she had procured the fowl , first she told me she had found it dead in the road , and then added in grim humor , ‘ They promised me a chicken in every pot , and now I got mine . ’
In Oklahoma , Texas and Arkansas I saw untold bales of cotton rotting in the fields because the cotton pickers could not keep body and soul together on 35 cents for picking 100 lbs .
The farmers cooperatives who loaned the money to make the crop require $ 5 a bale in payment .
That means 70 cents a day for a picker who can pick 200 lbs , and that does n’t provide enough pork and beans to keep the picker alive in the field , so that there is fine staple cotton rotting down there by the hundreds and thousands of tons .
AS a result of this appalling overproduction on one side and the staggering underconsumption on the other side , 70 percent of the farmesr of Oklahoma were unable to pay the itnerests on their mortgages .
Last week one of the largest and oldest mortgage companies in that state went into the hands of the reciever .
In that and other stateswe have now the interesting spectacle of farmers losing their farms by foreclosure and mortgage companies losing thier recouped holdings by tax sales that could never meet the value of the land .
The farmers are being pauperized by the poverty of the industrial population and the industrial population is being pauperized by the poverty of the farmers .
Neither has the money to buy the product of the other . ”
( David Shannon , _ The Great Depression_ 26 - 28 )
One of my greatest fears is that the story is about to be repeated .
Right now , farmers are struggling to get credit just like all small business owners .
The wheat crop is being planted right now – and next year ’s food depends on this year ’s credit .
High energy and fertilizer prices have already eaten up much of farmer ’s profit for this year – the point at which it is no longer feasible for farmers to grow our food is not so very far away , nor is it really so alien to imagine that again we might see the failure of the linkage between city and country , the poor digging in the garbage , the farmer unable to plant , unable to keep their land , or throwing food out to rot .
What ’s the answer ?
Food has to enter the center of our discourse in a meaningful way – we cannot allow wall street to starve main street .
More of us need to grow food , but more importantly , we will need to create direct ties between country and city , so that farmers and urban dwellers can skip middlemen who add costs and lower payments , and get what they really need .

Adelson Cerqueira Silva , of the federal environmental agency , said about 300 penguins have been found dead or alive in recent days along the coast of Bahia state , better known for sunbathers in bikinis than for seabirds native to Antarctica and Patagonia .
The state capital , Salvador , is roughly 600 miles closer to the equator than Miami is and temperatures in the current Southern Hemisphere winter are in the mid-70s ( low 20s centigrade ) .
" This is unheard of .
There have even been reports of penguins washing up as far as Aracaju , " Mr Silva said , referring to a beachside state capital even closer to the equator .
He said biologists believe stronger - than - usual ocean currents have pulled the birds north .
Others have suggested the increase might be due to overfishing near Patagonia and Antarctica which has forced the penguins to swim further in search of food .
Mr Silva said the environmental authority was receiving hundreds of phone calls reporting penguin sightings .
" We 're telling people if the penguins do n't appear to be injured or sick to leave them alone so they can swim back , " he said .
While penguins commonly wash up as far north as Rio de Janeiro state in July and August - hundreds have done so this year - Bahia is roughly 750 miles north - east of Rio .
P Dee Boersma , a conservation biologist at the University of Washington who works with penguins in Argentina , said that while she has heard of penguins occasionally washing up as far north as Bahia , the numbers washing up this year are extremely high .
" The last time that you got a lot of penguins was in 2000 , mostly in Rio but some further north .
That year the sea surface temperature was a degree lower than the 30 - year average so the penguins just keep swimming in search of food without noticing where they 're going , " she said .
SHANGHAI  Some of the world ’s biggest corporations are facing intense pressure from China to allow the state - approved union to form in their Chinese plants and offices .
But many companies fear admitting the unions will give their Chinese employees the power to slow or disrupt their operations and will significantly increase the cost of doing business here .
The companies , many of which moved to China to lower manufacturing costs and some to avoid unions in their home countries as well , are now being asked to meet a Sept. 30 deadline to make their offices and factories union shops .
Companies that do not comply risk being publicly vilified or blacklisted by the union , and perhaps penalized by the government , since businesses are required by law to allow unions to form .
Lawyers and analysts say that demands of the All China Federation of Trade Unions , the only union the Communist Party allows , could sharply alter business practices of foreign companies in China , including giving lower - level workers the power to bargain over anything from pay raises to whether a Chinese headquarters should be moved elsewhere in the country .

Advertisement A superweed spreading throughout the UK could be brought under control by introducing plant - eating predators from Japan , scientists believe .
Japanese knotweed was first introduced as an ornamental plant , but has since plagued the environment ; removal is costly and time consuming .
Now a team has identified natural predators from its native home that could also control it in the UK .
The plans have been submitted to the government for approval .
If the proposal gets the go - ahead , it will be the first time that biocontrol - the use of a natural enemy to control another pest - will be used in Europe to fight a weed .
All this week , BBC News will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the UK .
Appetite for knotweed
This year has been particularly bad for knotweed spread in the UK .
The nymphs are literally sucking the life out of the plant .
Dr Shaw , Cabi James MacFarlane , vegetation adviser for Cornwall County Council , said : " The weather patterns have ended up with us seeing a lot of knotweed spread in a number of areas . "
In Japan , the original home of knotweed , the plant is common but it does not rage out of control like in the UK .
Dick Shaw , the lead researcher on the project , from Cabi , a not - for - profit agricultural research organisation , said : " In 2000 , we went out to Japan to see whether the plant had any natural enemies that it had lost when it came here .
" We found that it had a lot : there were 186 species of plant - eating insects and about 40 species of fungi . "
The team then began to test the predators to find those that only had an appetite for Japanese knotweed - and not any other plants .
The researchers tempted them with plant species that were very closely related to knotweed , less closely related species that belonged to the same tribe or family , and important UK plants such as apples and wheat .
A leaf sport fungus only has an appetite for knotweed Those that attacked any plants other than Japanese knotweed were ruled out , explained Dr Shaw .
Eventually , the list was whittled down to two : a sap - sucking psyllid insect ( Aphalara itadori ) and a leaf spot fungus from the genus Mycosphaerella .
Dr Shaw told the BBC : " We have done some efficacy trials here in the lab and they are showing a significant impact . "

Advertisement Successful biocontrols do not eradicate the target weed - this would mean wiping out their only food source and effectively making themselves extinct - but they do bring them under control .
Dr Shaw said : " The psyllids are having an effect on the plants ' height and the treated knotweeds produce tiny curled leaves rather than big light absorbing leaves , which means that less resources will get to their root system .
" The nymphs are literally sucking the life out of the plant , " he added .
Phenomenal growth Japanese knotweed , like many other non-native , invasive plants , was first introduced to the UK for horticulture .
Its 3 - 4 m - tall ( 10 - 13 ft ) stems , ornamental leaves and clusters of white flowers made it an attractive option for gardens .
Simon Ford , a nature conservation adviser from the National Trust , said : " Japanese knotweed first came into the UK in 1840 through Wales - but it was only about 10 to 15 years later that people started to see it as a threat . "
The plants grow incredibly quickly - some have been shown to grow four metres in just four months , they can spread at a tremendous rate , and they can quickly obliterate any other vegetation growing nearby .
Mr Ford said : " By the time they realised this it was already far too late . "
Today , Japanese knotweed is prevalent throughout the UK .
It has not only caused great damage to plant biodiversity but it is also causing problems for hard structures , including buildings , paving stones and flood defence structures .
Is there an alien in your garden ?
Alien invasion hits the UK
It has been estimated that to remove all knotweed from the UK would cost several billion pounds .
Cabi scientists believe that natural control could offer a much simpler solution .
The project has cost about £ 600,000 over five years .
Dr Shaw said : " In comparison to the current control methods , if it works , this will be significantly less costly . "
The team has submitted its proposals to the government .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) along with independent peer reviewers will assess the work before it is submitted for a public consultation .
HAVE YOUR SAY
What is more alarming is the idea of introducing an insect into the wild to eat the J.K. Weed James Paul , United Kingdom Dr Shaw said : " We do not know if this is going to be the silver bullet for knotweed , but if we were able to just stop the thing spreading at the rate it currently is , or make it easier to kill , I will be very happy . "
The research project has been paid for by a consortium of UK sponsors including Defra , the Environment Agency , the Welsh Assembly Government , Network Rail , South West Regional Development Agency and British Waterways , coordinated by Cornwall County Council .

A red -haired family claims to have been driven from their Newcastle home because of abuse .
Why is the harassment of redheads dismissed as just harmless fun ?
Here 's a joke .
" What 's the difference between a terrorist and a redhead ? "
Here 's the punchline .
" You can negotiate with a terrorist . "
I was on the Tube , pregnant , and I was really humiliated by this drunk yob
Red - haired photographer Charlotte Rushton
Is this offensive ?
If it was made in your workplace , within hearing of a redheaded colleague , would you make a fuss ?
Probably not .
But mock someone 's ethnicity , religion or sexuality and you will attract the beady eye of management .
Make a sexist joke and prepare to be dismissed as an antediluvian relic .
Verbal abuse Carrot - top , copper - top , ginger - nut , ginger minger , bluey ( among Australians ) , Duracell , Ronald McDonald , Simply Red , Queen Elizabeth .
And so on for hours and hours of the typical redhead 's life .
No wonder some gloss over their hair colour as " auburn " and " strawberry blonde " and even " titian " .
Photographer Charlotte Rushton has been chronicling the UK's redheads for a book , Ginger Snaps .
Of the 300 she snapped , only two have been spared bullying because of their hair .
She herself has suffered verbal abuse from complete strangers .
LEGENDARY REDHEADS King David Queen Boudicca Pharaoh Ramses II Henry VIII and his daughter Elizabeth I Sir Winston Churchill " I was on the Tube , pregnant , and I was really humiliated by this drunk yob .
He was shouting ' do the cuffs and the collars match ? '
He got right up into my face .
You do n't do that to other people . "
She believes the phenomenon is long - standing and uniquely British in its most virulent form .
" In other countries redheads will get teased at school but it stops when they become adults .
If you are a woman you are fiery and alluring , beautiful . "
In adult life , women get stereotyped and red - haired men take much of the worst abuse .
Treatment of red - haired children in school ranges from mild taunts to grim persecution .
Michele Eliot , the American director of British children 's charity Kidscape , regularly has significant numbers of red - haired children in courses on coping with bullying .
Children face a tough time at school ( Pic : Charlotte Rushton )
" There is nothing like this in the US where having red hair is not a precursor to having someone abuse you .
Red hair is considered glamorous . "
Bullies at school and in later life may sense that ill - treatment of the red - haired will not be treated as seriously by the authorities as persecution of other groups .
" Bullies think that person is outside the norm , they will be able to attack them .
The bullies find something to pick on .
The bully has a problem and needs a victim , " Ms Eliot says .
Racism row
While there has been at least one report of a serious anti-red hair hate crime in the UK - a 20 - year - old stabbed in the back in 2003 - it 's unclear whose responsibility it is to monitor discrimination .
RED HAIR ROOTS
Caused by mutated MC1R gene Most prevalent in far northern and western Europe May have survived due to increased vitamin D production in pale - skinned ' Sexual selection ' also possible Disagreement over redheads ' reputed higher pain tolerance " It is certainly not us , " says the Commission for Racial Equality .
Conservative backbencher Patrick Mercer , when recently sacked for alleged racism , sought to get himself out of a hole by comparing treatment of black soldiers to those with red hair .
" That 's the way it is in the Army .
If someone is slow on the assault course , you 'd get people shouting : ' Come on you fat bastard , come on you ginger bastard , come on you black bastard . ' "
One of these three epithets would now be regarded as totally unacceptable , and possibly against the law .
Even the first , mocking someone 's weight , is under a sustained assault from feminists and those concerned about what society 's treatment of weight issues does to vulnerable teenagers .
But the abuse can be far from innocuous .
" We talk about kicking racism out of sport but this is just as bad in its way , " said Reading striker Dave Kitson in 2005 .
He can't have been delighted when the Daily Star reported his remarks under the headline " Kitson 's a right ginger whinger " .
Or when players ' association chief Gordon Taylor said : " It belittles racism to compare the two issues . "
RED HAIR MYTHOLOGY
Redheads sacrificed in ancient Egypt Associated with witches and vampires in Europe Reputed to bleed more Mary Magdalene , Adam , Judas and even Jesus depicted as redheads Journalist Sharon Jaffa - also a red - head - says society must stop its ginger - baiting .
" Growing up as a redhead I was lucky enough to escape with just the occasional name - calling - having the surname Jaffa was no doubt a double - whammy .
But attacking someone on the basis of their hair colour can be every bit as damaging as persecuting someone for their race or religion , and therefore , in some cases , needs to be taken just as seriously . "
Red hair has great cultural resonance .
Red is the colour of heat , danger and warnings .
When applied to women , it is the colour of sensuousness , fiery temperament and emotional instability .
" Lilith [ Adam 's lover ] was a redhead .
It indicates red hair was bad .
Shakespeare made all his most menacing characters wear red wigs .
That seeps into culture , " Ms Rushton says .
Stress release
So when does this date from ?
Some claim it could be a throwback to anti-Irish sentiment from the 19th Century and before when the Irish , with a greater prevalence of red hair , were regarded as ethnically inferior .
Anecdotally at least , males get more abuse than females Patrick O'Sullivan , head of the Irish Diaspora Research Unit , says he has never come across a link .
" People could feel forbidden to attack their usual victims and are searching around for ones that have not yet achieved the protection of the law . "
Professor Larry Ray , a sociologist at the University of Kent and an expert on racial discrimination , says the perpetrators could be habitual bullies .
" If they are engaging in one kind of harassment they are engaging in others .
They are looking for targets . "
For those who claim their workplace taunts are just harmless banter , it could be stress rather than an anthropological aversion to red hair .
Workplace psychologist Professor Cary Cooper , of Lancaster University , says abuse can be " an unhealthy release valve for stress " and redheads , as a visible minority not protected by law , have become a target .
While other forms of the discrimination are the subject of marches , lobbying and education campaigns , redheads cannot expect the arrival of the politically correct cavalry anytime soon .
Below is a selection of your comments .
The only time the colour of my hair was referred to was by my art teacher at school who would call me carrot top .
Personally I just thought that he was ridiculous , as carrot tops are green not red .
Helen , Milton Keynes Redheads are feared because they are believed in folklore to be the devil 's children and have red hair because they were conceived during their mother 's menstruation .
A welsh proverb says " os bydd goch , fe fydd gythreulig " or " if he 's redhaired then he is of the devil " .
Yesterday 's superstition has become today 's teasing .
L , Wales
Well clearly it 's wrong to be prejudiced againt a person because of their hair colour .
Just as it's wrong to persecute someone for any other reason - because they 're fat , or wear glasses , or support Man United , or work in McDonalds , or have bad skin , or listen to Daniel Bedingfield , or play in a ' drum circle ' ...
But it 's also ' funny ' , just as mocking Welsh people is funny .
Racism is something completely different , historically and socially .
The whole argument is complete twaddle .
Katy , Yorkshire I oppose " bluey " being included as some of a red - head 's taunts .
In Australia , this is n't a prejudiced comment , it is a term of endearment .
As an Australian living in London , I do not comprehend the prejudice surrounding red-head's .
A red -head woman is considered beautiful down under !
Laurel , London I think red haired men are gorgeous and sexy !
If we only had more where we live ... export them to the south of Europe , we would welcome them all !
Vina , Lisbon I did not ( could not ) understand the joke in the article so it was neither funny nor sad , but to all you redheads the world over , I think you are blessed .
I am a black woman and you cannot even begin to understand the silly ' jokes ' I have to put up with based on my race and my accent .
And I think I am blessed .
All others are just ' ordinary ' .
Katherine , London Being one of red - haired identical twins , my sister and I were forever being teased at school .
There were howls of laughter when we said we did not have red hair but were were " strawberry blonde " .
For a time it may have affected us but now in our 50s we realise how lucky we are , hardly any grey hairs and very healthy manes of hair to the envy of much younger females .
Jennifer Nasser , Heathfield , East Sussex I grew up in London .
I had red hair - auburn really ( before it went grey ) - my mother was always trying to emulate it from a bottle of dye , but no success .
Sometimes I was called ' ginger ' - but it was not said aggressively or unkindly , it was just a title .
Then in 1969 , I went to work in Italy and some of my colleaugues called me ' rosso ' - they all had black or dark brown hair .
They used it as a term of affection , not as an insult .
I find it strange that anyone should be abused for the colour of their hair .
Perhaps the best defence is simply to shrug and respond , ' So what !'.
Donald Morrison , Lochgilphead , Scotland Ahem ... would I be the only bloke to confess to having a fancy for long , red , curly hair .
Gorgeous .
Brian , Ipswich I grew up in Malta where ginger hair is put in the same bracket as blonde , both considered rare and desirable as being different from the more prevalent Mediterranean dark .
I did n't understand the British attitude towards red -heads when I first moved here and I still do n't .... and now I 've married a red - head rugby - player type , I defy anyone to insult him to his face !
Fiona Scerri-Headley , London , UK
The redhead thing does not happen in the US .
I have red hair and never got teased .
I spent years getting tormented for a physical disability .
The monsters at Oley Valley School District would definitely have mentioned my hair too if that was a normal thing in the US .
Barb , Philadelphia , USA
In primary school I would tell boys my red hair was actually gold , and if they married me they would be rich forever !
Boys ( although 5 years old ! ) fell for it !
As soon as I got a little bit older , the bullying started .
I have been spat at , as well as physically and verbally abused in the street because of the colour of my hair .
Abuse is abuse , whether sexist , racist , because of the colour of someones skin or because of the colour of someones hair , and abuse should never be tolerated .
Hannah Smith , High Wycombe
I 'm a blonde woman and believe it or not a day does n't go by when I have to contend with " dumb blonde " jokes either by the media or at work .
It is seen as very amusing to call blonde people , particularly women I hasten to add , unintelligent , bimbos and clumsy .
Where did that image come from ?
I 'll tell you where , the media again !
Another negative fictional image they have decided to use over and over again .
I do n't exactly feel that it has often been a personal vendetta against me but it does n't half annoy me when I feel I 'm fairly intelligent and deep - thinking most of the time !
Grow up Great Britain .
Adele , Birmingham
Last year I took my eleven year - old daughter Georgia to the naval base in Portsmouth where we took a guided tour of a submarine .
Unfortunately the guide was a bit of an old sea dog and kept on referring to my daughter as ginger .
I could see that she was embarrassed and I was embarrassed for her .
However , we both felt even sorrier for the German visitors who were rudely dismissed by the same man .
Being " folicularly challenged " , I would laugh at being called " baldy " , but times have chnaged to such a ridiculous level due to political correctness , that kids just can't do anything without being challenged or corrected !
Peter Moore , Basingstoke , Hampshire , England Tristan from Chatham - I do n't know what the origin of the ' South Park ' episode was , but as an American , I can assert that what the article stated about the lack of prejudice against people with red hair in the US is correct .
' Ginger ' is not a term used there to describe redheads , so perhaps Trey Parker ( the writer ) is familiar with the bias here .
No doubt American kids are teased for having red hair , but no more so than any other kids are teased for anything else ( name , size , glasses , etc ) .
I was very surprised when I moved to England to find that having red hair would make anyone subject to taunts and discrimination .
It is equally as absurd as all other forms of prejudice , which expose the insecurity , meanness and stupidity of those who are guilty of harboring them .
CP , London , UK I am honestly shocked that such idiocy prevails in a country normally so reasonable .
There is a line between teasing and harassment , and the British evidently cross it .
In the States we often tell blond jokes , but I 've never heard of a blond actually being offended , much less changing their address .
Peter , Seattle , USA
As the proud bearer of a mighty crop of red hair , I should like to remind the mousey coloured masses that on the two occasions during the last 500 years that this country was most in peril , redheads , namely Elizabeth I and Winston Churchill stepped up and met the challenge , of the Spanish Armada and the Nazis respectively .
So enjoy your japes and easy insults if you will , but remember that fact the next time a redhead saves the nations 's collective skin !
Gavin Happe , Ilford , Essex I 'm a 25 year old ginger female and I am amazed that grown men still feel compelled to shout ¿ Ginger ¿ at me , usually from the safety of a passing white van .
But its not all bad , sometimes they can even be flattering .
I¿ve had my fair share of teasing - the references to different bodily parts are unacceptable but you deal with it .
Claire , Manchester I cannot begin to describe , as a redhead , just how offensive I find the term " ginger " .
Yet I 've heard colleagues and friends use it freely in conversation in reference to a redheaded individual or even direct to my face without batting an eyelid .
Maybe they do n't realise that years of verbal , and occasionally physical , abuse can be recalled in an instant with the utterance of that one word .
I have long felt that such a term should be treated with the same seriousness as those used negatively to describe someone 's ethnicity , race , etc .
I also have to add that I 've lost count of the number of times I 've had the same comment as Charlotte Rushton had on the tube .
What 's even worse is when the people around actually smile as though the stupid oaf in question had made some intellectually witty comment .
If I say anything in response , to this or any other redheaded insult , I clearly can't take " a joke . "
However , I would n't change my colouring for anything .
It is a part of me and my identity and I love its natural uniqueness .
Jo Hobbs , Leicester , UK I speak as the proud fiancee of a gorgeous red -haired man .
My " type " has always been those of a red haired persuasion and I have never encountered any blatent rudeness about any of my boyfriends , although I have been questioned by friends about what I find so attractive .
Sadly as we begin to discuss starting a family the same friends are counselling against our procreation lest we produce " ginger babies " .
Claire Knowles , Truro , Cornwall I was surprised and angry when I heard seemingly intelligent people objecting to Patrick Mercer 's comments on the radio and TV implying that there was no comparison with calling someone a black bastard and a ginger bastard - that somehow a racial slur was a sacking offence whereas the other was not worthy of consideration .
Personaly although I agree with Patrick Mercer that the army and real life is n't perfect I think that bullying is wrong whatever colour , race or orientation you are .
Certainly I have thoughtlessly used deprecating words to describe red haired people in the past - I shall on reflection try to do better in the future in case I cause them any personal angst .
Jamie Taylor , Soho , London People get teased for all sorts of reasons ( too skinny , bald , fat , accent , etc. ) .
Racism is particularly requgnant because of it's historical resonance .
This kind of teasing is a different matter entirely .
Attacking people verbally is out of order on whatever grounds , but let 's not make more and more special cases .
Jonny , Glasgow
My ex-husband 's hair is pure ginger .
He has the notorious freckles , the lot !
No one else in his family ( alive ) has ginger hair .
His dad used to tease him when he was a kid , to build up his resistance to the teasing that is dad knew he was going to get once he started school .
My ex husband said that when he started school , he had heard all the names that were called him and even dared them to try and come up with some new ones !
He took it in his stride and as an adult , he still gets the odd comment , but all in the fun of the moment .
Steph , Coventry , England I 'de like to know where and when the term ' ginger ' became associated with people with red hair .
The root ginger is beige , at the most yellow .
How does this resemble red hair in any way ?
rufus flack , england I 'm a redhead , of the auburn persuasion , and believe me , if someone taunts me about my colouring , they 'll soon find out why redheads are reputed to have fiery tempers .
I realised when I was still at school that that was the only way to deal with bullies - and it worked .
And continues to work .
It 's time more redheads did the same - stop cringing and start standing up for yourselves !
Red and Proud !
Annia , UK Surely racism is evil because it's a form of prejudice .
It isolates an individual or group from the rest of society whether they are Asian , black , Jewish .
But to do the same because that person is overweight , has red hair , has large nose etc is no less cruel .
The emphasis should not be on racism , Islamophobia or whatever .
All prejudice should be outlawed .
Mark , Liverpool
As a child growing up I would often get into fights at school .
My brothers who did n't have red hair , never did .
I was constantly mocked infront of teachers and they did nothing .
Bullying is bullying whether it is due to race , weight , height , wearing glasses , sex , sexually orientation or hair colour .
Its just okay to do it because of hair colour .
Ian Watt , London
As a white redhead , I would agree that racism is different from " gingerism " - redheads have not suffered centuries of systematic abuse ranging from slavery to institutional racism .
Abuse of redheads is usually personal and does not , for example , affect our life or job prospects .
However , I would say that I have experienced abuse ( although not so much as an adult ) and I was mightily relieved that none of my children have turned out to have red hair and so they will not have to suffer similar abuse .
Rachel Pearce , Matlock , England I have long red hair and the guys at work constantly pickup on this fact , but mention someone from a different race with black or brown skin colour and they clam up and get hideously embarressed that someone would dare even mention something along those lines .
Its complete double standards and although it does n't get to me personally it must be classed as being just as bad as " racism " if not another form of it .
Paul May , Southampton England Gingerism is not the same as racism !!
To prejudice against someone on the basis of their skin colour / race depicts a far more dangerous hatred .
Somehow i do n't think ' ginger nut ' is exactly in the same league as some of the more ' colourful ' lingo directed at most non-whites , in their daily lives .
Dr Ami , Manchester Growing up in an Irish Catholic community in London in the 70s , my ginger hair did n't get me singled out for attention .
However , I feel spiteful hostility to gingers is definitely on the rise .
The lack of challenge allows people who enjoy being horrible about other people , but can't any more to other groups , to get away with it , from individuals to businesses and advertisers .
The criticism of Steve McClaren shows this : a caller to a BBC phone - in described him as " a typical useless ginger bloke " , and this ridiculous comment went unremarked by the host .
Because of this unchecked cruelty , I 'm relieved none of my children are ginger .
Stephen Martin , London
I 'm not sure that the statement " There is nothing like this in the US where having red hair is not a precursor to having someone abuse you .
Red hair is considered glamorous . " is entirely accurate .
I recently watched the South Park ( season 9 ) episode entitled " Ginger Kids " which tactfully deals with the subject , but indicates the same prejudice occurs in the US .
Tristan , Chatham
It is not a coincidence that the English regularly stereotype the Irish and Scottish as ginger haired .
Russ
Abbot made his name with this type of " humour " .
Of course it 's as bad as racism - and it often is racism .
Dougie , London , UK I 'm 20 now and since school I have only been subjected to red - hair - based abuse from misbehaving children and unintelligent idiots who can't think of any wittier or relevant insults .
It strikes a nerve because of the hard time I had as a ginger child but is n't even in the same league as racism .
Children will always find something to be cruel to each other over and only a few unfortunate adults do n't grow out of it .
Mike Assenti , Bristol , England
That joke at the top of the article is surely too rubbish to be offensive .
Gareth , Frome Having survived the occasional hair colour related taunting of the school play ground and mandatory nicknaming while in the army , I now celebrate the colour of my hair .
We , The Ginger , should rebuke any torments from those unfortunate to suffer the insecurities of the mousey masses , and explain to them that it is only their inability to articulate a more inteligent banter that leads them to choose pick on the one feature of us that makes us superior to them .
We should pity those who think it is right to try to bully us , because they will more than likely be bald before us .
David Cunningham , Bognor Regis
My gorgeous husband has ginger hair and I tell him ' Once you 've done ginger you never go back ' .
I have loads of affectionate names for him such as ' my little ginger freak of nature ' , ' ginge ' and ' ginog ' .
Unfortunately , my three year old daughter picked up on the first one and now regularly shouts ' ginger freak ' at my husband !
It is all done in our house with love and affection and my husband has long since accepted his hair colour and is proud of it .
He reckons that ginger people are the superior race and he'd be absolutely right .
Up those gingas !
Julie , Gateshead
I 've got red curly hair , and grew up at the time " Annie " was out at the pictures - thanks to all the teasing at school , I still hate that film !
Recently a beggar who I refused to give money to called me an " F****** ginger b****.
In my experience red hair makes you an easy target for insults , bullies and hurtful remarks .

Britain's ' worst driver ' is finally jailed ... but it took 54 driving offences to land him behind bars
Judge Andrew Lowcock : ' This is one of the worst records of driving
I have ever seen '
One of Britain 's worst drivers has finally been jailed after being convicted of driving while disqualified a ' ridiculous ' 54 times .
Anthony Marland has been given a four - month sentence - believed to be his first period behind bars - after a judge told him : ' This is one of the worst records of driving I have ever seen . '
But the number of offences it took to land him behind bars has been slammed as ' ridiculous ' by road safety campaigners .
Marland , 39 , of Ashton under Lyne , pleaded guilty to the latest in a long line of motoring offences after being caught by police last month .
He claimed he was driving to visit his partner , who he said was undergoing treatment for cancer at Manchester 's Christie Hospital .
One of the officers recognised him and confirmed he was a disqualified driver after checking the national database .
Nicoletto Amatino , prosecuting at Manchester Crown Court , said : ' The defendant was seen driving in Ashton under Lyne by police .
' The officer recognised the defendant , carried out a PNC check and found out that the defendant was a disqualified driver .
' His records show a considerable history for similar offences , a total of 53 convictions of driving when disqualified .
' A suspended sentence has been given in the past and also a community order , which was broken and replaced by the suspended sentence . '
Marland pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and driving without insurance .
He was banned from driving for a further two years and his licence was endorsed .
Judge Andrew Lowcock told him : ' This is one of the worst records of driving I have ever seen .
Court orders do n't seem to mean anything to you .
' You tell the probation officers that you were driving to see your partner who was in hospital .
' Whether or not this is true I do not know , but it is no excuse for you to drive a car again .
' In light of your record I think that in this case a custodial sentence is justified .
This is due to your continual flouting of court orders . '
Road safety campaigners welcomed the decision but said Marland should have been jailed earlier .
Cathy Keeler , from road safety charity Brake , said : ' It is ridiculous it has taken 54 offences to land him in jail .
' When somebody so blatantly disregards laws which are there to protect public safety and insists on putting other road users at risk by driving without a valid licence , jail is the only option . '
When considering John McCain ’s history of unethical behavior , the list usually starts ( and ends ) with the Keating Five scandal in the 1980s , for which McCain was rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for having shown , at a minimum , poor judgment .
In the aftermath , McCain helped improve his public image , and bury the scandal , by becoming an advocate of campaign - finance reform .
But the notion that McCain cleaned up his act may not be entirely true .
Take , for example , Donald Diamond , a wealthy Arizona real estate developer and generous McCain contributor , who wanted some coastal land in California freed up by an Army base closing .
When Mr. Diamond wanted to buy land at the base , Fort Ord , Mr. McCain assigned an aide who set up a meeting at the Pentagon and later stepped in again to help speed up the sale , according to people involved and a deposition Mr. Diamond gave for a related lawsuit .
When he appealed to a nearby city for the right to develop other property at the former base , Mr. Diamond submitted Mr. McCain ’s endorsement as “ a close personal friend . ”
Writing to officials in the city , Seaside , Calif. , the senator said , “ You will find him as honorable and committed as I have . ”
Courting local officials and potential partners , Mr. Diamond ’s team promised that he could “ help get through some of the red tape in dealing with the Department of the Army ” because Mr. Diamond “ has been very active with Senator McCain , ” a partner said in a deposition .
For Mr. McCain , the Arizona Republican who has staked two presidential campaigns on pledges to avoid even the appearance of dispensing an official favor for a donor , Mr. Diamond is the kind of friend who can pose a test .
Ya think ?
The closer one looks at this , the worse it appears .
In California , the McCain aide ’s assistance with the Army helped Mr. Diamond complete a purchase in 1999 that he soon turned over for a $ 20 million profit .
And Mr. McCain ’s letter of recommendation reinforced Mr. Diamond ’s selling point about his McCain connections as he pursued — and won in 2005 — a potentially much more lucrative deal to develop a resort hotel and luxury housing .
In Arizona , Mr. McCain has helped Mr. Diamond with matters as small as forwarding a complaint in a regulatory skirmish over the endangered pygmy owl , and as large as introducing legislation remapping public lands .
In 1991 and 1994 , Mr. McCain sponsored two laws sought by Mr. Diamond that resulted in providing him millions of dollars and thousands of acres in exchange for adding some of his properties to national parks .
The Arizona senator co-sponsored a third similar bill now before the Senate . [ … ]
For the California projects , the campaign said the McCain aide arranged the introduction to an Army official for Mr. Diamond ’s team as “ a constituent matter . ”
Oh , is that what the kids are calling it these days ?
McCain helped a wealthy and generous donor buy land from the Army — complete with special water rights — for a quarter of a million dollars , which McCain ’s buddy then sold two years later for $ 20 million .
There ’s a term for this — it ’s called “ influence peddling , ” and it ’s exactly the kind of thing McCain swears he never gets involved with .
If the Rezko story was considered a big deal by campaign reporters , the Donald Diamond issue should be huge .
Why the New York Times ran this the day of the Pennsylvania primary , when it ’s likely to get lost in the shuffle , is a mystery to me .
If this same story ran on Thursday morning , it would have become the talk of the political world in a hurry .
Enlarge Flarry family handout A California sea lion hopped aboard the Flarry family 's 31 - foot Catalina near Clark Island , Wash . on Sunday , Aug. 3 . Lynnea Flarry and her family were picnicking Sunday afternoon when her daughter - in - law spotted a sea lion aboard the boat .
FERNDALE , Wash .
( AP ) 
No one wants to be stuck with a large , uninvited visitor .
Especially a sea lion on a family sailboat .
Even more so twice in a day .
Lynnea Flarry was picnicking with her family Sunday afternoon on Clark Island when her daughter - in - law saw what they thought was a seal aboard the family 's 31 - foot Catalina , apparently after taking advantage of a ladder extending into the water from the stern .
Photographs taken by the family show the animal was probably a 2 - or 3 - year - old female California sea lion , said Sarah Rages , seasonal rehabilitator at Wolf Hollow Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Friday Harbor .
Females of the species often weigh 200 pounds or more when they mature at 5 to 6 years .
Flarry said her son and grandchildren took a dingy back to the boat .
" When they got close ( she ) hid ( her ) head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and does n't realize his toes are sticking out , " Flarry said .
One effort after another failed to dislodge the sea lion until Flarry 's son used a boat hook to nudge the creature gingerly back to the water .
" It was the strangest thing , " Flarry said .
" He was on there for more than an hour . "
It is legal to remove a marine mammal from private property as long as the creature is not injured , said Brian Gorman , a spokesman for National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle .
" This is a problem up and down the coast , particularly on docks , " Gorman said .
The rest of the group went back ashore as Flarry 's granddaughter stayed on the boat , taking more pictures as the sea lion swam in circles around the boat .
Then the animal climbed back up the ladder onto the boat and resumed sunning itself .
" She was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up , " Flarry said .
Back came the rest of the family to try to evict the sea lion .
" He 'd just turn his nose up to the sun and just look at us like , ' I 'm here , so what ? '
It was just the darndest thing , " Flarry said .
" I 've never seen anything so preposterous , and I 've been sailing for years and years . "
Her 5 - year - old grandson begged in vain to keep the sea lion as a pet .
" My grandson was more than willing to give up his bathtub if we could take the ( sea lion ) home , " Flarry said .

September 3 , 2008 — In a case - control study , the presence of measles virus RNA was no more likely in children with autism and GI disturbances than in children with only GI disturbances .
Furthermore , GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR vaccine timing .
Study findings are reported online in the Public Library of Science on September 4 ( http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003140).
Prior to the implementation of measles vaccines in 1963 , three to four million people were newly infected each year , 400 - 500 died , 48,000 were hospitalized , and 1,000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis .
From January 1 through July 2008 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received 131 reports of confirmed measles virus infection in the U.S. , the highest number for the same time period since 1996 .
Of these 131 cases , 91 % occurred in individuals who had not been vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status .
In 1998 , a report of the presence of measles virus RNA in intestinal tissue from children with autism spectrum disorders and GI disturbances ( Wakefield et al. ) resulted in public concern over the safety of MMR vaccine .
Although epidemiological investigations found no associations between MMR vaccine and autism , no subsequent studies tested for the presence of viral RNA in GI tissues of children with autism and GI disturbances or examined the temporal relationship of MMR , GI disturbances , and autism .
Failure to have done so may have contributed to persistent concerns that have influenced vaccine acceptance rates , resulting in outbreaks of measles .
Scientists at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health's Center for Infection and Immunity and researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Massachusetts General Hospital , and Trinity College Dublin , evaluated bowel tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone ( controls ) by real - time reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA .
Samples were analyzed in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis , including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between measles virus and autism had been reported .
" Our results are inconsistent with a causal role for MMR vaccine as a trigger or exacerbator of either GI difficulties or autism , " states Mady Hornig , associate professor of Epidemiology and director of translational research in the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Mailman School , and co-corresponding author of the study .
" The work reported here eliminates the remaining support for the hypothesis that autism with GI complaints is related to MMR vaccine exposure .
We found no relationship between the timing of MMR vaccine and the onset of either GI complaints or autism . "
Analysis in all three laboratories found two biopsy samples with measles virus RNA , one from a boy in the autism / GI group and the other from a boy in the control group , showing that the presence of measles virus sequences was not associated with an autism diagnosis ( autism / GI group , 4 % ; control , 8 % ) .
The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR vaccine administration was examined as well .
If MMR is causally related to either GI disturbances or autism it should precede their onset .
Analysis indicated no role for MMR vaccine in either the pathogenesis of autism or GI dysfunction .
Only five of 25 subjects ( 20 % ) had received MMR vaccine before the onset of GI complaints and had also had onset of GI episodes before the onset of autism .
" Over 20 epidemiologic studies have reported no temporal relationship between MMR vaccine and autism , however , no published studies from other research groups have addressed whether measles virus RNA is present in bowel of autistic children with GI disturbances .
Here we report results of independent , blinded testing in this particular subgroup for the presence of measles virus RNA in bowel tissues , " says corresponding author W. Ian Lipkin , John Snow Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Mailman School 's Center for Infection and Immunity .
He adds , " The study design process was a critical piece for us , as there is still so much public concern over the safety of the MMR vaccine .
For this reason , we involved the autism parent / advocacy community as we designed the study to ensure that all issues were being addressed .
We are hopeful that this process of community engagement will build important partnerships among members of the autism community , physicians , public health agencies , and clinical researchers ; serve as a paradigm for the conduct of future studies to understand the causes of this disorder ; and facilitate the rapid communication of clinically relevant scientific findings to the broader community .

Remember this , during the GOP convention , when Hurrican Gustav was going to possibly spoil the show :
“ You ’re seeing Republican governors and … uh … I think in Republican states , taking care of the citizens .
That ’s what …
That ’s what we do . ” – Governor Rick Perry
Well , the convention is over and the cameras are gone , so we are back to business as usual :
It did n’t take long for the finger - pointing to begin .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency came under fire Sunday as emergency workers were left undernourished and dozens of trucks of water and food had yet to be set up at distribution centers around Houston and surrounding communities .
And no sooner had the agency — widely condemned for its glacial response to suffering after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — drawn sharp criticism as its leaders and spokesmen began to say it was someone else ’s fault .
Earlier in the day , a FEMA spokesman said delays in setting up staging points to hand out needed provisions had been caused by blocked roads .
By the evening , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said it was the fault of state officials who handed his department the “ unexpected challenge ” of having to prepare distribution points in addition to delivering supplies .
Let me be the first to say you are doing a heckuva job , Rick Perry .

For the past week America has been subjected to another spectacular display of banality by the media and the campaigns of our presidential hopefuls .
First of all I must point out how amazing it is to me that , lately , just before an election there always seems to be a crisis of enormous proportion , something which has obviously been brewing for some time but somehow makes its ' appearance at right about this time , a time for heroic measures to be displayed .
It 's almost a perfect scenario .
First , one of the largest insurance companies in the world balanced it 's checkbook and found that they must have double entered a deposit or something because they 're 80 billion dollars in the red .
Understandable , we 've all overdrawn our accounts at one time or another but somehow I had the feeling that this was just the beginning .
In any event the government reacted quickly and , surprisingly , responsibly .
They did n't bail AIG out with a gift .
Uh-uh .
They took 80 % of the company as collateral and set a high interest rate on the payback .
America , the taxpayers , for once will realize a profit for their money being used by the government to assist the rich in their endeavor to be richer .
That is , of course , if AIG recovers and pays back the money .
If not , the taxpayers will own 80 % of an enormous debt .
But I digress .
Now , several days later the other anticipated shoe dropped .
It seems that our banking industry misplaced some money also , some 200 billion dollars .
According to someone who 's smart , or I may have dreamed this , that 's enough money to buy five thousand condoms for every man , woman and child in this country .
Not a bad idea actually but we have a presidential campaign going on , coincidently , and one of the candidates feels that he is so important to this process that he must suspend his campaign and cancel a much awaited and needed debate between himself and the democratic contender .
He has a plan and he 'll have this whole thing solved post haste .
So , he rushed to the meeting , found a chair right up front and sat there .
And sat there .
And as he sat there , silently , fingers interlocked , he moved his powerful mind around the room .
It was felt by all , who reported feeling as though they had been possessed by Elmer Fudd .
But , it was recognized by the people of this country as the familiar tactics of our current president .
I understand that while he was in Washington the Monument began to tip and McCain held it up by himself for several hours until crews could get there to add support .
I can't understand , for instance how now , finally , 80 % of the people in this country realize that Bush is a liar , manipulator and will ultimately , by choice , eliminate the middle class in the United States , yet , some of these people will consider voting for his evil twin , a man who not only extols the virtues of Bush through his actions but admits to planning to take the administration to the farthest boundaries of ultraconservative bumblism .
He is an enemy of the constitution and of the people , as is Bush , yet people who recognize the absolute ineptness of Bush can't recognize it in the silly grin of McCain that replaces the bush smirk .
I said this eight years ago .
I do n't believe that I 'm smarter than most people but what I can't understand is how did these men convince enough of the same people who now recognize Bush for what he truly is to vote for his retarded party brother .
What are people thinking ?
As I asked eight years ago , why did all of these seemingly intelligent people believe that a man , who I perceived to be the most obvious lying , evil , snide , obnoxious , epitome of a psycho dictator , was a good man with decent intentions and they should vote for him ?
Could I possibly be that wrong about someone ?
I never have been before .
I was n't eight years ago and I do n't believe that I 'm wrong now .
Now I 'm thinking differently though .
Maybe Bush is a good thing .
I did n't say a good man .
What 'd you think , that I took a stupid pill this morning ?
I said a good thing .
Why ?
What could be good about a man who , I believe , was involved in allowing the largest terrorist attack in history to occur on our soil in order to initiate military action against a country which had no involvement in the attacks , distracting us from the actual war on terror which we were engaged in Afghanistan ?
That 's treason , punishable by death .
It would take too long to continue citing individual transgressions but he obviously , with a smirk on his face and a song in his heart , went on to destroy our economy , strengthen the major conglomerates hold of the system over the people , breakdown the Constitution and begin the eradication of our freedoms and civil rights , alienate the people and political parties of our nation , defecate on our world image , alienate every ally we ever had , and now we discover , contributed to the topple of the financial giant which was the United States .
Ok .
Point made ?
But wait , did n't I just say he was a good thing ?
Let 's take a look from another angle .
Our country has been heading down the wrong road for some time now .
I believe it began when the first bullet struck JFK .
" Oh krist , another conspiracy nut " .
Whatever .
No matter what happened that day or who was involved you have to admit that our country has been on a downward spiral since .
Through the Clinton administration we became a three ring circus .
Our president , who was doing the best job of guiding this country in over thirty years is busted for getting blow jobs , like that 's never happened before , but this time our entire political process was ground to a halt while he was trying to do his job , keep his family together , trying to defend his actions , the republicans devoted all of their efforts to , , what ?
Humiliate him ?
Prosecute him ?
For getting a blowjob ?
For lying ?
About a blowjob ?
Let 's face it , it was embarrassing for our nation , a distraction from world affairs , another opportunity for corporate America to gain a stronger foothold on , not just our economy but our world .
It used to send shivers down my spine whenever I used to hear Reagan or Bush sr. bring up the New World Order , the One World .
It would blow me away that the rest of the nation did n't have the same reaction .
To hear the president of the United States espousing the views of some centuries old religious cult which has , for many years had questionable relationships and influences on our government scared the sh*t out of me .
Why did n't it scare anyone else ?
No one ever mentioned it .
Where was our media .
Where was someone else who felt that this was a bit bizarre .
Could no one else see , at the very least , what was happening in our government , where all the power was going ?
Where all the money was going ?
How come it seems that whenever there 's a republican in office the country takes several steps backward ?
Well , except this last administration .
It 's taken us back a century , right to the depression .
But McCain will fix all that .
Keep as many wars going as you can and throw money at the rich .
We 're a hard working nation of people .
Was the money going to remunerate the working Americans , the people who broke their backs , toiled long hours , got educated , built this country , literally , in the past hundred years ?
No , it was n't .
It was going to a bunch of fat suits .
Inherited wealth , CEO's who claimed to " have the right stuff " or the right contacts , basketball players , super salesmen , and teachers .
What ?
Did I say teachers ?
Yea , , I was just kiddin .
That 's my point .
We have the worst public education system in the world and everyone blames teachers .
They must have become teachers just for the money because they make the big bucks .
Why , here in Florida I know some teachers who make $ 40,000 .
a year .
Yea , that ai n't chickenfeed y'know .
And if you 're reading this and thinking " yea , he 's right .
That 's plenty of money for teachers , or anyone who works 40 , 50 , 60 hours a week to earn a living " then you must be one of the idiots who voted for Bush .
In this economy you cannot live a substantial life on that money .
This is not the American Dream .
It 's a literal nightmare .
What makes someone who 's invested money more valuable than someone who invests their labor or brains and dedicates all of their energy to do their job well and increase profitability of a firm .
Should a money investor live in such luxury and opulence while one who invests his life and labor barely gets by and can't even afford to save for a retirement , which , for many will never come as they must continue to work into their golden years just to survive ?
If you 're getting this point then you understand why GW Bush is possibly a good thing .
Bush finally opened America 's eyes to the idiocy of the system , the growing inequities in the application of law , justice , money , health care , etc .
Now I 'm not some liberal ( not that liberal is a bad thing ) who 's spouting off about civil rights or the ecology or what have you .
I have no agenda other than building this country to what it was meant to be , for the people , nothing about minorities or issues or special interests .
Not for the poor , not for the rich .
No special treatment whether you 're brown , black , yellow or white .
An equitable share of the wealth for anyone who wants to contribute .
That 's everyone , not just those who can contribute financially .
Sure , you can't start a business without money but you can't run it without labor .
Both are equally important to the success of any company and should be equally remunerated .
This is about what our country is supposed to be about .
Honesty , hard work , family values , these are the things that used to be the key to success .
Honest and hard work .
I do n't mean that everyone with these values should become a millionaire , most people do n't even want to be millionaires .
It 's not about the accumulation of money .
To most people money is just a means to an end .
The end being to live a comfortable , not necessarily luxurious , existence , provide education for your children and save enough money to get you through retirement .
These values have been lost in the past half a century and the Bush administration has opened the eyes of most good people to that .
Now , not only can people not save for retirement , most will never know what retirement is as they 'll have to work the rest of their lives .
The fact that these are the important things in life and that there are those who are so greedy , so arrogant and yes , so evil that they would deny those values and make a mockery of them for nothing more than their own personal gain and financial growth is unconscionable .
People are finally becoming aware because of his misdeeds and they 're fed up .
For the first time since the sixties people are actually talking out loud about revolution .
People are finally becoming , not only desperate but angry enough to consider what our forefathers found to be the only answer to tyrants who saw to kill their dreams , destroy the natural human spirit to provide for the welfare of their family by whittling away at their hopes , disallowing them the opportunities to advance themselves even to the point of experiencing true freedom , leaving them to fear the establishment and be satisfied to live in servitude , not daring to endanger the small chance remaining to them to just survive .
George Bush is the epitome of those tyrants and he 's in your face .
This election , no matter what the results , is not going to change the direction in which we 're heading .
It will only be a distraction to the fact that the powers who are in rule are greedy , evil , bloodsucking tyrants .
Bush is only the face of the establishment , putting Obama in his place will not change who he works for .
We must keep on vigilance , not be fooled into believing that an election is going to change anything in this country .
Open your eyes .
We 've already seen that an election under our present system is a meaningless joke .
We only get to chose from who the establishment allows us to chose from .
It 's no accident who is in the running , everything is contrived and if you do n't believe that yet then you 're only kidding yourself .
It 's time to stop being afraid of the realities of our world but to embrace them as your enemy .
There 's an Arabian proverb to which we should adhere .
" Keep your friends close - hold your enemies closer . "
Do n't ever forget that they exist and do n't believe that they 're not smart .
They 've gotten this far , they 're not going to let a little thing like an election defeat them now .
Electing Obama is a step in the right direction but we must continue to be vigilant , work for the changes needed to begin to fix the system where it's not working now , the electoral process , lobbying , corporate welfare are just the beginning .
Still , be careful how you vote .
Right now , I trust no one .
McCain , to me , is an obvious mistake .
He will obviously carry on in the tradition of Bush , keeping our enemy in our face , continuing to antagonize and rape our nation .
Maybe again that 's a good thing because much more of that and there will be a revolution .
I 'm not looking forward to it .
It will be an ordeal which will cost many and a trauma which will alter our lives for generations but that 's what our forefathers endured to preserve the way of life Americans strive for .
Freedom does n't come without sacrifice .
McCain in office may be the antagonist which tips the cart .
Four more years of Bush would surely do it .
But , by putting Obama in office we 're not assured that he's any different , but I do believe he will affect much of the " change " which we really need .
I believe that he will not distract us from the truth , from the facts that the same old " Order " is still in power and that we must not let down our guard , that we must all still work together to find real solutions to the progressive downward spiral of the quality of life and freedom for the hard working people of America .
I hope that 's where Obama will take us .
People are so easily fooled , so wanting to believe in the good of America that they will forget that the people who now own America do n't care about them , only about their own greed , their own attainment of all of the wealth , no matter the cost to anyone else .
If Obama wins he 'll be fighting those people in congress and the senate and we must support him continuously .
The far right claims that they want bi-partisanship but when it comes down to it they will fight every bill , every initiative and will not hesitate to attack the character and person of Barack Obama himself when the time comes .
They are liars and backstabbers and we can't expect anything less from them than they displayed during the Clinton years .
We must stand strong with him and fight of these abuses of power .
Personally , I believe that the prosecution of the entire Bush administration for treason is the first line of order to punish the lawbreakers and demonstrate the consequences of such future actions .
If the tables were turned they ( the republicans ) would surely pursue all prosecutorial actions with a vengeance and with fervor .
This is what democrats must now do .
It 's time to demonstrate the strength of the party .
So remember , after the election , no matter the outcome , keep your eye on the ball .
If we do n't see real change , real fast , in our economy , the strength of working Americans to pull themselves out of the debt we 've had to incur just to maintain a comfortable standard of living , our health care system and the cost of pharmaceuticals for everyone , and corporate accountability for the state of our economy then we must continue the fight .
Not just for the elderly , nor to be distracted my minorities and special interest groups but for every working American , young or old , black or white or brown , man or woman , We have to end being a nation of special interests .
If we take care of working Americans , all working Americans , then and only then can we begin the task of fixing the system to work for all Americans equally .
Vote , but do n't let an election end our quest for true equality in our Nation .
The Establishment , One World Order , the New World Order , the powers that be , whatever you want to call it , or them , are not looking out for your best interests .
They want to own you .
They do own you .
They 're not " good Christian people " , benevolent factions , or great leaders .
They are greedy , monstrous , evil people who share no beliefs beyond their own personal gain of power and money and they rule .
They will continue to rule until they are physically removed from power , by coup , as they came into the power they now hold or by revolution .
Do n't ever forget it and do n't be afraid to speak .
Maybe Bush is a good thing .
The failures of this Congress to do anything to end the Iraq war or to stem the Bush / Cheney executive power grab are apparently all the fault of the Senate .
At least that 's the message coming from Nancy Pelosi , now out making the rounds on talk shows for her new book .
It actually started at Netroots Nation , when she blamed the FISA capituation on " seventeen Democratic Senators for backing the President 's surveillance bill . "
Yes , there were 17 Democratic Senators who backed the President 's FISA bill , but there were also 21 House Blue Dogs who backed the President 's FISA bill and managed to bully House leadership into bringing a bad bill to the floor .
We can't let it be forgotten that the House was the chamber that brought the FISA " compromise " to the floor and forced it through , despite having been the last chamber to have acted by passing the much better RESTORE Act back in February .
Then , in an appearance this week on the " The View , " she had this to say in responding to a question from Joy Behar ( at about the 5:50 minute mark ) on impeachment .
Her long answer boils down to :
. . .
If somebody had a crime that the President had committed , that would be a different story .
. . .
You ca n't do that [ pursue a legislative agenda ] if you 're trying to impeach the president at the same time , unless have the goods that the President committed a crime .
Which , of course , we did n't have for the most part because the Democratically controlled Congress largely did n't investigate .
I say for the most part because we do know that Bush violated the FISA law .
We had the goods on that .
What we do n't know is the full extent of that lawbreaking because , again , Congress has utterly failed in its job of oversight .
It failed so much in that job that , while it was at it , actually took away the judiciary 's ability to conduct oversight by granting retroactive amnesty to the telcos .
Which brings us to Pelosi's Monday appearance on " The Daily Show . "
Here 's the critical snippet , starting at about the 4:20 mark :
Q : Is Congress , as it is made up today , obsolete ?
With a powerful president , is Congress sort of a vestigial -- unless it has 60 votes in the Senate and a huge majority in the House ?
A : Fair question ... because the fact is the Republicans in Congress vote so much as a rubber stamp with the president that they are abdicating the role of Article I -- we are the first article of the Constitution , the Congress of the United States -- but if you say , " I 'm just going to vote with the president , stick with the president every time , " then he has power he should not have .
Q : Will you exercise that type -- let 's say Barrack Obama is fortunate enough to win the presidency ... are you saying that the Democrats will
exercise more and more stringent oversight over a Democratic president than the Republican Congress did over President Bush ?
A : Well , the same thing -- Q : You 'll rubber stamp ?
A : No rubber stamp .
And in terms of , say , for example , domestic surveillance , no president , Democrat or Republican should have the power that this president wanted to have .
So it is n't -- and the Congress of the United States has to assert its prerogatives .
And this Republican Congress has been a rubber stamp for so long , but that will change .
Um , just to set the record straight here .
Pelosi is absolutely right in that no president , Democrat or Republican , should have the power that this president wanted to have in domestic surveillance .
Unfortunately , she went along with the Republican rubber stampers to GIVE HIM THAT POWER !
Fine , we 're moving along .
We 're going to have a new president .
But redemption for the abysmal performance by this Congress in conducting its job is n't going to come from Pelosi's or any other Congressional leader 's revisionist history of how all this went down .
It 's also not going to come from , as Meteor Blades so succinctly put it , letting bygones be bygones when we have that new president .
Redemption , and restoring the Constitution , is going to come from sunlight , from investigations -- both Congressional and by the new President 's Justice Department -- that shine a bright light on all of the excesses of this administration , running the gamut from torture and illegal domestic spying to the takeover of the Justice Department by political hacks .
The nation , the Constitution , deserves no less .
Has any single videogame been so relentlessly hyped prior to its release as Spore , the latest brainchild of SimCity creator Will Wright ?
This game has been in the news for years because of its raw ambition :
Wright said it would simulate the entire history of life on Earth , from cells flagellating in the primordial soup all the way up to space travel .
( He originally called the game SimEverything . )
Can anything actually live up to that standard ?
If Spore is our test case , then the answer has to be no :
For all the work that went into this intricate and complex simulation of life , I never found myself gripped by the simple gameplay .
But this is n't to say it 's not fun to see what happens when you open up and start poking around in this game that bills itself as " your own personal universe in a box . "
In fact , with all the real - life evolutionary science that went into the making of the game , I feel like I 've actually learned a few things during my time in Spore 's universe .
Here are 10 of them .
10 . Life began when a geode carrying a bacterium struck Earth .
Done .
I 'm sick of all of these arguments about how life began .
Wright 's theory seems as plausible as anything : Skillions of years ago , an asteroid hit Earth , and it contained an adorable little big-eyed , single - celled creature whose name , in my version of events , was Spike .
I named him that because of the razor - sharp poking appendage that I attached to him as soon as he could mutate .
You 'll spend the first half - hour of your Spore experience in the " Cell stage , " swimming around in the aforementioned prehistoric bisque .
You spear other lifeforms , eat their carcasses to earn DNA points , then mate with another bacteria and produce offspring .
At this point , you jump into one of the game 's much - lauded Creators , in which you can add new body parts to your cell .
Some are vital for survival , like spines and electric tails , and some just look cute .
The Cell stage does n't last especially long , which is good because it ends right around the time that you figure out it 's not very much fun .
It 's kind of like Pac - Man except with no power pellets or clear goals , and eventually Pac - Man grows legs and walks out of the maze .
But the decisions you make during the Cell stage are important , because ...
9 . The apple does n't fall far from the tree .
Before you even begin the Cell stage , you have to make a decision :
Is your little guy an herbivore or a carnivore ?
This can have lasting repercussions throughout the rest of the game .
As a carnivore , the easiest way to get meat is to attack your fellow creatures .
This turns your bacteria into kind of a jerk , and when he evolves , he 'll be more suited to being an aggressive land animal .
Establishing dominance with violence will be easier than trying to reason with other creatures .
And if you take this path of least resistance throughout the rest of the game , you 'll be a warlike , spacefaring race of jerks in no time , just because your aquatic ancestors went on the Atkins diet eons ago .
8. First , protect your hut .
Take care of your home before venturing out into the world .
Once I 'd reached the Tribe stage of the game , in which my little tribe of sapient Spikes had developed crude weapons and loincloths and were domesticating stupider animals , I discovered that I had to go out and attack neighboring tribes to wipe them off the continent .
But I got cocky after an early victory , and sent my whole village out to raze the next tribe .
Big mistake :
Another tribe came over and sacked my village , and the Spikes were no more .
I had to start the entire stage over again :
This was how I found out that Spore has no auto - save feature , and that you have to manually save your progress .
What 's more , there 's only one save slot , and you can't backtrack – which means that your decisions become finalized once you commit to them .
7. Didgeridoo = friends .
Everybody knew one guy in college who played the didgeridoo .
Admit it , though :
Even though he looked extremely silly playing it , were n't people just drawn to him ?
When I restarted the Tribe stage after being wiped out , I thought that perhaps I should actually try to make some friends this time around .
So when I built up my hut again , I skipped adding stone axes , and added digeridoos .
I equipped my tribe with them , sent them over to the neighbors ' place and played them a song .
This , as suspected , made them love me , and soon they were bringing me gift baskets .
But my brief flirtation with pacifism was not to last .
For just as I was planning to walk over and perform for another tribe , they declared war on me .
Actually , every other tribe declared war on me .
And so just when I thought I was out , they pulled me back in to a life of crime .
Speaking of which ...
6. Sometimes you have to kill babies .
Look , I do n't make these rules .
But as the old saying goes , if you want to make an omelet , you have to murder a few babies .
In the Creature stage of the game , when you 're trying to make other beasts extinct without dying off yourself , your pack of animals has got to kill a certain number of them .
All things being equal , do you think we 're going to try to take on the alpha male ?
Hell , no : Babies have much fewer hit points and do n't fight back .
Murdering the innocent is also an excellent strategy in the Tribe phase .
Tribal babies , like human ones , are n't good for anything other than filling diapers for the first part of their lives .
But if you 're raiding a camp , you still need to take out the babies , because if you do n't , they grow up and try to kill you .
Also see : the first 10 minutes of The Godfather : Part II .
5. Strip clubs make successful wars .
By the time I reached the penultimate Civilization stage , I knew that the namby - pamby vegetarian pacifist approach to world domination was n't going to happen for me .
And so although I could have attempted to make friends and allies with other nations via economic or even religious means , I knew that my destiny was to go to war .
And go to war I did , designing vehicles with lots of guns on them and sending them off to bomb capital buildings and such .
Unfortunately , I played the Civ stage all wrong .
What you 're really supposed to do is build up your cities first , adding homes , factories and entertainment until the cities all generate the optimum amount of profit to fund your war machine .
If you expand too aggressively without doing this , you 'll find that you have a lot of enemies and no money to actually fight back with .
( In this case , you might hope that you did n't save your game . )
Before you can place any buildings into your cities , you 'll be whisked into the building editor .
This is just as intuitive and robust as the Spore Creature Creator , allowing you to make any sort of architecture you can imagine with a few mouse clicks .
But what 's even more innovative is that it's also very easy to not make something of your own .
With one mouse click , you can seamlessly log into the " Sporepedia , " a constantly growing online catalog of other players ' creations .
Players can tag their creatures , vehicles and buildings , so finding a structure you like is as easy as entering " strip club " into the search field .
4. Parenthood is gratifying .
I did n't sit down with Spore 's Creature Creator and labor over Spike for hours .
He grew up organically from the Cell stage to Civilization .
I only added body parts when I wanted to upgrade him and make him stronger .
But it says something about the appealing nature of Spore 's creators that even I ( who ordinarily could not care less about such things ! ) spent a few minutes here and there making cosmetic changes to Spike every time he evolved – straightening his spine , making his eyes round and expressive , giving him a big wide mouth .
Eventually he looked sort of like a red- and - white - striped Yoshi from Super Mario World .
And it pleased me to no end when I started a new game and it automatically imported my creation into the worlds , and I could see little Spikes that I designed running free about the planets of the new universe .
Since Spore automatically uploads your creations to the central content servers , Spike is going to start popping up in other people 's games , too .
And just by clicking on him , they can leave comments to tell me how much they love him .
3 . Your children do n't have to look kind of like Yoshi .
When I realized that I 'd screwed up on the Civ stage , I decided to move on to the final phase of Spore , space exploration .
You do n't have to finish each mode in order to go to the next .
Since I had to start a new game , I decided to jump into the Sporepedia and seed the new galaxy with other players ' creations .
I searched for " Mario " and found that , of the 5 million or so creatures and objects that other players had already created , there was no shortage of red - hatted mustachioed guys .
So I named my planet " Mushroom Kingdom " and put a race of Marios in charge .
When I visited my home colony , I opened the music editor , which is just as intuitive and clever as the object makers .
Dragging musical notes up and down , and using my scroll wheel to change the notes ' duration , I had a passable Super Mario jingle playing in just a few minutes .
The editor will randomly generate pleasing melodies , too .
2 . Outer space is vast , and it hurts .
Reviewing Spore last week , a New York Times writer called the gameplay controls in the Space phase " carpal - tunnel - inducing . "
At first I just laughed and thought : " Man up , guy from The New York Times . "
But I had n't been playing in space for very long before my arm started to hurt .
To move your spaceship around , you have to hold down the right mouse button with your middle finger to accelerate , and use the scroll wheel with your index finger to move up and down .
It becomes a pain in the wrist real fast .
The Space stage is where Spore really opens up .
The galaxy is enormous – you can zoom out and see thousands of little dots , each of which is a solar system with its own set of planets .
I spent hours exploring , trading with other races , landing on planets to landscape and colonize them , shooting down alien pirates that tried to take my planet 's resources , and all kinds of other missions .
And I barely made a dent .
But I do n't know how much more I 'm going to play , because , well ...
1. Spore is kind of boring .
Spore 's creative tools are proving to be very popular – so many people are using it so intensely that the 5 - million - creations figure that I referenced above , current as of this writing , will probably be woefully outdated when you read this .
And it 's clear that lovers of space - exploration games will find a great deal to keep them occupied for a long time .
So I 'm almost embarrassed to admit that I just do n't get the appeal .
Strip away all the truly innovative and occasionally mind - boggling tricks that Spore pulls behind the scenes , and you 're left with very simplistic gameplay .
Eat these pieces of meat .
Click on those creatures to kill them .
Click on that city and start an alliance .
While I found that Spore got more engaging once I had to think about my actions and plot a strategy , it just barely got as fun as any average , run -of - the - mill videogame .
In attempting to Sim everything , Spore tries to be all things to all people – a strategy that never quite works out the way it 's supposed to .

Personal information requested by the ATO includes names , addresses , telephone numbers , email addresses , user IDs , dates of birth , dates of registration on eBay and monthly sales data .
Some eBay users are already panicking in posts on the site 's discussion boards , saying they were unaware they could be considered tax cheats .
In Australia eBay has over five million unique users and research by Nielsen in 2006 found there were 52,000 Australians who derived either a primary or secondary income selling on eBay .
That number is likely to have increased significantly since then .
An ATO spokeswoman said : " This is one of the tools that we use to check that people are declaring their income properly and we do it across a whole lot of industries , not just online trading . "
Adam Micmacher , partner with the Lowensteins Arts Management accountancy firm in Bondi Junction , said the move was a sign the ATO was " expanding its reach to internet - based trading platforms like eBay " , noting that it would appear that the ATO would now scrutinise transactions at e-commerce sites like eBay just as intensely as a shop on the street .
But the ATO 's initial request suggested those earning less than $ 50,000 annually from the site would escape relatively unscathed this time around .
" However , if for example this initial review bears fruit , they might come back again and now ask for people who sold , for example , $ 30,000 , " he said .
The ATO said the high income cut - off did not mean the ATO had no chance of catching eBay sellers who did not declare all of their income , " because we also data match reported income with bank records " .
Mr Micmacher said the ATO may also seek out people who have not paid capital gains tax on one - off sales of high value items such as paintings .
" Somebody may have , for example , just sold two private paintings that they 've owned for 20 years over eBay , but that does n't necessarily mean it 's going to be income , " he said .
" In that circumstance it might throw up that the person may have been subject to report a capital gain from having sold those items . "
eBay user Maureen Chuck said she never sold enough to warrant a look from the ATO but she regularly saw " some very silly people who are selling high volumes who because they call themselves ' stay at home mums ' think they [ are ] tax exempt " .
Mr Micmacher agreed that it may be difficult for some part - time sellers selling second - hand goods to determine whether they are running a taxable business or simply selling knick - knacks as a hobby .
" You have to look at the traditional aspects of business .
Have you got a business plan , what is the size and scale of the operation , how many transactions do you do a year , are you really holding yourself out to be in business , have you registered with the Government to be recorded as having an Australian Business Number , how do you run your business or are you doing this truly has a hobby ? " he said .
eBay Australia spokesman Daniel Feiler said the auction site was legally obliged to provide the ATO with the requested personal information of its members .
" We believe that the majority of eBay sellers do the right thing but I think the simple point is that if you 're selling on eBay to a point where you are reaching the threshold where you 're required to pay tax and you 're not doing it , then you 're really stupid , " he said .

Purpose
The Web Application Security Consortium ( WASC ) is pleased to announce the WASC Web Application Security Statistics Project 2008 .
This initiative is a collaborative industry wide effort to pool together sanitized website vulnerability data and to gain a better understanding about the web application vulnerability landscape .
We ascertain which classes of attacks are the most prevalent regardless of the methodology used to identify them .
Industry statistics such as those compiled by Mitre CVE project provide valuable insight into the types of vulnerabilities discovered in open source and commercial applications , this project tries to be the equivalent for custom web applications .
Goals
Identify the prevalence and probability of different vulnerability classes .
Compare testing methodologies against what types of vulnerabilities they are likely to identify .
Project Leader
If you represent an organization that performs vulnerability assessments on websites , particular in those in custom web applications , through a manual or automated process and would like to participate please let us know .
Once statistics are compiled , a report will be distributed , and all contributors will receive a logo on the project pages as well as on other deliverables in appreciate of their contribution .
Please contact Sergey Gordeychik .
Project Contributors
Methodology
The statistics was compiled from web application security assessment projects which were made by the following companies in 2008 ( in alphabetic order ) :
This article contains Web application vulnerability statistics which was collected during penetration testing , security audits and other activities made by companies which were members of WASC in 2008 .
The statistics includes data about 12186 sites with 97554 detected vulnerabilities .
As a result , we now have 4 data sets :
Overall statistics by all kinds of activities ;
Automatic scanning statistics ;
Black box method security assessment statistics ;
White box method security assessment statistics .
Automatic scanning data is collected in fully automated scanning process without any preliminary settings ( with standard profile ) of hosting provider sites .
Remember that not all the sites include interactive elements , and additional settings made by an expert considering certain Web application , allows to greatly improve the efficiency of vulnerability detection .
Black box method security assessment statistics includes the results of manual and automated Web application analysis without any preliminary known data about the application .
As a rule , this includes scanning with standard settings and manual search of vulnerabilities unavailable for automatic scanners .
White box method security assessment statistics includes the results of the deep Web application analysis which contains application analysis done as an authorized user .
It also includes static source code and binary analysis .
Detected vulnerabilities are classified according to Web Application Security Consortium Web Security Threat Classification ( WASC WSTCv2 ) early draft .
Vulnerability risk level is determined by contributors or assessed according to CVSSv2 ( Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2 ) .
Then the level was brought to PCI DSS ( Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ) risk levels as described in the methodology ( see appendix 1 ) .
Summary
The statistics includes data about 12186 web applications with 97554 detected vulnerabilities of different risk levels .
The analysis shows that more than 13 % * of all reviewed sites can be compromised completely automatically .
About 49 % of web applications contain vulnerabilities of high risk level ( Urgent and Critical ) detected during automatic scanning ( T. 1 ) .
However , detailed manual and automated assessment by white box method allows to detect these high risk level vulnerabilities with probability up to 80 - 96 % .
The probability to detect vulnerabilities with risk level more than medium ( PCI DSS compliance level ) is more than 86 % by any method .
At the same time , detailed analysis shows that 99 % of web applications are not compliant with PCI DSS standard ( T. 6 , P. 13 ) .
* Web applications with Brute Force Attack , Buffer Overflow , OS Commanding , Path Traversal , Remote File Inclusion , SSI Injection , Session Fixation , SQL Injection , Insufficient Authentication , Insufficient Authorization vulnerabilities detected by automatic scannings .
The following conclusions can be drawn based on the analysis :
The most wide spread vulnerabilities are Cross - site Scripting , different types of Information Leakage , SQL Injection , HTTP Response Splitting ;
The probability to detect a urgent or critical error in dynamic web application is about 49 % by automatic scanning and 96 % by comprehensive expert analysis ( white box method ) ;
Administration issues are 20 % more frequent cause of a vulnerability than system development errors ;
99 % of web application are not compliant with PCI DSS standard requirements , and 48 % of web applications are not compliant with criteria of ASV scanning by PCI DSS ;
Detailed white box method analysis allows to detect up to 91 vulnerabilities per web application , while automatic scanning – only 3 ;
Compared to 2007 , the number of sites with wide spread SQL Injection and Cross - site Scripting vulnerabilities fell by 13 % and 20 % , respectively , however , the number of sites with different types of Information Leakage rose by 24 % .
On the other hand , the probability to compromise a host automatically rose from 7 to 13 % .
Data analysis
General analysis
T. 1 and P. 1 show the probability to detect vulnerabilities of different risk levels detected during audits and automatic scanning .
Thus , automatic scanning detected up to 86 % sites with one or some vulnerabilities of medium ( or higher ) risk level ( Urgent - High ) .
Black box and white box analysis methods increase it to 92 - 98 % , respectively .
These results are greatly depend on the fact that detailed risk assessment analysis is more adequate and consider not only vulnerability type but its exploitation consequences and application design and implementation .
Another important fact is that automatic scanning was made for hosting provider sites which in some cases have no active content , while security assessment is usually done for application with complicated business logic .
That is that automatic scanning results can be interpret as typical Internet site scanning results , while black box and white box methods results are scanning results of interactive corporate web applications .

The most widespread vulnerabilities are Cross - Site Scripting , Information Leakage , SQL Injection , Insufficient Transport Layer Protection , Fingerprinting и HTTP Response Splitting ( P. 2 ) .
As a rule , Cross - Site Scripting , SQL Injection and HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities are caused by design errors , while Information Leakage , Insufficient Transport Layer Protection and Fingerprinting are often caused by insufficient administration ( e.g. , access control ) .

If we consider the prevalence of high risk level vulnerabilities in detailed web application analysis ( P. 9 ) we ’ll see that the most widespread is Credential / Session Prediction errors .
SQL Injection , Path Traversal and implementation and configuration errors in authentication and authorization systems are also widespread .
P. 9
The probability to detect the most risky vulnerabilities in Web applications ( % Sites BlackBox & WhiteBox )
If we consider the probability to detect vulnerabilities in terms of web resource visitors and web server impact ( according to classification in appendix 2 ) , the server - side vulnerabilities are the most widespread ( P. 10 ) .
But the vulnerability distribution by impact type per site is irregular and greatly depends on used vulnerability search method ( P. 11 ) .

Data analysis according to PCI DSS requirements
If we consider data sets about vulnerable Web applications according to PCI DSS requirements , we can easily sort ( T. 4 ) those that are about certain vulnerability elimination in Web applications .
In addition , PCI DSS Technical and Operational Requirements for Approved Scanning Vendors ( ASVs ) includes similar requirements but affects only ASV scanning by PCI ( T. 5 ) .

Water - fuel car unveiled in Japan
Posted
Jun. 13 - Japanese company Genepax presents its eco-friendly car that runs on nothing but water .
Caterpillar 's come out with a new line of electric - drive mining trucks called the AC Series , and some diesels that belch less pollution than the other ginormous vehicles the company builds .
Depending upon your perspective , this is either the most half - hearted greenwashing attempt since Emirates ditched paper products but kept onboard showers , or the most amazing engineering feat since the Manhattan Project .
Caterpillar rolled out its new behemoths this week during the 2008 MINEXpo show in Las Vegas , and company president Stu Levenick crowed , " New technologies have allowed us to make trucks more reliable , easier to maintain and more friendly to the operator and to the environment , " though we do n't see how chopping off mountaintops is friendly to the environment .
Though Cat 's new 795F AC is more mind - boggling than vegan pork rinds , it 's still a flippin ' huge truck that can haul 345 tons of earth out of a thousand - foot - deep pit using diesel - electric drive .
It 's even bigger than the 793D shown above ( Cat has n't released pics of the 795 F , which is expected to go into production in 2010 ) .
The tires cost more than most cars on the road , and the thing has a flight of stairs to reach the cab .
We still love it , even though there 's no denying that a lot of these trucks will be put to use in ways that make the Sierra Club cringe .
We can almost hear the sales pitch : " Ah , grasshopper !
You must save the earth to destroy the earth . "
Though some overly optimistic A123 fans predicted the AC - series would run on batteries or catenary wires , it relies on a diesel generator to support the electric drivetrain .
Such a setup is nothing new , as Caterpillar developed AC - drive for mining trucks back in the 1960s , and Komatsu and others have been using it for years .
But Cat 's trucks are the biggest that can use either powertrain .
The company says the leviathan EVs will appeal to an important niche market .
" Cat will produce mining trucks for every application – uphill , downhill , flat or extreme conditions – and now with electric as well as mechanical drive , " says Chris Curfman , president of Cat Global Mining and vice president of Caterpillar Inc .
Their impact on the environment , for better or worse , is n't the prime motivator for building these earth - moving beasts .
The companies that use them are concerned with another kind of green , and that 's operating costs .
The electric drivetrains are cheaper to run because they produce gobs of torque at low speeds without straining mechanical transmissions , and they do n't rely on mechanical brakes to slow their descent into the mine .
What 's more , electric drive trucks are easier to control , thereby increasing operator safety and reducing the risk of accidents .
Plus , saving a little bit of diesel never hurt anyone .
After all , the standard 795 has an 1,800 gallon fuel tank .

I wrote this short reminiscence of Bill Ayers six months ago , when his name came up in the campaign for the first time .
Now it looks as if he ’s the key to the McCain - Palin strategy down the home stretch .
Other than rousing the uglier impulses of the Republican base , I do n’t think the Kristol Plan is going to make much difference .
It ’s the wrong year .
Like Palin herself , the use of Ayers is a sign of ill - health in the Republican Party and a symptom of an ideology in an advanced state of decay .
The smarter conservatives , like Frum and Douthat , know this .
FIRE CHRISTOPHER COX ?….
John McCain has apparently decided he has to say something different and / or unique about the crisis on Wall Street , so he ’s come up with a new line : he wants to see Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox fired .
“ The chairman of the SEC serves at the appointment of the president and has betrayed the public ’s trust .
If I were president today , I would fire him , ” McCain says , according to excerpts for a speech on reforming the ailing U.S. financial markets he will deliver today in Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
“ The primary regulator of Wall Street , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino , ” McCain says .
” They allowed naked short selling — which simply means that you can sell stock without ever owning it .
They eliminated last year the uptick rule that has protected investors for 70 years .
Speculators pounded the shares of even good companies into the ground . ”
I suppose this shameless grandstanding is preferable , at least politically , to explaining why the fundamentals of the economy are “ strong ” and why McCain was against the AIG bailout before he was for it , but only marginally .
First , the president cannot fire an SEC chair .
It ’s procedurally impossible .
As ABC News reported , “ [ W ] hile the president appoints and the Senate confirms the SEC chair , a commissioner of an independent regulatory commissions cannot be removed by the president . ”
That seems like the kind of thing McCain ought to know before spouting off on the subject .
Second , the SEC did allow all kinds of short selling , but that ’s legal under the federal regulatory system that John McCain — and his advisor , Phil Gramm — helped put in place .
After more than a quarter of a century in Congress , has McCain ever proposed changing these laws and imposing stricter regulations ?
No .
Has he ever , before today , criticized Cox ’s oversight of existing trading rules ?
Not as far as I can tell .
Third , I ’m not an expert , but I ’m fairly certain short selling is not the underlying cause of the current crisis .
The sub - prime mortgage fiasco and over - leveraged banks are .
If McCain wants to make a case for firing Cox , he should at least get the cause right .
It has been a week since Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was catapulted from relative obscurity to centre stage as US Republican John McCain 's choice for running mate .
Here are 10 things we now know about her .
Images of Sarah Palin , past and present
In pictures
1 . Her five children are named Track , Bristol , Willow , Piper and , last but not least , Trig Paxson Van Palin .
According to the Washington Post newspaper , Track was named after the course of the sockeye salmon the family fishes off the town of Dillingham , while her eldest daughter 's name comes from Bristol Bay , an area known for its salmon fisheries .
The name Willow relates to the state bird , the willow ptarmigan , and a nearby town , the paper says , while daughter Piper shares her name with the family 's small plane .
Trig is the Norse word for " brave victory " , the Post adds .
2 . Her rimless glasses are now a style phenomenon .
The titanium Kawasaki 704 frames - designed in Japan , where they sell for $ 300 - are apparently flying off the shelves .
Her upswept hair - do is also reportedly spawning imitators .
LA Times fashion writer Booth Moore writes : " The untidiness of her updo has a can - do spirit that says , ' I have more important things to do than worry about my hair , so I just twirled it into this clip so I could get to the real business of governing and shooting caribou and having babies and taking them to hockey practice . ' "
3 . John McCain picked someone who not only appeals to " Wal - Mart Moms " but is one herself , shopping for the family in a local branch .
Not only that , writes New York Times columnist William Kristol , but " he picked someone who , in 1999 as Wasilla mayor , presided over a wedding of two Wal - Mart associates at the local Wal - Mart " .

4 . Mrs Palin enjoys moose - hunting and salmon - fishing - and has said her favourite dish is moose stew .
Former Republican senator and one - time presidential hopeful Fred Thompson described her as " the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to properly field - dress a moose " .
Cindy McCain , in her speech to the party 's national convention , said her husband John had " picked a reform - minded , hockey - mommin ' , basketball - shooting , moose - hunting , salmon - fishing , pistol - packing mother - of - five for vice - president " .
5 . A month before her fifth child , Trig , was due , Mrs Palin 's waters broke while she was in Texas to address a conference .
She delivered her speech nonetheless and embarked on the long flight back to Alaska - changing planes in Seattle - before travelling an hour by road to hospital to give birth .
She says she was not in " active labour " and her doctor said it was fine .
Alaska Airlines allows women to travel in the late stages of pregnancy .
Husband Todd - a commercial fisherman - is quoted by the Anchorage Daily News as saying : " You can't have a fish picker from Texas . "
Three days later , Mrs Palin was back at work .
6 . As governor of Alaska , Mrs Palin ditched plans for a " bridge to nowhere " - a federally - funded project to link a handful of Alaskans to an airport at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars .
In her speech to the Republican National Convention , she said she had told the US Congress " thanks , but no thanks " .
But US media say she appeared to support the project while running for governor in 2006 , though she said the proposed design was too " grandiose " .
And when she announced the cancellation of the bridge a year ago - after it gained notoriety as an example of wasteful spending - she hardly seemed to be turning down federal funds out of thrift .
She explained the decision by saying , " It 's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island . "
The federal funding was diverted to other projects in Alaska .
Mrs Palin enjoys hunting , shooting and fishing for salmon 7 .
In a line that has gone down well at the Republican National Convention and on the campaign trail , she boasts of putting the previous governor 's " luxury jet " on eBay as a measure to cut wasteful spending .
That is true .
But what she has not always explained to her audience is that the plane failed to sell on the internet auction site and so aides had to broker a deal with a buyer .
8 . She was baptised a Catholic as an infant but attended a Pentecostal church in Wasilla - her hometown since her parents moved to Alaska from Idaho when she was three months old - for many years .
She now attends Wasilla Bible Church , a non-denominational , evangelical church .
The Associated Press reports that the church is promoting a conference that promises to convert gays into heterosexuals through the power of prayer .
9 . As hunters sometimes do , Mrs Palin has incurred the wrath of wildlife - lovers .
It 's not just that she shoots moose and caribou , she has also backed legislation to encourage the aerial hunting of wolves , as a " predator control " measure .
Plus , she has opposed the US government 's listing of a variety of animals as endangered , including the polar bear and the beluga whale .
Unlike Mr McCain and to the horror of many environmentalists , she actively supports drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
10 .
She is a self - described " average hockey mom " ; a biography published a few months ago was entitled Sarah : How a Hockey Mom Turned Alaska 's Political Establishment on Its Ear .
The hockey mom branding could prove useful come November in the swing states of Michigan and Minnesota , where ice hockey is a big game .
Her best - known joke so far ?
" What 's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ?
Lipstick . "

First , the money rushed into hedge funds .
Now , some fear , it could rush out .
Even as Washington reached a tentative agreement on Sunday over what may become the largest financial bailout in American history , new worries were building inside the nearly $ 2 trillion world of hedge funds .
After years of explosive growth , losses are mounting  and so are concerns that some investors will head for the exits .
No one expects a wholesale flight from hedge funds .
But even a modest outflow could reverberate through the financial markets .
To pay back investors , some funds may be forced to dump investments at a time when the markets are already shaky .
The big worry is that a spate of hurried sales could unleash a vicious circle within the hedge fund industry , with the sales leading to more losses , and those losses leading to more withdrawals , and so on .
A big test will come on Tuesday , when many funds are scheduled to accept withdrawal requests for the end of the year .
“ Everybody ’s watching for redemptions , ” said James McKee , director of hedge fund research at Callan Associates , a consulting firm in San Francisco .
“ And there could be a cascading effect , where redemptions cause other redemptions . ”
I was n't going to post about this guy with the Obama monkey - doll .
Then I watched the video again , and noticed something .
There is nothing troubling about one lone racist nut in a crowd .
What 's troubling is the crowd .
Dig how they just look on and smile uncomfortably .
No one confronts him .
This is the banality of evil , no ?
It is n't the guy doing the deed .
Its the enablers who give comfort and haven to spew his hatred .
On one level , I 'm thankful for them .
Anyone , who wants to now say that an Obama election proves that racism is dead will have to contend with this last week .
And it is n't the nuts that this person must contend with --- it 's the crowds , the crowds who silently , and sometimes not so silently , just stand by and let it happen .
They are all , to a man , cowards .

He is not alone in his thinking .
Similarly ,
In July of 2008 IBM , Intel , Microsoft and Xerox announced that they were joining forces with Information Overload Research Group (
In a study done by the group 's research arm , Less than 37 % of an average office workers time is spent doing productive work .
15 % is spent on information searching
20 % is spent in meetings
28 % is spent in unnecessary distractions from phone calls , e-mails and instant messages
Another study done by Seattle - based RescueTime concluded that a typical office worker : Accesses their e-mail program more than 50 times a day
Uses instant messaging 77 times a day .
According to Basex , these interruptions result in 28 billion hours of lost productivity every year .
With an average wage of $ 21 per hour for knowledge workers , it could end up costing the U.S economy over $ 588 billion dollars a year .
While it 's not possible to avoid all our workplace distractions .
There are things we can do to have a more meaningful and productive workday .
Ten Tips to Help Manage Information Overload
1 ) Define a workspace
Choose a workspace and only do work in that area .
Avoid communicating , browsing or searching in that space .
Paul Graham uses this method , by using a separate computer workstation for browsing and communication .
2 ) Centralize communications
Use one means of communication instead of subscribing to multiple communication channels such as IM , Email , Phone , Facebook or twitter .
It 's easy to manage your distractions from communication when it comes from one place .
3 ) Avoid Immediate responses
Get rid of instant notifications and avoid responding to IM 's and e-mails immediately .
Set aside specific time to address these messages during the day and limit the number of times you address them .
People will eventually figure out when you are most likely to respond .
4 ) Spend time with people
Go to lunch with your colleagues that you are working with .
Spend 10 - 15 minutes at the end or beginning of the day to talk to your team .
If you set aside some time everyday to catch up with people , you will less likely be interrupted during your work time .
5 ) Take a break
Your mind needs a break ever once in a while to unwind and realign your focus .
Get up , stretch , go for a walk .
Though remember not to distract your other workers by interrupting their work .
6 ) Try disconnecting
Silence the blackberry , turn of the IM and e-mail and kill the internet connection .
Some of your work will make it impossible to completely disconnect .
If you can't , limit the applications and sites you connect to .
7 ) Cut the news
While you can't cut off keeping up to date on recent activity related to your life or work , it would n't be a bad idea limiting it .
Limit the amount of time you spend browsing news and also limit the number of times you do it .
Start out by spending only 1hr every 3 - 4 days and adjust according to your needs .
It 's more important to get the work done than it is to know about everything around you .
8 ) Most important tasks first , everyday
Most of us have lots of tasks every day , it 's not easy to narrow it down .
Though we should prioritize and a good method is to pick 3 important tasks at the begining and get started on them .
If you get through them move on to other less important tasks .
This way you are finishing the most important stuff first .
9 ) Why am I doing this ?
With all the work we have to do sometimes we forget why we are doing it .
Every once in a while step back and ask yourself why are you doing what you 're doing ?
Having a good reason will keep you motivated and inspired .
This only works if you spend some time to come up with some good meaningful reasons .
10 ) Keep a consistent schedule
Keeping a daily schedule that is consistent will help you break some of your distractions .
Take a break at a 10 am and 2 pm .
Talk to your coworkers at a 9 am and 4 pm .
Check your emails at 8:30 , 11:30 and 3:30 .
Come in at 8:15 am and leave at 5 pm .
Once you have a set daily schedule those events turn into markers for your day and you can quickly view if you are spending your day effectively .
Being aware of how your time is being spent at work can have great long - term benefits for your career .
While these solutions wo n't work for everyone , using just a few can be a good start towards optimizing your output .
The key is to become more aware of what task is beneficial to helping your maximize your output and what tasks take away from that .
While you can't avoid doing unncessary tasks , you can minimize their effects by being aware of them .

Favorite Answer :
So you 're getting some Trump supporters who are saying that this makes Trump smart .
But this is false .
The Times story does include some creative tricks to lessen his tax bill .
But all of the ones mentioned are at least borderline , if not clearly , illegal .
But the bigger problem is that Trump escaped taxes not primarily through creative accounting .
Instead , he escaped them because his businesses lost truly massive amounts of money .
The biggest was in the early 1990s when he lost almost $ 1 billion dollars , more business losses than any other individual in America at the time .
This staggering loss was so massive that it allowed Trump to essentially erase his tax liabilities for the rest of the decade , and into the 21st century .
Needless to say , it 's not a sign of intelligence that your business fails so badly that you do n't have to pay taxes for over a decade .
When Trump did enjoy success , he usually had large tax bills , as one would expect for a high net worth individual .
For example , the times reports that during the later Bush administration , Trump paid over $ 70 million in taxes , his first significant tax bill in many many years .
Why ?
It was because Trump 's financial fortunes had been reinvigorated by the Apprentice and the licensing deals which his new fame made possible .
At the same time , the tax advantages of his early 90s failure were running out .
Now , if Trump 's tax avoision ( to quoth Kent Brockman ) were the product of an intelligent tax sheltering strategy then you 'd expect that he would n't pay a lot in taxes .
But he did .
That 's because he was actually successful once again .
He did n't have those huge business losses which could offset his tax liability .
But as the star power of the Apprentice faded , Trump once again began losing buckets of money .
These losses then allowed him , once again , to reduce his tax bill to very low levels .
So it 's not that he 's smart , but that he 's very bad at business .
We have other evidence from the report that Trump is bad at business .
The Times notes that most of Trump 's flagship properties are losing copious amounts of money .
His DC hotel lost , I believe , something like $ 55 million .
His golf courses , Mar -a - Lago , and Doral are all losing money .
He does have a few money making investments .
Trump
Tower , where he still owns the commercial space , still makes him money .
But other than that his few consistent money makers are all things where he has investments , but which he does n't manage .
Especially important are two office towers which he owns a minority stake in and which are managed by Vornado .
This shows his lack of intelligence .
The businesses which he actually runs are failing and the few really profitable parts of his portfolio are ones that he plays no role in running .
Measure is toned - down version of earlier draft that could conflict with state statutes , which require officers to use “ all lawful means ” to enforce drunken driving laws .
By Tony Plohetski ( AMERICAN -STATESMAN STAFF )
Friday , October 23 , 2009
Backing down from a more stringent measure , Austin City Council members Thursday approved a resolution saying it is their “ clear will ” that police officers not personally collect blood from people suspected of driving while intoxicated .
Council members had been set to vote on a proposal that would have directed City Manager Marc
Ott to block officers from gathering such samples , but the council backed off that plan at the urging of city lawyers who said the measure could run afoul of state law .
The original proposal had been sponsored by Council Members Bill Spelman and Laura Morrison and Mayor Lee Leffingwell .
During Thursday ’s meeting , police leaders told the council that they have abandoned plans to train a group of officers to act as phlebotomists .
“ We have not trained anybody , nor are we currently training anyone ” to collect blood , said Assistant Police Chief David Carter , who is the department ’s chief of staff .
“ We do not expect to train anybody . ”
Police Chief Art Acevedo had previously said he was interested in teaching officers to collect blood evidence , setting off a public debate that went on for months .
Assistant City Attorney David Douglas told council members before their vote that barring Austin officers from collecting such evidence could conflict with state statutes , which require officers to use “ all lawful means ” to enforce the law .
Civil libertarians oppose police officers taking blood , saying it could put the city at risk of lawsuits if a suspect is injured .
They also said they thought city officials should instead focus their efforts on programs that would prevent drunken driving , such as offering free taxi rides for intoxicated motorists .
Spelman had said he thought police officers collecting blood also could lead to more complaints against officers .
Carter said the idea of having officers collect blood was first mentioned last year after police officials reviewed practices in other Texas cities .
He said the department is now exploring other options and told council members Thursday that police officials have been , and will continue to , have blood drawn at Austin hospitals .
Austin police administrators also are in talks with Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton about creating a partnership in which blood would be drawn by phlebotomists at the county ’s central booking facility , Carter said .
The resolution approved Thursday directs
Ott to develop clear guidelines for the collection of blood specimens and bring them to the council by Feb. 19 .
“ The guidelines must explain who will collect the specimens and under what circumstances , ” the resolution said .
Ott also must prepare a cost study for the new blood specimen program .
Officials from several groups , including representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union of Central Texas and Texans for Accountable Government , had initially asked for the resolution to ban police officers from drawing blood .
They also had sought a measure to prohibit police from conducting so - called “ no refusal ” operations , in which officers seek search warrants for the blood of drunken - driving suspects who refuse to provide breath tests .
Such operations usually are conducted on holiday weekends .
The resolution did not address that issue .
Spelman said he learned from the city manager ’s office and city attorneys last Friday that the original resolution might be in conflict with state laws .
“ I think they were concerned about the City Council directing the police chief , through the city manager , to adopt a police procedure , ” he said .
Spelman said he was pleased with the version that won approval Thursday , even though he said it is “ clearly watered down from the original version . ”
Debbie Russell , director of the Central Texas ACLU , said she also was pleased .
“ There is simply no reason for officer - phlebotomists , ” Russell said .

If you want to know why see - sawing John McCain has had to be goaded , prodded , begged , and dragged into spotlighting Barack Obama ’s radical ACORN roots , here ’s your answer :
Turns out John McCain had no problem calling ACORN members his friends during his ill - fated illegal alien shamnesty crusade .

The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was introduced in the Senate by Senators Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) and in the House by Representatives Jim Kolbe ( R - AZ ) , Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) and Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) .
It addresses border security and illegal immigration while bringing the 11 million undocumented immigrants out from the shadows and onto a path to legal permanent status ; setting up legal channels and realistic caps for workers and family members to enter in the future ; providing for tough enforcement ; and enabling more immigrants to learn English and prepare for citizenship .
The rally in Miami is being sponsored by the New American Opportunity campaign ( NAOC ) in partnership with ACORN , Catholic Legal Services – Archdiocese of Miami , Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center , Florida Immigrant Coalition , Miami Dade College , People for the American Way / Mi Familia Vota en Acción , Service Employees International Union , and UNITE HERE .
ACORN is now gleefully reminding McCain of his common cause with the group to paint itself as bipartisan — while at the same time issuing the usual strident , anti-conservative statements that ought to be immediate grounds for revoking its non-profit tax status .
“ I ’ll rely on people to judge me by the company that I keep , ” McCain said in February .
That ’s not working out so well now , is it ?
We ’re Screwed ’08 .
The first half of Sarah Palin 's interview with Katie Couric aired tonight and it's already making the wrong sorts of headlines .
This is looking a lot like Palin 's train wreck sit - down with ABC News ' Charlie Gibson .
( Video of the most damaging moments — this time around — after the jump . )
The lefties at Huffington Post and Crooks and Liars have seized upon the part where the Republican vice presidential nominee can't give examples of John McCain supporting financial regulation .
" I 'll try to find some and bring them to you , " she tells Couric .
The neocon New York Sun ( not yet dead ! ) notes the part where Palin said we might be headed for another Great Depression , hardly the most reassuring leadership from the ticket that was recently talking about how strong America 's economic " fundamentals " are .
And she was also clearly flummoxed by a question about ongoing ties between McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis and a group that advocated for housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Perhaps Palin should stick to interviews with Fox News shouting heads like Sean Hannity .
It 's not like she 's ever needed the mainstream press for high approval ratings .

( CNN ) -- The Rev. Paul Earl Sheppard had recently become the senior pastor of a suburban church in California when a group of parishioners came to him with a disturbing personal question .
Rev. Rodney
Woo leads a successful interracial church but says church members still clash over race .
They were worried because the racial makeup of their small church was changing .
They warned Sheppard that the church 's newest members would try to seize control because members of their race were inherently aggressive .
What was he was going to do if more of " them " tried to join their church ?
" One man asked me if I was prepared for a hostile takeover , " says Sheppard , pastor of Abundant Life Christian Fellowship in Mountain View , California .
The nervous parishioners were African - American , and the church 's newcomers were white .
Sheppard says the experience demonstrated why racially integrated churches are difficult to create and even harder to sustain .
Some blacks as well as whites prefer segregated Sundays , religious scholars and members of interracial churches say .
Americans may be poised to nominate a black man to run for president , but it 's segregation as usual in U.S. churches , according to the scholars .
Only about 5 percent of the nation 's churches are racially integrated , and half of them are in the process of becoming all - black or all - white , says Curtiss Paul DeYoung , co-author of " United by Faith , " a book that examines interracial churches in the United States .
DeYoung 's numbers are backed by other scholars who 've done similar research .
They say integrated churches are rare because attending one is like tiptoeing through a racial minefield .
Just like in society , racial tensions in the church can erupt over everything from sharing power to interracial dating .
DeYoung , who is also an ordained minister , once led an interracial congregation in Minneapolis , Minnesota , that eventually went all - black .
He defines an interracial church as one in which at least 20 percent its membership belongs to a racial group other than that church 's largest racial group .
" I left after five years , " DeYoung says .
" I was worn out from the battles . "
The men and women who remain and lead interracial churches often operate like presidential candidates .
They say they live with the constant anxiety of knowing that an innocuous comment or gesture can easily mushroom into a crisis that threatens their support .
Poll : Race and religion in America »
" It 's not all ' Kumbaya ' and ' We are the World , ' " says Sheppard , the pastor of the Northern California church , who was raised by his father , a Baptist preacher , in the black church .
" There are plenty of skirmishes . "
Ca n't we just be Christians ?
If it 's so tough , why bother ?
That 's one of the first questions interracial churches must address .
DeYoung says he encountered many blacks who said they wanted a racial timeout on Sunday .
" They would say , ' I need a place of refuge , ' " he says .
" They said , ' I need to come to a place on Sunday morning where I do n't experience racism . ' "
Whites also complained of their own version of racial fatigue , other scholars say .
Theodore Brelsford , co-author of " We Are the Church Together , '' another book that looks at interracial churches , says whites often say that church should transcend race .
" They 'd say , ' Ca n't we just get along without talking about race all the time ?
Ca n't we just be Christians ? ' "
Not really , say advocates for interracial churches .
They argue that churches should be interracial whenever possible because their success could ultimately reduce racial friction in America .
American churches have n't traditionally done a good job at being racially inclusive , scholars say .
Slavery and Jim Crow kept blacks and whites apart in the pews in the nation 's early history .
Some large contemporary black denominations , like the African Methodist Episcopal church , were formed because blacks could n't find acceptance in white churches .
Large denominations like the Methodists , Baptists and Presbyterians split over race in the 19th century when their members clashed over the issue of slavery , Michael Emerson , a scholar on interracial churches , recounted in his book , " Divided by Faith . "
But interracial church advocates say the church was never meant to be segregated .
They point to the New Testament description of the first Christian church as an ethnic stew -- it deliberately broke social divisions by uniting groups that were traditionally hostile to one another , they say .
DeYoung , the " United by Faith " co-author , says the first - century Christian church grew so rapidly precisely because it was so inclusive .
He says the church inspired wonder because its leaders were able to form a community that cut across the rigid class and ethnic divisions that characterized the ancient Roman world .
" People said that if Jews , Greeks , Africans , slaves , men and women - the huge divides of that time period -- could come together successfully , there must be something to this religion , " DeYoung says .
Biblical precedents , though , may not be enough to make someone attend church with a person of another race .
Something else is needed : a tenacious pastor who goads his or her church to reach across racial lines , interracial church scholars say .
The Rev. Rodney Woo , senior pastor of Wilcrest Baptist Church in Houston , Texas , may be such a person .
He leads a congregation of blacks , whites and Latinos .
Like many leaders of interracial churches , he is driven in part by a personal awakening .
Woo 's mother is white , and his father is part Chinese .
He attended an all - black high school growing up in Port Arthur , Texas , where he still remembers what it was like to be a minority .
" Everyone understands the rules , the lingo , the mind - set -- except you , " he says .
" It was invaluable , but I did n't know it at the time . "
When he became pastor of Wilcrest in 1992 , he was determined to shield his church members from such an experience .
But an exodus of whites , commonly referred to as " white flight " was already taking place in the neighborhood and the church .
Membership fell to about 200 people .
At least one church member suggested that Woo could change the church 's fortunes by adding a " d " to his last name .
" The fear there was people would think I was Chinese , " he says .
" There would be a flood of all these Asians coming in , and what would we do then ? "
Woo kept his last name and his vision .
He made racial diversity part of the church 's mission statement .
He preached it from the pulpit and lived it in his life .
He says Wilcrest now has about 500 members , and is evenly divided among white , Latino and black members .
Woo does n't say his church has resolved all of its racial tensions .
There are spats over music , length of service , even how to address Woo .
Blacks prefer to address him more formally , while whites prefer to call him by his first name , ( a sign of disrespect in black church culture ) , Woo says .
Woo tries to defuse the tension by offering something for everyone : gospel and traditional music , an integrated pastoral staff , " down - home " preaching and a more refined sermon at times .
But he knows it 's not enough .
And he 's all right with that .
" If there 's not any tension , we probably have n't done too well , " he says .
" If one group feels too comfortable , we 've probably neglected another group . "
Going from " they " to " we "
Sometimes , though , a determined pastor is not enough .
Interracial churches can also implode on issues far more explosive than worship styles -- like sex and power .
One such issue is interracial dating .
Some scholars and leaders who deal with interracial issues say it 's not unusual for parents in racially - mixed churches to leave when their teenage kids begin dating .
Woo saw that exodus at Wilcrest .
Some parents talked about the importance of a multiracial church , until their kid became attracted to someone from another race within the church .
" As kids began to date , some things get revealed , " he says .
" They did n't want their kids involved in interracial dating -- and that 's not just whites . "
Accepting black leadership is another touchy subject .
Most interracial churches are led by white pastors .
A congregation typically becomes all - black if a black pastor is hired , says DeYoung , the " United by Faith " co-author .
" As long as the top person , the senior pastor , is white , power sort of resides with whites , " DeYoung says .
" But when that shifts , it does something psychologically to people .
People usually leave . "
Black pastors who do gain the acceptance of interracial congregations still have to watch themselves .
Some white parishioners , even progressive ones , get uneasy when a black pastor gets too fiery in the pulpit , says Brelsford , co-author of " We are the Church Together . "
" A black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation , " Brelsford says .
" It could kick into fear of black men . "
Sheppard , the black minister of the church in California , says he modified his style to appeal to all sorts of people .
He says he abandoned the pulpit pyrotechnics he learned growing up in the black church when his congregation 's racial mix changed .
He also carries his authority lightly , dressing casually in the pulpit and consulting with church committees before making decisions .
In conversation , he 's relaxed and accessible .
" I 'm very aware of how rare this is , " he says of being the black minister of an interracial congregation .
" I 'm humbled by it . "
The people in the pews must also do their share of adapting , scholars and ministers say .
Only when ethnic groups no longer feel compelled to abandon their entire culture on Sunday morning can a church claim to be interracial , Brelsford says .
An interracial church is n't one in which all the black members act , dress and worship like the church 's majority white members to make them feel comfortable , he says .
Interracial churches resist " taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it , " Brelsford says .
That appears to have happened at Sheppard 's church in Northern , California .
Since its rocky early days , it has now grown to a multiracial congregation of about 6,000 people .
Whites , blacks , Asians , Latinos - all now attend .
" We refuse , " Sheppard says , " to be a one - flavor - fits - all church . "
Interracial congregations often include people who probably would n't have become friends in any other circumstances .
They are people like Dwight Pryor , a black man who grew up in segregated Mississippi seeing blacks brutalized by whites .
He says he grew up disliking white people .
Today , Pryor says he is best friends with a white member of Wilcrest , a man who grew up in Alabama during segregation in a family that hated blacks .
When Pryor sees his friend on Sunday , he says he no longer sees a " they " or a " them " trying to invade his world .
He sees his brother in Christ .
" We come to love each other , " he says .
" When I look into his eyes , I can see the love of Jesus Christ .
He and I have become friends . "
All About Racism and Bigotry • Religion
CountyFair had an important and much - needed lesson in journalistic ethics for us this morning .
The key points :
First : it should never , ever be considered acceptable to quote a candidate or official making a false claim without noting its falsity .
Reporters do this all the time , justifying it by saying they ’re just presenting both sides , or that they are n’t making the false claim , they ’re just reporting it , or saying they corrected three other false claims in the article .
That is not sufficient : if a journalist includes a false or misleading claim in their news report — in any form — without indicating that is false , they are actively helping to spread misinformation .
Second : the way in which news reports debunk misinformation matters a great deal .
If Candidate A lies about Candidate B , for example , the fact that Candidate A is lying should be the lede – otherwise the news report just drills the false claim into readers ’ and viewers ’ minds , allowing the misinformation to take hold before it is corrected .
As I wrote in my column on Friday , the news media too often privileges lies rather than punishing them .
To put it simply , we need a press that , when it hears a public figure lying , understands that the story is n’t the substance of the lie , which therefore needs repeating ; it ’s that a public figure is lying .
And it ’s okay to use these words .
When a public figure says something that is patently false , and that he or she knows or ought to know , as a matter of basic competence , then it is okay to report what happened : Candidate A lied this morning .
That is not opinion – it is a statement of fact .
So I second MediaMatters ( and the Shankar Vedantam piece they ’re riffing on ) here .
I ’d also like to broaden the discussion a bit in order to provide some context for the appropriate use of terms like “ negative ad , ” “ go / went negative ” and “ attack ad . ”
I heard one of the network nitwits this morning talking about another round of “ attack ads ” – a lede that reinforces the message that the candidates are campaigning “ negatively . ”
This approaching to packaging the story pretends that the claims of the ads are irrelevent .
If Candidate A indicts Candidate B for lying , and Candidate B shoots back with an ad that lies about Candidate A some more , a reporter ( or morning show host pretending to be a reporter ) who frames these events as an exchange of negative ads has not only failed to accurately report the story , he or she has in fact added to the lie .
All “ negative ” ads are not alike , and I ’d be grateful if someone would explain the difference to the collected asshaberdashery at NBC “ News . ”
Let ’s illustrate with a couple examples :
Congressman
Bob has been using his office to conduct all manner of graft and fraud for 20 years and a recent investigation has brought it all to light .
His challenger , Assemblywoman Jane , runs an ad pointing all this out and saying that it ’s time to run the criminals out of the statehouse .
Congressman Bob runs an ad accusing Assemblywoman Jane of being a communist millionaire crook who blows lobbyists under her desk .
All of these assertions are either demonstrably false or at the very least based on little more than Bob ’s imagination .
NBC leads its morning show with a story about mudslinging in the campaign and repeats the substance of the charges in the story without making clear that one ad is truthful while the other is bad creative writing .
In doing so , they have certainly provided “ balance , ” but they have also done to the truth what the guys in that shop did to Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction .
They not only fail to bring truth to the audience , their malfeasance helps the audience internalize an outright lie .
It ’s reached the point where as soon as I hear the term “ negative campaigning , ” or any iteration thereof , I immediately assume that I ’m about to be lied to .
If the source is one I know to usually be credible , I figure they simply have n’t thought about how they ’ve bought into this corrosive , corruption - enabling canard , which must originally have been fabricated on the same hellish meme - forge that gave us “ Japan - bashing ” and “ flip - flopping . ”
If I hear it from a member of the mainstream press or someone who gets their information about the world from those corporatist sources , I assume either stupidity , intentional dishonesty or a measure of both .
Regardless of the source or intent , however , this kind of uncritical , half - educated rage for the faux - ethics of “ balance ” and “ fairness ” is doing very real damage to our society .
Given the central role played by Big Media in our politics , then , the first step in holding our leaders to a higher standard is to demand that the press hold itself to some kind of standard – and really , just about any kind of standard would be an improvement .
The Fund for Public Interest Research Is Lying to You
If you plan to work for the Fund following college , as a career , or just to make some money while doing something you believe in , you must read this first .

What is the Fund for Public Interest Research ?
The Fund for Public Interest Research is a national , non-profit group that primarily raises money for groups like the PIRGs , the Sierra Club , Greenpeace , HRC , and a few others .
Ninety percent of their work consists of hiring and training people to go door - to - door to solicit donations on behalf of these organizations .
They do a little media work , but not much .
You probably have n’t heard of them before , and if you have , it was most likely from an on - campus recruiter , a job posting on a website , or your local classified ads .

My Involvement with the Fund
I first heard of the Fund in the winter of my senior year in college .
They came on - campus to recruit , and it sounded like a great option : I wanted to work for a year before going to grad school , preferably for an organization that shared my interests in progressive ( some might say liberal ) reform .
What ’s not to like ?
They work to clean the environment and protect consumers , and said they ’d teach me how to be an effective political advocate .
Almost immediately upon starting with the Fund as a Canvass Director in July , I found that the job description they had given me was misleading , to say the least .
The hours were much longer then they had stated , the responsibilities were wildly different , and the pay was less than they advertised .
I stayed for three months , on the promise that things would be more like they said they would after the summer was over .
I lasted until October , at which time I was told that I was n’t raising enough money for them .
When they gave me an ultimatum to raise more money or be fired , I left on the spot .

______________________________________________
How Exactly is the Fund Lying to Me ?
Wow .
Where to start ?
The best way to do this is to make a list of claims the Fund makes to its prospective employees , divided by position , and contrast that with what actually happens .
Citizen Outreach Directors ( aka Canvass Directors , the job that college graduates usually apply to )
Claim : Canvass Directors work about 60 hours a week .
Truth : Canvass Directors actually work about 70 - 80 hours a week during the “ summer season ” , which ranges from May until September .
Did n’t tell you that , did they ?
This included about 13 hours a day on weekdays , then anywhere from 2 - 6 hours on Saturday , and a meeting on Sunday afternoon .
Miss any of this , and you ’ll be considered “ not dedicated ” to the position .
For the rest of the year , 60 hours is accurate , but keep in mind this is still 1 ½ times a normal work week .
Claim : Canvass Directors make $ 19,500 dollars a year ( or whatever it is now ) .
$ 1000 of this is from an “ expected bonus . ”
Truth :
This “ expected bonus ” is almost impossible to achieve , unless you happen to be an amazing fundraiser , which is what the bonus is based on .
Did n’t tell you that , did they ?
Out of the 4 new directors working in the D.C. office while I was there , none were even close to soliciting the requisite amount of money to even approach the full bonus .
It is my estimation that few new directors nationally receive this “ expected ” bonus , which is significant given the low pay of the job in the first place .
Paychecks are routinely and unapologetically sent late to offices , and directors are asked to pay for almost all office expenses out of pocket , with the burden on them to submit requisitions in a confusing and inefficient repayment system .
Claim : The Fund has a generous loan repayment program to college grads with debt .
If you pay at least $ 50 a month , the Fund will pay $ 100 ( again , the numbers may have changed ) .
Truth : I do n’t know how they look themselves in the mirror on this one .
In order to be eligible , the employee ( i.e. you ) must “ make an effort to extend your payment over the longest possible schedule ” and then the Fund will provide the $ 100 , with federal and state taxes being withheld from your paycheck .
Essentially , this program discourages employees from actually enrolling in it , since extending your loan in order to receive $ 100 a month would almost surely be more expensive in the long run ( And you would not actually receive $ 100 a month due to taxes – something the Fund knows but does n’t tell candidates ) .
Yet you do n’t find all this out until it is too late .
This is significant , given the draw of a loan - repayment plan to graduates taking on such a low - salaried position .
Claim :
As a director , you will organize a field campaign , write press releases , call and speak at press conferences , build coalitions with elected officials , and meet with editorial boards .
Truth :
This is absolutely ridiculous .
Ok , technically , you might do all these things .
In practice , however , I would say you spend maybe 20 percent of your time focused on them .
The rest is fundraising , pure and simple .
That means that you will be going out “ into the field ” 3 - 4 days a week ( at least – do n’t let them tell you otherwise before you get there ) , knocking on people ’s doors and asking for money to support these issues .
A noble thing , to be sure !
The world needs people to do this .
But they do n’t tell you that ’s what you ’ll spend most of your time doing .
In 3 months , I never held a press conference , wrote sporadic letters to the editor ( there just is n’t time ) , and met with one elected official , whom I happened to work for previously .
The claim on their website that you ’ll meet with editorial boards is so ridiculous and so false I wo n’t insult your intelligence by discussing it .
Canvasser
( The job that you find advertised in papers and on a lot of these environmental job sites .
For college graduates and non-college graduates alike . )
Claim :
You can expect to make between $ 300 - 500 dollars per week ( amount depends on the city ) .
Truth :
Very few people make this much .
The base salary per week is about $ 250 a week , again depending on the city in which you work .
If you raise more than the “ quota ” amount per week , you ’ll earn a percentage of what raised above the quota .
But , to make the $ 500 a week ( which they speak of as being no hard thing ) , you would need to earn , on average , about 140 dollars over quota each night .
That means you ’d be soliciting almost 2 ½ times over the quota each night to get to $ 500 a week .
Did n't tell you that , did they ?.
Nationally , probably 5 percent of canvassers do this .
Most have been there for years .
So do n’t let them fool you into thinking you be making lots right off the bat .
Claim : The Fund will train you to be a great canvasser .
Truth :
They ’ll train you , alright , if you happen to be good at it when you walk in the door .
If not , you ’ll most likely be fired within days .
On average , a canvasser gets 2 - 3 days to prove that they can raise lots of money .
If they can ’t , they ’ll be fired .
Claim :
You will get to do other political activism , like media work and letters to the editor and all that .
Truth : Sure , you might get to do that stuff .
But , you will spend 90 - 95 percent of your time on door - to - door related activities , unless you want to come in early or stay late .
You wo n’t get paid more if you do , though .
I do n’t know about you , but 300 dollars a week for 60 hours does n’t quite work for me ( And it would n’t work for the federal government , either : that ’s below minimum wage ) .

_____________________________________________________________________
Can Any of This Be Verified ?
It sure can .
There are people , literally in every major city around the country , who have experienced this same thing .
Every year , the Fund hires almost 60 new canvass directors ( “ citizen outreach directors ” ) .
These recent college graduates start in July , and by December , almost 30 percent of them have quit or been fired by the Fund for various reasons .
They will tell you the same thing I have .
While I really can’t give out other people ’s email addresses over the web , there have been a number of articles published that document what I ’m talking about .
Here are some links :
http://www.laweekly.com/ink/02/12/news-ehrenreich.php :
This will take you to an LA weekly article about how the Fund fired two directors after they tried to form a union .
I ca n’t believe this is legal ; if it is , it certainly violates almost every principle the Fund claims it has on workers ’ rights .
http://thestudentunderground.org/article.php3?Issue=36&ArticleID=163 : This article from the Student Underground is interesting , and disturbing , but more important are the comments from students who had worked for the Fund following the article .
You ’ll find them saying the same things I ’ve said here .
Here ’s a link to a letter I sent to the on -campus recruiting head at the College of William and Mary , my alma mater .
It basically says a lot of what I ’ve already said here , but I post it just to show that I ’m willing to stake my reputation at my alma mater on the veracity of what I ’m saying .
The Director of Career Services at the College recently contacted me , and said they are investigating the matter .
Plus , I have some former Fund employees who will be more than happy to verify what goes on there .
If you ’d like to email me , they would be happy to email you personally with their rather disturbing stories .

Certainly some of the parallels are coincidental .
It is unlikely , for example , that the writers knew Mr. Obama had an affection for Bob Dylan when they made Santos a Dylan fan .
But it is the unintentional similarities that make the DVDs of the sixth and seventh seasons , which at the time received mixed reviews , so rewarding to watch now .
In both “ The West Wing ” and in real life , for example , the Phillies played in the World Series during the election campaign .

As the primaries unfolded this year , “ I saw the similarities right away , ” said Lawrence O’Donnell , a producer and writer for the series who has appeared on MSNBC as a political analyst .
Mr. O’Donnell had used Mr. McCain as one of the templates for the Vinick character in the episodes he wrote , though he said that “ McCain ’s resemblance to the Vinick character was much stronger in 2000 than in 2008 . ”
Echoing the criticism Mr. McCain faced during the primaries , a White House aide in “ The West Wing ” contends that Vinick is “ not conservative enough ” for the Republican base .
Sometimes the two candidates ’ situations are almost identical : when the press starts asking where Vinick attends church , he tells his staff that “ I have n’t gone to church for a while . ”
Asked in July by The New York Times about the frequency of his church attendance , Mr. McCain said , “ Not as often as I should . ”
Mr. Alda and Mr. McCain are the same age .
When a hard - edged strategist played by Janeane Garofalo joins the Santos campaign , she immediately alludes to Vinick ’s age .
“ He ’s been in the Senate for like 90 years .
He was practically born in a committee room , ” she says .
In the same way that Obama surrogates have subtly knocked Mr. McCain ’s lack of computer skills , the Garofalo character remarks to the Santos campaign manager , Josh Lyman : “ Why are you always talking about high - tech jobs ?
Because Vinick uses a manual typewriter . ”
Conversely , Santos staffers talk about getting video of the candidate with his “ adorable young children hugging their hale and vital dad . ”
The casting of Mr. Smits introduced story lines about the prospect of a minority president .
But when an aide suggests a fund - raising drive in a Latino community , Santos snaps : “ I do n’t want to just be the brown candidate .
I want to be the American candidate . ”
The Obama campaign has made similar assertions .
First - time Australian - Indian novelist Aravind Adiga has won the Man Booker Prize with The White Tiger .
The 33 - year - old is only the third debut novelist to claim the prestigious literary award in its 40 - year history .
He receives a cheque for 50,000 pounds ( $ 125,000 ) and can expect a significant spike in book sales in the run-up to Christmas .
Booker organisers say last year 's winner , Anne Enright , has sold around 500,000 copies of The Gathering - largely due to the prize .
" I would like to dedicate this award to the people of New Delhi , " Adiga said on accepting the prize , adding that 300 years ago it was the most important city on in the world and could become so again .
Michael Portillo , chairman of the five - member judging panel , praised Adiga 's White Tiger for tackling important social and political issues in modern - day India .
" What sets this one apart was its originality , " Mr Portillo told reporters in London .
" For many of us this was entirely new territory - the dark side of India .
" It 's a book that gains from dealing with very important social issues - the divisions between rich and poor and the impossibilty of the poor escaping from their lot in India .
" It tackles these global issues and social issues with tremendous humour , and it is a book which is extremely readable .
It is his first novel , and I imagine [ this prize ] will come as rather good news to Aravind Adiga . "
Adiga was one of six novelists on the shortlist for the prize , which rewards the best novel of the year by a citizen of the Commonwealth of former British colonies or Ireland .
He beat Australian - born Steve Toltz 's A Fraction Of The Whole .
Toltz is in London for the awards .
Earlier , he said he did not believe he would win .
Also nominated were India 's Amitav Ghosh , Britons Linda Grant and Philip Hensher and Ireland 's Sebastian Barry .
Adiga was born in Madras on October 23 , 1974 , and brought up partly in Australia .
He holds dual citizenship in both countries .
He studied at Columbia and Oxford universities before working as a journalist .
He now lives in Mumbai .
He is the fourth Indian - born author to win the Booker Prize since it was set up in 1969 , joining compatriots Salman Rushdie , Arundhati Roy and Kiran Desai .
The book is the ninth winning novel to take its inspiration from India or Indian identity .
Some have accused Adiga of painting a negative picture of modern India and its huge underclass .
But Adiga says the novel is meant to be provocative .
" It 's not a book that 's meant to ingratiate itself with anyone , " Adiga told the BBC before the prize was announced .
" The tone of it was meant to be provocative and even a bit nasty at times .
It 's meant to get people thinking . "

Photovoltaic cells , once so costly they could be used only to power million - dollar satellites , are today turning up even on humble parking meters .
Now a brash Tempe , Ariz. , company called First Solar plans to take the technology to the next level by making it cost - effective enough to compete with coal - fired generation .
Achieving grid parity -- selling power to the nation 's electric grid at a competitive price -- has long been a holy grail of the photovoltaic industry and other suppliers of alternative energy .
Yet despite the company 's soaring price share and its multimilliion - dollar order book , First Solar declines to speak to journalists .
In the August issue of IEEE Spectrum , British writer Richard Stevenson combines a journalist 's knack for investigation with the expertise of a solid - state physicist to piece together how First Solar has cracked the problem .
He concludes that the secret involves not the photovoltaic cell itself but the way in which it is manufactured .
Instead of the familiar silicon , the design uses a compound of cadmium and tellurium .
Not long ago it was little more than a laboratory curiosity , largely because nobody had found a practical way to make the cells much larger than a postage stamp .
First Solar has now refined the manufacturing procedure to blow up the cells to poster size .
Already the firm has been able to make a profit selling the panels to utilities in a number of countries -- particularly Germany -- that subsidize alternative energy sources for environmental reasons .
Available figures suggest that the manufacturing cost per watt delivered is still too high to compete with that of power delivered on the grid , but First Solar has told investors that it expects to be able to lower the cost substantially .
It seems likely that such improvements , together with the rising price of fossil fuels generally , will enable the company to reach grid parity within just a few years .
Indeed , the technology is so promising that it puts into question whether there will be enough tellurium available to make all the solar panels the world is likely to demand .
Stevenson 's conclusion is that the answer is yes , because increased demand for the panels will stimulate the search for new supplies of the scarce element .
Meanwhile , other photovoltaic technologies continue to advance , not the least of which is silicon .
If , as expected , the current shortage of silicon should abate in the coming years , then First Solar 's clear lead on the industry may narrow .
In any case , photovoltaic cells seem poised to advance from their current role in niche applications to become one of the more important sources of electricity in the world .

The US Housing Bill 2008 : Part IX
The Peter G. Peterson Foundation is now marketing a new documentary called I.O.U.S.A .
I have only seen the trailer .
Based on my reading the website and watching the trailer , I 'd say that it is slick , Orwellian hogwash .
If the national debt was almost ten trillion dollars before the housing bill and , if my estimate is right , approximately ten trillion dollars has been stolen since 1997 , then do we have a debt problem or do we have an aristocracy problem ?
One of the beauties of I.O.U.S.A. is that all the luminaries interviewed as experts on this “ debt problem ” were in a position to stop or warn us that the $ 10 trillion dollars was leaving .
They did not .
The implication is that the American people are slobs who are irresponsible and wrecked the place while the leaders who ran the country were helpless to do a thing about it .
Let ’s set the record straight :
If energy technology had not been suppressed for the past 100 years , our energy costs would be a pittance compared to what they are now , and our savings would be much higher .
If countless medical discoveries had not been suppressed , we would not be looking at such ridiculous costs for health insurance , Medicare and Medicaid .
If government had produced proper financial statements as required by law and had also produced such disclosure contiguous to Congressional districts , the housing bubble and a lot of other bubbles could never have happened .
If the currency and monetary systems had been run in the manner envisioned by the founding fathers rather than by private bankers , we would not have any debt .
If the American media and government had communicated honestly about our problems for the past few decades , we would not be in this pickle .
If wasteful defense spending and disappearing money had not defined the Pentagon for quite some time , things would look very different .
I once had a wonderful employee when I was the Assistant Secretary of Housing .
He told me that the way to clean up a big mortgage mess was to view the problem as the solution .
He said , “ In the destruction of the old , let there be the creation of the new . ”
America does not have a debt problem .
We have a political problem .
We have created a system where secret governments can steal and have Congress , the U.S. Treasury , and the Federal Reserve replace whatever they stole .
The theory is that the end of the world will come unless we bail them out .
That is not true , for all the reasons you learned in kindergarten about letting bullies have their way .
The implication of the trailer for I.O.U.S.A. is that we must turn to these great financial leaders to lead us out of our mess .
But if they were truly leading , how did we get in this mess in the first place ?
How did billions of fraudulent securities get sold around the world ?
Why were several generations of Americans fraudulently induced to take on student debt and mortgage debt they could not afford ?
In the destruction of the old , let there be the creation of the new .
This begins with seeing the housing bill as it is .
When I finished reading the housing bill , I realized that it was more economic — on a risk - adjusted basis — for a young person to learn how to build a home than to manage dealing with the current homebuilding and mortgage finance industry .
Mind you , I say this as a former Assistant Secretary of Housing .
Shortly thereafter , I recently spoke to an attorney whose son was leaving for boarding school .
She indicated that she was having similar thoughts .
Why should n’t his education include learning to build and repair his own home ?
I also realized that the rich resources that the passage of this housing bill makes available would now be available for currency and market manipulation .
Sure enough : dollar up , gold down .
( See Silicon Investor Dollar Intervention Chart . )
For some temporary period of time , the price of everything that has no inherent value is rising and the price of anything that has tangible value is falling .
This , however , is temporary .
As someone wrote recently about the additional write - offs that one of the large banks was taking , whatever money you put into these things , it just disappears .
They will be back for more .
They ca n’t create wealth , they just consume it .
If there is to be any blessing in this housing bill , perhaps it will be to so offend , so disgust those of us who are awake that the process of withdrawing from the old and reinvesting in the new models will accelerate .
And maybe the smartest and most creative among us will be willing to invest the time and energy it takes to reinvent a model that incorporates what we like to think are traditional American values .
These are the values that are enduring and make us proud to be Americans still .
There is no hint of these values in the housing bill .
There is , however , an abundance of them in the hearts and minds of the people .
In the destruction of the old , let there be the creation of the new .

A while back , I woke up one morning thinking , John Resig ’s got some great CSS3 support in jQuery but it ’s all forced into JS statements .
I should ask him if he could set things up like Dean Edwards ‘ IE7 script so that the JS scans the author ’s CSS , finds the advanced selectors , does any necessary backend juggling , and makes CSS3 selector support Transparently Just Work .
And then he could put that back into jQuery .
And then , after breakfast , I fired up my feed reader and saw Simon Willison ‘s link to John Resig ’s nascent Sizzle project .
I swear to Ged this is how it happened .
Personally , I ca n’t wait for Sizzle to be finished , because I ’m absolutely going to use it and recommend its use far and wide .
As far as I ’m concerned , though , it ’s a first step into a larger world .
Think about it : most of the browser development work these days seems to be going into JavaScript performance .
Those engines are being overhauled and souped up and tuned and re-tuned to the point that performance is improving by orders of magnitude .
Scanning the DOM tree and doing things to it , which used to be slow and difficult , is becoming lightning - fast and easy .
So why not write JS to implement multiple background - image support in all browsers ?
All that ’s needed is to scan the CSS , find instances of multiple - image backgrounds , and then dynamically add div s , one per extra background image , to get the intended effect .
Just like that , you ’ve used the browser ’s JS to extend its CSS support .
This approach advances standards support in browsers from the ground up , instead of waiting for the browser teams to do it for us .
I suspect that not quite everything in CSS3 will be amenable to this approach , but you might be surprised .
Seems to me that you could do background sizing with some div - and - positioning tricks , and text - shadow could be supportable using a sIFR - like technique , though line breaks would be a bear to handle .
RGBa and HSLa colors could be simulated with creative element reworking and opacity , and HSL itself could be ( mostly ? ) supported in IE with HSL - to - RGB calculations .
And so on .
There are two primary benefits here .
The first is obvious : we can stop waiting around for browser makers to give us what we want , thanks to their efforts on JS engines , and start using the advanced CSS we ’ve been hearing about for years .
The second is that the process of finding out which parts of the spec work in the real world , and which fall down , will be greatly accelerated .
If it turns out nobody uses ( say ) background - clip , even given its availability via a CSS / JS library , then that ’s worth knowing .
What I wonder is whether the W3C could be convinced that two JavaScript libraries supporting a given CSS module would constitute “ interoperable implementations ” , and thus allow the specification to move forward on the process track .
Or heck , what about considering a single library getting consistent support in two or more browsers as interoperable ?
There ’s a chance here to jump - start the entire process , front to back .
It is true that browsers without JavaScript will not get the advanced CSS effects , but older browsers do n’t get our current CSS , and we use it anyway .
( Still older browsers do n’t understand any CSS at all . )
It ’s the same problem we ’ve always faced , and everyone will face it differently .
We do n’t have to restrict this to CSS , either .
As I showed with my href - anywhere demo , it ’s possible to extend markup using JS .
( No , not without breaking validation : you ’d need a custom DTD for that .
Hmmm . )
So it would be possible to use JS to , say , add audio and video support to currently - available browsers , and even older browsers .
All you ’d have to do is convert the HTML5 element into HTML4 elements , dynamically writing out the needed attributes and so forth .
It might not be a perfect 1:1 translation , but it would likely be serviceable — and would tear down some of the highest barriers to adoption .
There ’s more to consider , as well : the ability to create our very own “ standards ” .
Maybe you ’ve always wanted a text - shake property , which jiggles the letters up and down randomly to look like the element got shaken up a bit .
Call it - myCSS - text - shake or something else with a proper “ vendor ” prefix — we ’re all vendors now , baby ! — and go to town .
Who knows ?
If a property or markup element or attribute suddenly takes off like wildfire , it might well make it into a specification .
After all , the HTML 5 Working Group is now explicitly set up to prefer things which are implemented over things that are not .
Perhaps the CSS Working Group would move in a similar direction , given a world where we were all experimenting with our own ideas and seeing the best ideas gain widespread adoption .
In the end , as I said in Chicago last week , the triumph of standards ( specifically , the DOM standard ) will permit us to push standards support forward now , and save some standards that are currently dying on the vine .
All we have to do now is start pushing .
Sizzle is a start .
Who will take the next step , and the step after that ?
Never before has the Federal Reserve felt compelled to commit tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to shore up a company it does not regulate .
But now that the Fed is doing just that with its $ 85 billion bailout of the American International Group ( AIG ) , it 's time for Congress to reform how insurance companies are regulated .
AIG , like almost ...
“ I ’m not a real believer in limits , ” Mr. Johnson said .
Mr. Johnson rarely speaks at length with reporters .
But in a series of conversations , he said he was motivated by a belief in Mr. McCain and the democratic process .
“ I only take on things I really believe in , ” he said .
But Mr. Johnson also clearly has his own agenda .
Staff members on Capitol Hill credit him with playing a pivotal role in 2002 in pushing members of Congress , including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert , to allocate $ 750 million over five years for juvenile diabetes research .
Mr. Johnson ’s oldest daughter , Casey , has Type 1 diabetes , and he has given millions to the search for a cure .
“ We sat down and talked a couple times , ” said Mr. Hastert , who added that he and Mr. Johnson had bonded over football .
“ He made a very good case that by investing U.S. dollars , we could actually save money . ”
Mr. Johnson , who has another daughter with the autoimmune disease lupus and raised millions for that cause , also met with President Bush in the White House to push for embryonic stem - cell research , a meeting Mr. Johnson believes might have helped Mr. Bush to compromise in his policy and still allow federal financing for research on existing stem - cell lines .
Mr. Johnson ’s political clout has certainly not hurt him as owner of the Jets and in the search for a new stadium for the team , even if his quest to build one in Manhattan ultimately fell short .
He is candid about the need to make contributions to New York and New Jersey Democrats as well , given his business interests in the region .
The Jets and the Giants are building an $ 1.6 billion stadium together in New Jersey , but some critics have questioned the wisdom of the state ’s assuming $ 100 million in debt to pay off the teams ’ old stadium as part of the deal .
Like other major donors , Mr. Johnson has traveled with Mr. McCain on the campaign trail .
Mr. McCain also calls him on occasion to thank him .
But Mr. Johnson plays down the access he has , saying he is no different from anyone else .
Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to challenge voter registrations David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In a closely - watched case involving disputed voter registrations , the US Supreme Court has overturned a ruling by a federal judge in Ohio that could have forced as many as 200,000 newly - registered voters whose information does not perfectly match that in social security or motor vehicle databases to cast provisional ballots .
Those discrepancies typically involve minor differences or even typographical errors .
For example , " Joe the Plumber " -- whose full name is Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher -- is listed on Ohio voter roles as " Worzelbacher . "
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Friday that only the federal government -- and not a private party like the Republican Party -- has the right to sue the state of Ohio over the implementation of the Help America Vote Act .
As a result , Ohio's Democratic Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , will not have to hand over the list of names , which could have been used by Republicans to challenge those voters on Election Day .
Fox News 's Megyn Kelly saw the decision as a partisan victory for the Democrats .
" I 'm surprised that the full court sided with the Democrats on this , " she stated , " because I 'm surprised they wanted to wade into election law again . "
Kelly acknowledged that " on the merits , I understand the decision . "
However , she insisted that Secretary of State Brunner " is in blatant violation of her obligations under the Help America Vote Act . "
" You cannot overstate the importance of this , " Kelly continued .
" President Bush won Ohio by less than 200,000 votes in both 2000 and 2004 .
...
The Secretary of State of Ohio has said , of the 660,000 new voters ... at least 200,000 have been identified as potentially problematic .
The GOP said , ' Fork over the list . '
She said no .
...
And now she wo n't have to do it .
" They 're going to get to cast a real ballot , " Kelly concluded unhappily .

PARIS  Just over 100 years ago , J. P. Morgan gathered his fellow financiers at his Manhattan mansion amid growing financial panic and declared , “ This is where the trouble stops . ”
Last weekend , as one of the gravest crises since then accelerated , a similar conclave gathered farther downtown , at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
This time , the Fed chairman and the Treasury secretary summoned the bosses of Wall Street giants including Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and , yes , JPMorgan .
The officials had a similar ultimatum : find an industry solution to halt the undoing of Wall Street ’s financial order .
But , different from the action that brought the successful denouement to the Panic of 1907 , banks did not want to gamble their own position to prevent , in this case , the demise of Lehman Brothers .
If Bruce Springsteen were to record the soundtrack for the last couple weeks of the McCain campaign , the first single would be " I 'm goin ' down . "
And the emphasis on the word ' down ' could n't be more appropriate for these last two weeks .
After all , Springsteen repeats it 86 times .
That 's not to say the campaign is a Hindenburg .
But before cries of " Oh , the humanity " emanate from inside the Republican ticket , they 've got some turning around to do .
Poll numbers
New poll numbers from Tuesday 's debate are in – courtesy of Gallup and USA Today .
Most people polled fell asleep did n't change their feelings about either candidate .
Some 54 percent said Obama 's performance did n't change their opinion of him , while 53 percent said they felt the same way about McCain following the debate .
But that 's where the common ground stops .
Of those polled , 34 percent had more favorable opinions of the Democratic nominee following the event , while 33 percent had more unfavorable opinions of McCain .
Not surprisingly , those polled thought Obama " won " the debate , with 56 percent thinking Obama did a better job , compared with only 23 percent preferring McCain 's performance .
Underdog is here
News of this poll did n't seem to deflate the Republican nominee .
In fact , it might have just fired him up .
Speaking in Wisconsin today , McCain dismissed those who have declared him legally dead in the past .
And you 've got to give McCain some credit here .
That list is plenty long .
" Do you know how many times the political pundits in the last two years have written off my campaign ? "
McCain asked the crowd .
" We 'll win the state of Wisconsin and we 'll win this election and you can count on it because we will go to the American people and take our message to them . "
Charlie Gibson
Speaking to ABC's Charlie Gibson on Thursday , he repeated his underdog mantra .
" This is a tough campaign , " McCain said .
" I 'm the underdog .
I 've always been the underdog from the beginning .
I was the underdog in the primaries . "
How 's the weather ?
With the McCain campaign 's laser - like focus on Barack Obama 's relationship with Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers in the recent week , it did seem a little odd that Senator McCain did n't bring it up in the debate .
In the meantime , the campaign has unleashed a series of ads about Ayers while McCain 's running mate is mentioning him at every campaign stop leading some to say her speech consists of a noun , a verb and a " Obama hangs out with terrorist Bill Ayers . "
Gibson did bring up Ayers in the interview .
McCain said the attacks are not about Obama 's character , but more about Obama 's judgment .
" Does he have the experience , knowledge , and judgment and has he made the right decisions and has he ... been candid with the American people ? " he asked .
Hillary
Just like a month ago when the McCain campaign tried to make some hay by bringing up Senator Hillary Clinton , McCain brought her up with Gibson .
" Sen . Clinton in their debates said that the American people did n't know enough about him , including his relationship with Mr. Ayers .
That 's what she said .
And I agree with that . "
One commissioner , Harvey J. Goldschmid , questioned the staff about the consequences of the proposed exemption .
It would only be available for the largest firms , he was reassuringly told — those with assets greater than $ 5 billion .
“ We ’ve said these are the big guys , ” Mr. Goldschmid said , provoking nervous laughter , “ but that means if anything goes wrong , it ’s going to be an awfully big mess . ”
Mr. Goldschmid , an authority on securities law from Columbia , was a behind - the - scenes adviser in 2002 to Senator Paul S. Sarbanes when he rewrote the nation ’s corporate laws after a wave of accounting scandals .
“ Do we feel secure if there are these drops in capital we really will have investor protection ? ” Mr. Goldschmid asked .
A senior staff member said the commission would hire the best minds , including people with strong quantitative skills to parse the banks ’ balance sheets .
Annette L. Nazareth , the head of market regulation , reassured the commission that under the new rules , the companies for the first time could be restricted by the commission from excessively risky activity .
She was later appointed a commissioner and served until January 2008 .
“ I ’m very happy to support it , ” said Commissioner Roel C. Campos , a former federal prosecutor and owner of a small radio broadcasting company from Houston , who then deadpanned : “ And I keep my fingers crossed for the future . ”
The proceeding was sparsely attended .
None of the major media outlets , including The New York Times , covered it .
After 55 minutes of discussion , which can now be heard on the Web sites of the agency and The Times , the chairman , William H. Donaldson , a veteran Wall Street executive , called for a vote .
It was unanimous .
The decision , changing what was known as the net capital rule , was completed and published in The Federal Register a few months later .
And after the fall winter comes , so many children wanna ride their ice slides and have a good time .

Nick Johnson , of Google , has created a nice bridge service smtp2web.com : Allow App Engine apps to receive email .
This is perfect timing , as after my App Engine talk in Prague , a nice gent came up to me and asked for just this .
He wanted to process email in his application and did n’t think he could .
One shortcoming of purely HTTP - based webapps such as App Engine is
that they ca n’t receive email .
I know that some people are wanting to
create App Engine apps that do this , so I put together a service to
facilitate this .
It runs as a standard SMTP server , and sends all the
email it receives via HTTP POST to a user - designated URL .
It ’s free to
use ( but not to abuse )
To use the service , you setup an email account ( say [ email protected ] ) and a URL to point too .
Of course , if you want an email on your own domain you could alias [ email protected ] to [ email protected ] ) .
Then , you would configure an App Engine controller to receive the email contents :
from google .
appengine .
ext import webapp import email class EmailHandler ( webapp .
RequestHandler ) : def post ( self ) : sender = self .
request .
GET . get ( " from " , " " ) recipient = self .
request .
GET . get ( " to " , " " ) message = email .
message_from_string ( self .
request .
body ) #
Do stuff with the email message
The code for the service has also been released as open source on Google Code so you can check it out .
You will find that it runs as a Twisted application :
from twisted .
application import service from twisted .
application import internet from twisted .
enterprise import adbapi import sys import os sys .
path .
append ( os . path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) import smtp2web application = service .
Application ( " smtp2web Service " ) settings = smtp2web .
Settings ( secret_key = " < enter secret key here > " , state_file= " state " , master_host= " localhost:8081 " ) smtpServerFactory = smtp2web .
ESMTPFactory ( settings ) smtpServerService = internet .
TCPServer ( 2025 , smtpServerFactory ) smtpServerService .
setServiceParent ( application )
Thanks for doing this Nick !
NOTE : Mailhook is another service ( pay ) that does something similar
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Written references could become old hat for hiring managers with one in five saying they use social networking sites to research job candidates -- and a third of them dismissing the candidate after what they discover .
An office worker types in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
A survey by online job site CareerBuilder.com of 3,169 hiring managers found 22 percent of them screened potential staff via social networking profiles , up from 11 percent in 2006 .
An additional nine percent said they do n’t currently use social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace to screen potential employees but they do plan to start .
The survey found that 34 percent of the managers who do screen candidates on the Internet found content that made them drop the candidate from any short list .
The top area for concern among the hiring managers with 41 percent citing this as a downfall were candidates posting information about drinking or using drugs .
The second area with 40 percent of concern were candidates posting provocative or inappropriate photographs or information .
Other areas of concern to arise from social network sites were poor communication skills , lying about qualifications , candidates using discriminatory remarks related to race , gender or religion , and an unprofessional screen name .
But the survey found hiring managers scouring social network pages was not all bad with 24 percent of these managers saying they found content to help them solidify their decision to hire that candidate .
Top factors that influenced their hiring decision included candidate ’s backgrounds supporting their qualifications for the job , proving they had good communications skills , and having a site that conveyed a professional image with a wide range of interests .
“ Hiring managers are using the Internet to get a more well - rounded view of job candidates in terms of their skills , accomplishments and overall fit within the company , ” said CareerBuilder.com spokeswoman Rosemary Haefner in a statement .
“ As a result , more job seekers are taking action to make their social networking profiles employer - friendly .
Sixteen percent of workers who have social networking pages said they modified the content on their profile to convey a more professional image to potential employers . ”

By Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin
September 30 , 2008 -- The Bullet -- ' They say they wo n't intervene .
But they will . '
This is how Robert Rubin , Bill Clinton 's treasury secretary , responded to Paul O'Neill , the first treasury secretary under George W. Bush , who openly criticised his predecessor 's interventions in the face of what Rubin called ' the messy reality of global financial crises . '[ 1 ]
The current dramatic conjuncture of financial crisis and state intervention has proven Rubin more correct than he could have imagined .
But it also demonstrates why those , whether from the right or the left , who have only understood the era of neoliberalism ideologically – i.e. in terms of a hegemonic ideological determination to free markets from states – have had such a weak handle on discerning what really has been going on over the past quarter century .
Clinging to this type of understanding will also get in the way of the thinking necessary to advance a socialist strategy in the wake of this crisis . [ 2 ]
Markets , states and US empire
The fundamental relationship between capitalist states and financial markets cannot be understood in terms of how much or little regulation the former puts upon the latter .
It needs to be understood in terms of the guarantee the state provides to property , above all in the form of the promise not to default on its bonds – which are themselves the foundation of financial markets ' role in capital accumulation .
But not all states are equally able , or trusted as willing ( especially since the Russian Revolution ) , to honour this guarantee .
The US state emerged in the 20th century as an entirely new kind of imperial state precisely because it took utmost responsibility for honouring this guarantee itself , while promoting a world order of independent nation states which the new empire would expect to behave as capitalist states .
Since World War
Two , the US state has been not just the dominant state in the capitalist world but the state responsible for overseeing the expansion of capitalism to its current global dimensions and for organising the management of its economic contradictions .
It has done this not through the displacement but through the penetration and integration of other states .
This included their internationalisation in the sense of their cooperation in taking responsibility for global accumulation within their borders and their cooperation in setting the international rules for trade and investment .
It was the credibility of the US state 's guarantee to property which ensured that , even amidst the Great Depression and business hostility to the New Deal 's union and welfare reforms , private funds were readily available as loans to all the new public agencies created in that era .
This was also why whatever liquid foreign funds that could escape the capital controls of other states in that decade made their way to New York , and so much of the world 's gold filled the vaults of Fort Knox .
And it is this which helps explain why it fell to the US state to take responsibility for making international capitalism viable again after 1945 , with the fixed exchange rate for its dollar established at Bretton Woods providing the sole global currency intermediary for gold .
When it proved by the 1960s that those who held US dollar would have to suffer a devaluation of their funds through inflation , the fiction of a continuing gold standard was abandoned .
The world 's financial system was now explicitly based on the dollar as US - made ' fiat money ' , backed by an iron clad guarantee against default of US Treasury bonds which were now treated as ' good as gold ' .
Today 's global financial order has been founded on this ; and this is why US Treasury bonds are the fundamental basis from which calculations of value of all forms of financial instruments begin .
To be sure , the end of fixed exchange rates and a dollar nominally tied to gold now meant that it had to be accepted internationally that the returns to those who held US assets would reflect the fluctuating value of US dollars in currency markets .
But the commitment by the Federal Reserve and Treasury to an anti-inflation priority via the founding act of neoliberalism – the ' Volcker shock ' of 1979 – assuaged that problem .
( This ' defining - moment ' of US state intervention , like the current one , came in the run-up to a presidential election – i.e. before Reagan 's election , and with bipartisan support and the support of industrial and well as financial capital in the US and abroad . )
As the US state took the lead , by its example and its pressure on other states around the world , to give priority to low inflation as a much stronger and ongoing commitment than before , this bolstered finance capital 's confidence in the substantive value of lending ; and after the initial astronomical interest rates produced by the Volcker shock , this soon made an era of low interest rates possible .
Throughout the neoliberal era , the enormous demand for US bonds and the low interest paid on them has rested on this foundation .
This was reinforced by the defeat of US trade unionism ; by the intense competition in financial markets domestically and internationally ; by financial capital 's pressures on firms to lower costs through restructuring if they are to justify more capital investment ; by the reallocation of capital across sectors and especially the provision of venture capital to support new technologies in new leading sectors of capital accumulation ; and by the ' Americanisation of finance ' in other states and the consequent access this provided the US state to global savings .
Deregulation was more a consequence than the main cause of the intense competition in financial markets and its attendant effects .
By 1990 , this competition had already led to banks scheming to escape the reserve requirements of the Basel bank regulations by creating ' Structured Investment Vehicles ' to hold these and other risky derivative assets .
It also led to the increased blurring of the lines between commercial and investment banking , insurance and real estate in the FIRE ( finance , insurane , real estate ) sector of the US economy .
Competition in the financial sector fostered all kinds of innovations in financial instruments which allowed for high leveraging of the funds that could be accessed via low interest rates .
This meant that there was an explosion in the effective money supply ( this was highly ironic in terms of the monetarist theories that are usually thought to have founded neoliberalism ) .
The competition to purchase assets with these funds replaced price inflation with the asset inflation that characterised the whole era .
This was reinforced by the US state 's readiness to throw further liquidity into the financial system whenever a specific asset bubble burst ( while imposing austerity on economies in the South as the condition for the liquidity the IMF and World Bank provided to their financial markets at moments of crisis ) .
All this was central to the uneven and often chaotic making of global capitalism over the past quarter century , to the crises that have punctuated it , and to the active role of the US state in containing them .
Meanwhile , the world beat a path to US financial markets not only because of the demand for Treasury bills , and not only because of Wall Street 's linkages to US capital more generally , but also because of the depth and breadth of its financial markets – which had much to do with US financial capital 's relation to the popular classes .
The American Dream has always materially entailed promoting their integration into the circuits of financial capital , whether as independent commodity farmers , as workers whose pay cheques were deposited with banks and whose pension savings were invested in the stock market , as consumers reliant on credit , and not least as heavily mortgaged home owners .
It is the form that this incorporation of the mass of the US population took in the neoliberal context of competition , inequality and capital mobility , much more than the degree of supposed ' deregulation ' of financial markets , that helps explain the dynamism and longevity of the finance - led neoliberal era .
But it also helped trigger the current crisis – and the massive state intervention in response to it .
From ' Great Society ' to sub - prime mortgages
The scale of the current crisis , which significantly has its roots in housing finance , cannot be understood apart from how the defeat of US trade unionism played out by the first years of the 21st century .
Constrained in what they could get from their labour for two decades , workers were drawn into the logic of asset inflation in the age of neoliberal finance not only via the institutional investment of their pensions , but also via the one major asset they held in their own hands ( or could aspire to hold ) – their family home .
It is significant that this went so far as the attempted integration via financial markets of poor African - American communities , so long the Achilles heel of working - class integration into the American Dream .
The roots of the sub - prime mortgage crisis , triggering the collapse of the mountain of repackaged and resold securitised derivative assets to hedge the risk involved in lending to poor people , lay in the way the anti-inflation commitment had since the 1970s ruled out the massive public expenditures that would have been required to even begin to address the crisis of inadequate housing in US cities .
As the ' Great Society ' public expenditure programs of the 1960s ran up against the need to redeem the imperial state 's anti-inflationary commitments , financial market became the mechanism for doing this .
In 1977 , the government - sponsored mortgage companies , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ( the New Deal public housing corporation privatised by Lyndon Johnson in 1968 before the word neoliberalism was invented ) , were required by the Community Reinvestment
Act to sustain home loans by banks in poor communities .
This effectively initiated that portion of the open market in mortgage - backed securities that was directed towards securing private financing for housing for low income families .
From modest beginnings this only really took off with the inflation of residential real estate values after the recession of the early 1990s and the Clinton administration 's embrace of neoliberalism leading to its reinforcement of a reliance on financial markets rather than public expenditures as the primary means of integrating working class , Black and Hispanic communities .
The Bush Republicans ' determination to open up competition to sell and trade mortgages and mortgage - backed securities to all comers was in turn reinforced by the Greenspan Fed'eral Reserve 's dramatic lowering of real interest to almost zero in response to the bursting of the dotcom bubble and to 9/11 .
But this was a policy that was only sustainable via the flow of global savings to the US , not least to the apparent Treasury - plated safety of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities as government sponsored enterprises .
It was this long chain of events that led to the massive funding of mortgages , the hedging and default derivatives based on this , the rating agencies AAA rating of them , and their spread onto the books of many foreign institutions .
This included the world 's biggest insurance company , AIG , and the great New York investment banks , whose own traditional business of corporate and government finance around the globe was now itself heavily mortgaged to the mortgages that had been sold in poor communities in the US and then resold many times over .
The global attraction and strength of US finance was seen to be rooted in its depth and breadth at home , and this meant that when the crisis hit in the sub - prime security market at the heart of the empire , it immediately had implications for the banking systems of many other countries .
The scale of the US government 's intervention has certainly been a function of the consequent unraveling of the crisis throughout its integrated domestic financial system .
Yet it is also important to understand this in terms of its imperial responsibilities as the state of global capital .
This is why it fell to the Fed to repeatedly pump billions of dollars via foreign central banks into inter - bank markets abroad , where banks balance their books through the overnight borrowing of dollars from other banks .
And an important factor in the nationalisations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the need to redeem the expectations of foreign investors ( including the Japanese and Chinese central banks ) that the US government would never default on its debt obligations .
It is for this reason that even those foreign leaders who have opportunistically pronounced the end of US ' financial superpower status ' have credited the US Treasury for ' acting not just in the US interests but also in the interests of other nations . '[ 3 ]
The US was not being altruistic in doing this , since not to do it would have risked a run on the dollar .
But this is precisely the point .
The US state cannot act in the interests of US capitalism without also reflecting the logic of US capitalism 's integration with global capitalism both economically and politically .
This is why it is always misleading to portray the US state as merely representing its ' national interest ' while ignoring the structural role it plays in the making and reproduction of global capitalism .
A century of crises
It might be thought that the exposure of the state 's role in today 's financial crisis would once and for all rid people of the illusion that capitalists do n't want their states involved in their markets , or that capitalist states could ever be neutral and benign regulators in the public interest of markets .
Unfortunately , the widespread call today for the US state to ' go back ' to playing the role of such a regulator reveals that this illusion remains deeply engrained , and obscures an understanding of both the past and present history of the relationship between the state and finance in the US .
In October 1907 , near the beginning of the ' American Century ' , and exactly a hundred years before the onset of the current financial crisis , the US experienced a financial crisis that for anyone living through it would have seemed as great as today's .
Indeed , there were far more suicides in that crisis than in the current one , as ' Wall Street spent a cliff - hanging year ' which spanned a stock market crash , an 11 per cent decline in GDP , and accelerating runs on the banks .
[ 4 ]
At the core of the crisis was the practice of trust companies to draw money from banks at exorbitant interest rates and , without the protection of sufficient cash reserves , lend out so much of it against stock and bond speculation that almost half of the bank loans in New York had questionable securities as their only collateral .
When the trust companies were forced to call in some of their loans to stock market speculators , even interest rates which zoomed to well over 100 per cent on margin loans could not attract funds .
European investors started withdrawing funds from the US .
Whereas European central banking had its roots in ' haute finance ' far removed from the popular classes , US small farmers ' dependence on credit had made them hostile to a central bank that they recognised would serve bankers ' interests .
In the absence of a central bank , both the US Treasury and Wall Street relied on JP Morgan to organise the bailout of 1907 .
As Henry Paulson did with Lehman 's a century later , Morgan let the giant Knickerbocker Trust go under in spite of its holding $ 50 million of deposits for 17,000 depositors ( ' I 've got to stop somewhere ' , Morgan said ) .
This only fuelled the panic and triggered runs on other financial firms including the Trust Company of America ( leading Morgan to pronounce that ' this is the place to stop the trouble ' ) .
Using $ 25 million put at his disposal by the Treasury , and calling together Wall Street 's bank presidents to demand they put up another $ 25 million ' within ten or twelve minutes ' ( which they did ) , Morgan dispensed the liquidity that began to calm the markets . [ 5 ]
When the Federal Reserve was finally established in 1913 , this was seen as Wilson 's great Progressive victory over the unaccountable big financiers .
( As Chernow 's monumental biography of Morgan put it , ' From the ashes of 1907 arose the Federal Reserve System : everyone saw that thrilling rescues by corpulent old tycoons were a tenuous prop for the banking system . '[ 6 ] )
Yet the main elements of the Federal Reserve Bill had already been drafted by the Morgan and Rockefeller interests during the previous Taft administration ; and although the Fed 's corporatist and decentralised structure of regional federal reserve boards reflected the compromise the final
Act made with populist pressures , its immediate effect was actually to cement the ' fusion of financial and government power . '[ 7 ]
This was so both in the sense of the Fed 's remit as the ' banker 's bank ' ( that is , a largely passive regulator of bank credit and a lender of last resort ) and also by virtue of the close ties between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the House of Morgan .
William McAdoo , Wilson 's Treasury Secretary , saw the Federal Reserve Act 's provisions allowing US banks to establish foreign branches in terms of laying the basis for the US ' to become the dominant financial power of the world and to extend our trade to every part of the world . '[ 8 ]
In fact , in its early decades , the Fed actually was 'a loose and inexperienced body with minimal effectiveness even in its domestic functions . '[ 9 ]
This was an important factor in the crash of 1929 and in the Fed 's perverse role in contributing to the Great Depression .
It was class pressures from below that produced FDR 's union and welfare reforms .
But the New Deal is misunderstood if it is simply seen in terms of a dichotomy of purpose and function between state and capitalist actors .
The strongest evidence of this was in the area of financial regulation , which established a corporatist ' network of public and semi-public bodies , individual firms and professional groups ' that existed in a symbiotic relationship with one another distanced from democratic pressures . [ 10 ]
While the Morgan empire was brought low by an alliance of new financial competitors and the state , the New Deal 's financial reforms , which were introduced before the union and welfare ones , protected the banks as a whole from hostile popular sentiments .
They restrained competition and excesses of speculation not so much by curbing the power of finance but rather through the fortification of key financial institutions , especially the New York investment banks that were to grow ever more powerful through the remainder of the century .
Despite the hostility of capitalists to FDR 's union and welfare reforms , by the time World War Two began , the New Dealers had struck what they themselves called their ' grand truce ' with business . [ 11 ]
And even though the Treasury 's Keynesian economists took the lead in rewriting the rules of international finance during World War Two ( producing no little tension with Wall Street ) , a resilient US financial capital was not external to the constitution of the Bretton Woods order : it was embedded within it and determined its particular character .
In the postwar period , the New Deal regulatory structure acted an incubator for financial capital 's growth and development .
The strong position of Wall Street was institutionally crystallised via the 1951 Accord reached between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury .
Whereas during the war the Fed ' had run the market for government securities with an iron fist ' in terms of controlling bond prices that were set by the Treasury , the Fed now took up the position long advocated by University of Chicago economists and set to work successfully organising Wall Street 's bond dealers into a self - governing association that would ensure they had ' sufficient depth and breadth ' to make ' a free market in government securities ' , and thus allow market forces to determine bond prices . [ 12 ]
The Fed 's Open Market Committee would then only intervene by ' leaning against the wind ' to correct ' a disorderly situation ' through its buying and selling Treasury bills .
Lingering concerns that Keynesian commitments to the priority of full employment and fiscal deficits might prevail in the Treasury were thus allayed : the Accord was designed to ensure that ' forces seen as more radical ' within any administration would find it difficult , at least without creating a crisis , to implement inflationary monetary policies . [ 13 ]
Profits in the financial sector were already growing faster than in industry in the 1950s .
By the early 1960s , the securitisation of commercial banking ( selling saving certificates rather than relying on deposits ) and the enormous expansion of investment banking ( including Morgan Stanley 's creation of the first viable computer model for analysing financial risk ) were already in train .
With the development of the unregulated Euromarket in dollars and the international expansion of US multinational corporations , the playing field for US finance was far larger than New Deal regulations could contain .
Both domestically and internationally , the baby had outgrown the incubator , which was in any case being buffeted by inflationary pressures stemming from union militancy and public expenditures on the Great Society programs and the Vietnam War .
The bank crisis of 1966 , the complaints by pension funds that fixed brokerage fees discriminated against workers ' savings , the series of scandals that beset Wall Street , all foretold the end of the corporatist structure of brokers , investment banks and corporate managers that had dominated domestic capital markets since the New Deal , culminating in Wall Street 's ' Big Bang ' of 1975 .
Meanwhile , the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system , due to inflationary pressures on the dollar as well as the massive growth in international trade and investment , laid the foundation for the derivatives revolution by leading to a massive demand for hedging risk by trading futures and options in exchange and interest rates .
The newly created Commodity Futures Trading Commission was quickly created less to regulate this new market than to facilitate its development . [ 14 ]
It was not so much neoliberal ideology that broke the old system of financial regulations as it was the contradictions that had emerged within that system .
If there was going to be any serious alternative to giving financial capital its head by the 1970s , this would have required going well beyond the old regulations and capital controls , and introducing qualitatively new policies to undermine the social power of finance .
This was recognised by those pushing for the more radical aspects of the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act , and who could have never foretold where the compromises struck with the banks to secure their loans would lead .
Where the socialist politics were stronger , the nationalisation of the financial system was being forcefully advanced as a demand by the mid 1970s .
The left of the British Labour Party were able to secure the passage of a conference resolution to nationalise the big banks and insurance companies in the City of London , albeit with no effect on a Labour government that embraced one of the IMF 's first structural adjustment programs .
In France , the Programme Commun of the late 1970s led to the Mitterand government 's bank nationalisations , but this was carried through in a way that ensured that the structure and function of the banks were not changed in the process .
In Canada , the directly elected local planning boards we proposed , which would draw on the surplus from a nationalised financial system to create jobs , were seen as the first step in a new strategy to get labour movements to think in ways that were not so cramped and defensive . [ 15 ]
Such alternatives – strongly opposed by social democratic politicians who soon accommodated themselves to the dynamics of finance - led neoliberalism and the ideology of efficient free markets – were soon forgotten amidst the general defeat of labour movements and socialist politics that characterised the new era .
Financial capitalists took the lead as a social force in demanding the defeat of those domestic social forces they blamed for creating the inflationary pressures which undermined the value of their assets .
The further growth of financial markets , increasingly characterised by competition , innovation and flexibility , was central to the resolution of the crisis of the 1970s .
Perhaps the most important aspect of the new age of finance was the central role it played in disciplining and integrating labour .
The industrial and political pressures from below that characterised the crisis of the 1970s could not have been countered and defeated without the discipline that a financial order built upon the mobility of capital placed upon firms .
' Shareholder value ' was in many respects a euphemism for how the discipline imposed by the competition for global investment funds was transferred to the high - wage proletariat of the advanced capitalist countries .
New York and London 's access to global savings simultaneously came to depend on the surplus extracted through the high rates of exploitation of the new working classes in ' emerging markets ' .
At the same time , the very constraints that the mobility of capital had on working class incomes in the rich countries had the effect of further integrating these workers into the realm of finance .
This was most obvious in terms of their increasing debt loads amidst the universalisation of the credit card .
But it also pertained to how workers grew more attuned to financial markets , as they followed the stock exchanges and mutual funds that their pension funds were invested in , often cheered by rising stocks as firms were restructured without much thought to the layoffs involved in this .

Both the explosion of finance and the disciplining of labour were a necessary condition for the dramatic productive transformations that took place in the ' real economy ' in this era .
The leading role that finance came to play over the past quarter century , including the financialisation of industrial corporations and the greatest growth in profits taking place in the financial sector , has often been viewed as undermining production and representing little else than speculation and a source of unsustainable bubbles .
But this fails to account for why this era – a period that was longer than the ' golden age ' – lasted so long .
It also ignores the fact that this has been a period of remarkable capitalist dynamism , involving the deepening and expansion of capital , capitalist social relations and capitalist culture in general , including significant technological revolutions .
This was especially the case for the US itself , where financial competition , innovation , flexibility and volatility accompanied the reconstitution of the US material base at home and its expansion abroad .
Overall , the era of finance - led neoliberalism experienced a rate of growth of global GDP that compares favourably with most earlier periods over the last two centuries . [ 16 ]
It is , in any case , impossible to imagine the globalisation of production without the type of financial intermediation in the circuits of capital that provides the means for hedging the kinds of risks associated with flexible exchange rates , interest rates variations across borders , uncertain transportation and commodity costs , etc .
Moreover , as competition to access more mobile finance intensified , this imposed discipline on firms ( and states ) which forced restructuring within firms and reallocated capital across sectors , including via the provision of venture capital to the new information and bio-medical sectors which have become leading arenas of accumulation .
At the same time , the very investment banks which have now been undone in the current crisis spread their tentacles abroad for three decades through their global role in M&A and IPO activity , during the course of which relationships between finance and production , including their legal and accounting frameworks , were radically changed around the world in ways that increasingly resembled US patterns .
This was reinforced by the bilateral and multilateral international trade and investment treaties which were increasingly concerned with opening other societies up to New York 's and London 's financial , legal and accounting services .
The US state in crisis
The era of neoliberalism has been one long history of financial volatility with the US state leading the world 's states in intervening in a series of financial crises .
Almost as soon as he was appointed to succeed Volcker as head of the Fed , Greenspan immediately dropped buckets of liquidity on Wall Street in response to the 1987 stock market crash .
In the wake of the savings and loan crisis , the public Resolution Trust Corporation was established to buy up bad real estate debt ( this is the model being used for today 's bailout ) .
In Clinton 's first term Wall Street was saved from the consequences of bond defaults during the Mexican financial crisis in 1995 by Rubin 's use of the Stabilisation Exchange Fund ( this Treasury kitty , established during the New Deal , has once again been called into service in today 's crisis ) .
During the Asian crisis two years later , Rubin and his under - secretary Summers flew to Seoul to dictate the terms of the IMF loan .
And in 1998 ( not long after the Japanese government nationalised one of the world 's biggest banks ) , the head of the New York Federal Reserve summoned the CEOs of Wall Street 's leading financial firms and told them they would not be allowed to leave the room ( reminiscent of Morgan in 1907 ) until they agreed to take over the insolvent hedge fund , Long - Term Capital Management .
These quick interventions by the Fed and Treasury , most of them without waiting upon congressional pressures or approval , showed they were aware of the disastrous consequences which the failure to act quickly to contain each crisis could have on both the domestic and global financial system .
When the current financial crisis broke out in the summer of 2007 , the newly appointed chair of the Fed , Ben Bernanke , could draw on his academic work as an economist at Princeton University on how the 1929 crash could have been prevented , [ 17 ] and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson could draw on his own illustrious career ( like Rubin's ) as a senior executive at Goldman Sachs .
Both the Treasury and Federal Reserve staff worked closely with the Securities Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission under the rubric of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets that had been set up in 1988 , and known on Wall Street as the ' Plunge Protection Team ' .
Through the fall of 2007 and into 2008 , the US Treasury would organise , first , a consortium of international banks and investment funds , and then an overlapping consortium of mortgage companies , financial securitisers and investment funds , to try to get them to take concrete measures to calm the markets .
The Federal Reserve acted as the world 's central bank by repeatedly supplying other central banks with dollars to provide liquidity to their banking systems , while doing the same for Wall Street .
In March 2008 the Treasury – after guaranteeing to the tune of $ 30 billion JP Morgan Chase 's takeover of Bear Stearns – issued its Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure especially designed to extend the Fed 's oversight powers over investment banks .
Most serious analysts thought the worst was over , but by the summer of 2008 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , whose reserve requirements had been lowered in the previous years to a quarter of that of the banks , were also being undone by the crisis .
And by September so were the great New York investment banks .
The problem they all faced was that there was no market for a great proportion of the mortgage - backed assets on their books .
When the sub - prime mortgage phenomenon was reaching its peak in 2005 Greenspan was claiming that ' where once more - marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit , lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately . '[ 18 ]
But financial capital 's risk evaluation equations unraveled in the crisis of 2007 - 8 .
And as they did , so did financial markets ' ability to judge the worth of financial institutions balance sheets .
Banks became very reluctant to give each other even the shortest term credits .
Without such inter - bank credit , any financial system will collapse .
The unprecedented scale of interventions in September 2008 can only be understood in this context .
They have involved pumping additional hundred of billions of dollars into the world 's inter - bank markets ; the nationalisations of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG ( the world largest insurance company ) ; the seizure and fire sale of Washington Mutual ( to prevent the largest bank failure in US history ) ; a blanket guarantee on the $ 3.4 trillion in mutual funds deposits ; a ban on short - selling of financial stocks ; and Paulson 's $ 700 billion TARP ( ' troubled asset relief program ' ) bailout to take on toxic mortgage assets .
Amidst the transformation in the course of a week of New York 's investment banks through a dramatic series of bankruptcies and takeovers , the Treasury undertook to buy virtually all the illiquid assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions in the US , including those of foreign owned firms .
We now know that Bernanke had warned Paulson a year before that this might be necessary , and Paulson had agreed : “ I knew he was right theoretically ” , he said .
“ But I also had , and we both did , some hope that , with all the liquidity out there from investors , that after a certain decline that we would reach a bottom . ” [ 19 ]
Yet the private market has no secure bottom without the state .
The Fed and Treasury needed to act not only as lender of last resort , but also , by taking responsibility for buying and trying to sell all those securities that could n't find a value or market in the current crisis , as market maker of last resort . [ 20 ]
Is it over ?
Is it over ?
This is the question on most people 's minds today .
But what does this question mean ?
The way this question is posed , especially on the left , usually conflates three distinct questions .
First , is the Paulson program going to end the crisis ?
Second , does this crisis , and both the state and the popular reaction to it , spell the end of neoliberalism ?
Third , are we witnessing the end of US hegemony ?
There is no way of knowing how far this most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression might still have to go .
On the one hand , despite the condition of the ( no longer ) ' Big Three ' in the US auto sector , the overall health of US non-financial corporations going into the crisis – as seen in their relatively strong profits , cash flow and low debt – has been an important stabilising factor , not least in limiting the fall in the stock market .
The growth of US exports at close to double - digit levels annually over the past five years reflects not only the decline in the dollar but the capacity of US corporations to take advantage of this .
That said , the seizing up of inter -bank and commercial paper markets even after Paulson 's program was announced leaves big questions about whether it will work .
And even if it does , unwinding such a deep financial and housing crisis is going to take a long time .
As of now , foreclosures are still rising , housing starts and house prices are still falling , and the financial markets have not yet calmed .
Moreover , it is has been clear for over a year that the US economy will fall into – or already is in – a recession .
The immediate problem in this respect is where consumer demand will come from .
Credit is obviously going to be harder to obtain , especially for low income groups , and with the end of housing price inflation closing off the possibility of secondary mortgages , and especially reinforcing concerns about retirement alongside the devaluation of pension assets and even company cutbacks of benefits , most workers will be not only less able to spend , but also inclined to try to save rather than spend .
To the extent that a great deal of US consumption in the neoliberal era was also spurred on by the enormous appetites of the rich , this is obviously also going to now be restrained .
Fiscal stimulus programs are unlikely to be enough to compensate for this , especially given the nervousness over the impact of the bailouts on the fiscal deficit , the size of the US public debt and the value of dollar , and hence over whether low interest rates can be maintained .
To the extent that global growth through the neoliberal era was dependent on credit - based mass consumption in the US , the impact of this being cut back will have global implications , including on US exports .
This is why the current recession is likely to be deeper and longer than the last significant one in the early 1990s , and maybe even than the severe recession with which neoliberalism was launched in the early 1980s .
Yet when it comes to the question of whether this crisis spells the end of neoliberalism , it is more important than ever to distinguish between the understanding of neoliberalism as an ideologically driven strategy to free markets from states on the one hand , and on the other a materially driven form of social rule which has involved the liberalisation of markets through state intervention and management .
While it will now be hard politicians and even economists to uncritically defend free markets and further deregulation , it is not obvious – as exemplified by the concentration by both candidates on tax and spending cuts in the first US presidential debate of 2008 – that the essence of neoliberal ideology has been decisively undermined , as it was not by the savings and loan crisis at the end of the 1980s , the Asian and LCTM crises at the end of the 1990s , or the post - dotcom Enron and other scandals at the beginning of the century .
On the more substantive definition of neoliberalism as a form of social rule , there clearly is going to be more regulation .
But it is by no means yet clear how different it will be from the Sarbanes - Oxley type of corporate regulation passed at the beginning of the century to deal with ' Enronitis ' . [ 21 ]
Nevertheless , it is possible that a new form of social rule within capitalism may emerge to succeed neoliberalism .
But given how far subordinate social forces need to go to reorganise effectively , it is most likely that the proximate alternatives to neoliberalism will either be a form of authoritarian capitalism or a new form of reformist social rule that would reflect only a weak class realignment .
But whatever the answers to the questions concerning the extent of the crisis or the future of neoliberalism , this does not resolve the question of ' is it over ? ' as it pertains to the end of US hegemony .
Just how deeply integrated global capitalism has become by the 21st century has been obvious from the way the crisis in the heartland of empire has affected the rest of the globe , quickly putting facile notions of decoupling to rest .
The financial ministries , central banks and regulatory bodies of the advanced capitalist states at the centre of the system have cooperated very closely in the current crisis .
That said , the tensions that earlier existed in this decade over Iraq have obviously been brought back to mind by this crisis .
European criticisms of the Bush administration 's inadequate supervision of finance , including that US leaders ignored their pleas for more regulation during the last G8 meetings , may seem hypocritical in light of how far they opened their economies to the Americanisation of their financial systems .
But it is nevertheless significant in terms of their expectation that the US play its imperial role in a less irresponsible or incompetent manner .
This is reminiscent of the criticisms that were raised during the 1970s , which was an important factor in producing the policy turn in Washington that led to the Volcker shock as the founding moment of neoliberalism .
US hegemony was not really challenged then ; the US was being asked to act responsibly to defeat inflation and validate the dollar as the global currency and thus live up to its role as global leader .
With the economic integration and expansion of the EU and the emergence of the Euro , many would like to think that Europe has the capacity to replace the US in this respect .
But , as Peter Gowan insightfully puts it , ' this is not realistic .
Much of the European financial system is itself in a mess , having followed the Wall Street lead towards the cliff of insolvency .
The Eurozone government bond markets remain fragmented and there is no cohesive financial or political direction for the Eurozone , leave alone a consensus for rebuilding the Eurozone as a challenger to the dollar through a political confrontation with the United States . '[ 22 ]
If and when the Chinese state will develop such capacities to assume the mantle of hegemonic leadership of the capitalist world , remains to be seen .
But for the interim , a sober article in China 's business newspaper , the Oriental Morning Post , reflects a better understanding of the real world than some of those among who look to China as an alternative hegemon :
Bad news keeps coming from Wall Street .
Again , the decline of U.S. hegemony became a hot topic of debate .
Complaining or even cursing a world of hegemony brings excitement to us .
However , faced with a decline of U.S. hegemony , the power vacuum could also be painful .
We do not like hegemony , but have we ever thought about this problem when we mocked its decline ... at present the world 's financial system does not exist in isolation .
It is the result of long - term historical evolution , closely associated with a country 's strength , its openness , the development of globalization , and the existing global economic , political patterns .
The relationship can be described as ' the whole body moving when pulling one hair '...
The subprime crisis has affected many foreign enterprises , banks , and individuals which in itself is again a true portrayal of the power of the United States ...
Therefore , the world 's problems are not merely whether or not the United States are declining , but whether any other country , including those seemingly solid allies of the United States , will help bear the load the U.S. would lighten . [ 23 ]
For the time being , what is clear is that no other state in the world – not only today , but perhaps ever – could have experienced such a profound financial crisis , and such a enormous increase in the public debt without an immediate outflow of capital , a run on its currency and the collapse of its stock market .
That this has not happened reflects the widespread appreciation among capitalists that they sink or swim with Wall Street and Washington DC .
But it also reflects the continuing material underpinnings of the empire .
Those who dwell on the fact the US share of global GDP has been halved since World War Two not only underplay the continuing global weight of the US economy in the world economy , but fail to understand , as US policy makers certainly did at the time , that the diffusion of capitalism was an essential condition for the health of the US economy itself .
Had the US tried to hold on to its postwar share of global GNP , this would have stopped capitalism 's globalising tendencies in its tracks .
This remains the case today .
Not only is the US economy still the largest by far , it also hosts the most important new high - tech arenas of capital accumulation , and leads the world by far in research and development , while US multinational corporations directly and indirectly account for so large a proportion of world - wide employment , production and trade .
Moreover , in spite of the New York investment banks having come undone in this crisis , the functions of US investment banking are going to continue .
Philip Augar ( the author of the perceptive inside account of the investment banking industry , The Greed Merchants ) , while affirming that ' the eight days between Sunday September 14 and Sunday September 21 , 2008 ... [ were ] part of the most catastrophic shift among investment banks since the event that created them , the Glass Steagall Act of 1933 ' , goes on to argue that
... it is likely that investment banks will exist as recognisable entities within their new organisations and investment banking as an industry will emerge with enhanced validity ...
While they are licking their wounds , the investment banks may well eschew some of the more esoteric structured finance products that have caused them such problems and refocus on what they used to regard as their core business .
While we may have seen the death of the investment bank I would be very surprised if we have seen the death of investment banking as an industry . [ 24 ]
Indeed , the financial restructuring and re-regulation that is already going on as a result of the crisis is in good part a matter of establishing the institutional conditions for this , above all through the further concentration of financial capital via completing the integration of commercial and investment banking .
The repeal of Glass - Steagall at the end of the last century was more a recognition of how far this had already gone than an initiation of it ; and the US Treasury 's Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure , announced in March 2008 but two years in preparation , was designed to create the regulatory framework for seeing that integration through .
There is no little irony in the fact that whereas the crisis of the 1930s led to the distancing of investment banking from access to common bank deposits , the long - term solutions being advanced to the insolvencies of investment bankers today is to give them exactly this access .
It ain't over until it 's made over
The massive outrage against bailing out Wall Street today is rooted in a tradition of populist resentment against New York bankers which has persisted alongside the ever increasing integration of the ' common man ' into capitalist financial relationships .
US political and economic elites have had to accommodate to – and at the same time overcome – this populist political culture .
This could be seen at work this September when Henry Paulson declared before the House Financial Services Committee , as he tried to get his TARP plan through Congress , that ' the American people are angry about executive compensation and rightfully so . '[ 25 ]
This was rather rich given that he had been Wall Street 's highest - paid CEO , receiving $ 38.3 m in salary , stock and options in the year before joining the Treasury , plus a mid-year $ 18.7 m bonus on his departure as well as an estimated $ 200 million tax break against the sale of his almost $ 500 million share holding in Goldman Sachs ( as was required to avoid conflict of interest in his new job ) . [ 26 ]
The accommodation to the culture of populism is also seen at work in both McCain 's and Obama 's campaign rhetoric against greed and speculation , while Wall Street investment banks are among their largest campaign contributors and supply some of their key advisers .
This should not be reduced to hypocrisy .
In the absence of a traditional bureaucracy in the US state , leading corporate lawyers and financiers have moved between Wall Street and Washington ever since the age of the ' robber barons ' in the late 19th century .
Taking time off from the private firm to engage in public service has been called the ' institutional schizophrenia ' that links these Wall Street figures as ' double agents ' to the state .
While acting in one sphere to squeeze through every regulatory loophole , they act in the other to introduce new regulations as 'a tool for the efficient management of the social order in the public interest . '[ 27 ]
It is partly for this reason that the long history of popular protest and discontent triggered by financial scandals and crises in the US , far from undermining the institutional and regulatory basis of financial expansion , have repeatedly been pacified through the processes of further ' codification , institutionalization and juridification . '[ 28 ]
And far from buckling under the pressure of popular disapproval , financial elites have proved very adept at not only responding to these pressures but also using them to create new regulatory frameworks that have laid the foundations for the further growth of financial capital as a class fraction and as a lucrative business .
This is not a matter of simple manipulation of the masses .
Most people have a ( however contradictory ) interest in the daily functioning and reproduction of financial capitalism because of their current dependence on it : from access to their wages and salaries via their bank accounts , to buying goods and services on credit , to paying their bills , to realising their savings – and even to keeping the roofs over their heads .
This is why , in acknowledging before the congressional hearings on his TARP plan to save the financial system that Wall Street 's exorbitant compensation schemes are ' a serious problem ' , Paulson is also appealing to people 's sense of their own immediate interests when he adds that 'we must find a way to address this in legislation without undermining the effectiveness of the program . '[ 29 ]
Significantly , both the criticisms and the reform proposals now coming from outside the Wall Street - Washington elite reflect this contradiction .
The attacks on the Fed 's irresponsibility in allowing sub - prime mortgages to flourish poses the question of what should have been said to those who wanted access to the home - ownership dream given that the possibility of adequate public housing was ( and remains ) nowhere on the political agenda .
No less problematic , especially in terms of the kind of funding that would be required for this , is the opposition to Paulson 's TARP program in terms of protecting the taxpayer , presented in a pervasive populist language with neoliberal overtones .
It was this definition of the problem in the wake of Enron that led to the shaming and convictions of the usual suspects , while Bush and Republican congressmen were elected and reelected .
At the same time , many of the criticisms and proposed reforms today often display an astonishing naiveté about the systemic nature of the relationship between state and capital .
This was seen when an otherwise excellent and informative article in the New Labour Forum founded its case for reform on the claim that ' Government is necessary to make business act responsibly .
Without it , capitalism becomes anarchy .
In the case of the financial industry , government failed to do its job , for two reasons – ideology and influence - peddling . '[ 30 ]
It is this perspective that also perhaps explains why most of the reform proposals being advanced are so modest , in spite of the extent of the crisis and the popular outrage .
This is exemplified by those proposals advanced by one of the US left 's leading analysts of financial markets , Dean Baker :
The first target for reform should be the outrageous salaries drawn by the top executives at financial firms ...
While we do n't want a chain reaction of banking collapses on Wall Street , the public should get something in exchange for Bernanke 's generosity .
Specifically , he can demand a cap on executive compensation ( all compensation ) of $ 2 million a year , in exchange for getting bailed out ...
The financial sector performs an incredibly important function in allocating savings to those who want to invest in businesses , buy homes or borrow money for other purposes ...
The best way to bring the sector into line is with a modest financial transactions tax ... [ on ] options , futures , credit default swaps , etc ... [ 31 ]
This is a perfect example of thinking inside the box : explicitly endorsing two million dollar salaries and the practices of deriving state revenues from the very things that are identified as the problem .
Indeed , even proposals for stringent regulations to prohibit financial imprudence mostly fail to identify the problem as systemic within capitalism .
At best , the problem is reduced to the system of neoliberal thought , as though it was nothing but Hayek or Friedman , rather than a long history of contradictory , uneven and contested capitalist development that led the world to 21st century Wall Street .
The scale of the crisis and the popular outrage today provide a historic opening for the renewal of the kind of radical politics that advances a systemic alternative to capitalism .
It would be a tragedy if a far more ambitious goal than making financial capital more prudent did not now come back on the agenda .
In terms of immediate reforms and the mobilisations needed to win them – and given that we are in a situation when public debt is the only safe debt – this should start with demands for vast programs to provide for collective services and infrastructures that not only compensate for those that have atrophied but meet new definitions of basic human needs and come to terms with today 's ecological challenges .
Such reforms would soon come up against the limits posed by the reproduction of capitalism .
This is why it is so important to raise not merely the regulation of finance but the transformation and democratisation of the whole financial system .
This would have to involve not only capital controls in relation to international finance but also controls over domestic investment , since the point of taking control over finance is to transform the uses to which it is now put .
And it would also require much more than this in terms of the democratisation of both the broader economy and the state .
It is highly significant that the last time the nationalisation of the financial system was seriously raised , at least in the advanced capitalist countries , was in response to the 1970s crisis by those elements on the left who recognised that the only way to overcome the contradictions of the Keynesian welfare state in a positive manner was to take the financial system into public control . [ 32 ]
Their proposals were derided as Neanderthal not only by neoliberals but also by social democrats and post - modernists .
We are still paying for their defeat .
It is now necessary to build on their proposals and make them relevant in the current conjuncture .
Of course , without rebuilding popular class forces through new movements and parties this will fall on empty ground .
But crucial to this rebuilding is to get people to think ambitiously again .
However deep the crisis and however widespread the outrage , this will require hard and committed work by a great many activists .
The type of facile analysis that focuses on ' it 's all over ' – whether in terms of the end of neoliberalism , the decline of the US empire , or even the next great crisis of capitalism – is not much use here insofar as it is offered without any clear socialist strategic implications .
It ai n't over till it 's made over .

During an appearance on CNN’s The Situation Room , Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat , said Montana is “ one of the only states in the country Ron Paul will be on the ballot as the Constitution candidate , ” and “ if you travel across Western Montana , you ’ll actually see more Ron Paul signs than you do John McCain . …
If you include Paul in the polling , he gets somewhere between five and eight percent .
And then Obama and McCain are tied around five . ”
Schweitzer said , “ Ron Paul is going to be the decider here . ”

If you think the contents of your work computer are your business and only your business , then think again .
Applying federal rulings from other jurisdictions to help guide its ruling , the New Jersey State Appeals Court ruled in a recent case that " an employee has no reasonable expectation of privacy in personal files stored on a company - owned computer . "
This is a significant finding as it sets a precedent for the state of New Jersey , and adds to other similar rulings from the 4th and 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ( U.S. v. Angevine and U.S. v. Simons , respectively ) .
In fact , not only did the court rule that a employee of a company has no expectation of privacy of the contents of his work computer , the court further ruled that an employer 's consent to a police search of the employee 's computer is enough to make the search lawful .
The ruling for the case , State of New Jersey vs. M.A. , stated : " We conclude ... that neither the law nor society recognize as legitimate defendant 's subjective expectation of privacy in a workplace computer he used to commit a crime .
" This expectation of privacy is not even legitimized if the employee uses a " confidential password " : " A burglar plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season may have a thoroughly justified subjective expectation of privacy , but it is not one which the law recognizes as ' legitimate ' .
" The case centers around a man who was convicted of stealing money from his employer via electronic fund transfers , with evidence that was collected by police without a warrant .
( The employer granted consent to the police to search the computer for evidence of the crimes . )
In the initial case , the employee 's attorneys attempted to suppress the evidence , claiming that the employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy .
The motion was denied , and the employee " pleaded guilty to the thefts but preserved his right of appeal on the search and seizure issue . "
The appeals court subsequently agreed with the lower court 's ruling .
While this case specifically deals with criminal activity , it could potentially add more weight to a growing legal perception that the contents of an employee 's computer -- be it work - related or personal -- can be considered the property of his employer by the simple fact that the employer owns the equipment that the data is physically stored on .
It should be noted , however , that this finding deals specifically with the expectation of privacy between and employer and an employee , and could not be applied to an individual 's personal data stored on equipment owned by his Internet service provider .
In fact , in New Jersey vs. M.A. , M.A. 's attorneys tried to use the findings of a recent New Jersey Supreme Court case , State of New Jersey vs. Reid , as a precedent for its case .
In the New Jersey vs. Reid , the court found , " when users surf the Web from the privacy of their homes , they have a reason to expect that their actions are confidential . "
The judges in New Jersey vs. M.A. dismissed the findings of the New Jersey vs. Reid as being applicable in the case of New Jersey vs. M.A. :" However , Reid 's crime involved the Internet and information divulged by an Internet service provider , and it occurred at home through the use of Reid 's personal computer , which she never brought to work or permitted co-workers to use .
Thus Reid does not apply .
" So perhaps the lesson learned for potential Internet criminals plotting against their employers is to always use their home computers and hope that legally binding warrants and subpoenas are not issued to gain access to their personal offline or online data .
The lesson learned for us law - abiding citizens is that we need to be careful what activities we engage in on our work computers and what data we store on them .
Even if the activities and data are not illegal , they can still land us in trouble with our employers if they do n't jive with company policy or expectations .
In other words , leave the DRM - stripped MP3 file sharing and porn downloading for home .
Based on information from Russian defense officials and , no doubt , years of KGB savvy , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has surmised that the U.S. provoked the Georgia conflict in order to give John McCain a boost :
“ The suspicion arises that someone in the United States especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of U.S. president . ”
He may be onto something , considering the neoconservative fingerprints all over this thing and John McCain ’s man crush on the Georgian president .
In fact , Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer made a similar argument — without the benefit of Russian intelligence — in a recent column .

Lala is gaining headlines across the tech blogosphere for a new service that allows users to play songs on the web .
The glowing reviews mention support from major record labels and an extensive library .
Some are calling it “ The Next Revolution In Digital Music , ” “ Spectacular ” and “ Switched On . ”
Here ’s what Lala is offering .
Users sign up , and if they choose to they can sync what they own locally with what ’s on Lala ( no uploads , but owned single recognition ) .
Users can then play any song on Lala for free …once .
If they already own the song ( as identified through the sync process ) they can play that song on Lala on an unlimited basis , if they do n’t own that song , they have to pay 10 c for the rights to play it on an unlimited basis , per song .
Lala comes bundled with the ability to purchase songs at competitive rates vs Amazon or iTunes , and songs purchased are DRM free .
10 c play payments are credited against the future purchase of the song .
Pay to play : fail
What ’s revolutionary about a site that charges people to play music on demand that is freely available on other sites ( some legal , some dubious ) at no cost at all .
It ’s not only bizarre , it ’s beyond stupid .
It is spectacular …spectacularly dumb .
This is the third incarnation of Lala , with the site having started as a CD swapping service .
One headline said it may be third time lucky for Lala , more like three strikes and you ’re out .
People are not going to flock to , and use a service that charges them 10 cents every time they want to play a single more than once .
Why would they ?
Last.fm and Grooveshark are two perfectly legal players in this space where they do n’t have to pay ( Last. fm can be limited at times ) , and there are a range of other sites , such as Seeqpod that offer free on demand music as well .
It ’s insane to enter a market trying to get users to make micropayments when your competitors do n’t .
Bonus points : it ’s georetarded
Now here ’s a surprise ( not ) , Lala ca n’t be used outside of the United States , so the chirpy voice , with a couple of translations told me when I tried to play a song on the site .
So you ’ve got a model which charges users for playing songs when your competitors do n’t , and it ’s only available in the United States , so you immediately reduce the odds that you might be able to find enough people gullible enough to cough up to use the service .
lalalalalalala .
Conclusion
Lala sucks , and I can’t believe that so many in the tech blogosphere are either taking drugs , or drinking so much kool aid that they think this service is a good thing .
I tried extremely hard to find something I liked about this site , really , really , hard , and I just can’t .
Dumbest business model ever combined with the myopia of georetardation .
Three strikes equals an EPIC FAIL .

No , you 'd get chewed out and maybe a little not in your personnel file .
Lesson ?
DO NOT MAKE ADMISSIONS to anything short of the actual test question .
If the question concerns KNOWINGLY divulging classified information ( and not minor security lapses ) , then concern yourself with the original question , and not anything tangential .
Take GM 's advice .
Also , check out the following website :
http://www.sheldoncohen.com/publications/polygraph.htm
Federal administrative agencies handling employee appeals of adverse actions deal with polygraph results in a number of ways .
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals which decides appeals of security clearance decisions , has held that admissions by an applicant made during a polygraph examination may be admissible even though the results of polygraph examination are not .
( 11 ) , Such " results " would include the polygraph charts and the polygraph operator 's interpretation of those chart , [ The DOHA Appeal Board has held that Paragraph D.6 of DoD Directive 5210.48 which states that : " no adverse action will be taken solely on the basis of a polygraph examination chart that indicates deception " does not bar the use in evidence of applicant 's admissions .
DoD Reg. 5210.48 - R provides , however , that the " results of an analysis of the polygraph charts may be considered to have probative value in administrative determinations .
You are at an advantage .
I was just an applicant , you are an actual EMPLOYEE .
From what I have heard over the years , is that if the folks you work for in OPS want you bad enough , and are willing to go to bat for you , they will just have you tested , and tested and tested until you pass .
They used to have an old lady examiner ( grandmotherly type ) who specialized in those types of cases .
If you just can't pass , and nobody will go to bat for you , and you end up maintaining your legal right not to be fired based soley on some squigly - wigglies on a set of poly charts , they will give you some lowly job not requiring a clearance .
IOW , under - employ you and try to get you to quit .
I hope that helps .

By Steven Stark - October 30 , 2008
A number of pundits , mostly of the conservative variety , would like you to believe that if Barack Obama wins on Tuesday , it 's the mainstream media 's fault .
Do n't believe a word of it .
" Media bias " is to the Republicans what " Willie Horton " and " swiftboating " are to the Democrats -- a convenient but false explanation for having lost .
Was much of the mainstream media tilted toward Obama this election cycle ?
Undoubtedly -- sometimes embarrassingly so .
But the support of the mainstream media -- while irritating to those whose sympathies lie elsewhere -- does n't count for much .
Way back in the early 1980s , in his brilliant book The Real Campaign , Jeff Greenfield convincingly argued that the media " made almost no difference " in the outcome of the 1980 Reagan - Carter - Anderson election .
( Reagan won big , of course , even though the press disliked him . )
And that was in the era when the mainstream media really did dominate -- pre-cable , pre-Internet , and pre-You Tube .
Now , " the mainstream media " finds its numbers of readers and viewers dwindling .
Every quarterly report brings more bad news -- or , as a friend once put it , " Every time someone dies , the print media and network television lose another customer . "
The real reasons John McCain is in trouble are our current president , George W. Bush , and the economy -- with a little help from the candidate 's own ineptitude ( but only a little ) .
The press likes to focus on the day - to - day campaign .
That 's what sells papers ( or at least used to , in the days when people actually bought papers ) .
But larger trends determine most elections .
Bush 's favorability ratings continue to sit in the mid 20s .
That alone should have informed us of the chances of any Republican who sought to succeed him .
Despite this , McCain managed to keep the race close until September , when the dam of the credit crisis broke and reminded many voters why they dislike Bush , and by extension , the GOP .
Blasted by the past
This year , a Republican 's only real chance was to hope the electorate would find Obama unacceptable -- and that was n't an idle desire .
Only one Democrat has won more than 50 percent of the popular vote since 1964 .
Obama was far more liberal and far less experienced than the average Democratic candidate .
And McCain was the most experienced and arguably the most centrist candidate the Republican Party could have nominated .
Given that making Obama unacceptable was the best path to victory , McCain ran a rather tame negative campaign -- despite howls of protest from the mainstream media about how over the top he 's been .
( Again , not that anyone really cares what reporters and pundits say . )
McCain 's problem is that Obama has come off as the more temperate figure in the general election to date .
Beginning with McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin -- the Hannah Montana of American politics -- the GOP fall campaign has been a roller coaster , punctuated by three debates in which the standard bearer somehow could n't articulate a coherent argument as to why his opponent was unqualified for the presidency .
When " Joe the plumber " does a better job of critiquing your opponent than you do , you probably do n't have the rhetorical skills to be a good candidate .
Could another candidate who was n't a lifelong Capitol Hiller -- that is , obsessed with earmarks -- and knew how to run against a Democrat have done better ?
Well , perhaps , but no candidate who fit that bill was available this time around .
Some of the candidates who lost to McCain -- say , Mike Huckabee or Mitt Romney -- might have made better arguments against Obama , but they were n't as centrist or as experienced as him , which would have granted Obama the advantage anyway .
Rudy Giuliani might have mounted an effective challenge , but we 've learned that the Republicans will never nominate someone that liberal on social issues .
So McCain might have been his party 's best option under these very difficult circumstances .
And , on Tuesday night , we 'll know very early on how that worked out .
Unless McCain can somehow pick up a large state he's not expected to win ( Minnesota or Pennsylvania ) , he must sweep North Carolina , Virginia , Ohio , Indiana , Florida , Missouri , Colorado and one or two other small states , to boot .
It 's possible , given a last - minute surge , but still an uphill struggle .
( Hail to the new chief . )
It ’s done .
Core Lehman is sold .
Now the rest of the company can be liquidated .
Barclays will buy the core assets for a measly $ 2 billion .
For Lehman staff in the US , this has to be a relief .
However , staff in London are probably left out in the cold as Barclays sees this operation as redundant .
This is precisely the outcome that Hank Paulson was looking for .
The question now is at what cost .
While “ Core Lehman ” has been sold , the rest of Lehman Brothers will likely be liquidated except for the Investment Management Division , which is still quite valuable .
Nevertheless , systemic risk has definitely increased .
AIG conservatorship is rumored to be next — an interesting conclusion to the AIG problem .
I have now covered this solution ( see my post ) .
Barclays appeared tonight to have secured a deal to buy large parts of Lehman Brothers , the investment bank that filed for bankruptcy on Monday amid one of the worst financial crises that Wall Street has suffered .
Barclays ’ president , Bob Diamond , was reported to have addressed staff at Lehman in New York today , telling them : “ You have a new partner . ”
In a brief statement earlier today , Barclays said it was in negotiations about the “ possible acquisition ” of “ certain Lehman Brothers assets on terms that would be attractive to Barclays shareholders ” .
The talks centred on Barclays buying the U.S. investment banking and trading divisions of Lehman , including equities and fixed income , leaving the toxic property - related assets with the bankrupt firm .
It is also looking for a buyer for its asset management arm .
Full details of the deal were still not clear but the price was believed to be in the order of $ 2bn ( £ 1.1bn ) .
It is thought that a deal could save thousands of jobs , mainly in the US .
The news came less than 48 hours after Barclays had walked away from talks orchestrated by U.S. officials to prevent Lehman falling into bankruptcy .
The failure of Lehman , the fourth - largest investment bank on Wall Street , together with the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America , triggered a worldwide sell - off in the financial markets and shook faith in Wall Street .
Figures out today showed that hedge funds and other investors that had been shorting Lehman ’s stock since March had made $ 29bn from the firm ’s demise .
Short - sellers bet on shares falling .
Diamond , who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman , had remained in the U.S. and worked through Monday night to hammer out an agreement .
Lehman is said to have renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in some of its assets .
But it is far from clear that Barclays shareholders are ready to back further expansion of the bank ’s investment division , which has grown rapidly under Diamond ’s 10 - year tenure .
He was involved in disbanding the bank ’s last disastrous foray into global financial markets , BZW , and there are fears that he may now be preparing to recreate the business .
Diamond knows that if a deal requires Barclays to raise fresh funds from shareholders , the transaction will be subjected to even greater scrutiny .
He has insisted that Barclays has the opportunity to become a top - four bank on Wall Street as ailing players fall by the wayside .
Barclays has sounded out shareholders about a possible cash call although only 13 % of them backed its last funding when it raised £ 4bn , as well as £ 500 m from new investors in Japan .
Frustration at Lehman was growing today , particularly over its chief executive , Richard Fuld , who had still to address workers directly .
“ We do n’t know what is going on , ” one Lehman banker said outside the firm ’s offices in midtown Manhattan .
“ Fuld has n’t said anything to us yet ; we ’re all uncertain whether we have got jobs or not . ”
Lehman was racing to sell off the investment bank before staff and clients began to leave in large numbers , eroding any residual value it might have .
Staff have been clearing their desks and walking out with bags or cardboard boxes full of possessions since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished .
Lehman listed assets of $ 639bn , making it the biggest bankruptcy filing ever , 10 times the size of the energy firm Enron when it went bust in late 2001 .
The bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , which provides protection from creditors while it liquidates its business .
The operations in the UK were put into administration and staff reacted with shock and anger as they turned up for work on Monday and were in most cases told to go back home again .
Creditors from JP Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse to smaller investors such as Arapahoe County in Colorado rushed to file claims in the bankruptcy court .
The business owed $ 613 bn to creditors around the world .
The unravelling of the business is expected to take months or possibly years .
One large asset owned by Lehman is its corporate headquarters on Seventh Avenue in New York , which the bank paid $ 650 m for after it was forced out of downtown New York by the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Fears began to grow for Lehman in March , after the near failure of Bear Stearns .
But the business rapidly imploded just a week ago when it became clear that talks to secure capital from the Korea Development Bank had broken down .

Outside of restaurants , though , the bread could be hard to come by .
So at the end of last year , I was delighted to discover a small storefront selling all the familiar Sullivan
St breads and two cookies that , like everything Sullivan
St makes , are exemplary : biscotti pratesi ( almost as good as mine ) and ossi di morti , shatter - light meringues with almonds .
The location , at 72nd Street and Broadway , was convenient to my brother ’s apartment , where I stay , and perfect for buying and packing a loaf of the incomparable sesame bread — not just scattered with but rolled in a dense bed of sesame seeds — just before going to the airport .
The name was unfamiliar : Grandaisy , with a pretty pale - blue daisy logo on the bags .
The clerks reassured me that indeed , the bread was the same .
Sort of .
When I recently ran into Lahey , a longtime acquaintance and an inexhaustible source of pungent , often profanity - strewn , quotes , I told him how happy I was finally to be able to buy Sullivan
St breads every time I came to New York .
“ Those are n’t Sullivan St breads , ” he said drily .
Whaat ?
The explanation , I learned when I went to see Lahey at his new Sullivan St Bakery headquarters in the far - west reaches of Hell ’s Kitchen , was a romantic breakup that devolved into a rocky professional partnership that ended in a complete business split .
Now there were two bakeries with two different names selling breads and cookies identically named and to all appearances utterly identical , one owned by Lahey and the other by his former partner , Monica Von Thun Calderón .
Talk about confusion in the marketplace !
I was certainly confused .
I wondered how the Siamese twins had been parted , and how the twin breads would taste when reunited and compared .
I was put in mind of a much better - known baking breakup , which coincidentally has put two more bakeries on the Upper West Side selling very similar products : that of the two founders of Magnolia Bakery , which shot to fame after its way - too - cute cupcakes provided consolation to the women on Sex and the City .
The television exposure started a cupcake craze in which tourists make pilgrimages to the West Village original ( it ’s a wonder there are n’t Japanese tourists dressed as cupcakes , or at least as Samantha ) .
In a non-cute spat that delighted tabloids , the two women parted ways , and one of them opened a rival bakery called Buttercup Bake Shop .
The owner of Buttercup ( Magnolia has changed hands ) did not want to talk to me about the split .
But I noted with interest that when I asked for Magnolia Bakery on a call to 800 - GOOG411 , the free voice - activated directory - assistance service , the first listing I got was for Buttercup .
( Maybe Google really is omniscient : Buttercup is the much better baker . )
However entertainingly operatic , the details of the Sullivan
St separation are too complicated to go into here , and subject to the same side - choosing as in any divorce .
A side story of skulduggery is more dramatic still , if potentially litigious : as Lahey tells it , a former distributor of Sullivan
St breads hired former Sullivan
St bakers to start his own bakery , opened suddenly with an extremely similar product line , and started making deliveries to Sullivan
St customers with no notice of a change of vendor — initially in stockpiled bags with the Sullivan
St name and logo , yet .
“ It was almost the perfect crime ! ” Lahey says Mario Batali called out to him one day , getting off his Vespa .
( A lawsuit Lahey brought against the distributor over money he was owed was settled out of court . )
The threat to their business galvanized Lahey and Von Thun Calderón to join in battle , and within a year they had won back many of their lost customers .
But after weathering the crisis , the sparring partners split for good two years ago .
September 2008 will go down in the history books as the month in which the bulls finally looked like losers .
It took eight and a half years .
March 2000 marked the end of the Reagan stock market boom , although the supposed experts did not see this at the time or thereafter .
Even after the NASDAQ had declined 80 % by 2003 , they still told people that the best strategy is to buy stocks and hold them long - term .
They still believed that the stock market was going to produce 15 % per annum returns for the foreseeable future .
September 2008 and he ended that mantra .
On September 3 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was where it had been at its peak in 2000 : 11,700 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 index was lower : 1280 vs. 1529 ( close ) .
Subtract from that over 20 % price inflation .
The experts on CNBC on September 1 still clung to the illusion that there was no recession , the boom was still in force , and everything would work out just fine .
By the end of September , all that lay in ruins .
There is no optimism on CNBC today .
There is a kind of stiff upper lip determination not to panic .
It should have been obvious in August 2007 that the end of post - 2003 stock market recovery was over .
Bernanke had tightened money from the day he took over as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in February 2006 .
Real estate was the driving force of the expansion , and real estate was in decline .
It was obvious to me in late 2005 that the bull market in real estate was over .
I said so at the time .
It was surreal estate .
A handful of us saw this coming , but it seemed so far - fetched at the time that virtually nobody paid any attention .
They now pay attention .
Real estate from 2001 to late 2005 was the largest bubble in American financial history .
It dwarfed the bubble of the stock market in the 1920s , because that bubble had involved only a tiny fraction of American investors .
The residential real estate bubble involved two - thirds of the population , all of whom owned homes .
The other third were affected because of rising rents .
People thought that they were going to get rich with leveraged real estate .
Instead , something in the range of 40 % of all mortgage debtors in the United States will be under water in their mortgages by the end of 2009 .
People were told by the experts that “ this time it ’s different . ”
It was n’t different .
It was just more extreme .
The consequences will be felt over the next decade .
In September , confidence was at long last shattered .
At the beginning of the month , Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson was still assuring people that the banking system was perfectly sound .
On Sunday , September 7 , he unilaterally announced the Federal government was taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , along with their $ 5 trillion of mortgage debt .
He did not ask Congress .
Congress did not complain .
That act ended anything resembling a free market in housing .
Falling equity takes away the credit that Americans need to borrow money to live the good life .
They will soon feel betrayed .
A widespread sense of betrayal is dangerous for politicians .
A LOSS OF FAITH
We are living in a time in which the fundamental religion of our era has been faith in the redemptive power of the State .
Whenever there is a crisis , citizens call upon the State to bail them out .
They are convinced that the State has a separate existence which enables it to intervene into the affairs of men , thereby improving the life of almost everyone under its jurisdiction .
This religion of State redemption has been fading in recent years .
It gained almost universal acceptance during the Great Depression .
The fundamental purpose of the State is no longer seen as justice , but rather to serve as the source of guidance for the free market , without which the economy supposedly cannot sustain long - term economic growth .
There is enormous faith by the public in the ability of bureaucrats to collect data , interpret data , make accurate predictions , establish incentives that encourage growth , and enforce these incentives without bias .
People generally do not believe that God intervenes into the economy with the same frequency and reliability that the State does .
The great redeemer since 1987 has been Alan Greenspan .
He had the power of the printing press behind him , and he used it .
People concluded that in an economic crisis , under Greenspan ’s guidance , the Federal Reserve System would be able to overcome all economic setbacks .
This faith escalated from 1987 until his retirement in January 2006 .
We are now seeing the undermining of this confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve System to compensate for the downturns in the markets .
People are beginning to figure out that Bernanke is in over his head , and the Federal Reserve System seems impotent to overcome the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
It is significant that this assessment , namely , that this really is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , is now becoming widespread in the media .
The assumption that the Federal Reserve , when assisted by the U.S. Treasury , and funded by an extra couple of trillion dollars of Federal debt , will be able to deal with any crisis is now becoming shaky .
There are whispers of discontent .
Some people are saying that this crisis is more fundamental than what Paulson admitted in the week of September 15 .
SEPTEMBER 15
Paulson would have officially agreed with this optimism prior to September 15 .
He reiterated again and again that the financial system is fundamentally sound , that there is no threat to the banking system , and that people should not panic .
On September 15 , Lehman Brothers Holdings declared bankruptcy .
Merrill Lynch had become a subdivision of Bank of America the day before .
On September 16 , at 10 in the evening , the Federal Reserve announced an $ 85 billion bailout of AIG , the nation ’s largest insurance company .
The FED was buying AIG ’s about - to - be worthless stock .
This was the first time the FED had ever publicly bought equity in a company — a dying company .
On September 18 , Paulson clearly panicked .
He told Congress that it had to pass a $ 700 billion bailout of the financial industry .
The banks had loaded up on mortgages that are going bad , and this threatens to topple a highly leveraged series of dominoes all over the world .
None of this was visible to him the week before .
If it really was visible , then he was lying through his teeth , as high government officials are expected to , when he assured the public that there was no fundamental threat to the economic stability of the American economy .
So , he was revealed as either a liar or a completely ill - informed high official .
He is supposed to be second in knowledge only to Bernanke , but the two of them have imitated a pair of drunks , staggering home in the dark , arms wrapped around each other , each hoping that the other will not fall .
When I see Bernanke on television , he looks like someone who has been hit over the head by a frying pan .
He really looks dazed .
He does not communicate any sense of optimism .
Yet his function , as the senior representative of the fractional reserve banking cartel , is to exude confidence at all times .
He no longer does .
As for Bush , he looks washed out .
He really is a shell of a man .
He can see his legacy going down the tubes .
He is now visibly revealed as a man out of touch with reality .
He is going through the motions .
He is visibly the lamest lame - duck President since Herbert Hoover .
Paulson exudes lots of confidence , but unfortunately that confidence hit a brick wall on September 18 .
We now face a situation which he did not think we would be facing , or least pretended that we would not be facing , prior to September 15 .
We are facing a loss of confidence in the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
This loss of confidence now centers in Congress .
Congress is hearing from constituents , and most constituents are either opposed to the bailout or else they are not certain that the bailout will work , and offer the pollsters no opinion .
The number of people who oppose the bailout is significantly higher than the number people who favor it .
The taxpayers are beginning to figure out that they are going to be saddled with an enormous debt , and the main beneficiaries will be bankers .
This does not sit well with them .
We are now seeing a significant decrease in confidence regarding the reliability of the government with respect to financial crises .
This has not happened in a long time .
I do not recall that has ever happened on this scale in my lifetime .
It happened from 1929 to 1932 , but it has not happened since then .
This new outlook has blindsided the Federal government .
All the assurances coming down from the Secretary of the Treasury prior to September 15 are seen in retrospect as blowing smoke .
The critics who said that the crisis would get beyond the ability of the government control now appear to have been correct .
Bernanke and Paulson are fighting mightily to persuade Congress to have faith in the proposed bailout .
But the resistance of Congress turned out to be greater than either of them thought it would be .
The foot - dragging upset their plans .
But there was not much they can do about it .
The financial markets are still intact .
This indicates that investors are not really convinced that this crisis is so great that they must be saddled with an additional $ 700 billion of debt in order to bail out bankers .
This has the government in a dilemma .
If things get worse , Congress will capitulate to Bernanke and Paulson .
It will write a blank check .
But if things get worse , the recession will accelerate , Federal tax revenues will decline , and the deficit , even apart from the $ 700 billion bailout , will call attention to the fact that the American economy is in a crisis .
I think we have moved beyond a tipping point in American economic history .
I think the investing public has begun to sense that whatever may be wrong with the financial markets , the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department are at wit ’s end in dealing with the crisis .
This sense of uneasiness has not yet reached the general public .
Such issues as central banking , the federal funds rate , and derivatives will never penetrate the thinking of the general public .
The public simply trusts in the leaders .
The public thinks that the leaders know what is going on , and can take active steps to solve any problem when it occurs .
This confidence is being tested severely today .
My sense of the matter is the general public is still not anywhere near panic mode .
In fact , if I were to assess it one way or the other , I would say that Paulson and Bernanke are closer to panic mode than the general public is .
The public is not convinced yet that there has to be this gigantic bailout of the banking system with taxpayers ’ money .
In the past , taxpayers have grumbled when there have been tax increases .
They have paid very little attention to the Federal debt .
But this bailout is big .
Paulson says that it is important that it be executed rapidly .
But the public finally has some sense of the magnitude of the crisis that is facing the financial markets , and the magnitude of the debt burden that is going to be placed on their backs .
They do not like this message .
I , for one , am all in favor of this message .
The message is that the Federal government , even when backed up by the digital printing presses of the Federal Reserve System , is facing a crisis in the financial system that may be more than it can handle .
If the public loses confidence in the system , and if people begin to move their assets out of shaky banks into the large ones , the number of bank failures is going to increase .
As these bank failures increase , even though these are small banks , a sense of instability will begin to pervade the financial markets .
It will have the effect of the series of shoes dropping in a shoe closet larger than those of Imelda Marcos and Tammy Faye Bakker combined .
It is the drip , drip , drip of busted banks that threatens the public ’s confidence in the ability of the Federal government to deal with the problem .
Pain has not yet afflicted most Americans .
They have not lost their jobs .
They do not have a savings program , so they are not all that worried about a falling stock market .
They hear about the falling stock market , and they see the talking heads on television who tell them not to panic , but since most of them are running negative budgets anyway , imitating the Federal government , they do n’t care .
What they care about is whether or not they can meet their payments next month .
The Federal government does not worry about this because it can sell debt to foreign central banks , to investors who are moving out of the stock market in fear , and ultimately to the Federal Reserve System .
So , the Federal government really does n’t worry about red ink .
Voters do .
DEFICITS DO MATTER
Voters now see that their futures are going to involve a level of debt that they had not planned on .
They have heard that deficits do n’t matter , and so far , deficits have not hurt them personally .
But , at some point , either the debt level must cease outrunning economic growth , or else it is going to be funded by fiat money .
Voters do not understand how the Federal Reserve System works , but they do understand that if they continue to roll up debt , month after month , at some point they are going to have to pay the piper .
They are going to get calls from the credit collection agencies demanding that they pay what they owe .
They defer this day of reckoning , just as the Federal government defers its day of reckoning .
The average guy in the street perceives the Federal government as being in the same situation he is , but on a much larger scale .
The worse it looks for him personally in terms of his growing debt burden , the more he is going to make the same assumption about the Federal government .
This assumption is correct .
The average voter looks at his own budget and concludes that this can not go on forever .
This does n’t mean that he is going to stop going into debt .
Forever is quite some time away .
Until then , he will continue to spend more than he earns after taxes .
He does not want to go through the pain of balancing his budget .
Americans are borrowing against their futures .
They no longer save .
Yet they do sense that this is going to cost them in the future .
They are not going to live in a comfortable retirement .
Their children are going to inherit debt from the Federal government , and this will not be compensated by any inheritance left to them by the parents as people grow older .
They see that they have fewer reserves , they are supposed to change their behavior .
They are supposed to go into panic saving mode .
But the people have not done this .
Why not ?
Because they have been told that deficits do n’t matter .
They have also been reassured , time after time , that the Federal government will intervene and bail them out if they ever get into a major problem .
They look to Social Security , Medicare , the FDIC , and all of the other Federal regulatory agencies , and they conclude that they are safe .
Yes , they may go through some hard times , and they may miss a few payments , but they will not be reduced to bankruptcy , and even if they are reduced to bankruptcy , someone will still send them a credit card application a month later .
So , they really do n’t worry about the future very much .
They have a nagging sense that something is drastically wrong , but they do n’t try to fix it .
They do n’t want to begin to think about fixing it .
All of this is a threat to the Federal government .
It is a threat because people will eventually come to understand fully that the Federal government is not fundamentally different from an individual household .
It runs deficits .
It can sell Treasury debt to the Federal Reserve System .
But , at some point , it either balances its budget or else it goes under .
How ?
By inflating .
It ceases to be able to send out checks denominated in money that buys anything .
The average guy looks at his own situation , and he concludes that at some point he will run out of maneuvering room .
He has some vague awareness that the Federal government is in the same predicament .
On the one hand , he is seen that the Federal government always seems to evade a crisis .
On the other hand , he knows that he has done the same thing , and time is running out for him .
Why should we believe the time is not running out for the Federal government ?
Time really is running out for the Federal government .
The question is : When ?
It may be 10 years away .
It may be 20 years away .
Or , if the bailout does n’t go through , and Paulson was not crying wolf , it may begin in the next six months .
The crucial factor is the direction of the trend .
CONCLUSION
I think the investing public has finally figured out that the stock market is not going to go back up above what it was in March 2000 , plus 20 % to compensate for higher consumer prices .
The number of people on tout TV who talk about a new boom in the stock market being just around the corner , with highs in the range of 20,000 or 30,000 on the Dow , is zero .
“ Dow 36,000 ” is a matter of ancient history .
This shift in perspective is going to make it much more difficult for the government to persuade the voters that it has any more rabbits in its hat .
Every time it pulls out a rabbit these days , there is a large price tag on it .
The rabbit is then handed to the taxpayers .
The government has no viable answers .
It has only programs to delay the inevitable .
As this sense of the inevitable increases , people ’s willingness to invest in the stock market and the bond market will decline .
Capital will become more expensive for private entrepreneurs .
I do n’t think the rate of economic growth will reverse on a permanent basis , or even on a five - year basis , but it will be reduced .
Our lives will be worse off as a result .

Homebuyers will not have to pay stamp duty on properties costing £ 175,000 or less for the next 12 months .
The current £ 125,000 threshold will be raised as part of a package of measures aimed at boosting the housing market .
Someone buying a home for £ 175,000 will save £ 1,750 under the scheme , which is likely to cost the Treasury £ 600 m .
The government estimates half of all property transactions will now be exempt from stamp duty - up from one third when the threshold was £ 125,000 .
' Do all we can ' Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the package of measures - including help for first - time buyers and families facing repossession - showed the government was taking action to help people through difficult times .
" Home owners need to know that we will do everything we can to keep the housing market moving , " he told BBC News .
They are not going to help the vast majority of families facing a rising cost of living and falling house prices
George Osborne , Conservatives
Policies target repossessions
Home buyers give their views
But the Conservatives - who say they would scrap stamp duty for first - time buyers on properties worth £ 250,000 or less - said the measures were a short - term survival plan to keep Mr Brown in a job .
The government has not said how it will pay for the £ 600 m estimated cost of the stamp duty move .
Chancellor Alistair Darling said he would reveal more details in his Autumn Pre-Budget Report .
He said the government was also considering ways of increasing the availability of mortgage finance .
But - in an echo of his weekend interview with The Guardian in which he said the economic downturn could be worse than previously thought - he said other factors would be crucial to the housing market 's recovery .

" We face a unique set of circumstances that we have not seen in generations , where you have a credit crunch and where you have high oil and food prices .
" But I remain optimistic , as I have said on many occasions before , that we can get through it .
" We will get through it and today 's measures , helping the housing market , are one example of how the government can help people . "
Other housing moves announced by the government include : " Free " five year loans of up to 30 % of a property 's value for first time buyers of new homes in England
Extension of powers for councils and housing associations to be able to pay off debt for homeowners who can no longer afford mortgage payments and then charge rent .
Shortening from 39 weeks to 13 weeks the period before Income Support for Mortgage Interest is paid
Bringing forward spending from future years to encourage more social housing to be built
The funding for these measures , which unlike the stamp duty move will only apply in England , has been previously allocated and brought forward , the Treasury said .
Under the new loans system , called HomeBuy Direct , households in England earning less than £ 60,000 will be offered loans free of charge for five years on new properties , co-funded by the state and developers .
' Difficult conditions '
Once the five - year " free " period is up , homebuyers will be asked to pay a fee , the Department for Communities and Local Government said - although no more detail of this was provided .
In a statement , the DCLG said : " Not only will this [ HomeBuy Direct ] help first - time buyers ... it will help the housebuilding industry weather difficult conditions . "
This looks like a hotchpotch of measures thrown together to save Gordon Brown 's political skin
Nick Clegg , Lib Dems
Send us your comments
The prime minister has faced a difficult few months , with Labour losing two parliamentary seats in by - elections , the London mayoralty and many councillors in May 's local elections .
On Monday , he said the UK faced " unique circumstances " , including oil prices trebling and the global credit crunch .
But Mr Brown said the government was " resilient in ... dealing with these problems " .
He earlier denied a rift with Mr Darling , who had said the country was facing its worst economic crisis in 60 years .
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has said the UK economy is likely to fall into recession this year - the gloomiest forecast yet from an official organisation .
The Conservatives said the measures announced to help the housing market were " too little , too late " .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said : " We will look at the details of these measures and we will support those that will work .
" But let 's be clear , they are not going to help the vast majority of families facing a rising cost of living and falling house prices .
" Nor do they amount to the first instalment of the economic recovery plan we were promised .
" I suspect that what we will see in the coming weeks is a desperate and short - term survival plan for the prime minister rather that the long - term economic plan the country needs . "
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said : " This looks like a hotchpotch of measures thrown together to save Gordon Brown 's political skin .
" The social housing stock could be increased far more easily by allowing local authorities to buy up unsold properties and use them for new social housing .
" Yet again the government is desperately scrabbling around for a way to fix problems of its own making . "
Scotland 's first minister , Alex Salmond , welcomed an end to the uncertainty which he said was causing people to delay house purchases .
The Westminster government was now catching up with what the Scottish government had already done to help the housing market , he added .
Two weeks ago , Mr Salmond announced he was bringing forward £ 100 m worth of housing expenditure to this year rather than in 2010 .

In its most dramatic market intervention in years , the U.S. government seized two of the nation 's largest financial companies , taking direct responsibility for firms that provide funding for around three - quarters of new home mortgages .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced plans Sunday to take control of troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and replace the companies ' chief executives .
The Treasury will acquire $ 1 billion of preferred shares in each company without providing immediate cash , and has pledged ...
David Axmark , co-founder of MySQL , has quit Sun Microsystems because he “ hates ” all the rules he has to follow at the company .
“ I have thought about my role at Sun and decided that I am better off in smaller organisations , ” wrote Axmark in his resignation letter , according to a blog post from Sun flack Kaj Arnö .
“ I HATE all the rules that I need to follow , and I also HATE breaking them .
It would be far better for me to ‘ retire ’ from employment and work with MySQL and Sun on a less formal basis . ”
Sun acquired MySQL in January when it bought the open source database developer for $ 1bn .
Axmark co-founded MySQL with Michael " Monty " Widenius , who set tongues wagging in September when reports suggested he was mulling his future with the firm .
Monty – the primary architect of the original MySQL database – has spent the past " several years " contemplating a move that would allow him to concentrate on engineering the MySQL server , according to a previous blog post from Arnö .
Axmark ’s decision to quit the company will come as a huge blow to Sun , which in August lost the longtime head of MySQL's Japan business , Larry Stefonic , after five years with the outfit .
Some might conclude that the continued exodus of key MySQL players could suggest that all is not well at Sun HQ .
Arnö , however , is doing his face - saving best to accentuate the positives about Axmark ’s decision to walk .
“ I wish David would have stayed longer at Sun , but I understand why he decided to resign and I respect his decision .
" I ’m happy he ’s fine with working as a consultant for Sun , doing speaking engagements and connecting us with his huge network .
It ’s very much appreciated , ” said Arnö , who also pointed out that Larry Ellison ’s boat is bigger than Axmark’s .
We ’ll leave you to work out what that all means . ®
* Investors flee for safety after Lehman files for Chapter 11
* High - grade debt , gold , yen in demand on bank industry storm
* Focus turns to Fed policy decision on Tuesday ( Repeats to additional subscribers with no change to text ) ( Updates prices , details )
HONG KONG , Sept 15 ( Reuters ) - Stocks and the U.S. dollar fell sharply on Monday after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection , sending safe - haven Treasury debt and gold prices soaring as the financial system bent under severe pressure .
U.S. stock market futures SPc2DJc2ND c2 were down around 3 percent , pointing to sharply lower open , while major European markets were set for falls of between 3.5 to 4 percent STXEc1FDXc1FCEc1 .
Rapid - fire developments on Wall Street , only a week after the U.S. government bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , left some analysts literally speechless and sent shockwaves through almost every asset class .
The dollar plunged 1.9 percent against the yen , on track for its biggest decline since February 2007 , as investors ’ willingness to take risks evaporated .
[ ID:nLF649266 ]
“ It ’s a pure flight to quality right now , ” said Adam Donaldson , head debt strategist at Australia ’s Commonwealth Bank .
“ The big concern is how Lehman and other banks unwind their credit default contracts , ” he added .
“ Nobody knows how that will play out . ”
The price of insurance against default on debt soared , pushing up the iTRAXX Asia ex Japan high - yield index ITAHY5Y=IE , a measure of credit market stress , to match record highs reached in the runup to Bear Stearns ' collapse in March .
While a lack of confidence felled Lehman , a lack of short - term funding was hurting one of the world 's largest insurers American International Group Inc AIG.N.
The firm was asking the Federal Reserve for a bridge loan of $ 40 billion , according to the New York Times , an unprecedented move that further battered the dollar and knocked down two - year U.S. government debt yields to a five - month low .

ASIAN STOCKS TUMBLE
Stock markets in Australia , Singapore and Taiwan all dropped 3 to 4 percent , Indian stocks .
BSESN fell 5 percent .
Holidays in most major Asian markets kept volume thin though price action belied a desire to seek safety first and ask questions later .
“ The exact ramifications of the liquidation process and the unwinding of positions pertaining to the Lehman situation remain unclear .
Hence , over the next 48 hours at least , financial markets are likely to be volatile and tense , ” said economists with United Overseas Bank in Singapore in a note .
The Swiss franc and yen , currencies associated with stability in times of duress , strengthened , especially against the dollar , which reeled as some in the market speculated the Federal Reserve may have to cut interest rates on Tuesday to shore up the economy from financial fallout .
The U.S. dollar dropped 1.9 percent against the yen at 105.88 yen JPY= and was off 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1165 francs CHF = .
The euro rose by more than a cent against the dollar to $ 1.4380 , up 1.1 percent from late Friday in New York .

FED SUPPLIES LIQUIDITY , NOT CONFIDENCE
The Fed on Monday said it would begin accepting equities as collateral for emergency loans for the first time as it tried to ease the spiralling crisis .
The steps would likely help surviving financial institutions to find cash but may not do much to boost global confidence in the U.S. financial system .
“ The mere fact that they are forced to do this -- and they may still yet do some more -- indicates the breadth and depth of the trouble that the system is in , ” said V. Anantha Nageswaran , head of investment research , Asia - Pacific with Bank Julius Baer in Singapore .
In addition , 10 of the world ’s biggest banks agreed to establish a $ 70 billion borrowing facility to bolster liquidity .
U.S. Treasury yields , which move in the opposite direction of prices , fell sharply in early Asian trade on Monday and 3 - month eurodollar futures < O#ED : > surged as dealers priced in the possibility of lower Federal Reserve benchmark interest rates .
The yield on the policy - sensitive two - year Treasury note US2YT=RR hit a five - month low of 1.90 percent .
The 10 - year yield US10YT=RR was also at the lowest since April , at 3.52 percent compared with 3.72 percent late on Friday .
Bank of America BAC.N said it would acquire Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N for $ 50 billion in yet another development that realigned Wall Street .
The deal was significant not just because of its price but it showed how the private sector will have to sort itself out and not depend on backing of the U.S. government .

Oil CLc1 fell $ 2.10 to $ 99.08 a barrel after falling as low as $ 98.46 -- the lowest since February 26 -- adding to a steady downward trend in prices since mid-July 's peak of over $ 147 a barrel as evidence mounts that high energy costs and a weakening economy are cutting into fuel consumption .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Navy said on Wednesday it appeared pirates had tried to attack one of its big military oil tankers .
A security team aboard the vessel opened fire on two small boats near Somalia after they ignored warnings and pursued the ship , a U.S. Fifth Fleet spokesman said .
“ From all appearances it does look like it was a pirate attack and the incident is currently under investigation , ” he said by telephone from Bahrain .
He said the Military Sealift Command ( MSC ) oil tanker , the John Lenthall , which usually carries a range of fuels for the U.S. armed forces , was transiting outside Somalia ’s territorial waters when the incident took place .
In a statement the navy said a whole range of warnings were given before the security team opened fire on the small open skiffs which came within 400 yards of the tanker .
The skiffs then retreated and the navy said there were no reports of any casualties .
“ This incident is clear proof that all mariners must remain vigilant , ” said Captain Steve Kelley , the commander responsible MSC ships in the region .
Somali pirates have in the past mounted attacks on merchant shipping from skiffs launched from so - called “ mother ships ” in the waters in and beyond Somalia .
Heavily armed Somali pirates have hijacked more than 30 merchant vessels of the Horn of Africa country this year , with attacks off its coast and the Gulf of Aden almost every day .
The DRM that is installed on your computer along with your copy of Spore has come to completely dominate the conversation about the game , and while thousands of one - star reviews on Amazon is bad for PR , a class - action lawsuit could be bad for actual business .
One such suit has already been filed by Melissa Tomas , on the grounds that the installation of SecuROM is not disclosed in any of the game 's documentation , that the program is " uninstallable , " and does all sorts of nasty things to your system .
" Once installed , [ SecuROM becomes ] a permanent part of the consumer 's software portfolio , " alleges the complaint ( PDF , found via GamePolitics ) .
" Even if the consumer uninstalls Spore , and entirely deletes it from their computer , SecuROM remains a fixture in their computer unless and until the consumer completely wipes their hard drive through reformatting or replacement of the drive . "
After searching through Spore 's End -User Licensing Agreement , it is clear that while EA is explicit that the game will install DRM measures , the name SecuROM is never made clear .
As for the claims about the program being uninstallable short of a complete system wipe , an uninstaller is actually available to remove SecuROM .
You can grab it directly from the official web site , in fact .
The rest of the language is vague , making specific claims hard to either back up or refute .
The suit says that SecuROM " surreptitiously operated , overseeing function and operation on the computer , preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and / or disrupting hardware operations . "
The suit also quotes from an Amazon review that tells a horror story ; " The SecuROM disabled [ my fianceé 's ] firewall , anti-virus , and much of the functionality of Vista .
He can no long install any other programs to his computer , or use his task manage because his entire computer freezes up . "
Another complaint alleged that SecuROM led his computer to tell him he " was n't authorized . "
The suit continues to use accounts from the Amazon carpet - bombing as evidence , although the claimed damages may be hard or impossible to conclusively prove ; it 's not exactly possible to perform checks on all these thousands of computers to prove that SecuROM did in fact make the system " slow down [ the entire ] system significantly . "
The claim that a reformat is the only way to remove the program is repeated again and again .
The frustrating thing is that SecuROM does have some problems , but they 're mostly byproducts of its design ; the fact that EA does n't disclose its installation with clear instructions on how to remove it is a very real concern .
The program wo n't allow you to use certain CD virtualization programs at the same time as the protected program , and certain other programs are simply not allowed to be run concurrently with SecuROM .
That makes sense in a program that is supposed to fight piracy .
But this lawsuit claims that SecuROM does everything short of leaving the refrigerator door open so your milk goes bad , and the factually incorrect and over - the - top complaints may hurt the chances of this case going anywhere .
Simply put , the problems people are reporting are n't problems SecuROM have ever had , and this scare - mongering hurts the legitimate complaints about DRM .
There are are very real and very troubling things about the use of SecuROM and the control it has over your computer .
The lack of any specific complaints in this lawsuit makes it seem more like a money grab than anything else , and may detract from legitimate attention paid to the problems plaguing DRM in PC gaming .

The global financial crisis
In pictures
The US Federal Reserve has announced an $ 85 bn ( £ 48 bn ) rescue package for AIG , the country 's biggest insurance company , to save it from bankruptcy .
AIG will get an $ 85 bn loan , in return for an 80 % public stake in the firm .
The rescue follows the collapse of US investment giant Lehman Brothers , which caused share prices to plummet across the world 's financial markets .
Authorities are hoping the bail - out will avert the threat of a global financial meltdown .
The Fed 's move is viewed by some as the most radical intervention in private business in its history and has helped fuel a tentative rally on global stock markets .
The past few days have seen dramatic events unfold in the financial world :
The UK 's top mortgage lender HBOS is in merger talks with Lloyds TSB after a steep fall in HBOS shares
The Fed and the US Treasury say AIG 's bailout will protect the interests of US taxpayers
US interest rates have been kept on hold despite widespread calls for a cut
Barclays says it is buying some of the core assets of US investment bank Lehman Brothers for $ 1.75 bn ( £ 1 bn ) ' Challenging times '
The Federal Reserve made its decision about AIG " with the full support of the Treasury Department " , it said in a statement , adding that the secured loan included conditions designed to protect " the interests of the US government and taxpayers " .

The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson refused to bail out America 's fourth - largest investment bank Lehman Brothers after it filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday .
But he supported the rescue of AIG and said the move would protect taxpayers .
" These are challenging times for our financial markets , " he said .
The rescue of AIG - which has a trillion dollars in assets and insures bank loans around the world - helped world stock markets rally .
Wednesday trading saw gains in Tokyo , Taiwan , Singapore and Seoul , though prices in Hong Kong , Shanghai and Australia fell .
European markets were higher , but trading was volatile .
The dollar also rose against major currencies .
AIG 's ' tentacles '
Analysts said the demise of AIG - which has policy holders in more than 100 countries and insures deals and investments across the globe - would have had a far greater impact on financial markets than Lehman 's collapse .

Were the company to fail , many banks and investment funds around the world would lose their insurance cover at a time when defaults on payments are likely to rise .
The Governor of New York , David Paterson , said AIG had so many business interests it would be hard to predict how widespread its bankruptcy would have been felt .
" Its tentacles go further in to the avenues of business , as in mortgages , as in credit , as in hedge funds , as in countless ways that affect consumers , that affect drivers , that affect homeowners , affect passengers , " he said .
AIG had posted losses in each of the last nine months .
It was badly affected by the collapse of the US housing market , says the BBC 's business reporter Rob Young , owing to the underwriting payments it was forced to make when customers defaulted on their loans .
Market slump
The AIG plan calls for the government to seize up to 80 % of the company and remove its management , in a similar fashion to the way it took control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were crippled by the US housing crisis .

The White House welcomed the package , saying the deal was made " in the interest of promoting stability in financial markets and limiting damage to the broader economy " .
Meanwhile , the Fed has left interest rates unchanged at 2 % despite calls for a cut .
The BBC's Matthew Price in New York said the bank had decided an interest rate cut would not help to alleviate the short - term financial crisis .
On Wall Street , the Dow Jones rallied on Tuesday , closing 141 points higher having on Monday suffered its worst day 's trading since the September 2001 attacks on the US .
Central banks around the world responded by carrying out emergency measures to keep markets liquid .
The extra funding came as the interest rates at which banks lend to each other rocketed - as they did at the start of the credit crunch .

What are these ?
Despite the furor caused by Republican John McCain ’s return to Washington to join the $ 700 - billion financial bailout negotiations , his participation in the talks has so far done little more than spark a contentious debate over whether he has helped or hurt the process .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) insisted that McCain ’s role during a bipartisan White House meeting Thursday was “ entirely constructive . ”
McCain , he added , “ had suggestions .
We ’re taking those into account , and we ’re going forward .
And I think his goal is that we get a result . ”
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) told reporters in Washington that McCain had contributed little and largely used the negotiations as a media event .

“ The insertion of presidential politics has not been helpful , ” he said .
“ It ’s been harmful .
A few days ago , I called on Sen. McCain to take a stand , to let us know where he stands on the issue , on this bailout .
But all he has done is stand in front of the cameras . ”
The White House meeting , which McCain helped arrange , was attended by President Bush , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and congressional leaders .
McCain sat silently for more than 40 minutes , participants said later , offering comments only at the end .
No agreement was reached , and each side accused the other of acting in bad faith and scuttling a possible deal for partisan advantage .

Democrats in the meeting said McCain played a shockingly passive role as Obama , Paulson and others tried to make sense of a last - minute proposal unveiled by House Republicans just before the meeting .
“ Several of us asked what was the plan , ” said House Banking Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , one of the leading negotiators .
“ We also could n’t find out whether Sen. McCain was actively supporting this or not . ”
Frank said that he and others asked McCain directly if he was involved and that McCain replied : “ I think all members have a right to pursue their concerns . ”
McCain did not suggest how he thought the impasse could be overcome or ask any questions , another participant said .

McCain ’s top economic advisor , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , complained to NPR that much of the meeting “ was not constructive .
I mean , there was a lot of finger - pointing .
People were yelling at one point .
It was a meeting that did not meet the senator ’s goals , which was to make progress toward an agreement . ”
A senior McCain aide was more caustic , arguing that Democrats in the White House meeting had shouted and tried to provoke McCain into losing his temper .
McCain did not , he pointed out , instead letting Rep. John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , the House minority leader , take the lead .
The aide described the meeting as a Kabuki theater in which all sides played scripted roles and that cleared the air for more substantial talks this weekend , in which McCain is expected to participate .

Times staff writer Noam N. Levey , traveling with the Obama campaign , contributed to this report .
" Forget the whips and chains : it 's actually a lot more serious than that " .
This was the view of Consenting Adult Action Network Spokesperson and disability activist Clair Lewis , as she joined fashion photographer Ben Westwood and a bevy of bound and gagged models in a demonstration against what they believe to be the latest government witch - hunt .
" It is easy to trivialise this as being about a bunch of people worried about their porn stash when the extreme porn law goes live in January , " said Clair .
" But the issues run far wider .
You have nothing to lose but your chains
" Back in 2006 government were still openly claiming that they had no evidence that porn did any harm .
Despite that , they changed the Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons
Act at the last minute to make it possible to bar individuals from ‘ regulated jobs ’ just for possessing porn of any degree of violence .
In that one act , they effectively ruled our community out of almost half the jobs on offer .
" The result of these two measures taken together is that individuals are feeling scared , angry and under pressure .
We do not believe government reassurances about our sexuality .
We think they are as bigoted about kinkiness as previous governments were about homosexuality . "
It is possible that Ms Lewis has a point .
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice was quick to offer reassurance that the government had no such downer on her preferences .
According to them , the extreme porn clauses of the Criminal Justice Act ( s. 63 - 66 ) were about catching material that originated outside the UK that could not at present be prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 .
There was no intention to attack conduct , so long as it was legal and did not cause harm to the individuals participating in it .
They were rather less forthcoming on the issue of why the UK had adopted this route as a means to protect us all from " Dangerous Pictures " .
Governments across the world have looked at the issue and , according to CAAN , most are now looking into some form of filtering or blocking .
Their spokesperson added : " The UK government is the only one to have turned this into a direct attack on individuals . "
Insistence that everything 's just fine also come from the Department for Children , Schools and Families .
A spokesperson added : " Safeguarding children is top priority for this Government and the child has been put at the heart of our reforms and we are determined to maintain a relentless focus on children ’s safety . "
The real test of these promises is likely to come next year , when the extreme porn law finally goes live , and the Vetting Database comes online .
A Ministry of Justice Impact Assessment ( pdf ) suggests that there should be no more than 30 prosecutions in the first year of the extreme porn law .
If true , this would make it a fairly toothless beast .
The law on vetting is something else .
Despite government assurances that the vetting database will only cover 11 million adults ( still a very large part of the adult population ) , the estimates are open to question and it's fair to assume overreaction by public service authorities will lead the database eventually to include at least 14 million adults .
There is evidence already , from individuals who have spoken to us , that some employers are beginning to quiz would - be employees about the nature of the material they use for sexual titillation – which puts individuals in the highly difficult position of having to decide between being honest and not getting a job , or lying at interview and risk losing the job later .
That , coupled with the fact that legal precedent now has it that you can be barred from work on the basis of unsubstantiated allegation alone ( what used to be called ‘ hearsay ’ ) and the real threat to personal sexuality looks less and less like the extreme porn law : more and more like the vetting database .
Last word on this matter - for now - goes to Baroness Miller , who won the respect of a great many in the BDSM world for her spirited defence in the House of Lords of a lifestyle that is not hers .
Reacting to the demo , the Baroness said : " People do n't understand what the government was up to in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill and why they 're interfering in their private affairs .
No legislation should leave law - abiding citizens criminalised for private sexual behaviour that harms no one . " ®

The obituaries for Rostislav Belyakov are short , almost mysterious .
He was 94 and an engineer — and the chief designer at MiG , manufacturer of some of the world ’s most famous combat jets .
Balyakov died on Feb. 28 .
Most of the obits resemble this brief Associated Press story , which notes that Belyakov joined MiG as a young engineer in 1941 , became deputy chief designer in 1957 and then succeeded Artyom Mikoyan as chief designer in 1969 .
“ Belyakov led the development of a family of MiG fighters , including MiG - 23 , MiG - 25 , MiG - 29 and their versions , which have been the backbone of the Soviet and then Russian air forces , ” the AP repoted , adding that the engineer “ was showered with state awards and honors , but his name was unknown to the public until the Soviet collapse . ”
According to a Russian aviation Website , in 1997 Belyakov “ was appointed the counselor of the general designer , ” presumably meaning he became a consultant or designer emeritus .
Belyakov . Via Aereo.jor.br
We do n’t know much about Belyakov , but we can surmise that he had an interesting career , to say the least .
If he became a designer in 1941 , he was building planes for Stalin at a time when designers like Andrei Tupolev were drawing up aircraft blueprints from inside a Soviet penal laboratory .
Rather than speak of Belyakov , we should let his work speak for itself .
The MiG - 21 Fishbed proved a worthy adversary for U.S. aircraft during the Vietnam War .
Many air forces still use the tiny jet .
The MiG - 25 Foxbat set speed and altitude records in the 1960s .
The MiG - 29 Fulcrum with its helmet - mounted sight was reckoned a deadly opponent against contemporary American warplanes like the F / A - 18 Hornet .
The MiG - 31 Foxhound , a sort of 1980s upgrade of the MiG - 25 , was the first fighter with a passive electronically scanned array radar .
On the other hand , Belyakov might not want to be remembered for the MiG - 23 Flogger or its MiG - 27 ground attack variant , swing - wing aircraft that were easy prey for Israeli F - 15 Eagles over Lebanon in 1982 .
He probably was too late to design the latest MiGs , such as the MiG - 35 .
Yet Belyakov has left a legacy of aircraft design that few can match .
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
A new poll suggests that Barack Obama is widening his lead over John McCain in two battleground states but indicates the race is dead even in Ohio , the state that decided the last presidential election .
John McCain gets the support of white voters in Ohio , while in Iowa and Minnesota they lean toward Barack Obama .
In a CNN / Time / Opinion Research Corp. survey out Wednesday afternoon , 55 percent of Iowa registered voters who were questioned said that Obama , D - Illinois , is their choice for president , with 40 percent backing McCain , R - Arizona .
That 's more than double the lead Obama had in a University of Iowa poll taken early last month .
" Obama is winning in all regions of the state , even in the western counties , where George W. Bush beat John Kerry by 17 points , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" Obama is winning rural voters in Iowa , not something you see in many other states . "
Iowa 's caucuses kicked off the presidential primary season and launched Obama toward the Democratic presidential nomination .
" Iowa was Barack Obama 's breakthrough state .
He won the Democratic caucuses with a powerful organization .
John McCain barely competed in the Iowa Republican caucuses .
He came in fourth , " said Bill Schneider , a CNN senior political analyst .
" Obama retains a strong organization in Iowa , where McCain is just beginning to get started , " Schneider said .
It appears to be a similar story in Minnesota , where the Republicans are holding their national convention this week .
The poll indicates that Obama has a 12 - point lead over McCain , 53 percent to 41 percent .
That 's up slightly from a 10 - point lead Obama held in a Humphrey Institute survey taken last month .
" It 's important to note that today 's polls do n't reflect any boost McCain might get from the GOP convention , because nearly all the interviews were done before the festivities started in St. Paul , " Holland said .
" This could be Obama 's high - water mark in those states . "
It looks like a very different story in Ohio , which has 20 electoral votes up for grabs .
iReport.com : Share your images from the campaign trail
President Bush 's narrow victory in Ohio four years ago clinched his re-election .
It looks like it could be just as tight this time around in Ohio .
The poll suggests that Obama has a 2 - point lead over McCain , 47 percent to 45 percent , which is a virtual tie when taking into account the survey 's 3.5 - percentage - point sampling error .
" In Iowa and Minnesota , white voters are backing Obama .
In Ohio , white voters are supporting McCain .
What about those blue - collar white voters that were so important for Clinton in Ohio ?
They 're pretty solidly for McCain , " Schneider said .
The CNN / Time Magazine / Opinion Research Corp. poll was taken August 31 through September 2 , with 828 registered voters in Iowa , 742 registered voters in Minnesota and 685 registered voters in Ohio questioned by telephone .

Obama condemns ad against Jewish candidate
Obama — in his de facto new role as leader of the Democratic Party — just put out a statement condemning Nikki Tinker 's attack on Stephen Cohen , which has been widely interpreted as a thinly disguised reference to Cohen 's Judaism :
“ These incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of Tennessee .
It ’s time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country , ” Obama said .
( Tinker has pulled the attack ad from her YouTube channel ; you can read a bit about it here . )
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann last night labeled Tinker " the worst person in the world . "

' Judicial Murder ' Despite Doubts , Alabama Man Faces Execution
Thomas Arthur has been on death row since 1982 .
His execution is set for July 31 -- although strong doubts remain about his guilt .
The governor of Alabama is refusing to allow DNA tests that may prove his innocence .
As a Perl programmer , I enjoy a lot using hash tables .
I keep this habit in C/ C++ programming .
Then what C/C++ hash libraries are available ?
How are they compared to each other ?
In this post , I will give a brief review of hash libraries and present a small benchmark showing their practical performance .
Hash table libraries
In C++ , the most widely used hash table implementation is hash_map / set in SGI STL , which is part of the GCC compiler .
Note that hash_map / set is SGI ’s extention to STL , but is not part of STL .
TR1 ( technical report 1 ) tries to standardize hash tables .
It provides unordered_map / set with similar API to hash_map / set .
Most of TR1 routines are available since gcc -4.0 .
Google sparse hash is another C++ hash table template library with similar API to hash_map / set .
It provides two implementations , one is efficient in speed and the other is in memory .
In contrast , there are few good C libraries around .
I have tried SunriseDD , uthash , glibc hash table , hashit , Christopher Clark ’s hashtable , glib hash table and ghthash .
SunriseDD sounds a great library that implements a lock - free hash table .
However , I am not sure how to install it or use it , although the code itself is well documented .
Uthash is a single header file .
It is quite complex to use and incompatiable with C++.
It also lacks basic APIs such as counting how many elements in the hash table .
Glibc hash and hashit seem to only implement static hash tables .
Glibc hash even does not have deletion operation .
Only glib hash , CC ’s hashtable and ghthash implement most of common operations .
And they still have their weakness in comparison to C++ implementations ( see below ) .
Design of the benchmark
The benchmark is comprised of two experiments .
In the first experiment , a random integer array of 5 million elements is generated with about 1.25 million distinct keys .
Each element is then tested whether it is present in the hash .
If the element is in the hash , it will be removed ; otherwise , it will be inserted .
625,792 distinct keys will be in the hash after this process .
To test performance on string input , I convert integers to strings with sprintf ( ) .
The second experiment is designed by Craig Silverstein , the author of sparsehash .
I am using his source codes .
This experiment tests the performance of insertion from zero sized hash , insertion from preallocated hash , replacement , query , query of empty hash , and removal .

Notes :
Please be aware that changing the size of input data may change the ranking of speed and memory .
The speed of a library may vary up to 10 % in two different runs .
CPU time is measured in seconds .
Memory denotes the peak memory , measured in MB .
For string hash , only the pointer to a string is inserted .
Memory in the table does not count the space used by strings .
If two numbers are given for memory , the first is for integer keys and the second for string keys .
For all C++ libraries and khash.h , one operation is needed to achieve “ insert if absent ; delete otherwise ” .
Glib and ghthash require two operations , which does not favour these two libraries .
The speed may also be influenced by the efficiency of hash funtions .
Khash and Glib use the same hash function .
TR1 / SGI - STL / google - hash use another hash function .
Fortunately , to my experiment , the two string hash functions have quite similar performance and so the benchmark reflects the performance of the overall hash libraries instead of just hash functions .
For glib and ghthash , what is inserted is the pointer to the integer instead of the integer itself .
Ghthash supports dynamic hash table .
However , the results do not seem correct when this is switched on .
I am using fixed - size hash table .
This favours ghthash .
CC ’s hashtable will force to free a key , which is not implemented in all the other libraries .
This behaviour will add overhead on both speed and memory in my benchmark ( but probably not in other applications ) .
The memory is measured for integer keys .
This simple benchmark does not test the strength and weakness of splay tree .
And here is the result of the second experiment :
Library grow pred / grow replace fetch fetchnull remove Memory TR1 194.2 183.9 30.7 15.6 15.2 83.4 224.6 STL hash_map 149.0 110.5 35.6 11.5 14.0 87.2 204.2 STL map 289.9 289.9 141.3 134.3 7.0 288.6 236.8 google - sparse 417.2 237.6 89.5 84.0 12.1 100.4 85.4 google - dense 108.4 39.4 17.8 8.3 2.8 18.0 256.0 khash ( C++ ) 111.2 99.2 26.1 11.5 3.0 17.4 198.0
Notes :
CPU time is measured in nanosecond for each operation .
Memory is measured by TCmalloc .
It is the memory difference before and after the allocation of the hash table , instead of the peak memory .
In this experiment , integers are inserted in order and there are no collisions in the hash table .
All these libraries provide similar API .
Discussions
Speed and memory .
The larger the hash table , the fewer collisions may occur and the faster the speed .
For the same hash library , increasing memory always increases speed .
When we compare two libraries , both speed and memory should be considered .

C vs. C++. All C++ implementations have similar API .
It is also very easy to use for any type of keys .
Both C libraries , ghthash and glib , can only keep pointers to the keys , which complicates API and increases memory especially for 64 - bit systems where a pointer takes 8 bytes .
In general , C++ libraries is perferred over C ones .
Surprisingly , on 32 - bit Mac OS X , glib outperforms TR1 and STL for string input .
This might indicate that the glib implementation itself is very efficient , but just the lack of functionality in C affects the performance .

Generic programming in C .
Except my khash.h , all the other C hash libraries use ( void * ) to achieve generic typing .
Using void * is okey for strings , but will cause overhead for integers .
This is why all C libraries , except khash.h , is slower than C++ libraries on integer keys , but close to on string keys .

Open addressing vs. chaining hash .
Khash and google hash implement open addressing hash while the remaining implement chaining hash .
In open addressing hash , the size of each bucket equals the size of a key plus 0.25 byte .
Google sparsehash further compresses unused bucket to 1 bit , achieving high memory efficiency .
In chaining hash , the memory overhead of each bucket is at least 4 bytes on 32 bit machines , or 8 bytes on 64bit machines .
However , chaining hash is less affected when the hash table is nearly full .
In practice , both open addressing and chaining hash occupy similar memory under similar speed .
Khash takes less peak memory mainly due to its advanced technique in rehashing which reduces memory usage .
So far as speed is concerned , chaining hash may have fewer comparison between keys .
We can see this from the fact that the speed of chaining hash approaches that of open addressing hash on string keys but much slower on integer keys .

Memory usage of search trees .
B - tree is the winner here .
Each element in the B - tree only needs one additional pointer .
When there are enough elements , a B - tree is at least halfly full ; on average it should be around 75 % full .
And so on 64 - bit systems , for a B - tree with N elements , we need additional N*8/0.75=10N bytes memory .
Splay tree will need N * 8 * 2=16N extra space .
RB tree is the worst .

Other issues . a )
Google hash becomes unbearably slow when I try to put a lot of strings in the hash table .
All the other libraries do not have this problem .
b)
Google hash performs more comparisons than khash .
This is obvious because google - dense is clearly faster on integer keys but comparable to khash on string keys .
Concluding remarks
C++ hash library is much easier to use than C libraries .
This is definitely where C++ is preferred over C .
TR1 hash implementation is no faster than STL implementation .
They may outperform one another under certain input or settings .
SGI hash_map is faster and takes less memory than STL map .
Unless ordering is important , hash_map is a better container than map .
Google hash is a worthy choice when we understand why it is slow for many string keys .
My khash library , which is a single - file C++ template header , achieves good balance between speed and memory .
All my source codes are available at the Programs page .
Update
C interface can be elegant , too , if we implement it cleverly .
See this post .
I realize that we just need one lookup to achieve “ insert if absent ; delete otherwise ” .
This further improves the speed for all C++ libraries .
I have analyzed google dense hash table in this post which explains why it is faster than khash on integer keys but close to or slower than on string keys .
This thread directed me to gcc hashtable , and cocom hashtable .
They are more or less independent of other source codes , but it would still take time to separate the source codes .
So , I have not benchmarked them .
Just keep a record .
Python dictionary is in fact a hash table .
The dictnotes . txt in that directory gives some quite interesting discussion about how to implement hash efficiently .
hashlib library .
A bit hard to use and I can not get it running correctly .
Possibly I have not provided a proper second hash function for rehashing .
Added results for STL set ( based on red - black tree ) and John - Mark Gurney ’s B - tree implementation ( JG ’s btree ) .
Both libraries are considerably slower than hash tables .
Of course search trees provide more functionality than hash tables , and every nice thing comes with a price .
I have also tried Jason Evans ’s and Niels Provos ’ red - black tree implementations .
On integer keys , JE ’s takes 6.110 seconds on Mac - Intel using 18.884 MB memory and NP ’s taks 6.611 seconds using the same amount of memory .
This performance is close to that of STL set .
They appear to be slower mainly due to the additional malloc / free calls I have to made under their APIs .
Unlike hash table which have a variety of ways to implement it , red - black tree usually has one way ( well , can be more .
See also Jason ’s blog . ) .
And so I only show the performance of STL set as a representitive .
Replaced JG ’s B - tree with a modified version .
The new version is both faster and more light - weighted .
Coming to a neighborhood near you soon : American Ethnic Cleansing .
That 's right , in Los Angeles , California Latino gangs are roaming the streets and killing random black people .
These are not black gang members , but just average Americans going about their daily business .
From the guy waiting for a bus to the kid sitting on her bike .
Countless times we are told that illegal immigration will bring Latin American " family values " to the United States and that they mean no harm and will assimilate .
Over the past decade though there has been a long standing edict issued by the Mexican Mafia to " ethnically cleanse " the streets of all blacks living in what they consider " Latino neighborhoods " .
This is what we have to look forward to as the massive influx of illegal aliens settle across the United States and have kids .
The results have totally changed the LA racial makeup with more than 50 % of blacks that used to live in the area leaving for other areas outside of the gang territories .
The fact that this can be allowed to continue in this United States of America is simply insane .

... her 21 - year - old son Anthony was shot in the face with a . 25 - caliber semi-automatic while lying on a futon she had purchased for him from IKEA .
He died wearing a shirt that read , " Keep the Peace . "
Anthony Prudhomme was slain by members of the Avenues , a Latino street gang .
But he was not a rival gang member , or a police informant , or a drug dealer .
The Avenues did not target him for the content of his character , or even the contents of his apartment .
They targeted him for the color of his skin ... Anthony Prudhomme presented no threat to the Avenues .
Even so , he was murdered two months after he moved into Highland Park , a neighborhood in northeastern Los Angeles that is home to many gang members .
" He did n't have anything [ to steal ] , " his mother says .
" He had nothing when they broke in .
So to shoot him , I 'm sure it was a stripe .
They get stripes for killing black people . " ...
According to gang experts and law enforcement agents , a longstanding race war between the Mexican Mafia and the Black Guerilla family , a rival African - American prison gang , has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders , or shot callers , that they have issued a " green light " on all blacks .
A sort of gang - life fatwah , this amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia .
...
Random , racially motivated crimes have been committed across the 88 cities of Los Angeles County by the members of Latino gangs ...
But while the Latino gangs ' racial terror campaign is not new , gang experts and law enforcement authorities say the intensity and frequency of anti-black terrorism is now escalating , as the amount of turf in Los Angeles claimed by Latino gangs continues to increase rapidly .
...
The LAPD estimates there are now 22,000 Latino gang members in the city of Los Angeles alone .
That 's not only more than all the Crips and the Bloods ; it 's more than all black , Asian , and white gang members combined .
Almost all of those Latino gang members in L.A. -- let alone those in other California cities -- are loyal to the Mexican Mafia .
Most have been thoroughly indoctrinated with the Mexican Mafia 's violent racism during stints in prison , where most gangs are racially based .
Green lighted ethnic cleansing by a Mexican Jihad , just what this country needs .
There was a time when gangs would only attack other gangs , it seems those times are behind us and that California has done a piss poor job of assimilating the massive influx of Latinos into its community .

I was just wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction as far as getting more info on Target .
I 'm hazy on the specifics , but I heard Alex mention that the Target stores are part of a NSA behavioral psychology experiment .
This is no great shocker to me , having realized that there is clearly something up with them ( using the sun symbol , for instance , and probably referring to us as the " target " ... surprise , surprise ) .
Thanks in advance for any info / links .

Could n't find much via Google , except mention of the usage of the ancient sun symbol in Target , the " O " in HBO , and so on .
I do n't shop there myself , in any event , but I am curious about the goings - on " behind the scenes " .
Of course , Vegas is notorious for mind - twisting methods , true .

Retailer Target Branches Out Into Police Work
Minneapolis Forensics Lab , Donations Help Law Enforcement Agencies
By Sarah Bridges
Special to The Washington Post
Sunday , January 29 , 2006 ; A01
When arson investigators in Houston needed help restoring a damaged surveillance tape to identify suspects in a fatal fire , they turned first to local experts and then to NASA .
With no luck there , investigators appealed to the owner of one of the most advanced crime labs in the country : Target Corp .
Target experts fixed the tape and Houston authorities arrested their suspects , who were convicted .
It was all in a day 's work for Target in its large and growing role as a high - tech partner to law enforcement agencies .
In the past few years , the retailer has taken a lead role in teaching government agencies how to fight crime by applying state - of - the - art technology used in its 1,400 stores .
Target 's effort has touched local , state , federal and international agencies .
Besides running its forensics lab in Minneapolis , Target has helped coordinate national undercover investigations and worked with customs agencies on ways to make sure imported cargo is coming from reputable sources or has n't been tampered with .
It has contributed money for prosecutor positions to combat repeat criminals , provided local police with remote - controlled video surveillance systems , and linked police and business radio systems to beef up neighborhood foot patrols in parts of several major cities .
It has given management training to FBI and police leaders , and linked city , county and state databases to keep track of repeat offenders .
The efforts are part of a trend in corporate donations directed at solving societal problems .
" Target is pushing forward a different model of corporate giving , " said Douglas G. Pinkham , president of the nonpartisan Public Affairs Council .
Others are doing the same .
Exxon Mobil , for example , is building hospitals in the developing world .
Cargill Corp. is building schools in areas where potential employees lacked basic skills .
Target 's law enforcement efforts date back at least a decade but intensified after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The company has applied in - store practices , such as inventory - tracking technologies , to the business of identifying and locating criminals .
" In many ways , Target is actually a high - tech company masquerading as a retailer , " said Nathan K. Garvis , Target 's vice president of government affairs .
Some people note the possible ethical complexities inherent in Target 's tight government relationships .
" It is a tricky issue when firms get too close to government , " said Ernesto Dal Bó , assistant professor of business and public policy at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley .
Dal
Bó sees such alliances as fraught with potential conflicts , though he cautions against alarm .
" There is no reason we need to say that anything bad is happening , but we do need to watch , " he said .
It is typical for big companies , especially retailers , to coordinate with law enforcement in safeguarding their properties .
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. , for example , takes a " one store at a time " approach , in which bicycles and other gear are given to law enforcement agencies in need , spokeswoman Sharon Weber said .
" We are also very proud of our outreach program with police in some cities , " she said .
" We teach kids the true consequences of shoplifting . "
Target 's approach is more comprehensive .
Target has replaced the concept of " assets protection " in its stores with crime prevention in the community .
A program called " Target and Blue " defines its approach to philanthropy and partnership with law enforcement agencies .
Chief executive Robert J. Ulrich made cooperating with law enforcement a priority in the mid-1990s , when crime rates skyrocketed and his hometown of Minneapolis was nicknamed " Murderopolis . "
" The turning point occurred for me when I read about a repeat offender walking out of the courtroom because the judge did n't know he had a criminal record in a different part of the state , " Ulrich said in an interview .
" He raped a woman the next day . "
Ulrich slapped the table .
He said he wanted to know how the man got out of jail so fast .
Ulrich assigned Garvis to figure that out , and he began by interviewing police , judges and politicians to understand why one branch of law enforcement may not have access to another agency 's records .
He learned that city , county , state and federal criminal record systems had different ways of entering data and could n't routinely share information .
" It struck me that following repeat criminals was really an inventory - management problem , " Garvis said .
He turned to the partnerships Target had already developed with law enforcement -- Target 's assets protection group is headed by Brad Brekke , a former FBI agent , and is staffed by former police officers .
Working with local and state jurisdictions , Target donated what boiled down to tracking technology and database translation , as well as employees to work on the project .
" This kind of thing has been tried before , " said Richard W. Stanek , a former Minnesota public safety commissioner .
" The extra thing that Target brought was neutrality -- and mediation .
They physically brought the different arms of law enforcement together and helped get us talking . "
For several years , a database called CriMNet has been used in Minnesota in the prosecution of the felonies .
It is one of several alternatives under consideration for a national criminal database .
As the project gained footing , Target investigators began working with law enforcement agencies in sting operations and surveillance concerning crime in their stores .
Target began helping law enforcement on cases that had nothing to do with its business .
It was n't long before Target was analyzing criminal evidence for police , the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .
" One of the nation 's top forensics labs is located at Target 's headquarters building in downtown Minneapolis , " said FBI Special Agent Paul McCabe , who has worked with Target .
" They have abilities and technology that far surpasses many law enforcement agencies in the country . "
Target forensics investigators spend 45 percent of their time offering pro-bono assistance to law enforcement .
Target declined to say how many cases that involves per year .
Visiting the forensics lab entails a trip to Target 's corporate security department , past red-and - white bull 's - eyes and up the elevator to the second floor .
Through password - protected doors is a windowless room -- the desks packed with computers and flat - screen monitors , and a wall decorated with the badges from the law enforcement agencies that Target has helped .
Motion - detection sensors linked to silent alarms sweep the ceiling above the locked evidence room , and only four employees have access to the facility .
The lab 's first big outside criminal case was the Houston arson - homicide in 2004 .
Thomas D. Wood , a senior arson investigator for the Houston Fire Department , oversaw the case and was the first law enforcement official to use Target 's lab .
A woman and two children died in the fire .
A surveillance tape from a nearby convenience store showed what appeared to be two juvenile suspects buying gasoline hours before the fire , but the tape was damaged and Wood struggled to restore it .
He happened to go to lunch with a Target investigator , who mentioned the forensics lab .
Wood sent the tape the next day .
" Not only were the Target people able to clean the tape , they also made still shots from it that were used by the boys ' school principal to identify them , " Wood said .
Both suspects confessed and are now serving prison sentences .
As word spread about what Target 's lab had accomplished in the Texas arson case , the requests for help soon became overwhelming .
" We had cops in here every day -- chairs pulled up next to my computer , " said Target forensic investigator Craig Thrane .
" We finally had to make criteria for the cases we take .
The only ones we do now involve violent felonies . "
At a work station in the lab , Thrane popped a videotape into a machine with 60 tiny knobs , then tapped a series of commands into his computer .
" This is a video from a bank robbery that the FBI brought to me to try to figure out who the criminal is .
In this case , it is a gun woman -- very unusual . "
Thrane measured the robber 's height electronically and zoomed in on some of her features .
" Notice the space between the corner of her mouth and her lip -- there is something unusual about it -- I 'm guessing she is missing teeth , " he said , making several more measurements of unique characteristics that he sent to the FBI .
A week later , word arrived that agents nabbed a suspect -- a 40 - year - old woman who was a methamphetamine addict .
" They also told me she lost her teeth , " Thrane said .
Besides helping law enforcement solve crimes , Target has a prevention program called " Safe City . "
It began two years ago in a police precinct in Minneapolis and has spread to dozens of other cities including Washington , Boston , New York and Atlanta .
In the Washington area , Target is using Safe City at two stores in Prince George 's County -- at Forestville Mall and P.G. Plaza , with increased cooperation between its own security officials and law enforcement in patrolling areas around the buildings .
Modeled after a community surveillance program in England , Safe City uses video and computer equipment to help police patrol neighborhoods by remote control , coordinated with security workers at participating businesses .
Target also has been paying for a lawyer and a paralegal in the Minneapolis prosecutor 's office through its charitable foundation , with an emphasis on prosecuting repeat criminals .
" They do n't just give us money -- they demand accountability , " said Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar .
" There were huge strings attached when we received the funding for our new staff , and we were expected to routinely communicate how the money was used and what kind of results we 'd gained .
Here 's an example :
In the past , the DA 's office tracked input numbers [ how many criminals were charged ] , though once we were working with Target , we were required to track output numbers , or how many convictions we get in a year . "
Before Target 's involvement , the prosecutor won convictions for about three repeat criminals a year .
Since adding the new staff and changing how it operates , the prosecutor now has more than 90 such convictions in a year .
Target 's latest ventures include building a forensics lab for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension , including FBI and other agency officials in their corporate leadership programs and providing various agencies with " sting trailers , " trucks filled with electronics and other merchandise to lure criminals -- and containing wireless devices that send information to police .
The company also has run programs for the World Customs Organization to determine how to protect cargo through advanced technical systems and " smart boxes . "
Such close cooperation sometimes has Target employees working as de facto law enforcement officials .
Chris W. Nelson , director of assets protection for the retailer , recalled one case in which he worked with federal agents for two years to break up a crime ring .
He questioned informants , got to know some of the suspects and was there as a federal SWAT team surrounded one of the ringleaders on a speedboat on a lake in Minnesota .
The suspect " stopped short as he spotted me in the crowd and shouted , ' What the [ expletive ] is Target doing here ?!' " Nelson said .
" I still love that one . "

Target has replaced the concept of " assets protection " in its stores with crime prevention in the community .
A program called " Target and Blue " defines its approach to philanthropy and partnership with law enforcement agencies .
Chief executive Robert J. Ulrich made cooperating with law enforcement a priority in the mid-1990s , when crime rates skyrocketed and his hometown of Minneapolis was nicknamed " Murderopolis . "
" The turning point occurred for me when I read about a repeat offender walking out of the courtroom because the judge did n't know he had a criminal record in a different part of the state , " Ulrich said in an interview .
" He raped a woman the next day . "
Ulrich slapped the table .
He said he wanted to know how the man got out of jail so fast .
Ulrich assigned Garvis to figure that out , and he began by interviewing police , judges and politicians to understand why one branch of law enforcement may not have access to another agency 's records .
He learned that city , county , state and federal criminal record systems had different ways of entering data and could n't routinely share information .
"
It struck me that following repeat criminals was really an inventory - management problem , " Garvis said .
He turned to the partnerships Target had already developed with law enforcement -- Target 's assets protection group is headed by Brad Brekke , a former FBI agent , and is staffed by former police officers .
Working with local and state jurisdictions , Target donated what boiled down to tracking technology and database translation , as well as employees to work on the project .
" This kind of thing has been tried before , " said Richard W. Stanek , a former Minnesota public safety commissioner .
" The extra thing that Target brought was neutrality -- and mediation .
They physically brought the different arms of law enforcement together and helped get us talking . "
For several years , a database called CriMNet has been used in Minnesota in the prosecution of the felonies .
It is one of several alternatives under consideration for a national criminal database .
As the project gained footing , Target investigators began working with law enforcement agencies in sting operations and surveillance concerning crime in their stores .
Target began helping law enforcement on cases that had nothing to do with its business .
It was n't long before Target was analyzing criminal evidence for police , the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .
"
One of the nation 's top forensics labs is located at Target 's headquarters building in downtown Minneapolis , " said FBI Special Agent Paul McCabe , who has worked with Target .
" They have abilities and technology that far surpasses many law enforcement agencies in the country .
" Target forensics investigators spend 45 percent of their time offering pro-bono assistance to law enforcement .
Target declined to say how many cases that involves per year .
Visiting the forensics lab entails a trip to Target 's corporate security department , past red-and - white bull 's - eyes and up the elevator to the second floor .
Through password - protected doors is a windowless room -- the desks packed with computers and flat - screen monitors , and a wall decorated with the badges from the law enforcement agencies that Target has helped .
Motion - detection sensors linked to silent alarms sweep the ceiling above the locked evidence room , and only four employees have access to the facility .
The lab 's first big outside criminal case was the Houston arson - homicide in 2004 .
Thomas D. Wood , a senior arson investigator for the Houston Fire Department , oversaw the case and was the first law enforcement official to use Target 's lab .
A woman and two children died in the fire .
A surveillance tape from a nearby convenience store showed what appeared to be two juvenile suspects buying gasoline hours before the fire , but the tape was damaged and Wood struggled to restore it .
He happened to go to lunch with a Target investigator , who mentioned the forensics lab .
Wood sent the tape the next day .
" Not only were the Target people able to clean the tape , they also made still shots from it that were used by the boys ' school principal to identify them , " Wood said .
Both suspects confessed and are now serving prison sentences .
As word spread about what Target 's lab had accomplished in the Texas arson case , the requests for help soon became overwhelming .
" We had cops in here every day -- chairs pulled up next to my computer , " said Target forensic investigator Craig Thrane .
" We finally had to make criteria for the cases we take .
The only ones we do now involve violent felonies .
" At a work station in the lab , Thrane popped a videotape into a machine with 60 tiny knobs , then tapped a series of commands into his computer .
" This is a video from a bank robbery that the FBI brought to me to try to figure out who the criminal is .
In this case , it is a gun woman -- very unusual .
" Thrane measured the robber 's height electronically and zoomed in on some of her features .
" Notice the space between the corner of her mouth and her lip -- there is something unusual about it -- I 'm guessing she is missing teeth , " he said , making several more measurements of unique characteristics that he sent to the FBI .
A week later , word arrived that agents nabbed a suspect -- a 40 - year - old woman who was a methamphetamine addict .
" They also told me she lost her teeth , " Thrane said .
Besides helping law enforcement solve crimes , Target has a prevention program called " Safe City . "
It began two years ago in a police precinct in Minneapolis and has spread to dozens of other cities including Washington , Boston , New York and Atlanta .
In the Washington area , Target is using Safe City at two stores in Prince George 's County -- at Forestville Mall and P.G. Plaza , with increased cooperation between its own security officials and law enforcement in patrolling areas around the buildings .
Modeled after a community surveillance program in England , Safe City uses video and computer equipment to help police patrol neighborhoods by remote control , coordinated with security workers at participating businesses .
Target also has been paying for a lawyer and a paralegal in the Minneapolis prosecutor 's office through its charitable foundation , with an emphasis on prosecuting repeat criminals .
" They do n't just give us money -- they demand accountability , " said Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar .
" There were huge strings attached when we received the funding for our new staff , and we were expected to routinely communicate how the money was used and what kind of results we 'd gained .
Here 's an example :
In the past , the DA 's office tracked input numbers [ how many criminals were charged ] , though once we were working with Target , we were required to track output numbers , or how many convictions we get in a year .
" Before Target 's involvement , the prosecutor won convictions for about three repeat criminals a year .
Since adding the new staff and changing how it operates , the prosecutor now has more than 90 such convictions in a year .
Target 's latest ventures include building a forensics lab for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension , including FBI and other agency officials in their corporate leadership programs and providing various agencies with " sting trailers , " trucks filled with electronics and other merchandise to lure criminals -- and containing wireless devices that send information to police .
The company also has run programs for the World Customs Organization to determine how to protect cargo through advanced technical systems and " smart boxes .
" Such close cooperation sometimes has Target employees working as de facto law enforcement officials .
Chris W. Nelson , director of assets protection for the retailer , recalled one case in which he worked with federal agents for two years to break up a crime ring .
He questioned informants , got to know some of the suspects and was there as a federal SWAT team surrounded one of the ringleaders on a speedboat on a lake in Minnesota .
The suspect " stopped short as he spotted me in the crowd and shouted , ' What the [ expletive ] is Target doing here ?!' " Nelson said .
" I still love that one . "
