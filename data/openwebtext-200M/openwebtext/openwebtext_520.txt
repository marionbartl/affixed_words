Advice On Baby Furniture Sets September 13 , 2008
Posted by juditaylor in baby furniture sets Tags : baby furniture sets
As a mom of three i understand how much you love your babies and always want the best for them , crib , armoire , desk … everything .
But when you choosing baby furniture sets for your cutie , you will realize that it involves various factors and it ’s definitely not a “ just pick one ” choice .
Babies and toddlers spend a majority of their early years in their rooms ( and we do too ) .
It is important to plan carefully and make sure your baby furniture sets are safe enough to hold the prince and the princess , durable enough to fit your needs in the coming years , finely crafted and aesthetically pleasing with a great look and design .
As more and more parents are planning an enchanted environment for their babies to grow - up and play in , I would like to give a few advices on how to choose the right baby furniture sets to complement it .
Safety
Safety should be the major concern of all baby furniture sets as you do n’t want any potential hazard around your love .
Pay attention to these three things when you shopping
1. Rounded Corners and Edges
Kids are known to rough - handle beds , chairs , tables and everything they can reach .
When they put their hands on , you want all the edges and corners of the baby furniture sets are smooth and rounded .
Just make sure there is no incidental injures occurs during their way to learn by manipulating things around them .
2. Steadily Stand
Toddlers might still try to climb when they see a half - opened drawer of a armoire .
When they step on , the weight can pull those tall but thin furniture down and threaten your babies safety .
Pieces like bookcases , shelves , stacked boxes are potentially very dangerous to children .
Pick those short and fat ones whenever possible because they are less likely to tip over .
3. Healthy Material
Last but not least , there is an invisible hazard should n’t be ignored .
Some furnishing materials contain formaldehyde – a toxic chemical related to allergies , asthma , and cancer .
They will contaminate indoor air of your home 24 hours a day .
And babies in their early years are particularly likely to be harmed .
American Society for Testing and Material ( www.ASTM.org) has standards made especially for baby furniture sets .
Expandable
Keeping in mind that children are growing faster than you think and the fact you want baby furniture sets to be used for the first a couple of years ( if not a couple of months ) , it ’s a smart idea to considering choosing those expandable ones .
In my case , marely one year after the Molly ’s birth I found she was no longer going to fit into her crib .
So you may want to look at considerate designs that allow you to transform a tiny baby crib into a full - fledged bed .
So you do n’t need to update the “ hardware ” every year or two .
Toddlers feel more comfortable within environment they are familiar with , so a consistent expandable furniture set is good for them as well .
Design
One of the challenges when planning a baby room is that how to you get all the furniture piece beautifully matching each other and teaming with the rest of the your home decor .
Ideally the baby furniture sets provide both beauty and practicality at the same time .
I found the tips for having a harmony around your baby ’s world is to focus on the crib and the armoire .
Because they are the foundation of all the furniture set and they are setting the style of a dream nursery .
So get them fixed together first and later on you can always add the others easily .
Good designs will help to keep your taste consistent through the house and create a “ wonderland ” for your baby .

The disinfectant wipes used in hospitals are more likely to spread dangerous infections than to prevent them as currently used , a study conducted by researchers from Cardiff University and presented at the general meeting of the American Society of Microbiology in Boston has warned .
Researchers observed the cleaning procedures in the intensive care units of two Welsh hospitals .
They noted that staff tended to use disinfectant wipes on more than one surface , rather than using a clean wipe for each surface .
" There was a tendency for the staff in the intensive - care unit to ... move on to consecutive surfaces in close proximity to the initial surface , " said lead researcher Gareth Williams .
" So from a bed rail to a table , for instance .
... with the same wipe .
That set the alarm bells ringing .
" The researchers then tested how effective three different types of disinfectant wipes were at killing and removing methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) .
One type of wipe contained a detergent , another contained a disinfectant and the last contained a natural antimicrobial .
Rather than killing most of the bacteria on a surface , the wipes were more likely to scoop them up .
" We found that all three wipes suffered from the same problem " Williams said , " in that they transferred high numbers [ of bacteria ] and in fact in most cases uncountable numbers to consecutive surfaces .
... too many to count to the consecutive surfaces . " " These disinfectants do n't kill all the bugs .
That 's not how they work , " said Andrew Simor , head of microbiology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto .
" You 're physically removing a layer of the organisms .
But that does n't necessarily kill them .
And so it 's easy to pick them up and transfer them to another area . "
" We found that the most effective way to prevent the risk of MRSA spread in hospital wards is to ensure the wipe is used only once on one surface , " Williams said .

Why do people attack each other via blogs and online forums ?
Researchers now think they know
Again and again we hear the suggestion that if only people would use their " real " names when commenting on blogs and sites such as the Guardian 's , everything would be sweetness and light .
Would n't it ?
New research suggests not , says psychology lecturer Dr Ros Dyer , who researched computer mediated communication for her PhD at Staffordshire University .
In fact , contrary to expectations , her experiments demonstrated that students who were familiar with each other took more liberties on screen , not fewer .
" There was four times as much flaming when they knew each other than when they did n't , " Dyer says .
There was also - dating sites take note - more flirting when people used their own names .
At another college , Dyer set up a message board with the aim of creating an online version of student late - night coffee sessions putting the world to rights .
But it had to be taken down because the flaming - and bullying - became intolerable .
With names known , abuse flowed .
Another study into online behaviour found that certain types of individual are attracted to the net precisely because it allows them to behave in a way they are less likely to offline .
It is , therefore , somewhat self - selecting before you even hit a key : what you read may not reflect the writer 's real - life self .
One of the authors of this study , Dr Chris Fullwood , an internet psychology lecturer at the University of Wolverhampton , says : " Removing anonymity may have some small effect , but not a massive one .
This is because a number of factors contribute towards what psychologists call online disinhibition .
Removing one of them - the anonymity - and not removing any of the others means it will probably still occur as people remain invisible and so can disassociate their online from their offline persona . "
( See liebertonline.com for more . )
Professor John Suler of Rider University also explains the main causes of online flaming besides anonymity at enotalone.com .
Dr Daniel Goleman , the author of the bestseller Emotional Intelligence , thinks the problems are caused by a lack of emotional and social intelligence .
Last month , using the example of an email war between two engineers who knew each other , he wrote a paper about web rage and why it happens .
In essence , as most of us already know , it 's much easier to get mad with someone online .
He says : " Flaming is a symptom of a larger malady - an epidemic failure of social restraint .
The same syndrome seems at work in bloggers who take a perverse glee in attacks and threats ( such as those recently against blogger Kathy Sierra ) .
They see web rage as cool . " ( danielgoleman.info )
Fullwood adds : " Some people deliberately create a different persona online , even if they use their real name , because it 's like a big computer game to them . "
And so relieved of the norms that usually govern human interaction , if we feel like yelling abuse online , many of us will .
We can poke people all we like on Facebook but until someone invents a computer that really delivers a punch , there are no immediate consequences if you simply can't resist telling someone to make love elsewhere .

Tyler student , 17 , gets 8 years in prison for phone threat Student , 17 , gets 8 years in prison for phone threat
TYLER — A 17 - year - old who phoned his rival high school on a school bus and threatened to open fire on students has been sentenced to eight years in state prison .
An attorney for Terrance Taylor said Saturday he was surprised by the sentence and had recommended probation for his client , who was a junior at John Tyler High School in Tyler .
Taylor pleaded guilty Thursday to making a terroristic threat .
Don Davidson , the student 's attorney , said state District Judge Jack Skeen Jr. used the phrase " the times we live in " in handing down the sentence .
Police found no weapons belonging to Taylor after he made the call in January .
Davidson said another student initiated the call on the bus and that his client was " gullible " in taking part .
Angela Jenkins , a spokeswoman for the Tyler school district , said that while the sentence was " severe in this circumstance , " the school takes threats very seriously .
She said " we now live in a time where safety is of paramount concern . "
How to get started programming for the GAMEBOY !
Have you ever dreamed of becomming a game programmer ?
Today is your lucky day , becuase if you go through the following steps .
I bet your can be making gameboy games in less than an hour , and that is if your modem is slow .
By the time you finish reading this page you will have the basics that will enable you to build homebrewn games that will give give professional developers a run for their money .
( well maybe not professional developers , but its a start ! )
Note this tutorial is rather dated .
It covers the original gameboy , and not gameboy advance .
For information about gameboy advance programming click here .
Step I : Emulation Get into Emulation , it Rulez !
You will definetly need to have a nice emulator for development .
Even if you are lucky enough to have a copier and flash cartrige you will NOT want to transfer everytime you do a build .
So find a good emulator .
The two emulators I use are GB98 , and NoCash .
To find out the lasted in emulation news visit Zophar .
Step II : Be a Nerd , Be a Programmer Learn C!
You need to be able to program to write Gameboy software , if you need help visit CProgramming .com ( which has lots of tutorials )
If you are ambitious enough there are several excellent assemblers out there , but the Z80 opcodes are quite a bit different than the good old x86 .
Step III : Downloading / Installing / Setting Up the Compiler Get the GBDK ( GameBoy Development Kit ) by Pascal Felber .
The download site is located at SourceForge .
Net , you will need to go to this page http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1249 and then scroll down to the Windows binaries .
The file name of the write one is gbdk -2.95-3-win32.zip
It is around 950k .
It lets you build roms from C code .
To install the GBDK you will need to unzip it so that the GBDK directory is right off the root ( e.g. C : \GBDK )
This is the most important step , without the compiler you can't MAKE GAMES !
Now you are probably wondering about the power of this compiler .
So let 's make a sample game , change your directory to C: \GBDK\EXAMPLES \GB\DSCAN .
Now you will need to edit the MAKE .
BAT in this directory , load it up and any editor ( notepad ) or dos edit , and add " ..\ " to the front of the two lines .
It should look like this ..\..\..\ bin\lcc - Wa-l - c -o dscan.o dscan.c ..\..\..\ bin\lcc - Wl - m - Wl - yp0x143=0x80 - o dscan.gb dscan.o
After you are done editing , run MAKE .
When your done their should be a file dscan.gb .
Load this into your emulator and watch the magic .
You can really develop cool stuff with this compiler , eh ?
If you want to see more examples , look in the C: \GBDK \EXAMPLES \GB .
After seeing the power of the GBDK , you should add the following line to the end of your autoexec. bat to compile your programs .
Type it in right NOW !
path % path % ;C: \GBDK\BIN
Step IV : Your first ROM , Wahoo !
Write and compile the following program .
Place it in a directory and give it the name NEW.C #include < gb/gb.h > # include < stdio.h > void main ( ) { printf ( " Welcome to GAMEBOY
Programming " ) ; printf ( "
Press Start " ) ; waitpad( J_START ) ; // other keys are J_A , J_UP , J_SELECT , etc. printf ( "
Is n't it easy ! " ) ; } Compile it ( make a ROM ) by typing the following at the command line lcc -o new.gb new. c
( You need to have added C : \GBDK \BIN to your path )
After that load up new.gb with an emulator and watch the magic .
You just made your first Gameboy ROM !
Step V : Developing the Skill Write some cool programs !
Spend all your time writing games instead of playing them .
For more tutorials on basic gameboy programming visit Gameboy Dev'rs .
It is a great resource .
Step VI : Enter the GRAPHiCS Get the Gameboy Tile Designer , and Map Builder .
They will build the graphics and sprites you will use in your game .
For help using these look through the GBDK samples .
There is a lot of sample code out there .
Step VII : Keeping
Up with the Scene Now that your an accomplished gameboy programmer , it might be a good idea to keep up with the scene .
Here are some of the most noteworthy sites out there .

The records will be updated until children turn 18 then kept in an archive for six years before being destroyed , meaning they can be accessed until a young person reaches 24 .
Those who have learning difficulties or who are in care will remain on the live system until they turn 25 , so their archived records will be available into their 30s .
The fuel of the future could be hydrogen — if it can be made cheaply enough .
Currently , electrolyzers ( machines that split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen ) need a catalyst , namely platinum , to run ; ditto fuel cells to recombine that hydrogen with oxygen , which produces electricity .
The problem is that the precious metal costs about $ 1,700 to $ 2,000 per ounce , which means that hydrogen would be an uneconomical fuel source unless a less costly catalyst can be found .
But researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) and Monash University in Australia report in Science today that they may have a cost - effective solution .
Chemist Daniel Nocera , head of the M.I.T.'s Solar Revolution Project , focused on one side of the equation : splitting water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen molecules .
This can be done well , but it remains difficult to actually separate the molecules .
But Nocera and postdoctoral fellow Matthew Kanan discovered it could be accomplished by simply adding the metals cobalt and phosphate to water and running a current through it .
In contrast to platinum , cobalt and phosphate cost roughly $ 2.25 an ounce and $.05 an ounce , respectively .
" We [ have ] figured out a way just using a glass of water at room temperature , under atmospheric pressure , " Nocera says .
" This thing [ a thin film of cobalt and phosphate on an electrode ] just churns away making [ oxygen ] from water . "
Inspiration for the new catalyst came from nature ; Nocera studied the chain of processes that take place during photosynthesis , such as how plants use the energy from sunlight to rearrange water 's chemical bonds .
In a future hydrogen economy , he imagines , a house would function much like a leaf does , using the sun to power household electricity and to break down water into fuel — a sort of artificial photosynthesis .
According to John Turner , a research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo. , who was not involved in the research , the discovery could reduce the need for platinum in a conventional electrolyzer .
He believes it could also play a role in a future large - scale hydrogen generator , which would collect the energy from sunlight in huge fields and then run that electric current through water to produce vast amounts of hydrogen to meet , for example , the demand from a future fleet of hydrogen - powered vehicles .
" That 's what his advance is pointing towards , " he says , " finding an alternative catalyst that will allow us to do oxygen evolution ( breaking the bonds of water or H2O and forming oxygen ) in concert with hydrogen " on a grand scale .
But that still leaves plenty of platinum in the other side of the equation : the fuel cells that combine hydrogen and oxygen back into water to harvest electricity .
Chemist Bjorn Winther - Jensen of Monash University in Australia and his colleagues addressed that problem by developing new electrodes for fuel cells made from a special conducting polymer , that costs around $ 57 per counce .
During experiments , the polymer proved just as effective as platinum at harvesting electricity — and the work could prove immediately relevant in mini fuel cells , such as the kind that are being designed for computers .
In order for this to work on the grand scale of a fuel cell stack for a hydrogen vehicle or power plant " we need to develop a more three - dimensional structure to get thicker electrodes and a higher current per square centimeter , " says Winther - Jensen .
Regardless , by reducing or eliminating platinum , the two studies help pave the way for a future hydrogen economy .

AP does n’t bother to tell you that Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) is n’t just a SuperDelegate and a Clinton supporter , he ’s also the brother of top Clinton adviser and spokesperson Ann Lewis .
Frank represents a state that voted for Hillary .
This is a very interesting , and noticeable development .
It means that even SuperDelegates who are on Hillary ’s side want this to be over in the next month or so .
And they do n’t care if that means Hillary loses .
They just want it over .
Now , Barney Frank is a curmudgeon , but he ’s a curmudgeon who often voices what others fear to say .
To quote Dr. House , this is interesting .
From TPM Reader CC …
Considering as how the proposed Wall Street bailout will be one of the most intensely lobbied efforts in American history , will there be anyone left to manage John McCain ’s campaign ?
TPM Reader JS makes another …
You would never know it from watching the news , but one of the candidates in this race happens to have been previously implicated in a national scandal involving pressuring regulators to back off of a bank making risky moves with its assets , leading to disaster for investors and an expensive government bailout .
Is there a good reason why no one is mentioning John McCain ’s Keating Five membership in any of these arguments over who is on the side of regulating risky private banking practices ?
I know that McCain sort of asked for our forgiveness or something at some point during his “ maverick period ” around 2000 - 2003 , but since he wants to engage in a debate about who is on the side of government regulation of risky banking practices , I think maybe we ’re allowed to call him out on this issue .
Does anyone believe that if Barack Obama were one of the Keating Five that the Republicans would for some reason hold back from mentioning that fact ?

One day in August 2006 , Nicole Macy met with a San Francisco building official to talk about the damage that a small fire had caused to the South of Market apartment building she and her husband owned .
She also mentioned she wanted to get rid of a stubborn tenant .
Which one of the now - exposed ceiling beams in the fire - damaged unit , Macy asked , would need to be cut to make the building so dangerous that the city would red-tag it as uninhabitable ?
" That would be illegal , " Inspector David Herring replied , according to a court filing reviewed by The Chronicle .
Herring would never tell someone how to make a building unsafe , he later recounted to authorities .
Macy was not too pleased at the inspector 's response , he said .
San Francisco prosecutors now say that Macy and her husband , Kip Macy , did have the beams cut supporting the floor of that pesky renter , who had managed to fight off eviction .
It was just one salvo in a war of terror that prosecutors say the Palo Alto couple waged against their renters at 744-746 Clementina St. that also included cutting holes in the floor , falsely reporting the troublesome tenant to police as a squatter , and concocting e-mails in his name to an attorney for the landlords , threatening to dismember her children .
Last week , the Macys ' alleged tactics landed them in criminal court .
Kip Macy , a 33 - year - old software developer who has developed anti-hacking programs , and Nicole Macy , 32 , a real estate agent whose office is in the Sunset District , were both charged with multiple felony counts of burglary , theft , conspiracy and stalking .
They declined to be interviewed for this story .
A knock at the door
Scott Morrow 's nightmare , as recounted in a 61 - page affidavit that prosecutors filed in support of the charges against the Macys , began not long after the couple showed up in June 2005 at the apartment where he had lived for six years .
They introduced themselves as having just bought the six - unit building with a plan to live downstairs .
The Macys were cordial , even when they soon moved to evict Morrow and the tenants of four other units under the Ellis Act , a state law that lets landlords remove tenants to let family members move in .
Most of the tenants would have to leave within 60 days , but because he was disabled - suffering chronic , debilitating migraine headaches - Morrow got a one - year reprieve .
In July 2005 , the same month the Macys moved in and started eviction efforts , Nicole Macy called Morrow .
She asked him if he hated her because of the plan to kick him out , he later told prosecutors .
They chatted , and she seemed amiable enough , he said .
Not long after that , however , somebody stomped loudly on the floor of the apartment above Morrow , the one the Macys were using as an office .
His electric power was cut in the middle of the afternoon .
It lasted just five minutes , so Morrow did n't think much of it .
Building trouble
That November , however , things deteriorated rapidly .
Morrow complained to the city about noise and dust from crews working on the vacant apartment below , prompting inspectors to issue a citation against the Macys for having work done without permits .
Kip Macy got so mad , Morrow told prosecutors , that he jumped up and down in the upstairs unit with sufficient force that Morrow 's ceiling paint started to crack .
Nicole Macy shouted his name from the backyard and tossed pebbles against his window .
Loud music blared for six hours .
At 5 a.m. the next day , Morrow said , the music and stomping started again .
An hour later , Kip Macy knocked at Morrow 's door and asked , " How 's it going , Scott ? "
Later that morning , Morrow found the new work permit stuffed through his door .
Written on it was , " Scott get lost !
Get a job ! " according to investigators .
Over the next few months , Morrow 's water was shut off repeatedly without notice .
One time , it happened while Morrow was in the shower .
In December , the Macys moved out , but they made it clear to Morrow they were still thinking about him .
Investigators say that a few days after his shower water was cut off , in January 2006 , he got a note from Nicole Macy asking how he was doing .
" If you come out , " she wrote , " I have cinabons from IKEA .
Nicole . "
Electronic warfare
In March 2006 , Morrow was notified that the Macys wanted to sell .
The building did go on the market as a tenancy - in - common , with Nicole Macy as the agent .
Then the case took a menacing turn .
Kip Macy , prosecutors believe , turned his software engineering skills against Morrow .
Someone started generating e-mail , using accounts under Morrow 's name , to attorneys in his eviction case .
Morrow later told prosecutors he did n't even have an e-mail address .
The first e-mails went to Morrow 's own lawyers in July 2006 , the same month that marked the end of the year 's reprieve .
There was going to be a fight about the eviction in court .
One e-mail purportedly from Morrow told the lawyer that he had been a " disaster and a f- up . "
The next day , the same lawyer got another message : " You are no longer my counsel .
Get lost .
Scott . "
When a court ruled in Morrow 's favor in the eviction case , a lawyer at the firm representing the Macys got an e-mail purportedly from the tenant that read , " One day you are going to come home to the Victorian house ... and find ( your three children ) missing .
Then each day a package will arrive with a piece of them .
You are f- with the wrong person . "
J. Scott Weaver , Morrow 's current lawyer , said the messages prompted the lawyer to obtain a restraining order .
When Morrow found out , the attorney said , " he was horrified .
Absolutely horrified . "
A rocky relationship
On Aug. 21 , 2006 , Nicole Macy appeared in the backyard at Clementina Street and shouted up to Morrow , " I want you out of my building ! " he told prosecutors .
She was spotted by a friend of Morrow's who photographed her carrying a rock , and Morrow heard a large crashing sound in the back of his unit .
A few minutes later , the power went off .
Later that day , Nicole Macy called police and reported that a homeless person was living in the building and had threatened her , police dispatch records show .
An officer soon showed up .
When Morrow opened his door , the officer rushed in with gun drawn and ordered Morrow and a friend to the floor .
Morrow convinced the officer he was a tenant , and Macy conceded that she knew him , Morrow told investigators .
But Macy also told the officer about a small fire that had damaged the unit below Morrow 's a few days before .
Morrow told prosecutors that after a night celebrating his victory in staving off eviction , he had come home and found the unit below his on fire .
The fire was quickly put out .
The officer told Morrow that the building was n't safe and that he would have to leave .
" Watch your backs , " the officer told Morrow and his friend .
A strange conversation
Nicole Macy proceeded to call a city inspector to the building and ask him to rule that Morrow 's unit was not habitable because of the fire .
The inspector concluded the structure was unsafe and issued a violation notice .
Not satisfied with that , Nicole Macy showed up at the Department of Building Inspection , asking building Inspector Herring to have the Clementina Street structure condemned so she could get rid of Morrow .
Herring replied that another inspector had already checked the structure and would have red - tagged the building if needed .
Besides , he said , he understood the fire to be minor and that none of the ceiling joists had been damaged .
" Nicole Macy replied by asking what beams she would need to cut to make the apartment building structurally unsafe so the inspector would red tag ( it ) , " according to the prosecution 's affidavit .
Rebuffed , prosecutors say , the Macys went ahead with their plan .
First they told Morrow the building had been condemned .
Then in September , he started to hear rumbling noises from below .
One Saturday , he discovered a 1 - by - 2 - foot hole had been cut in his living room floor .
Soon the Macys were at his door .
When Morrow protested , Kip Macy replied , " I 'm afraid you did n't inherit the building , " the affidavit said .
The contractor the Macys had hired , Ricardo Cartagena , later told prosecutors that Kip Macy had asked him to cut out walls in the first - floor unit .
Cartagena protested that it could cause the upper unit to collapse .
" Would n't it be a shame if it collapsed , " Kip Macy replied , Cartagena said .
Crews did cut wedges into the floor beams , prosecutors said , which Morrow discovered when he looked through the hole in his floor .
When he called building officials , Nicole Macy told inspectors that it was all because of a misunderstanding with the Spanish - speaking crew she had hired , the prosecution affidavit said .
Then she pressed for building officials to condemn the structure , but inspectors decided instead to declare just Morrow 's living room uninhabitable .
City crews shored it up at a cost of $ 8,000 .
The Macys have yet to pay the bill .
As the Macys ' apparent financial problems mushroomed and the plan to sell the building for tenancies - in - common was put on hold , Nicole Macy sent Herring an e-mail in last April that prosecutors believe better describes herself .
She accused him of an " unhealthy obsession " with the building and its owner .
The building was nicely maintained but was the target of endless code violations , she complained .
The whole thing was an effort to " assert control over a young female owner , " she said .
" Your obsessive , compulsive , bizarre , and downright vindictive behavior is a source of utmost and ongoing distress . "
Next banned game " could be BioShock 2 " Consultant Scheurer adds that over turning a BBFC ban could put independent developers out of business

Vincent Scheurer has issued a warning over the possible future of a BBFC rated games industry , at the Develop conference in Brighton .
Scheurer , founder of the business consultancy Sarassin , said that the costs RockStar incurred in overturning the BBFC 's ban on Manhunt 2 would have put an independent developer out of business , and further warned that due to the vague reasons given for the ban any game could be next .
" The costs of the Manhunt 2 ban to RockStar were massive - an independent developer would be out of business , " he explained .
" It makes the business of making games that much harder . "
During his talk , he explained the stated reasons behind the Manhunt 2 ban , including the level of realism , the lack of a puzzle element and the lack of humour .
" Call of Duty and BioShock could be banned under that criteria …
The next game to be banned could be BioShock 2 , and then where would we be ? " he said .
He went on to criticise the games media , publishers and developers for failing to defend the medium properly , specifically signalling out ELSPA for its support of the Manhunt 2 ban .
" While we fail to fight back we will continue to be blamed for all of societies ills …
In my view Tiga was the only association to step up …
Tiga realised , where the other 's did n't , that this was about more than Manhunt 2 , " he added .
Nullriver 's short - lived iPhone application NetShare , which turns your iPhone into a wireless modem for your laptop , might not be returning to the App Store after all .
Earlier in the week , Nullriver received a response from Apple saying the removal of
NetShare was a mistake that required " technical review . "
It turns out that was a blanket term , because in a phone interview today Nullriver's
CEO Adam Dann said Apple was reviewing user contracts with providers , including AT&T .
Though Apple is continuing to make Nullriver sit and wait , we 've already received confirmation from AT&T spokesperson Brad Mays that tethering with iPhone is not allowed .
He cited a clause in AT&T's Terms and
Conditions :
" Furthermore , plans ( unless specifically designated for tethering usage )
cannot be used for any applications that tether the device ( through use of , including without limitation , connection kits , other phone / PDA - to computer accessories , Bluetooth ® or any other wireless technology ) to
Personal Computers ( including without limitation , laptops ) , or other equipment for any purpose . "
Nullriver is one of a few other iPhone apps recently removed from the App Store .
Around the same time , BoxOffice inexplicably disappeared from App Store , leaving its developer confused .
Later in the week , Apple removed a $ 1,000 iPhone application called I Am Rich .
Apple 's demonstrated fickle nature has led Nullriver 's CEO to question the iPhone App Store 's approval process .
" From what I can tell their approval process is not very strict at all , " Dann said .
" It 's more technical than content related is what it seems like to us .
I think they run it , start it up and if it does n't crash they approve it .
They brainlessly click through , and if there 's problems they remove it is what it seems like . "
Dann added that his experience with Apple has tempered his views of the company .
" They 're shooting themselves in the foot these days ; they 're probably just understaffed , " Dann said .
" We 'll see how it goes .
Hopefully they do n't get too much of the bad press and it does n't ruin the iPhone , because I want to develop for it . "
Apple did not return phone calls before press time .
Hip - hop / Punk / Emo band Gym Class Heroes released a song titled Taxi Driver in 2005 on their Paper cut Chronicles album , I listened to it the other day and was thinking , " Wow , there are a ton of band references in that song . "
So I brought up the wonderful Wikipedia and discovered there is a list of 25 bands and a record label that are referenced in the song .
Always the jokester , I decided to get copies of the bands in question 's albums and pasted them on top of themselves to give the lyrics a little ransom note feel to it .
Here , ladies and gentlemen is the finished copy , let me know what you think .

Join us !
We need every citizen , and every citizen group in favor of transparent government to email us , and join 112 coalitions determined to implement sweeping Whistleblower protection .
Last month the trans - ideological Make It Safe Coalition ( MISC ) of 112 citizen organizations stood in solidarity with whistleblowers , the public 's eyes and ears .
MISC urged Congress to complete an eight year effort to revive the discredited Whistleblower Protection Act. ( WPA ) .
In 1978 , 1989 , and 1994 Congress unanimously passed this foundation good government law .
The dittos are because in practice the law has n't been worth the paper it 's written on .
For example , whistleblowers ' only “ day in court ” to enforce rights is a minor league administrative hearing at the Merit Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) , which only has found illegal retaliation twice during the Bush administration .
Voter 's agree : whistleblowers are essential to the public interest , good government , and the fight to end corruption .
Voters expect more .
In a post 2006 election survey of likely voters , strengthening whistleblower rights was the second highest priority , picked by 79 % , second only to 81 % for ending illegal government spending .
At first Congress seemed to listen .
In March 2007 the House promptly passed a “ best practices ” law .
In December the Senate followed suit .
But the end game has stalled .
Time is running out , particularly to overturn a promised veto .
Reportedly the gridlock is because Senate leaders fear key , tougher House provisions could spark holds or filibusters there is no time to defeat .
But six months of delays are making that a self - fulfilling excuse .
MISC told Senate leaders that after thirty years of “ safe ” bills with strong rights but weak enforcement teeth , it is time to fight whatever battles are necessary for three House provisions :
* Normal court access .
The hopelessly surreal MSPB record makes the facts of life unavoidable : whistleblower paper rights are a mirage without jury trials for a genuine day in court .
It would be bad public policy to take the broken record approach -- a fourth generation WPA without normal court access .
Workers at publicly - traded corporation have had the right to a jury trial since passage of the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley law , and three times since 2006 the Senate has provided jury trials -- for all ground transportation , defense contractor , and retail products employees .
There is no excuse to give government workers second class rights to defend themselves when they defend the public .
* FBI and Intelligence Agencies .
The FBI 's track record of one whistleblower victory in 30 years makes it clear that a 1978 “ separate but equal ” system of in - house review will not work either .
There are no victories since 1998 for analogous intelligence agency “ protections . ”
Especially since 9/11 , these whistleblowers are freedom 's first line of defense both against outside threats like terrorists ; and internal threats like illegal government domestic surveillance .
But they are still in the cold , without independently - enforced rights when challenging bureaucratic abuses sustained by secrecy .
The House bill does not protect public disclosures , rather creating safe channels to solve the 9/11 Commission 's primary explanation for the tragedy : communications bottlenecks blocking the flow of vital information within agencies and to Congress .
* Scientific freedom .
These whistleblowers have more impact on public safety than any other government function .
Far more Americans have perished from drugs officially labeled safe by our government , than from enemy fire in the Vietnam and Iraq wars combined .
The greatest threat facing the planet is global warming , but for six years top climate change scientists were gagged and censored while works published under their names were rewritten by energy industry lobbyists .
For matters beyond principle , there simply is no whistleblower topic with higher stakes .
The public can and will make the difference .
If politicians think voters no longer care , they will avoid risks and run out the clock or pass another bill with second class enforcement .
But if voters reaffirm their post -2006 election priority , it could go to the President by the end of the month .
No prior government or corporate whistleblower law needed more than a month to reconcile House - Senate differences for consensus rights .
Readers should Google their Senators ' emails , and write insisting that each personally urge Majority Leader Harry Reid , and Senators Lieberman and Collins on the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee to finish work on this reform .
And to reserve floor time against filibusters and vetoes risked by finally doing it right .
That means giving all taxpayer - financed workers access to jury trials to fight retaliation - just as it has done three times this Congress for corporate workers .
Tell them you wo n't accept any less .
Government workers defending America 's families need first class rights at much as corporate workers defending America 's investments .

Turns out the that Israelis have been supplying the US trained Georgian army with weapons .
It was reported that they stopped such sales a few days ago :
Israel has decided to halt all sales of military equipment to Georgia because of objections from Russia , which is locked in a feud with its tiny Caucasus neighbor , defense officials said Tuesday .
The officials said the freeze was partially intended to give Israel leverage with Moscow in its attempts to persuade Russia not to ship arms and equipment to Iran .
They spoke on condition of anonymity as Israel does not officially publish details of its arms sales .
Russia has repeatedly refused to comment on reports its is selling S - 300 air defense missiles to Iran .
Among items Israel has been selling to Tbilisi are pilotless drone aircraft .
Russian fighters shot one down in May , according to UN observers .
Other types of weaponry include the following :
… Israel has also been supplying Georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems , and has helped upgrade Soviet - designed Su- 25 ground attack jets assembled in Georgia , according to Koba Liklikadze , an independent military expert based in Tbilisi .
Former Israeli generals also serve as advisers to the Georgian military .
Interesting .
Israeli arms sales to Georgia are purportedly halted , and the Georgians invade South Ossetia in less than a week .
There are also reports today that the Georgians have shot down Russian aircraft , which brings this story from April to the top of the queue :
Russia asked Israel last week whether it had supplied Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) to Georgia , for it to use in military operations against secessionists from Abkhazia .
An Israeli security source confirmed that the UAVs being used by Georgia are manufactured by Israeli firm Elbit .
A diplomatic source in Jerusalem said that the Russians did not have proof of this , however , and that the request for clarifications was based on suspicions .
He added that Israel does not sell any attack weapons to countries that border with Russia and only sells them defensive equipment .
Georgia accused Russia of using a MiG - 29 to shoot down one of its UAVs over Abkhazia and produced a video to back up its claim .
The video was shot by the UAV seconds before it was shot down , and it shows a MiG - 29 .
Georgia ’s president said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and demanded an end to the “ unjustified aggression against Georgia ’s sovereign territory . ”
Of course , the subject that keeps intruding into this saga is Iran .
Is the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia meant to pressure the Russians into severing economic and military ties with the Iranians ?
The Israelis supposedly halted arms sales to Georgia in an effort to persuade the Russians to refuse to supply Iran with a new air defense system .
Did that effort fail , or was it merely a pretense before the launching of the Georgian invasion ?
Perhaps , the invasion has also been prompted by competition between the US , Russia and Europe over access to natural reserves in the Caucasus .
Along these lines , consider this July 30th article by former Indian diplomat M K Bhadrakumar :
From the details coming out of Ashgabat in Turkmenistan and Moscow over the weekend , it is apparent that the great game over Caspian energy has taken a dramatic turn .
In the geopolitics of energy security , nothing like this has happened before .
The United States has suffered a huge defeat in the race for Caspian gas .
The question now is how much longer Washington could afford to keep Iran out of the energy market .
Gazprom , Russia ’s energy leviathan , signed two major agreements in Ashgabat on Friday outlining a new scheme for purchase of Turkmen gas .
The first one elaborates the price formation principles that will be guiding the Russian gas purchase from Turkmenistan during the next 20 - year period .
The second agreement is a unique one , making Gazprom the donor for local Turkmen energy projects .
In essence , the two agreements ensure that Russia will keep control over Turkmen gas exports .
The consequences for the US are reportedly significant :
Until fairly recently Moscow was sensitive about the European Union ’s opposition to the idea of a gas cartel .
( Washington has openly warned that it would legislate against countries that lined up behind a gas cartel ) .
But high gas prices have weakened the European Union ’s negotiating position .
The agreements with Turkmenistan further consolidate Russia ’s control of Central Asia ’s gas exports .
Gazprom recently offered to buy all of Azerbaijan ’s gas at European prices .
( Medvedev visited Baku on July 3 - 4. )
Baku will study with keen interest the agreements signed in Ashgabat on Friday .
The overall implications of these Russian moves are very serious for the US and EU campaign to get the Nabucco gas pipeline project going .
Nabucco , which would run from Turkey to Austria via Bulgaria , Rumania and Hungary , was hoping to tap Turkmen gas by linking Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan via a pipeline across the Caspian Sea that would be connected to the pipeline networks through the Caucasus to Turkey already existing , such as the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline .
But with access denied to Turkmen gas , Nabucco ’s viability becomes doubtful .
And , without Nabucco , the entire US strategy of reducing Europe ’s dependence on Russian energy supplies makes no sense .
Therefore , Washington is faced with Hobson ’s choice .
Friday ’s agreements in Ashgabat mean that Nabucco ’s realization will now critically depend on gas supplies from the Middle East – Iran , in particular .
Turkey is pursuing the idea of Iran supplying gas to Europe and has offered to mediate in the US - Iran standoff .
The geopolitics of energy makes strange bedfellows .
Russia will be watching with anxiety the Turkish - Iranian - US tango .
An understanding with Iran on gas pricing , production and market - sharing is vital for the success of Russia ’s overall gas export strategy .
But Tehran visualizes the Nabucco as its passport for integration with Europe .
Again , Russia ’s control of Turkmen gas cannot be to Tehran ’s liking .
Tehran had keenly pursed with Ashgabat the idea of evacuation of Turkmen gas to the world market via Iranian territory .
Curiouser and curiouser .
The thread that emerges from Bhadrakumar ’s analysis , however , is the urgency for the US ( and the Israelis ) to act quickly to disrupt Russia ’s ability to bring natural gas from Turkmenistan to the European market .
Otherwise , the US will be forced , to the great dismay of Israel , to broker a deal with Iran so as obtain access to Iranian natural gas to break the Russian monopoly .
Hence , we now see a Georgian invasion of South Ossetia about a week after the Russian announcement of its natural gas agreements with Turkmenistan .
The invasion of South Ossetia may well be a strong signal that the US prefers confrontation with the Russians over negotiating a new commercial relationship with the Iranians .
In other words , it suggests that the US still sees war as the ultimate solution of its disagreements with them .
The invasion also suggests that the US is incapable of choosing an ally in the region , and persists in the hope that it can economically and militarily dominate both the Russians and the Iranians , and through them , just about every country in Central Asia .
Such arrogance is likely to be ruinous for all involved .
A dirty adventure , indeed .

Pluto 's years - long identity crisis just got more complex today .
The International Astronomical Union has decided on the term " plutoid " as a name for Pluto and other objects that just two years ago were redefined as " dwarf planets . "
The surprise decision is unlikely to stem ongoing controversy and confusion , astronomers say .
Sidestepping concerns of many astronomers worldwide , the IAU 's decision , at a meeting of its Executive Committee in Oslo , comes almost two years after it stripped Pluto of its planethood and introduced the term " dwarf planets " for Pluto and other small round objects that often travel highly elliptical paths around the sun in the far reaches of the solar system .
" Most of the people in astronomy and planetary science community had no idea this was going to come out , " said Hal Weaver of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory .
Weaver called the process that produced the new definition " sort of outdated , outmoded , archaic . "
" In this day and age of transparency and mass communication , it seems a bit strange that such an important pronouncement would come out with so few people knowing about it , and , apparently , with no serious attempt to vet this with more people in the community , " Weaver said .
A meeting in August at the Applied Physics Laboratory is slated to debate the entire topic of defining planets .
Meanwhile , other astronomers said the new definition needed more definition or that it might simply not be used .
" This seems like an unattractive term and an unnecessary one to me , " said David Morrison , an astronomer at NASA 's Ames Research Center who , in 2006 , said the IAU 's actions on Pluto have created major rifts among astronomers .
The new definition
The name plutoid was proposed by the members of the IAU Committee on Small Body Nomenclature ( CSBN ) , accepted by the Board of Division III and by the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature ( WGPSN ) , and approved by the IAU Executive Committee at its recent meeting in Oslo , according to a statement released today .
Here 's the official new definition :
" Plutoids are celestial bodies in orbit around the sun at a distance greater than that of Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self - gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium ( near - spherical ) shape , and that have not cleared the neighborhood around their orbit . "
In short : small round things beyond Neptune that orbit the sun and have lots of rocky neighbors .
The two known and named plutoids are Pluto and Eris , the IAU stated .
The organization expects more plutoids will be found .
" Rather than resistance to ' plutoid , ' I think we 'll just be hearing groans , " said Stephen J. Kortenkamp , senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson .
Controversy continues
One IAU leader recognizes it is adding to an ongoing controversy .
The IAU has been responsible for naming planetary bodies and their satellites since the early 1900s .
Its decision in 2006 to demote Pluto was highly controversial , with some astronomers saying simply that they would not heed it and questioning the IAU 's validity as a governing body .
" The IAU is a democratic organization , thus open to comments and criticism of any kind , " IAU General Secretary Karel A. van der Hucht told SPACE.com by email today .
" Given the history of the issue , we will probably never reach a complete consensus . "
Van der Hucht said the new designation is not a further demotion for the once - favorite planet of grade - school children : " Pluto is now the prototype of a very interesting category of outer solar system bodies . "
IAU Division III President Edward L.G. Bowell of the Lowell Observatory said the ruling stems from unfinished business from the forging of a planet definition in 2006 .
Bowell said there is no agreed - upon way to define " dwarf planet " yet , so " officers of the IAU thought it would be a good idea to adopt alternative criteria that would at least allow those large bodies to be named as though they were dwarf planets . "
It remains to be seen whether astronomers will use the new term .
" My guess is that no one is going to much use this term , though perhaps I 'm wrong , " said Caltech astronomer Mike Brown , who has led the discovery of several objects in the outer solar system , including Eris .
" But I do n't think that this will be because it is controversial , just not particularly necessary . "
Brown was unaware of the new definition until the IAU announced it today .
" Back when the term ' pluton ' was nixed they said they would come up with another one , " Brown said .
" So I guess they finally did . "
Reactions were not all negative , however .
" It seems like a reasonable decision to me , and given the excitement generated by New Horizons [ a NASA probe headed for Pluto ] , it 's in everyone 's interest to favor the largest Kuiper belt objects with their own categorical designation , " said Gregory Laughlin , a University of California , Santa Cruz extrasolar planet researcher .
" The only fly in the ointment that I can envision is if a plutoid larger , than , say , Mars is detected , " Laughlin points out .
" In that case , I think we 'd see a big flare - up of the what - is - a - planet debate . "
More debate coming
The dwarf planet Ceres ( which used to be called an asteroid , and before that was called a planet ! ) is not a plutoid as it is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , according to the IAU .
Current scientific knowledge lends credence to the belief that Ceres is the only object of its kind , the IAU stated .
Therefore , a separate category of Ceres - like dwarf planets will not be proposed at this time , the reasoning goes .
Weaver , the Johns Hopkins researcher , has helped organized a meeting , planned earlier this year for Aug. 14-16 at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , that aims to bring astronomers of varying viewpoints together to discuss the controversy .
" We 're not trying to slam the IAU , it 's just that we also do n't want to lead people to the idea that there 's a handful of people who decide where science should go , " Weaver said today .
The meeting is designed to " address this question in terms of a scientific conference . "
He said no votes will be taken at the meeting .
Rather , it 's a time to " sit back and take stock of everything we 've learned in the past couple of decades . "
The term plutoid joins a host of other odd words -- plutinos , centaurs , cubewanos and EKOs -- that astronomers have conjured in recent years to define objects in the outer solar system , whose appearance seems to grow more complex every year .
Kortenkamp wonders if " plutoid " is n't just one more confusing term in the cosmic lexicon .
" So Pluto is a Kuiper belt object , a plutino ( the unofficial but nearly universally accepted name for objects in the 2:3 resonance with Neptune ) , a dwarf planet , and now also a plutoid ? " he said .
" If the IAU is trying to make things more clear , I think it needs to try again .
This is just another layer of confusion that will feed the " pluto is a planet " camp at the [ Johns Hopkings ] meeting . "
Kortenkamp also thinks the new defiinition leaves Ceres up in the air : " And this " - oid " classification does n't apply to Ceres ? " he asks .
" Okay , so does that means we continue calling Ceres an ASTERoid ? "
Asked if Ceres remains a dwarf planet and is not an asteroid , Bowell , the IAU official , said : " I think so ! "

In future , most new internet users will be in developing countries and will use mobile phones .
Expect a wave of innovation
Illustration by Belle Mellor
THE World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , the body that leads the development of technical standards for the web , usually concerns itself with nerdy matters such as extensible mark - up languages and cascading style sheets .
So the new interest group it launched in May is rather unusual .
It will focus on the use of the mobile web for social development — the sort of vague concept that techie types tend to avoid , because it is more than simply a technical matter of codes and protocols .
Why is the W3C interested in it ?
The simple answer is that the number of mobile phones that can access the internet is growing at a phenomenal rate , especially in the developing world .
In China , for example , over 73 m people , or 29 % of all internet users in the country , use mobile phones to get online .
And the number of people doing so grew by 45 % in the six months to June — far higher than the rate of access growth using laptops , according to the China Internet Network Information Centre .
This year China overtook America as the country with the largest number of internet users — currently over 250m .
And China also has some 600 m mobile - phone subscribers , more than any other country , so the potential for the mobile internet is enormous .
Companies that stake their reputations on being at the technological forefront understand this .
Last year Lee Kai - fu , Google 's president in China , announced that Google was redesigning its products for a market where “ most Chinese users who touch the mobile internet will have no PC at all . ”
It is not just China .
Opera Software , a firm that makes web - browser software for mobile phones , reports rapid growth in mobile - web browsing in developing countries .
The number of web pages viewed in June by the 14 m users of its software was over 3 billion , a 300 % increase on a year earlier .
The fastest growth was in developing countries including Russia , Indonesia , India and South Africa .
Behind these statistics lies a more profound social change .
A couple of years ago , a favourite example of mobile phones ' impact in the developing world was that of an Indian fisherman calling different ports from his boat to get a better price for his catch .
But mobile phones are increasingly being used to access more elaborate data services .
A case in point is M - PESA , a mobile - payment service introduced by Safaricom Kenya , a mobile operator , in 2007 .
It allows subscribers to deposit and withdraw money via Safaricom 's airtime - sales agents , and send funds to each other by text message .
The service is now used by around a quarter of Safaricom 's 10 m customers .
Casual workers can be paid quickly by phone ; taxi drivers can accept payment without having to carry cash around ; money can be sent to friends and family in emergencies .
Safaricom 's parent company , Vodafone , has launched M - PESA in Tanzania and Afghanistan , and plans to introduce it in India .
Similar services have also proved popular in South Africa and the Philippines .
Mobile banking is now being introduced into the Maldives , a group of islands in the Indian Ocean where many people lost their life savings , held in cash , in the tsunami of December 2004 .
For the W3C , M- PESA and its ilk are harbingers of far more sophisticated services to come .
If mobile banking is possible using a simple system of text messages , imagine what might be possible with full web access .
But it will require standards to ensure that services and devices are compatible .
Stéphane Boyera , co-chair of the new W3C interest group , says its aim is to track the social impact of the mobile web in the developing world , to ensure that the web 's technical standards evolve to serve this rapidly emerging constituency .
The right approach , Mr Boyera argues , is not to create “ walled gardens ” of specially adapted protocols for mobile devices , but to make sure that as much as possible of the information on the web can be accessed easily on mobile phones .
That is a worthy goal .
But Ken Banks , the other co-chair of the W3C 's new interest group and the founder of kiwanja.net , which helps non-profit organisations exploit mobile technologies in the developing world , points out that simple services based on text messages are likely to predominate for some time to come , for several reasons .
All mobile phones , however cheap , can send text messages .
Mobile - web access requires more sophisticated handsets and is not always supported by operators .
And users know what it costs to send a text message .
As countries work their way up the development ladder , however , the situation changes in favour of full mobile - web access .
Jim Lee , a manager at Nokia 's Beijing office , says he was surprised to find that university students in remote regions of China were buying Nokia Nseries smart - phones , costing several months of their disposable income .
Such handsets are status symbols , but there are also pragmatic reasons to buy them .
With up to eight students in each dorm room , phones are often the only practical way for students to access the web for their studies .
And smart - phones are expensive , but operators often provide great deals on data tariffs to attract new customers .
Xuehui Zhao , a recent graduate of the Anyang Institute of Technology in Henan province , explains that a typical monthly package for five yuan ( $ 0.73 ) includes 10 megabytes of data transfer — more than enough to allow her to spend a couple of hours each day surfing the web and instant - messaging with friends .
It is also much cheaper than paying 200 yuan per month for a fixed - broadband connection .
As this young generation of sophisticated mobile - web users grows up , what sort of new services will they want ?
Many NGOs and local governments are trying things out .
Several examples were discussed at a workshop in June organised by the W3C in São Paolo , Brazil .
The government of the Brazilian state of Paraná , for instance , is using text messages and voice - menu systems to notify the unemployed about job opportunities and farmers about agricultural prices .
But the workshop also highlighted the limits of what such efforts can achieve .
It quickly became apparent that more or less identical services are being developed from scratch repeatedly in different parts of the world .
There is clearly room for more co-ordination of such efforts , which is exactly what the W3C has in mind .
Furthermore , many clever systems are being developed by NGOs with no apparent interest in setting up commercial services .
As Mr Boyera points out , this raises the issue of sustainability .
What happens when the NGO 's funding runs out ?
One conclusion from the workshop was that promoting social development through the mobile web will mean engaging with businesses .
Regulators can also help by fostering cheap mobile access .
The developing world missed out on much of the excitement of the initial web revolution , the dotcom boom and Web 2.0 , largely because it did not have an internet infrastructure .
But developing countries may now be poised to leapfrog the industrialised world in the era of the mobile web .
What does a 21st century home look like ?
We recently gave a rundown of some of the features we can expect in the next wave of amazing , green houses ( in 21 Ways To Build A 21st Century Home ) .
But since we ’re already in the 21st Century , you ’d expect to see some of these innovations put into practice already .
And you ’d be right .
Here are 15 amazing futuristic innovations that you can see at work right now :
Modular Manufacture .
Prefab houses come in all sorts of weird and wonderful shapes – but let ’s get rid of one preconception .
Cramped ?
Tell that to someone living in a Dwell home .
Green Building Materials .
And to think we used the phrase “ house of straw ” to mean impermanent .
I ca n’t see this strawbale - packed house from Earthflow Design Works ( complete with pervious concrete driveway ) going anywhere in a hurry .
Keeping It Together .
We ’ve featured them before , but the Loq - Kit house never gets old .

Living Walls … or even better , a living roof , as with Tom Ground ’s Gimingham Eco House by Quadlock building solutions .
But why stop with grass ?
Why not grow trees on the outside of your house ?

Sonic Cloaking .
Not yet !
The sonic cloak is still in development , and it ’ll be years before we see ( or hear ) it manifesting in our homes .
But for now , think on this : noise is vibration , and noise is transmitted into the home via vibrations in windows – so if they ’re vibrating already ( powered sustainably , of course ) , that would make them soundproof .
Clever !

“ Traditional ” Alternative Energy .
Solar panels are currently a fairly obtrusive design feature – but with technological breakthroughs ( such as this one ) solar panels will disappear into designs , leaving them as clean - looking as this eco-house proposed for the outskirts of Nicosia , Cyprus .
Even though it ’s solar powered – nary a panel in sight .
Recycled Water .
In the Florence Lofts , Sebastopol ( California ) , all gray water from washing , bathing and laundry is fed into landscape irrigation , helped along with freshly - scrubbed rain water .

Ground Heat .
A good example is the Orchid House in Britain ’s Cotswolds region – some of this unique looking eco-house ’s power supply is geothermal energy .
Price ?
$ 6,000 per square foot .
Ouch .
Passive Heating .
These passive houses from Swedish architects Kjellgren Kaminsky rely on top-quality insulation to keep heating energy requirements down to a minimum .
The tree erupting from the central atrium is a nice touch .
( via cubeme ) .
Electronic Regulation .
Looking like it ’s about to lurch into the sky , the Zero House is a model of tailored energy efficiency – all run through a fully customized “ house brain ” computer - system .
Electrical Lights .
With the advent of LED lighting , we ’re rediscovering color again .
Take the roof of the Evergreen State College , using the Color Kinetics lighting system .
Not only is it the green way forward ( LEDs are now more efficient than CFLs ) , it ’s the fun way forward .

Natural Light .
Sunpipes are cropping up everywhere , and no wonder – they ’re a brilliant idea ( excuse the pun ) .
But they ’re just the start .
For example , look at what Parans is doing with fiberoptics , feeding natural light all around the home ( see more over at Treehugger ) .
Rain Harvesting .
A rainwater - collection system is compulsory in the next generation of eco-housing – but it ’s far from a new idea .
As greenUPGRADER notes , Japanese rain chains are a traditional and stylish way of diverting rainwater down the side of the house and into a collection tank .
Ventilation .
How do you keep your eco-house cool and aerated ?
Along with advances in electronically controlled temperature and airflow , why not get higher into the breeze ?
You ’re looking at Joel L. Sherman ’s Steel Tree House – one of many treehouses featured in a series of posts over at Inhabitat .
Gardens .
On one example springs to mind , dominating the landscape in every sense .
Not only a symbol but a living , breathing example of sustainable green living , the .
On one example springs to mind , dominating the landscape in every sense .
Not only a symbol but a living , breathing example of sustainable green living , the Eden Project is astonishing .

Whatever next ?
Bill Clinton Has Regrets on Campaign for Wife Reflects on anger over S.C. race and " things I wish I had n't said . "
MONROVIA , Liberia Aug. 4 , 2008  --
In his first broadcast interview since his wife dropped out of the Democratic presidential race , former President Bill Clinton said he still has regrets , and insisted he 's " not a racist , " despite controversies surrounding his comments about Sen.
Barack Obama 's win in the South Carolina Democratic primary .
Clinton reflected on his wife 's campaign , his future and the work his foundation is doing across Africa in an exclusive wide - ranging interview with ABC News in Monrovia , Liberia .
He and daughter Chelsea spent time in four African nations over the past six days .
On Monday , the former President will address the World AIDS Conference in Mexico .
At times , he appeared to grow testy as he discussed his wife 's failed bid for the nomination and was asked if he deserves at least some of the blame for his wife 's losses .
Clinton at first said he did not want to rehash events of the past year because it " interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in November . "
But then he offered a lengthy defense of his own role and chastized the media for its coverage .
When asked , " Do you personally have any regrets about what you did , campaigning for your wife ? "
Clinton , at first , answered , " Yes , but not the ones you think .
And it would be counterproductive for me to talk about . "
But then he added , " There are things that I wish I 'd urged her to do .
Things I wish I 'd said .
Things I wish I had n't said .
" But I am not a racist , " he continued .
" I 've never made a racist comment and I never attacked him [ Obama ] personally . "
Clinton was referring to an uproar surrounding some of his comments in the South Carolina Democratic primary that prompted anger among some in the African - American community .
After Obama , D - Ill. , defeated his wife there , Clinton seemed to downplay the significance of the victory by noting Jesse Jackson had won South Carolina in 1984 and 1988 , which some observers found offensive .
The controversy later brought an apology from Hillary Clinton , who told reporters , " You know , I am sorry if anyone was offended .
It was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive . "
Bill Clinton suggested he is still mad at one politician , South Carolina 's Rep. Jim Clyburn , who abandoned his neutrality to back Obama after claiming that the former president had injected race into the campaign .
When Clyburn 's name was brought up as a supporter who criticized the former president , Clinton interrupted to say Clyburn was never a supporter of the Clintons .
When Clyburn 's description was changed to " longtime friend , " Clinton replied , " Used to be . "
Pressed on whether Clinton " severely damaged " his standing with African - Americans as Clyburn has claimed , Clinton snapped , " Yeah , that may be .
By the time he got through working on it , that was probably true . "
But Clinton says that he has no hard feelings towards Obama , the man who defeated his wife .
" I 'm not and never was mad at Senator Obama , " Clinton said .
" You know he hit her hard a couple of times and they hit us a few times a week before she ever responded in kind .
The only thing I ever got mad about was people in your line of work pretending that she somehow started the negative stuff .
It 's a contact sport , " Clinton said .
The Obama campaign 's only response to Clinton 's comments was to say , " We had a hard - fought primary .
We head to the fall , a united Democratic Party , and look forward to the general election . "
More significant is the likelihood that both Sen. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton will have prominent speaking roles at the Democratic convention later this month , where Obama will be nominated to be the party 's presidential nominee .
ABC News ' Jake Tapper , Tahman Bradley and Michael S. James contributed to this report .
Ronald Reagan — the first president since Eisenhower to serve two full terms — had presided over a renewed national optimism , but there were dark clouds on the horizon as his presidency drew to a close .
The federal deficit was soaring out of control .
The revelation that profits from American sales of weapons to Iran were illegally routed to the Nicaraguan contras spawned a major scandal .
Wall Street was in turmoil following several insider - trading scandals and the October 1987 stock market collapse .
The stage was set for one of the most bitter presidential campaigns in recent history : Vice President George Bush , who portrayed himself as the rightful heir to the Reagan revolution , versus Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis , who offered a traditionally Democratic vision of increased government spending on health care , child care , education , and housing .
The Bush campaign used brutal television advertising to portray Dukakis as an ineffective liberal who would gut the country ’s defense system and let convicted murderers out of prison .
Hoping voters would dismiss the attacks as unfair , Dukakis refused to counterattack until late in the campaign .
By then it was too late .
Republican George Bush for president
Dan Quayle for vice president
" Experienced Leadership for America ’s Future " The case of Willie Horton -- an African American convicted murderer who raped a white woman and tortured her fiancé while on a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison -- was frequently mentioned by George Bush in campaign speeches .
The case was directly referred to in a commercial produced by an independent political action committee .
Although officially repudiated by the Bush campaign , the spot , which was broadcast only once , was widely reported in the news media and caused substantial damage to Dukakis .
The Horton case was also implicitly referred to in Bush ’s " Revolving Door " ad , which attacked the Massachusetts furlough program in general .
Another negative commercial that has gained legendary status used news footage of Dukakis riding in a tank -- grinning and looking diminutive in his oversized helmet -- to ridicule the idea of him as commander in chief .
Though Bush ’s negative commercials garnered most of the attention , his campaign also produced a series of strong positive ads , such as " The Future . "
Made in the lyrical montage style of Reagan ’s 1984 spots , these ads sought to establish an identity for the two - term vice president .
The main departure from the Reagan ads was that while Reagan hardly appeared in his own spots , Bush figured prominently in his .
He was shown either in excerpts from his speech accepting the nomination or in family scenes that presented him as an all - American father figure .
Bush ’s media campaign skillfully supplemented paid publicity ( commercials ) with free publicity in the form of staged photo opportunities sure to be reported as news - - a technique originated by the 1984 Reagan campaign .
For example , news footage of Bush receiving the endorsement of the Boston police union reinforced the law - and - order message of the furlough ads .
The Bush media campaign was a model of control , supervised in all respects by veteran media consultant Roger Ailes , who also coached Bush for the debates .
Democrat Michael Dukakis for president
Lloyd Bentsen for vice president
" The Best America Is Yet to Come " The disarray and confusion of the Dukakis campaign was exemplified by a series of commercials known as " The Handlers . "
In one of these commercials , " Crazy , " a group of Bush media consultants worries that their selection of Dan Quayle for vice president may have been a mistake .
The intention was to portray Bush as a superficial candidate whose campaign was based more on image than on substance , but the ads were confusing and seemed at first glance to be pro-Bush .
They were pulled off the air , but only after the Dukakis campaign had spent $ 3 million to produce and air them .
Consultants from several ad agencies came and went throughout the run of the Dukakis campaign , and the chain of command was constantly in flux .
The campaign considered more than 1,000 ad scripts during a three - month period , and the ads produced were inconsistent in style and devoted almost exclusively to defending against Bush ’s attacks .
There were no strong ads linking Bush to Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega , even though Dukakis repeatedly brought up the connection in speeches and debates , or to the Iran - contra arms - for - hostages deal .
Most critically , Dukakis failed to respond to the Willie Horton attack until late in the campaign , when he finally aired a counterassault called " Furlough from the Truth . "
Like Mondale in 1984 , Dukakis never forged a positive identity in his ads .
In his speech accepting the nomination , he had movingly described himself as the embodiment of the American dream , a son of Greek immigrants who was more in touch with the people than George Bush .
Inexplicably , this message was almost completely absent from his advertising .
Godly Tips on How to Punish and Beat Your Christian Child " Blows and wounds cleanse away evil , and beatings purge the inmost being . "
Proverbs 20:30 From the Landover Baptist Department of Creation Science 1 .
To begin with , a Christian parent must understand that a child will never learn a lesson unless they are beaten on their naked bottoms until the imprint of the rugged cross is plainly visible on both cheeks .
( Proverbs 23:13 - 14 ) A clothed bottom is less humiliating and less painful for the wicked child .
In fact , the child may feel no pain at all if they are cunning enough to sin while wearing heavy jeans or khaki pants .
A youngster who can sit comfortably after a Godly beating will think they have outsmarted you and tend to repeat their misdeed and feel a license to move on to more hardcore sins , like rape and blasphemy .
If a child is able to sit down within three days without ointment or a bag of frozen vegetables after their punishment , you have failed as a Christian parent .
A good spanking should be traumatic and something the child will remember well into adulthood .
2 . Use a heavy object , a ruler is too light , a belt - buckle may cause bleeding and suspicion from liberal democrat schoolteachers if you are careless enough to allow your child to attend a public school .
We suggest a heavy King James 1611 authentic cowhide leather bound Bible .
3 . Find a comfortable place to sit and ask your child to come over and have a seat on your lap .
Act as if there is nothing amiss .
We suggest that you smile or wink at your child .
If it is your daughter , say " Come on over here and sit on daddy 's lap , sweet heart .
I want to talk to my little angel for a minute . "
If it is your son , we suggest you say , " Hey there , sonny - how 's Dad 's little quarterback ?
Come on over here and sit on my lap for a minute and let 's talk about Jesus . "
4 . As soon as you have the child on your lap , clench his hands so that he cannot move .
Immediately flip the child over so that his stomach is across your knees .
If the child struggles , give him a good whack across the back of his head and tell him to shut up .
Whisper in his ear , " You 're going to get a whole lot worse from Jesus , you rebellious , hateful , little sissy ! "
5 . This is the point where the child may act like a little demon and start screaming .
Be prepared for this wicked outburst .
Have an athletic sock in your back pocket and cram it into the child 's mouth .
Stuff it back until you get to the stripes at the top of the socks .
Do n't worry : if the child is smart enough to remember to breath through their nose , they wo n't suffocate .
6 . Ready your Bible , and lift it high above your head with one hand .
Keep the child secure with your free hand .
Landover Baptist Creation Scientists agree that the most effective way of securing the child for beating is to clench the back of his neck like a turkey .
If they are still struggling , we suggest you raise your voice and say something like , " I 'll give you something to squirm over , you little devil ! "
7 . Pull down their pants and underwear to reveal their pink little hiney .
May sure both cheeks are fully exposed .
8 . To ensure that the child is aware of their misdeed , and they never forget it , it is often best to smack the child across the bottom with the Bible as you speak out their misdeed .
Each word would be one healthy whack across their naked hind quarters .
For example : " YOU " [ WHACK ! ]
" DIDN'T " [ WHACK ! ] " EAT " [ WHACK ] " YOUR " [ WHACK ] " BRUSSEL " [ WHACK ] " SPROUTS " [ WHACK ! ] " YOU " [ WHACK ! ] " LITTLE " [ WHACK ! ] " DEMON ! " [ WACK ! ] and finishing off with a lighter whack , " did " [ whack ! ] " you ? " [ whack ! ]
9 . Rebuke the child in the sweet name of Jesus , toss them aside like a used Kleenex and let them roll to the floor to contemplate their sinful nature .
10 .
After about an hour , when the child has calmed down , have him sit on your lap again and read him some scripture verses about Hell ( We recommend , Matthew 13:41 - 42 ) from the same Bible you used to beat him with .
Let the child know that the punishment he received today is nothing compared to the eternal punishment of Hell where Jesus burns and cooks all the bad little boys and girls who do n't do what their daddy tells them .

A team of researchers at the University of Alberta has discovered a gene that is able to block HIV , and in turn prevent the onset of AIDS .
Stephen Barr , a molecular virologist in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology , says his team has identified a gene called TRIM22 that can block HIV infection in a cell culture by preventing the assembly of the virus .
" When we put this gene in cells , it prevents the assembly of the HIV virus , " said Barr , a postdoctoral fellow .
" This means the virus can not get out of the cells to infect other cells , thereby blocking the spread of the virus . "
Barr and his team also prevented cells from turning on TRIM22 - provoking an interesting phenomenon : the normal response of interferon , a protein that co-ordinates attacks against viral infections , became useless at blocking HIV infection .
" This means that TRIM22 is an essential part of our body 's ability to fight off HIV .
The results are very exciting because they show that our bodies have a gene that is capable of stopping the spread of HIV . "
One of the greatest challenges in battling HIV is the virus ' ability to mutate and evade medications .
Antiretroviral drugs introduced during the late 1990s interfere with HIV 's ability to produce new copies of itself - and even they are beneficial , the drugs are unable to eradicate the virus .
Barr and his team have discovered a gene that could potentially do the job naturally .
" There are always newly emerging drug - resistant strains of HIV so the push has been to develop more natural means of blocking the virus .
The discovery of this gene , which is natural in our cells , might provide a different avenue , " said Barr .
" The gene prevents the assembly of the virus so in the future the idea would be to develop drugs or vaccines that can mimic the effects of this gene . "
" We are currently trying to figure out why this gene does not work in people infected with HIV and if there is a way to turn this gene on in those individuals , " he added .
" We hope that our research will lead to the design of new drugs , or vaccines that can halt the person - to - person transmission of HIV and the spread of the virus in the body , thereby blocking the onset of AIDS . "
The researchers are now investigating the gene 's ability to battle other viruses .
Barr 's research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research .
The findings are published in the Public Library of Science Pathogens .

McCain ’s attacks on rival fall flat with vets group Republican offers plan to let some get care outside VA
John McCain speaks in Vegas Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , speaks to members of the Disabled American Veterans Saturday in Las Vegas .
Clinton Stumps for Obama Sen. Hillary Clinton hosts a " Campaign for Change " rally for presumed Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama at Green Valley High School on Friday .
The rally kicks off a weekend of organizing activities throughout the state .
In Today 's Sun In grim present , election is uncertain
Sun Voter Guide Barack Obama
John McCain
Sen .
John McCain , speaking to disabled veterans Saturday in Las Vegas , attacked his Democratic opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , for his foreign policy record , while also proposing a program that would allow veterans to acquire health care at private hospitals and not just through the Veterans Affairs Department .
The veterans , at Bally ’s for their national convention , gave him a tepid reception , especially considering McCain ’s life story .
The Arizona senator was a Navy pilot shot down over Vietnam , tortured and held as a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years .
Just one of 14 veterans interviewed by the Sun after his speech said he is a certain McCain voter , and the nonpartisan group ’s legislative director expressed concerns about McCain ’s proposed “ Veterans ’ Care Access Card . ”
But as with most presidential campaign events , the intended audience was not the veterans in the hall but television viewers .
McCain used the opportunity to hammer Obama on his opposition to the 2007 surge of U.S. troops in Iraq .
McCain said Obama “ ca n’t quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment .
Instead , he commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight , he would oppose the surge .
Even in retrospect , he would choose the path of retreat and failure for America over the path of success and victory .
“ Behind all of these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the ambition to be president , ” McCain said .
“ What ’s missing is the judgment to be commander in chief . ”
McCain said Obama had tried to “ legislate failure ” in Iraq .
Obama has said that he showed good judgment by opposing the war in the first place .
The Iraqi government recently endorsed Obama ’s proposal to withdraw troops .
In setting forth an agenda for veterans , McCain said he would make sure Congress approves the VA health care budget on schedule .
“ But I will say that every increase in funding must be matched by increases in accountability , both at the VA and in Congress . ”
Legislation appropriating money for veterans is often tardy , bogged down in the legislative process and loaded with extra spending on unrelated matters .
McCain said he would veto veterans legislation that contains unrelated pork barrel spending .
The money saved could be used for veterans benefits , he said .
To help veterans who live far from VA hospitals or need specialized care the VA can’t provide , McCain proposed giving low - income veterans and those who incurred injury during their service a card they could use at private hospitals .
The proposal is not an attempt to privatize the VA , as critics have alleged , but rather , an effort to improve care and access to it , he said .
Joe Violanti , legislative director of the Disabled American Veterans , a nonpartisan organization , said the proposal would increase costs because private hospitals are more expensive .
The increased cost could lead to further rationing of care , he said .
McCain closed with stirring words : “ I have had the good fortune to know personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend America .
But I have known none braver or better than those who do so today .
They are our inspiration , as I suspect all of you were once theirs .
And I pray to a loving God that he bless and protect them . ”
John Von Schlicher , 87 , of Florida , said he will support McCain .
Schlicher sharply criticized the Democratic - controlled Congress for not funding VA hospitals .
( Spending on veterans benefits will increase 11 percent this year . )
Other veterans , such as James Jewett and Jay Johnson of Texas , expressed misgivings about McCain using the occasion to attack his opponent so fiercely .
Duke Hendershot , a double amputee retired Marine who served in Vietnam , supported McCain ’s run for president in 2000 but is undecided this year .
“ John just is n’t the same as he used to be .
He ’s not his own man , ” said Hendershot , who lives in San Antonio , Texas .
“ A lot of that has to do with how he ’s wanted this job so bad for so long that he ’s tied himself to President Bush . ”
He said McCain ’s embrace of Bush , whom Hendershot called a “ draft - dodging coward , ” is even more perplexing because of the rivalry between the two candidates during the 2000 campaign .
Hendershot also criticized McCain for taking swipes at Obama in his speech .
“ He should have been talking about veterans issues , not his opponent , ” he said .
By contrast , he praised Obama for keeping his remarks tightly focused on veterans .
The Democrat gave taped remarks via video .

The disgraced Greek sprinter Katerina
Thanou yesterday said she would not appeal against the IOC 's decision banning her from the Beijing Games , after the IOC 's executive board ruled that the Sydney 100 m silver medallist had brought the Olympic movement into disrepute .
She has also been barred from attending the Games in any capacity .
Thanou had been entered to compete in the 100m in Beijing .
One of Thanou 's lawyers , Nikos Kollias , said the sprinter would not file an appeal .
" We will not appeal her participation in the Games .
What matters now is Katerina 's compensation , " said Kollias .
Thanou fled from the Athens Olympic Village on the eve of the Games four years ago after drug testers arrived to see her and her team - mate Kostas Kenteris , overshadowing the start of their home Olympics .
" The executive board took the decision this morning to declare Ms Thanou ineligible to compete in the Beijing Games , and ... also took the decision in their own right to send a firm signal of the moral case that this has brought the Olympic movement into disrepute , " said the IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies yesterday .
Thanou and Kenteris were expected to be among the stars of the Athens Games , but their controversial exit from the Olympic Village , and their subsequent claim that they had been injured in a motorcycle accident that meant they were hospitalised beyond the reach of dope testers , was a national scandal .
" These events resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the Athens Games and brought the Olympic movement and the IOC into disrepute , " said Davies .
She said she was unaware whether the Hellenic Olympic Commission would appeal the decision .
The IOC 's disciplinary case against Thanou had been in abeyance since
Athens , but as soon as she declared her intention to run in Beijing a hearing was fixed .
The disciplinary commission met on Thursday and passed its recommendations to the executive board yesterday .
Thanou has already said she will sue the IOC and its president , Jacques Rogge , if she is not officially awarded the gold medal from the Sydney Games as a result of Marion Jones being stripped of the gold following her admission that she used drugs .
In a statement , Thanou said the IOC 's decision was " arbitrary and illegal " .
" It is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the Olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute , " Thanou said .
UPI | The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a way for people who do n’t belong on terrorist watch lists to be spared extra scrutiny at the airport .
Under the new program , tens of thousands of travelers who are stopped repeatedly because their names match those of suspected terrorists will be permitted to register with the airlines , USA Today reported Monday .
Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff said once their names and date of birth have been added to company records , they will be treated like the rest of the flying public .
“ After that , they will get their boarding pass just like everyone else does , ” Chertoff said .
The downside is that travelers will have to provide their personal information to each airline they use and it is up to the airline to decide whether it wants to participate in the program .
“ The airlines need to learn more about the program to determine to what extent they can use it , ” said David Castelveter , a spokesman for the Air Transport Association .
[ Update on 9/19 : The Senator has agreed to meet with me so no need to call him .

If you call nonetheless , please be kind to the staff you talk to . ]
You 're never going to believe it folks , but today I had another close call on my bike , but this time the driver was New York State Senator Jeff Klein of the 34th Senate District in the Bronx .
What follows is an open letter to the Senator which I will deliver to him today .
I am asking Senator Klein to meet with me and the Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives , the New York City organization that advocates for bikers and pedestrians .
Since the Senator has now had first hand experience , we'd like to talk to him about policies that would help keep bikes and cars from tangling with each other .
Bloggers and journalists , please feel free to repost the letter in its entirety ( being sure , of course , to attribute it to Colin Beavan at NoImpactMan.com ) .
Readers , please email this post to every New Yorker you know .
New York State citizens , please register your thoughts on the incident I will describe below with Senator Klein and the leader of the New York State Democrats .
I will give contact details below .
Please also ask Senator Klein to honor my request to meet with him .
Also , readers , please excuse the vulgar language , which as you know , I do n't generally use on the blog .

Senator Jeff Klein
Legislative Office Building
Room 313
Albany , New York 12247
Dear Senator Klein ,
RE : My request , as a member of the board of Transportation Alternatives , to meet with you to discuss transportation policy as it relates to bicycle safety , carbon emissions , the cultivation of New York City quality of life , breathable air , and traffic congestion .
Though you may not know my name , you may recall that you and I met today under rather unpleasant circumstances on New York City 's Broadway , just north of City Hall .
You were driving your black Mercedes .
I was riding a small folding bicycle and wearing a purple helmet .
To refresh your memory :
Traffic was moving rather slowly and you were heading in the downtown direction , as was I .
You were in the far left lane and I was riding on the curbside of that lane , near your rear passenger door .
Suddenly , you began to veer your Mercedes to the left , potentially crushing me between your car and the cars parked on the side of the road .
With nowhere to go to get out of your way , and to avoid serious injury or death , in desperation , I chose to knock on your window to let you know that I was there and that you should avoid veering further in my direction .
At this point , you brought your vehicle to an abrupt halt , not to avoid hitting me , but because you apparently needed to communicate something to me .
You rolled down your window and said , " Get your hands off my car , you fucking asshole . "
I said , " You were veering into me and going to crush me . "
You said , " You better not touch other people 's cars .
You might find that touching other people 's cars is more dangerous than traffic . "
This gave me the impression that you were threatening me .
I said , " I think my life is more precious than your car . "
You said , " I did n't see you . "
I said , " If you 're driving a car , it 's your responsibility to see what 's in road space before you veer into it .
That 's what your driver side mirror is for . "
You said , " I looked in my mirror . "
I said , " You should also turn and look over your shoulder since you know there could be a bicyclist . "
You said , " Yeah .
Well , maybe you should watch where you 're going . "
I said , " Where was I supposed to go ?
I was there .
And you were veering into me . "
I was about to remind you that , in the past week , two cyclists have been killed by automobiles in New York City , but you made a gesture which implied you considered this conversation a waste of time and drove off .
That is when I saw that your car had special license plates proclaiming your membership of the New York State Senate .
A red light stopped you at the next intersection .
I rode alongside you and , more cautiously , tapped again on your window .
You rolled it down .
I could tell by your face that you were n't happy to be talking again to this particular New York State citizen , on whose behalf you govern .
I asked you , " What is your name , Senator ? "
You said , " Senator Jeff Klein . "
This is how I know it was you .
Now , the thing is , Senator , I do n't particularly call you to task for calling me a fucking asshole .
If the roles had been reversed , and I had a big black Mercedes and you came up in a purple helmet , knocking on my window , and I did n't realize I was on the verge of crushing your legs , I might have called you a fucking asshole , too .
I 'd like to point out , however , that , as mad as you were about my touching your car window with my hand , you could double or triple that strength of emotion when it comes to how frightening it is to be on the other side of the Mercedes driving wheel , especially when that particular Mercedes is coming toward you .
Weigh it up : " he might scratch my black Mercedes " against " he might cause my little girl to be left fatherless . "
Weigh it up again :
One guy is riding a bike that weighs a grand total of 22 pounds and has a relatively small potential to harm others .
The other guy is in charge of a powerful machine that weighs a couple of tons .
Which person has the greater responsibility to watch out for the care and welfare of people who may get in their path , by their own fault or not ?
As a State Senator , I 'm sure you especially feel the weight of the obligation to look out for the welfare of others , no ?
Again , this is not to say you did not act like many other humans in the same situation .
But it is to say that transportation policy in New York City currently falls way too short of making sure that unintended confrontations like ours -- and worse ones that end in fatalities -- do n't occur .
Proper policy , which provided ubiquitous segregated bike lanes or which limited traffic congestion , could reduce such incidents without having to depend on drivers of black Mercedes , for example , remembering to look in their driver side mirror or over their shoulders .
It is for this reason that I hope you will honor my request to visit your office , along with Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Paul Steely
White , to ask you to reconsider your current platforms on transportation and traffic congestion in New York City .
As you know , the United States ' dependence of foreign oil contributes significantly to our current economic crisis and is a matter of national security .
Furthermore , the planet 's future ability to support human life is in peril because of global warming caused , in large measure , by the overuse of the same foreign oil .
At the same time , countless studies show that making the streets of New York and other cities safer and more convenient for bicyclists and pedestrians would reduce automobile use , dependence on foreign oil , carbon emissions , and traffic congestion while contributing to breathable air and livable streets , improved retail business , and the physical health of New Yorkers .
Yet , until now , your platform has presented obstacles to the adaptations that might bring these benefits to New York City .
Not only did you oppose congestion pricing , a measure intended to decrease vehicular traffic , but you proposed eliminating the tolls on bridges and tunnels into Manhattan on holidays , which would bring more traffic into the City and further encourage automobile use , just when it should be decreased .
I hope you 'll consider that these policies are out of step with the current times .
I hope , too , seeing , in the case of our confrontation , the result of your policies when it comes to impact on personal lives , in general , and the safety of bikers , in particular , might also give you cause to reconsider your position .
Policies that make New York City safe for bicyclists and pedestrians -- the people who live on the streets as opposed to the people who just drive through them -- is best , both for our citizens and the planet .
I look forward to hearing from you regarding my request to meet in person to discuss these issues .
Yours sincerely ,
Colin Beavan

Brad Friedman Byon 9/29/2008 , 12:25 pm PT
[ Ed Note : Cliff Arnebeck , the Ohio attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case discussed below , will be joining me Wednesday evening to talk about the case , when I sit in to Guest Host The Mike Malloy Show , which I 'll be doing Wed - Fri this week , from 9 p - Midnight ET ( 6 p - 9 p PT ) - BF ]
A recent flurry of activity in the long - standing King Lincoln v. OH Sec. of State lawsuit concerning voting rights violations in the state during the 2004 election has resulted in the judge lifting the stay to allow depositions to be taken of key GOP tech - guru Mike Connell , and potentially others , such as Karl Rove .
A subpoena has now been served to Connell , who was recently described by the attorneys working on the case , as a ' high - IQ Forrest Gump ... at the scene of every GOP crime . '
Federal District Court Judge Algenon Marbley 's brief order [ PDF ] , agreeing to lift the stay , was quietly issued on September 19th .
It reads :
On motion of the plaintiffs and agreement of the defendant Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , the stay in this matter is lifted for the sole purpose of permitting the plaintiffs to take the deposition of Michael Connell and any other witnesses whose testimony , in the judgment of these parties , may be warranted based upon the deposition of Michael Connell .
The BRAD BLOG had learned about the latest court action , which could soon entangle Rove as well , some time ago , but we were asked by parties involved in the case to embargo the information until such time as they were able to serve Connell with his subpoena ...
The lifting of the stay comes on the heels of a troubling declaration filed with the court by Republican cyber - security expert and Connell colleague , Stephen Spoonamore who testified that he 's concerned a classic " Man in the Middle " cyber hack may have occurred on Election Night in 2004 as Connell 's Republican firm handled results reporting for Ohio's Presidential election .
According to Spoonamore , control of Ohio 's election system by Connell 's firm , may have allowed for the compromise of election results as they were being reported .
The structure of the system , as results were allowed to be first diverted to Connell 's servers that night , would have been " cause to launch an immediate fraud investigation " in the banking industry , charges Spoonamore , who ferrets out such problems in the financial services industry .
Spoonamore further notes in his declaration , in regard to Connell , that " He has admitted to me that in his zeal to ' save the unborn ' he may have helped others who have compromised elections . "
Should Rove be subpoenaed in this case , it is believed that he would not be able to invoke the Executive Privilege claims he 's used to fight similar calls to testify before Congress , attorneys working on the case have told The BRAD BLOG .
Connell 's attorneys are currently fighting to quash his subpoena .

BRUSSELS ( AP ) 
Deaths are expected to outnumber births in the European Union from 2015 when migration will become the only source of population growth , according to an EU report released Tuesday .
The forecasts show Europe aging rapidly over future decades with fewer workers paying the pension and health care costs of more and more elderly people .
In the near - term , the number of EU citizens in the 27 - nation bloc will swell from today 's 495 million to 521 million in 2035 .
But after that it will shrink back gradually to 506 million in 2060 , according to the EU 's statistics agency .
Many more people will live longer , with those aged 80 or over almost tripling in number from 22 million now to 61 million in 2060 , Eurostat predicts .
EU officials regularly warn governments they need to do more to prepare for this population timebomb which will see two workers for every retiree in 2060 instead of four at present .
Some European countries are trying to tackle this by encouraging people to work longer , shedding some rules that allow some professions retire in their 50s .
The population changes will vary from country to country .
By 2060 , Britain will overtake Germany and France to become the European Union 's most populous state , increasing by a quarter to 77 million .
Germany will shrink to 71 million while France will grow to 72 million , Italy to 59 million and Spain to 52 million .
Ireland — which currently has Europe 's second highest birth rate after France — will grow by half , while Cyprus , one of the EU 's smallest states , will expand by three quarters .
Some eastern European states will see their populations fall dramatically .
Bulgaria will drop by 28 % , Latvia by 26 % , Lithuania by 24 % , Romania by 21 % and Poland by 18 % , Eurostat forecasts .
The Luxembourg - based EU agency warns that its figures are a " what - if scenario " that should be taken with caution .
It says it assumes that all European countries will become more similar with birth rates falling and people living longer .

Close your eyes for a moment and visualize with me .
( Hopefully you have text - to - speech turned on . )
I want to try some guided imagery on you .
Your daily grind is over .
You 're no longer maintaining a huge application that your whole team hates .
You 're sitting alone in a peaceful meadow .
There is a small mailbox here .
Your computer is in front of you , and your favorite IDE is loaded up on the screen .
You 're starting a new project — a project in which you will guide the overall design .
Your business rules are well - defined and you know them like the back of your hand .
You create your database and set up the rest of the initial configuration .
You 're ready to write your first code file .
OK , now open your eyes .
Which code file was it ?
If you 're like me , then it was a preliminary collection of constants and enumerations based on the business requirements .
A developer that worked at Chris 's company in ages past had created Constants .
java , and added a few constants that 'd be frequently used in the application .
It was n't the ideal way to handle codes , but it certainly did the trick .
//Auto Estimating Send Estimate Assignments Request Types public static String _AUTO_STTS_OPEN = " 10 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_OPEN_ACWP = " 11 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_REOPEN = " 20 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_NO_CLAIM
= " 30 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_CWP = " 40 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_OIE = " - 0 " ; public static String _AUTO_STTS_COVERAGE_QUESTION
= " CQ " ; public static String _STTS_PAID = " PD " ; public static String _FIRE_STTS_OPEN = " OPN " ; public static String _FIRE_STTS_REOPEN = " RPN " ; public static String _FIRE_STTS_OIE = " OIE " ; public static String _FIRE_STTS_COVERAGE_QUESTION
= " COV " ; public static String _FIRE_STTS_CWP = " CWP " ;
Over time , Constants .
java grew to have more and more constants , and gradually less and less were commented , but they started being put into separate classes , employing a sophisticated " incrementing " technique for naming classes .
Here 's the second group of constants added to the file :
public static class _ 2 { public static String _A = " A " ; public static String _B = " B " ; public static String _C = " C " ; public static String _R = " R " ; public static String _S = " S " ; }
There 's no reason that anyone would forget these codes , right ?
I mean , Accepted , Blocked , Created ... it should be clear to anyone that understands the business rules .
The constants stuff was going so well for them that they started moving everything into the constants :
public static class _5 { public static String _LESS_THAN = " < " ; public static String _LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL = " < = " ; public static String _NOT_EQUAL = " <> " ; public static String _EQUAL = " = " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN = " > " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL = " >= " ; }
As the file took on more and more constants , though , things started to get a little murky .
public static class _215 { public static String _BACKSLASH = " \\ " ; public static String _ 2 = " 2 " ; public static String _ 3 = " 3 " ; public static String _ 4 = " 4 " ; public static String _5 = " 5 " ; public static String _ 6 = " 6 " ; public static String _ 7 = " 7 " ; public static String _ 8 = " 8 " ; public static String _9 = " 9 " ; }
Some of the groups got really long .
public static class _ 131 { public static String _01001 = " 01001 " ; public static String _01003 = " 01003 " ; public static String _01005 = " 01005 " ; // * SNIP * ( 3,215 lines ) public static String _ VQ010 = " VQ010 " ; public static String _ VQ020 = " VQ020 " ; public static String _ VQ030 = " VQ030 " ; }
Some were started but never finished :
public static class _ 1269 { public static String _A = " A " ; public static String _B = " B " ; public static String _C = " C " ; public static String _D = " D " ; public static String _E = " E " ; public static String _F = " F " ; public static String _G = " G " ; public static String _H = " H " ; public static String _I = " I " ; public static String _J = " J " ; public static String _K = " K " ; public static String _L = " L " ; public static String _M = " M " ; public static String _O = " O " ; public static String _P = " P " ; public static String _R = " R " ; public static String _S = " S " ; public static String _T = " T " ; public static String _W = " W " ; }
Some were just plain weird .
public static class _83 { public static String _LESS_THAN = " < " ; public static String _LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL = " < = " ; public static String _NOT_EQUAL = " <> " ; public static String _EQUAL = " = " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN = " > " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL = " >= " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL14 = " > =14 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL180 = " > =180 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL30 = " > =30 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL60 = " > =60 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN14 = " > 14 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN180 = " > 180 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN30 = " > 30 " ; public static String _GREATER_THAN60 = " > 60 " ; public static String _14LESS_THAN = " 14 < " ; public static String _14LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL
= " 14<= " ; public static String _180LESS_THAN = " 180 < " ; public static String _180LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL
= " 180<= " ; public static String _30LESS_THAN = " 30 < " ; public static String _30LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL
= " 30<= " ; public static String _60LESS_THAN = " 60 < " ; public static String _60LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL
= " 60<= " ; }
And some even had bugs !
public static class _ 1641 { public static String _AB = " AB " ; public static String _AK = " AB " ; // * SNIP * public static String _WY = " WY " ; }
I 'll spare you the remaining lines of the 16,519 line file .
But suffice it to say , if there 's a string you need , it appears somewhere in one of the five hundred and fifty two classes .
Mr. Anonymous frequently finds offense or insult in things I say and do , then retaliates by ignoring me , even though I 'm unaware I 've done anything to upset him .
It 's beginning to take a toll .
I can give an actual example and a generic description of the dynamic .
Would some MeFites care to weigh in and provide a label for either his behavior or our dynamic ?
At heart I want to improve our relationship , but right now I just need some coping strategies and can't see the forest for the trees .
We 've been together a little more than 5 years and this is a chronic problem .
These events happen about once a week .
Here 's a real - life example :
Me : Would you handle dealing with the contractor about the exterior and the garage ?
Him :
Why ?
Me : I do n't think it makes sense for me to be a go - between on areas you requested work for .
Also , I do n't think I can watch Toddler Anonymous and meet for two hours with the contractor at the same time , and then spend my free time in the evening filling you in on the meeting .
Him : Fine .
[ A bit curt .
He begins to gather his things to leave for work in a very clipped and efficient way . ]
Me : Have I said something to upset you ?
Him : No . [ Now very curt ] .
He makes no eye contact with me and says nothing for the next 20 min .
Me :
You said you 're not upset , but when you stop talking to me and start rushing to leave I think you are angry with me .
Him :
Is that so ?
See you later .
He then more or less avoided me for the next two days ( while at home he retreated to his office , came to bed later than me , would not start or continue conversations with me , etc. ) before I got upset with him and we had a blow - out .
Here 's my take on how the dynamic usually plays out in a generic fashion :
Me : Neutral remark or request
Him : Silence and withdrawal for a number of hours .
He often does n't tell me he 's upset and , if I do n't notice , this can go on for a full day or two .
Me : Noticing and asking if something 's wrong .
No idea I 've done something .
Him :
Tells me I offended him and usually claims it was intentional , which justifies his upset .
He often has to specify the event because it 's so small I cannot identify it .
Me :
An apology for offending him ( but without taking on the " intentionally malicious " claim ) and explanation for my behavior .
Him : Silence , withdrawal , refusing to interact with me for another extended period .
Me : I also begin to ignore him .
Eventually I confront him and express upset at being punished disproportionately for my actions .
Him :
Or he eventually approaches me saying , more or less , to stop being controlling and ordering him around .
Also I should be more polite ( say please after requests , wait until a better time , not interrupt him , etc. ) .
Me : Point out that he could have said no to my request or tried to negotiate a compromise or asked to talk about it later or pointed out why he could not meet the request .
When I ask if he could do this rather than ignoring me for hours at a time , he again says some variation of " You meant to offend me " or " No , just because you want me to do it does n't mean I have to . "
Then the full - fledged argument begins .
What 's going on here ?
Is he paranoid , depressed , insecure , a bully , all of the above ?
No one in my life ( including ex's ) has had this issue with me and I 'm getting tired of the work it takes just to get through small transactions with Mr. Anonymous .
Context :
We 've been in therapy for other issues but stopped for some scheduling reasons and never resumed .
( I do n't think our counselor was very adept .
Every time we came up against a hard issue she 'd say " we 'll save it for next time " and ask us not to talk about it during the week , but then we 'd never re-address it .
I called her on this a few times and she basically said some people just get along better if they avoid issues .
I said I was n't one of them .
So I never rescheduled after a missed meeting . )
Yes , therapy might work but in this case I 'm looking for other suggestions and specifically a concise label for his or our dynamic that will help me find some strategies for dealing with it .
I 'm having difficulty interacting with Mr. Anonymous .
I 'm looking for a label to describe how he behaves so I can do some reading and work out some strategies for handling our interactions better .
There 's
I ’m at the Ruby Hoedown in Huntsville this weekend .
Being around so many brilliant geeks encouraged me to release a gem I ’ve had sitting in the hopper for several weeks .
finder_filter encapsulates a pattern I find myself using quite frequently in Rails .
Namely , looking up an instance variable before an action .
For example :
class UsersController < ActionController :: Base before_filter : find_user , :only => [ : show , : edit ] def show # do something with @user end def edit # do something with @user end def find_user @user = User.find ( params [ : id ) end end
Sticking the finder in a before filter keeps the code DRY , but it still takes several lines to do this .
finder_filter reduces this to a single line of code :
class UsersController < ActionController :: Base finder_filter : only => [ : show , : edit ] def show ; end def edit ; end end
There are other options to customize the column and param used in the lookup .
Check out the README for full details .
To install the gem as a plugin in your Rails project :
sudo gem install pelargir - finder_filter -- source=http://gems.github.com
Then open environment.rb in your Rails app and add the gem as a dependency in your initializer block :
Rails :: Initializer.run do |config| config.gem " pelargir - finder_filter " ... end
If you have any comments or suggestions , I ’d love to hear from you .
Contact me through the finder_filter project on GitHub .
‘ Whatever you can say about the Soviet bioweapons scientists , ” a Bush administration official once told me , “ they never killed anyone . ”
We ca n’t say the same about our bioweapons scientists .
Someone , most likely Bruce Ivins , at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Ft. Detrick , Md. , turned powdered anthrax spores into a deadly weapon .
It ’s ironic that the Soviet scientists were making offensive weapons .
Our people , since 1969 , have worked strictly to defend us .
One of those defenders killed five people , sickened 17 others and plunged the nation into hysteria for weeks in the fall of 2001 .
After a seven - year investigation by the FBI , the source of the deadly anthrax strain has been identified -- our own biodefense program at Ft. Detrick .
That is the real legacy of the FBI investigation .
Since the anthrax - laced letters were mailed in September and October of 2001 , U.S. biodefense has blown up out of all proportion to any rational assessment of the bioweapons threat .
Earlier this year , an article in the journal Biosecurity and Bioterrorism , analyzing government biodefense spending from 2001 to 2008 , stated that $ 49.66 billion has been allocated for civilian biodefense .
According to microbiologist and longtime biodefense critic Richard Ebright of Rutgers University , actual spending is even higher , amounting to $ 57 billion .

In 2005 , he and 757 other microbiologists sent a stinging open letter to Elias Zerhouni , director of the National Institutes of Health , protesting the government ’s preoccupation with “ priority pathogens ” -- germs such as anthrax that could be used in a bioweapons attack .
But Zerhouni and Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , would have none of it .
In a letter published in the journal Science , they disagreed : “ The United States has experienced an anthrax attack , and security experts repeatedly express concern that future attacks with biological weapons are likely , if not inevitable . ”
But we did n’t actually experience an anthrax attack .
The whole incident amounted to a snake eating its own tail .
No ingenious biowarrior from Al Qaeda sent the lethal envelopes through the U.S. postal system .
An American scientist did .
The FBI and its genetic analyses leave no doubt :
Though 16 laboratories had access to the “ Ames strain ” of anthrax used in the letters , only the samples that came from Ivins ’ laboratory at Ft. Detrick matched the genetic fingerprint of the attack strain .
In the sorry aftermath of the anthrax investigation , it ’s clear that the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have to rethink the priority - pathogens list , which includes anthrax , smallpox , plague , tularemia , Ebola and other germs that rarely , if ever , threaten American lives .
It ’s the “ non-defense - related ” germs that are killing us .
Randall Wolcott of the Southwest Regional Wound Care Center points out that 500,000 Americans a year die of biofilm infections -- such as diabetic ulcers -- that are almost impossible to treat by conventional means .
That ’s almost twice as many as die of cancer .
According to the CDC , infections caused by methicillin - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , kill 19,000 people a year .
Still , staph itself is n’t considered a priority pathogen , despite the emergence of highly resistant and increasingly virulent strains .
Only one of 40 staph toxins is on the priority list .
Advertisement
There ’s another problem created by the priority - pathogens list .
The ballooning of the biodefense program , according to Ebright , means that about 14,000 individuals are now considered qualified to work with priority pathogens .
It has n’t always been easy to find qualified people for this research .
In the days when the FBI was pursuing former “ person of interest ” -- and now exonerated -- Steven J. Hatfill , one senior government scientist said of Hatfill ’s background , “ You take what you can get -- not many people with his abilities show up very often . ”
So where do 14,000 suddenly qualified biodefense experts come from ?
And how can they be vetted ?
As biodefense expert Leonard Cole , author of “ The Anthrax Letters , ” told me : “ There are 15,000 to 16,000 people now working in labs on select agents -- that ’s many more possibilities of another bizarre individual doing illicit work . ”
The lesson of the anthrax letters is n’t that we ’re in danger of a bioweapons attack from terrorists .
It ’s that U.S. biodefense itself has become a threat :
We have met the enemy -- and it is us .
The next administration should pull the plug on the biodefense excesses of the Bush administration and put most of the thousands of microbiologists to work on the germs we really need to worry about .

Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned the House that he is “ convinced the time is now upon us that some Big Events are about to occur . ” that will cause liberty to go “ into deep hibernation ” .
Paul told the House :
“ These fast - approaching events will not go unnoticed .
They will affect all of us .
They will not be limited to just some areas of our country .
The world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed . ”
“ There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced .
Instead of using globalism in a positive fashion , it ’s been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians , bureaucrats and central bankers . ”
Paul continued .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A nuclear power plant that lies within commuting distance of New York City is more likely to be shaken by an earthquake than previously thought because it sits atop a newly identified intersection of two active seismic zones , scientists said .
The Indian Point nuclear reactor is within a mile or two
of both a seismic zone running from Stamford , Connecticut , to Peekskill , New York , and the Ramapo seismic line , said the study by seismologists at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
Large earthquakes are infrequent around New York compared to more active areas like California , but the risk is higher because of the millions of people that live around the largest U.S. city and the infrastructure surrounding it , said Lynn Sykes , the lead author of the study .
Indian Point , which is owned by Entergy Corp , lies about 40 miles north of New York City in the town of Buchanan , which sits on the banks of the Hudson River .
“ The problem here comes from many subtle faults .
We now see there is earthquake activity on them .
Each one is small , but when you add them up , they are probably more dangerous than we thought , ” said Leonardo Seeber , a co-author of the study , which appeared in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America .
Jim Steets , a spokesman for the plant , said the study added nothing new to what was known before the plant was built and that Indian Point was made to withstand a magnitude 7 quake on the Mercalli scale , equal to about 6.1 on the Richter scale .
The study said Richter magnitude 5 quakes , which are strong enough to cause damage , occurred around New York in 1737 , 1783 and 1884 and that stronger quakes in the area are possible .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - People who have been exposed to high levels of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) may face an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes , a new study shows .
The findings , reported in the journal Diabetes Care , come from a long - term study of Taiwanese adults who , in the 1970s , had been poisoned by cooking oil contaminated with PCB pollutants .
Once used in products ranging from fluorescent lights and appliances to insulation and insecticide , PCBs were banned in the late 1970s as carcinogens and general health hazards .
They linger in the environment , however .
In the new study , Dr. Yueliang Leon Guo , from the National Taiwan University in Taipei , and colleagues examined the incidence of type 2 diabetes among 378 Taiwanese “ oil disease ” victims and 370 of their neighbors who had not been poisoned .
They found that women who had been exposed to the PCB - laced oil were twice as likely as other women to develop type 2 diabetes over 24 years .
And women who had been most severely affected by the PCB exposure had a more than five - times higher diabetes risk .
There were no similar risks seen in men , however .
Other studies have found that people with diabetes tend to have relatively higher levels of organic pollutants , such as PCBs , in their blood .
In comments to Reuters Health , Guo said that since “ everyone ” has detectable PCB levels in his or her body , it ’s possible that exposure to such pollutants has helped feed the widespread rise in diabetes in recent decades .
“ The public health implication of these findings can be huge , ” Guo added , “ considering the burden of diabetes and its multiple long - term complications . ”

I doubled the avocado filling but kept the amount of crab the same , and I was still able to make about 35 of these little guys .
I put a cilantro leaf in the bottom of each wonton cup to help prevent them from getting soggy as they sat out , and that seemed to work like a charm .

They were delicious and I will definitely , definitely be making them again .
Light from distant quasars — early galaxies that shine with tremendous brightness — has given researchers a new clue to the origin of vast magnetic fields studding today 's galaxies :
They were running strong when the universe was only a third of its present age .
Astronomers had observed that radio emissions from quasars tend to be angled , or polarized , in such a way that powerful magnetic fields must have twisted them .
The greater their distance from Earth , the more polarized their light .
But researchers did n't know whether the magnetic fields were part of the quasar or were present in galaxies encountered by quasar light as it made its journey to our telescopes .
So a team led by astronomers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH Zurich ) scanned more than 70 of those quasars using the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile to look for signs of galaxies hiding in front of the quasars .
Specifically , they checked for a feature called the magnesium ( II ) absorption line , a reduction in the intensity of light of a certain wavelength , which is a commonly used indicator that gas from a star - forming galaxy has soaked up that light .
The researchers report today in Nature that light from quasars showing the magnesium ( II ) line was more strongly polarized than light from other quasars in the sample .
The interpretation : light did indeed pass through regular galaxies and that it likely acquired its polarization in the process .
They estimated the age of the magnetic galaxies by measuring the red shift of the absorption line — the observed reddening of light that occurs when galaxies move rapidly apart .
The typical red shift of the inferred galaxies corresponded to an age of 5.2 billion years , study author Francesco Miniati says .
Precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background peg today 's universe at 13.7 billion years old .
Miniati says the earliest galaxies did not have magnetic fields .
But somehow they became commonplace , perhaps as a result of violent events in quasars that seeded other galaxies with tiny but strong magnetic fields .
Researchers speculate that turbulent matter expanded and strengthened the magnetic fields by pulling them like taffy .
" What these observations tell us is that this stretching process took place very rapidly , " says Ellen Zweibel , an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison .
She says that incorporating those fields into computer models of star formation might help solve the puzzle of why stars that formed in the past five billion years or so were typically about the size of the sun — smaller than earlier ones .
Galactic magnetic fields are thought to influence the size of stars by making them spin slower .
The observations " tell us that magnetic fields really were there in these early times , " she says , " and you have to include them in the models . "
Below are excerpts from an email which I sent to selected councillors in advance of them receiving the report of an internal review into Cambridge City Council ’s use of its powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act .
Cllrs Nimmo- Smith , Ward and Herbert ,
Cambridge City Council ’s internal review of the Council ’s use of powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) is due to be presented to councillors at the at the Strategy & Resources Scrutiny Committee , which you are members of , at 17.00 on Monday the 1st of September .
The report claims to include a summary of the council ’s use of directed surveillance .
However the deployment of cameras to cover the river bank at Jesus Green during April and May 2008 is not included in the list .
It is my opinion that this deployment was to monitor a small group of individuals , namely the independent punters who were operating from the Jesus Green river bank .
These cameras were poking though small holes in the wooden bowling pavilion on the green and were behind wire mesh .
In my opinion they were not highly visible and the area they covered was not clearly signed , though signage was improved during the period of the deployment .
I accept it is a grey area as to if these cameras were covert or not , but believe that according to both the council ’s code of practice on CCTV usage and the RIPA , authorisation for their deployment was required .
I was told by Alastair Roberts , Safer Communities Section Manager at the City Council , that with respect to these cameras that “ the collection of data is subject to the same rules as those that apply to any Council owned CCTV installation . ”
However Cambridge City Council ’s Re-Deployable ( Mobile ) CCTV Cameras Deployment Guidelines ( RCCTV ) state :
“ If a known individual (s ) is the target this becomes ‘ Direct Surveillance ’ and the deployment will additionally have to be authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 . ”
This internal review shows that this authorisation was not given with respect to the deployment of cameras on Jesus Green to monitor independent punters .
I also note that this current review has a different interpretation of the RIPA to the RCCTV deployment guidelines .
The review states only covert directed surveillance requires RIPA authorisation , whereas the RCCTV deployment guidelines state direct surveillance , covert or not , requires authorisation .
[...]
It appears that some sections of the City Council are deploying CCTV cameras in contravention of the City Council ’s code of practice on CCTV usage .
The occurrence at Jesus Green draws attention to a flaw in this report in that it only reports deployments which council officers have determined require authorisation under RIPA .
Those deployments where officers determined RIPA authorisation was not required are ignored , it is those which are just on the ‘ authorisation not required ’ side of the line which in my view are most in need of the scrutiny of councillors .
As all instances where council officers believe “ RIPA did not apply ” are excluded from the internal review there does not appear to have been any chance of the review uncovering incidences where an incorrect judgement has been made by officers .
In my opinion the monitoring of independent punters on Jesus Green was just the sort of case , where the proportionality of CCTV deployment is controversial and questionable which ought to have be reviewed .
I wrote to the council asking that the deployment at Jesus Green be included in this review on the 14th of July 2008 .
My request has clearly been ignored by those conducting the review .
The report does not identify the terms of reference of the review or the methodology followed , these omissions make it hard to judge its credibility .
I note this scrutiny meeting has not specifically invited evidence from the public as Sir Simon Milton ’s letter suggested , though I am aware there are arrangements for members of the public to speak at many of Cambridge City Council ’s meetings including this one .
I urge you to condemn the report ’s omission of the deployment of cameras at Jesus Green , and to demand consistent , legally compliant , policies and practices on CCTV deployment across all council departments .

US government to bail out Wall Street
By Barry Grey
20 September 2008
The Bush administration on Friday announced plans for a massive and unprecedented federal bailout of the US banking system .
In separate appearances Friday morning , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President Bush announced a series of measures to shore up collapsing financial markets and called on Congress to pass legislation next week to use , in Paulson ’s words , “ hundreds of billions ” of taxpayer dollars to buy virtually worthless mortgage - backed assets that cannot be sold on the market from banks and other financial institutions .
Paulson said he would meet over the weekend with congressional leaders to lay out the details of the government plan .
With this plan , the full cost of the immense debts piled up by the banks will be imposed on the American people .
It will shift the banks ’ liabilities onto the federal government , sharply increasing government budget deficits and the US debt , a process that can only further erode the creditworthiness of the United States and place a bigger question mark on the value of the US dollar .
In the past week alone , the US Treasury has announced cash injections into the Federal Reserve Board of $ 200 billion to bolster the sagging balance sheet of the central bank , which has already expended hundreds of billions in loans and subsidies to the major Wall Street banks and put out another $ 85 billion in the takeover this week of the insurance giant American International Group .
The presidential candidates of both major parties , Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Barack Obama , quickly signaled their support for the wholesale bailout of the banks and big investors , and prominent congressional Democrats issued assurances that they would obey the demands of Paulson , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and Bush and pass the required legislation by the end of next week .
The immediate line - up of both parties and the media behind the bailout plan for Wall Street stands in the starkest contrast to their indifference and inaction in regard to the plight of millions of American working people , who face a rising tide of home foreclosures , layoffs and sinking living standards .
When it comes to the social needs of the people , the universal cry from corporate America and the two parties is , “ There is no money , ” but when the fortunes of the financial elite are threatened , the full power of the government and unlimited resources are marshaled virtually at a moment ’s notice .
There was no suggestion in the statements of Bush and Paulson of any relief for the working class — nothing to stop home foreclosures or help those who have already lost their homes .
Rather , hundreds of billions — and more likely trillions — of dollars in public funds will be used to prop up the banks .
The resulting bankrupting of the government will be used to justify a brutal assault on what remains of social programs , including Medicaid , Medicare and Social Security , and demand even greater financial “ sacrifices ” from workers , whether the next administration is headed by Obama or McCain .
Nothing could more clearly demonstrate that behind the façade of American democracy there stands a dictatorship of big business .
Paulson made his announcement following a meeting Thursday night , with Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox also in attendance , along with congressional leaders from both parties .
At the meeting , Paulson warned that the US and global financial system was on the brink of collapse and outlined in general terms the plan to set up some form of government agency to take “ illiquid ” mortgage - backed securities off of the balance sheets of the banks .
News of the plan first broke Thursday afternoon , at a point when a massive injection of liquidity by the Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe , Canada and Japan had failed to unfreeze credit markets that had collapsed over the previous days .
The Fed loaned $ 180 billion to the other central banks and then added another $ 120 billion in an attempt to get banks to lend to one another and to other companies , under conditions where confidence in the financial markets and major institutions had fallen so sharply that credit markets had ceased to function .
But instead of lending the fresh money to other companies , the big banks were hoarding it to protect themselves against possible default .
The breakdown in the world capitalist system — widely acknowledged to be the worst crisis since the 1929 stock market crash and heading toward another Great Depression — came in the wake of the US government takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac less than two weeks ago and the collapse this week of Wall Street icons Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch , followed on Tuesday by the US takeover of American International Group .
In the aftermath of these developments , other major US banks had come under immense pressure and were facing bankruptcy , including the investment bank Morgan Stanley and the savings and loan giant Washington Mutual .
Both were scrambling to find buyers as their share prices plummeted .
The domino effect of falling banks was threatening the biggest US investment bank , Goldman Sachs , headed by Paulson prior to his becoming treasury secretary , whose stock had suffered enormous losses in the course of the week .
The crisis reached the tipping point on Tuesday and Wednesday when major US money market funds announced losses and some were forced to close .
This sparked a growing run on the funds , with $ 78.7 billion withdrawn from the largest funds on Wednesday and , according to one industry estimate , a total of $ 145.3 billion over a two - day period .
Money market funds are considered the safest form of investment , and tens of millions of Americans have their savings in them .
More immediately , from the standpoint of Wall Street , the funds pump money into credit markets by buying short - term IOUs issued by banks and companies , called “ commercial paper . ”
The growing crisis of the money market funds threatened to collapse the commercial paper market , precipitating a chain reaction of defaults and bankruptcies across the economy .
“ It ’s the ultimate nightmare to have a run on the money markets — that is truly Armageddon — and they ’re not going to allow that to happen , ” said Paul McCulley at Pacific Investment Management Co .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had already lost nearly 800 points in the first three trading days of the week , and by Thursday afternoon a rally sparked by the coordinated action of the Fed and other central banks that morning was faltering .
At about 3 PM news broke of the government ’s plan for a bailout of the banks , the floor of the New York Stock Exchange erupted in cheers , and the market immediately reversed itself and rocketed upward in a frenzy of buying .
In the final hour of trading , the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped most of Wednesday ’s 449 - point loss , rising 410.03 points in the biggest percentage gain in almost six years .
From its midday low to its late - afternoon high , shortly before the finish , the Dow swung 617 points .
The biggest winners were the financial stocks , including Morgan Stanley and Washington Mutual , which lurched from heavy losses to big gains .
On Friday morning , the government announced a series of immediate measures to bail out the markets , including a temporary ban on short - selling ( betting on a fall in prices ) of financial stocks and a $ 50 billion government program to insure money market funds .
The Treasury Department also announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , now under government ownership , would increase their purchases of mortgage - backed securities and the Treasury would directly buy up a larger number of such assets .
The Fed added that it would extend low - cost loans to the banks to unfreeze the commercial paper market .
These moves and the statements of Paulson and Bush set off another orgy of buying on the stock exchange , with the Dow closing up 368.75 for the day .
In his statement , Paulson said “ comprehensive ” action was needed “ to address the root cause of our financial system stresses .
The underlying weakness in our financial system today is illiquid mortgage assets that have lost value as the housing correction has proceeded . ”
This is a lie .
The root cause of the crisis is the unbridled parasitism of American capitalism , which over a period of decades has dismantled huge sections of industry in order to reap super profits for the rich by means of financial speculation and fraud , based on a colossal buildup of debt .
Now the bill is being passed to the American people .
Bush , flanked by Paulson , Bernanke and Cox , called for a government bailout of Wall Street in the name of “ our system of free enterprise . ”
“ There will be ample opportunity to debate the origins of this problem , ” he said .
“ Now is the time to solve it . ”
There will , in fact , be no debate or discussion .
Nobody will be held accountable for the greatest financial scandal in world history .
There will be no penalties .
No one who made tens and hundreds of millions from the plundering of America will be forced to give back a dime .
All of the financial resources of the United States are being placed at the disposal of Wall Street and every American citizen , without being asked , is being given the responsibility for covering the debts of the richest people in the country .
Certainly no debate or resistance will come from the supposed political opposition — the Democratic Party .
Speaking Friday in Miami , Obama said he fully supported the bailout plan .
“ John McCain and I can continue to argue about our different economic agendas for next year , but we should come together now to work on what this country urgently needs this year , ” he said .
Obama is no less bound to Wall Street than his Republican opponent .
In fact , he has received more campaign money from the financial industry — $ 22.5 million — than McCain , who has taken in $ 19.6 million .
Democratic congressional leaders lined up Friday to back the administration plan .
New York Senator Charles Schumer , who chairs the Joint Economic Committee , said he was optimistic that Congress could approve the package in a week .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts , said his panel could hold a vote on the package as soon as Wednesday .
“ They said they would like legislation to do it , and there was virtually unanimous agreement that there would be legislation to do it , ” said Frank .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives , added , “ We hope to move very quickly — time is of the essence . ”
All of those involved in pushing through this scheme to funnel the entire wealth of the country into the coffers of the financial elite have direct financial stakes in the outcome .
Paulson made hundreds of millions of dollars as chairman of Goldman Sachs .
Pelosi reportedly has major investments in American International Group .
Many of the congressional leaders of both parties are themselves multi-millionaires and rely on handouts from big business to get elected .
They are all ruled by personal interests that reflect the interest of the American ruling class .
The result of the government moves announced Thursday and Friday has already been to not only cover the debts of the super - rich , but to expand their stock portfolios and bank accounts by millions more through the run-up of share prices .
A flat - tailed house gecko skydiving in a wind tunnel , showing how geckos are able to glide and maneuver in midair using their large tails .
For a long time , biologists thought a main function of geckos ' tails was to store fat , but a new study gives that couch - potato image a makeover .
In fact , the tail plays an active role in the gecko's amazing ability to climb — for which their sticky feet usually get all the credit — as well as to fall safely .
Ardian Jusufi , his graduate advisor Robert J. Full , and two colleagues , all at the University of California , Berkeley , videotaped flat - tailed house geckos ascending a vertical wall .
The team observed that when the lizards ' front feet hit a slippery patch and lost their grip , the animals instantly tapped their tails to the wall to keep from pitching backwards .
If a tap was n't enough , they pressed their tails against the wall , like kickstands .
Tailless individuals had much less success traversing the slick spot than intact animals .
( Geckos can jettison their tails when snagged by a predator . )
The researchers also observed gecko tail action in the air : they either dropped the lizards from an upside - down position , or set them afloat in a wind tunnel .
By actively rotating their tails , turned - over geckos took just one - tenth of a second to roll right side up — the fastest air - righting response ever reported for an animal without wings .
Again , intact geckos outperformed tailless ones .
After self - righting , the geckos calmly glided belly first in a typical skydiving posture , moving their tails to control their direction and angle of descent into a safe landing .
Fat storage , my tail !
The research was detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Scientists Create Device to Remove Carbon Directly from the Air
September 29th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
Scientists from the University of Calgary in Canada have created a method to efficiently capture carbon dioxide directly from the air around us .
The device , which is built on near - commercial technology , was built by Uof C climate change scientists David Keith and his team .
“ At first thought , capturing CO2 from the air where it ’s at a concentration of 0.04 per cent seems absurd , when we are just starting to do cost - effective capture at power plants where CO2 produced is at a concentration of more than 10 per cent , ” says Keith , Canada Research Chair in Energy and Environment .
“ But the thermodynamics suggests that air capture might only be a bit harder than capturing CO2 from power plants .
We are trying to turn that theory into engineering reality . ”
Technology for reducing the levels of carbon dioxide have advanced in the last 18 months , focusing on capturing carbon directly from the production and immediately burying it .
Keith ’s device , however , does not require any proximity to the production of the harmful greenhouse gasses .
This technology is especially helpful in the removal of emissions made by transportation sources , such as airplanes and cars .
Director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy , Environment and Economy ’s ( ISEEE ) Energy and Environmental Systems Group and a professor of chemical and petroleum engineering , Keith is heralded by his peers as a scientist looking to the future .
“ While it ’s important to get started doing things we know how to do , like wind power nuclear power and ‘ regular ’ carbon capture and storage , it ’s also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem . ”
“ David Keith ’s vision and originality are key factors in our ranking this year as the top engineering school in Canada for sustainability initiatives , both in terms of research and curriculum , ” says Elizabeth Cannon , Dean of the Schulich School of Engineering .
“ Leaders like this are not commonplace , and we are proud to get behind this kind of leadership at the Schulich School . ”
Keith explains just how this technology could be used by companies across the globe : “ A company could , in principle , contract with an oilsands plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it ’s cheapest – China , for example – and the same amount of CO2 would be removed . ”
In a recent test , Keith and his team demonstrated that they could capture CO2 directly from the air , using less than 100 kilowatt - hours of electricity , and capture the equivalent of about 20 tons per year of CO2 on a single square meter of scrubbing material .
“ This means that if you used electricity from a coal - fired power plant , for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine , you ’d be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity , ” Keith says .
And though this technology is in its early stages , and relatively expensive – despite being comparable to carbon capture and storage technologies – the relative simplicity of the device and scalable technology will see the technology flourish over the next few years with commercial input .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In his celebrated 1837 Phi Beta Kappa Oration at Harvard , titled “ The American Scholar , ” Ralph Waldo Emerson predicted that a day would come when America would end what he called “ our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands . ”
His prediction came true in the twentieth century , and in no area of learning more so than in science .
This surely would have pleased Emerson .
When he listed his heroes he would generally include Copernicus and Galileo and Newton along with Socrates and Jesus and Swedenborg .
But I think that Emerson would have had mixed feelings about one consequence of the advance of science here and abroad — that it has led to a widespread weakening of religious belief .
1
Emerson was hardly orthodox — according to Herman Melville , he felt “ that had he lived in those days when the world was made , he might have offered some valuable suggestions ” — but he was for a while a Unitarian minister , and he usually found it possible to speak favorably of the Almighty .
Emerson grieved over what he saw in his own time as a weakening of belief , as opposed to mere piety and churchgoing , in America and even more so in England , though I ca n’t say that he attributed it to the advance of science .
The idea of a conflict between science and religion has a long pedigree .
According to Edward Gibbon , it was the view of the Byzantine church that “ the study of nature was the surest symptom of an unbelieving mind . ”
Perhaps the best - known portrayal of this conflict is a book published in 1896 by Cornell ’s first president , Andrew Dickson White , with the titleA History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom .
In recent times there has been a reaction against talk of warfare between science and religion .
White ’s “ conflict thesis ” was attacked in a 1986 paper by Bruce Lindberg and Ronald Numbers , both well - known historians of science , who pointed out many flaws in White ’s scholarship .
The Templeton Foundation offers a large prize to those who argue that there is no conflict between science and religion .
Some scientists take this line because they want to protect science education from religious fundamentalists .
Stephen Jay Gould argued that there could be no conflict between science and religion , because science deals only with facts and religion only with values .
This certainly was not the view held in the past by most adherents of religion , and it is a sign of the decay of belief in the supernatural that many today who call themselves religious would agree with Gould .
Let ’s grant that science and religion are not incompatible — there are after all some ( though not many ) excellent scientists , like Charles Townes and Francis Collins , who have strong religious beliefs .
Still , I think that between science and religion there is , if not an incompatibility , at least what the philosopher Susan Haack has called a tension , that has been gradually weakening serious …
Clinton frees delegates , Obama roll call next The Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This DENVER - Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton released her remaining convention delegates on Wednesday as Democrats were poised to formally deliver the party 's presidential nomination to Barack Obama , making him the first black nominee of a major party .
As many in the room yelled , " No , " Clinton said that , while she was releasing the delegates she had won in the primaries , " I am not telling you what to do .
You 've come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do . "
Suspense still remained over the voting process  and whether and when a planned roll - call vote would be cut off to give Obama the nomination by acclamation .
Obama planned a mid-afternoon arrival in the convention city after campaigning in Montana .
Meanwhile , former President Clinton , who was a prime - time Wednesday headliner along with Obama running mate Joe Biden , planned to make a forceful endorsement of the man who forced his wife out of the race and to make the case that Obama is ready to confront any domestic , international or national security challenge , said an aide .
Bill Clinton will say in a roughly eight - minute speech that only a Democrat in the White House can " restore America 's standing to what it was eight years ago , " said the aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to pre-empt the former president 's speech .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , presiding officer of the Democratic National Convention , predicted the roll - call voting after the names of both Obama and Clinton were put in nomination would go " very smoothly . "
" Are you ready for victory ?
Then you must be ready for unity .
That is the only way we are going to win and have this victory , " she told Iowa 's convention delegates .
Many details remained unknown , however , including how many states would vote before somebody  probably Clinton herself  asked the delegates to give the nomination to Obama by acclamation .
Clinton won 18 million votes in primary - season contests but failed to earn her party 's nomination .
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , who had been a Clinton supporter , suggested in an interview with The Associated Press that some delegates would vote for Clinton no matter what she said , and that any motion to move to an unanimous convention ballot would draw " a few no's . "
Obama will give his acceptance speech on Thursday to as many as 75,000 people at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium .
Then , on Friday , Obama , his wife Michelle and running mate Joe Biden and his wife Jill will embark on a three - day bus tour of battleground states Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan .
Representatives of the Clinton and Obama teams struck a deal setting ground rules for the roll call vote that will hand the nomination to Obama but will also allow Clinton supporters to express their support for her .
Advisers to Clinton and Obama sent a joint letter to state delegation chairs instructing them to distribute vote tally sheets to delegates Wednesday and return them before the vote got under way .
The letter , first obtained Tuesday night by The Associated Press , said Clinton would have one nominating speech and two seconding speeches , followed by Obama 's nominating speech and three seconding speeches  totaling no more than 15 minutes for each candidate .
Then the roll call would begin , said the letter signed by Obama senior adviser Jeff Berman , Clinton senior adviser Craig Smith and convention secretary Alice Germond .
Kathleen Krehbiel , an Iowa delegate who had supported Clinton , credited the New York senator 's convention speech Tuesday night for finally persuading her to cross the line and vote for Obama .
" My horse is out of the race .
I 'm getting out to work for Obama , " Krehbiel said .
But , she added , " I think there are a few delegates who need to vote for Hillary to reach that point of closure . "
In a sign of unity , Obama adviser Berman and Clinton adviser Smith told delegates on Wednesday that they had been working out of the same office all week to ensure a smooth convention .
" The story is that we are working as a team , " Berman said .
Anticipating Wednesday night 's focus on national security at the convention , Republican John McCain contended in a new TV ad that Obama showed he was " dangerously unprepared " for the White House when he described Iran as a " tiny " nation that did n't pose a serious threat .
" Iran . Radical Islamic government .
Known sponsors of terrorism .
Developing nuclear capabilities to ' generate power ' but threatening to eliminate Israel , " says the ad , which was being run in key states .
" Terrorism , destroying Israel  those are n't ' serious threats ' " ?
Missing from the ad was the context of Obama 's remarks last May in which he compared Iran and other adversarial governments to the superpower Soviet Union .
" They do n't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us , " he said in arguing for talks with Iran .
" You know , Iran , they spend one - 100th of what we spend on the military .
If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us , they would n't stand a chance . "
Such measures , however , are undercut by high turnover among employees , who are paid little better than minimum wage , former executives say .
Mr. Hrouda said there was no plan to address high turnover .
“ We think we ’re able to recruit people at the wages we pay and are good at training them , ” he said .
The F.D.A. , however , sees the main problem differently .
“ Size is no longer an excuse , ” said Mr. Blumberg , the agency ’s deputy general counsel .
Ms. Malarkey , of the F.D.A. ’s Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality , said : “ Right now , the biggest issue confronting the Red Cross is what we refer to as their problem management .
They have standard operating procedures by which they should be able to investigate , evaluate , correct and control to prevent recurrence of the issues we have identified again and again , but they have a lot of difficulty implementing those procedures and , frankly , in having people follow them . ”
Ms. Malarkey said a recent “ adverse determination letter , ” the process through which the F.D.A. informs the Red Cross of violations it has identified and demands payment of fines , illustrated her point .
In that letter , dated Feb. 8 , the drug agency listed 113 “ events ” involving 4,094 flawed blood components that were recalled by 15 of the Red Cross ’s 36 regions .
The recalls occurred largely from April 15 , 2003 , to April 15 , 2006 .
( It is not uncommon for letters to list hundreds of infractions  one 2005 letter identified more than 22,000 flawed blood components that were recalled  and recalls do not mean every blood product is returned . )
“ We are not seeing what we were seeing in the late 1980s and early 1990s , where unsuitable blood was routinely being released , ” Ms. Malarkey said , “ but they still need to make more progress , and we would like to see that progress made quickly . ”
@ SirDrinksalot : Epic
Fail at commenting on a comment that was made earlier in the post .
And so fucking what ... it was news to me , check your ego and obsessive compulsive behavior at the door .
Now where is the disemvowelator when you need it
TRADITIONAL bakery exhibitions are at risk of being consigned to history thanks to a new European directive .
New EU regulations have banned the consumption of cakes and confectionary entered at country fairs and agricultural shows immediately after baking competitions .
The chairman of Mayo County Council , Cllr Joe Mellett , said the new rules were the “ death knell ” for the Irish agricultural show .
“ When you see things like this it ’s no wonder the people voted No to the Lisbon Treaty .
This will be the end of the traditional baking competition at local shows across the country , therefore impacting on local revenue .
It ’s just ridiculous . ”
Under the rules adjudicators of bakery sections in local shows are only permitted to taste the traditional favourites such as apple tarts or cheese cakes .
Once the judging is over , the produce must be immediately destroyed .
As a result , only bite - sized versions of the cakes will be entered in shows .
The directive has already been made law in Scotland .
Mr Mellett , one of the founding members of his own local agricultural show in Swinford , said he “ could not believe ” the latest EU directive .
“ Honestly , when I saw this first I thought it was something to do with April Fools ’ Day .
I just could n’t imagine someone sitting down and coming up with this rule .
“ It is a real deterrent to those entering shows .
If you thought your prize produce was going to be destroyed immediately after a tiny taste was taken from it , then you would not want to enter a competition . ”
He added : “ Local people are doing their best to continue on traditions , particularly in places like the west of Ireland , and this is what they are met with . ”
Unbeknownst to the American people who are besieged with a fear and trembling over the falling stock market , the sub - prime credit crisis , the flooding in the Midwest , and the all - time oil , gas and food prices , a much greater , more enduring and lasting evil is taking over the country through new regulations proposed by the U.S. Treasury Department .
To give you a better understanding of the BIG picture , we will address it in three segments : ( 1 ) " America Seized with Fear and Trembling -- Again " ( 2 ) " The Final Globalization of the U.S. Banking System by the Federal Reserve , " and ( 3 ) " How to Survive in a World Without Safety Nets . "
While covering global meetings I have observed over and over again that most of the " problems , " which arise , are often part of the agenda of whatever global meeting is being held at the time .
During the past twelve months , beginning specifically the end of July , 2007 , I started to understand that the sub - prime crisis had another side to it - the globalization our entire financial structure .
To understand what is at stake , we 'll review first the changes to our Republic .
The first major change came in 1913 with the establishment of a new central bank ; a private corporation we call the Federal Reserve , setup to control the financial , economic and monetary system of the United States , and run by a group of powerful financial opportunists .
( It was Andrew Jackson who shutdown the second of the two original central banks , approved with limited charters by our Founding Fathers . )
This is why we , the American people , cannot forgive ourselves the interest on our current the debt .
We do not owe it to ourselves , but rather to our privately - owned Federal Reserve Corporation .
Since its inception , the Federal Reserve charter has been amended more than 195 times , which included the passage of HR12 , " The Banking Modernization Act . "
According to the March 31 , 2008 " Treasury Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure , " the Fed is about to seize its final empowerment over the rest of the American banking and financial system .
While the Blueprint states it will take years for all of this legislation to be put in place , Paulson gave a speech on June 19 to Women in Housing and Finance in which he stated , " [ W ]e must dramatically expand our attention to the fundamental needs of our system , and move much more quickly to update [ the outdated nature of our financial regulatory ] system . "
Once this is finalized , the Congress of the United States of America become useless because their main purpose since 1913 has been to surrender to the Federal Reserve more and more powers over our economic and financial structure .
In other words , what we are witnessing a complete take over of our economy by a private corporation !
The second series of major changes is called " globalization " .
This is the tearing down of barriers between the nation - states .
When Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush along with England 's Prime Ministers Tony Blair and the current Prime Minister Gordon Brown , refer to " interdependence " they are speaking of the fact that there are no more economic , political , legal , trade , military , or intelligence barriers separating the nation - states .
In 1944 , a post - World War II economic conference was held in New Hampshire .
" Bretton Woods " , dubbed after the conference hotel , birthed the first two international pieces , which now comprise an international / global world - government structure : the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
Today on a regular basis , all the treasury secretaries of the world meet to resolve how to change their nation 's financial and economic laws to meld into an ever evolving international financial and economic world .
In 1945 , the United Nations was founded in San Francisco .
Today , all the foreign ministers of the UN meet to " keep the peace . "
That is so laughable considering the fact that the UN is ready to sign off on its biggest peacekeeping budget , $ 7.3B , in their history .
There are more wars now globally than at any other time in the history of the UN .
They have failed miserably at keeping the peace .
Primarily because there are those who only want the WHOLE PIECE and not PEACE as we think of it .
The U.S. should not only withdraw from the United Nations but all of the related UN organizations .
It should also be remembered that the Commonwealth of Nations , a special league of nations which pledge allegiance to the Queen of England operate within the UN and have the potential of 54 votes to our ONE vote .
As the trade barriers fell in 1994 it changed the entire structure of the world .
No longer could the average American compete with his neighboring farmer , manufacturer , architect , or technician , but now would compete with ALL counterparts worldwide .
The globalized workplace has affected many American industry workers .
We cannot , with our higher standard of living , compete with the Chinese slave laborers .
Buying cheaper cannot be better when it destroys the very backbone of the American dream .
In 1998 , the foreign ministers of the world approved an International Criminal Court .
For the first time since the Roman Empire , a global body now has the right to transcend national sovereignty in order to search , seize , arrest and deport an alleged international criminal .
What else can I say ?
We are all terrorists until proven innocent .
In 2001 , the final barriers between the nation - states came down when alleged terrorists attacked the World Trade Towers in New York City .
My extensive research revealed very simply that if all the other barriers between states had already fallen , then the two most sensitive barriers still remaining had to be erased : the military and intelligence barriers .
Currently we have two global militaries : the U.S. " Coalition of the Willing " and 90,000 United Nations peacekeepers .
In regard to the UN , when they need more supplies , i.e. , food , uniforms , guns , ammunition , tents , planes , boats , etc. , they basically call on the countries of the world to ante up .
Britain might supply uniforms while the U.S. provides military transport planes .
In regard to the intelligence barriers , beginning as early at 1996 , the G8 countries were working to establish a global intelligence gathering room where the CIA , Britain 's MI6 , Russia 's KGB and other G8 intelligence agencies would work together to help maintain world peace and to track international terrorism .
Today it is fully functional .
The various barriers , which once protected the citizens of each respective country , vanished as the IMF / World Bank , United Nations , World Trade Organization , International Criminal Court , etc. were set in place above the nation - state .
Today and with the handover of the remaining parts of our financial structure by Congress , there are no safety nets to protect us .
In other words , the big powerful money lords who rule the world - people like George Soros , the Rockefellers , European royal families , and the most powerful banking families­will be able to operate without impunity while the average American will be rendered helpless .
Our Constitution will become nothing more than a piece of worthless paper because the power of Congress will be eliminated with the final sell - out of our economic system .
Without national barriers to protect us , America is now part of a " level landscape . "
As a result , when the powerful sell their investment positions , they can take their gains all at once , globally , instead of country by country .
Lastly , the fear and trembling is used as a tool to force people into change .
The fear is created through a constant stream of negativity and used as a process .
First the situation is created ( Sept. 11 ) and then solved so that people think they are safe ( Anti- terrorist Bill ) when in fact , the wool has just been pulled over their eyes .
Fear and trembling can also be associated with " creative destruction . "
Our once great country , way of life , livelihood and future is being destroyed before our very eyes .
We have a choice : to operate in fear or turn to faith .

What 's wrong w / this picture : Gore - Lieberman 2000 ? / Lieberman supports McCain 2008 ?
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/12/16/lieberman-to-support-mccain/
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) - Sen. Joe Lieberman , a Democrat turned Independent , will endorse Republican Sen. John McCain for president , officials close to both Lieberman and McCain familiar with the plan tell CNN .
Lieberman is planning to announce his support for McCain at an early Monday morning event in New Hampshire , but the campaign is keeping a close eye on a winter storm that could force it to be rescheduled .
The McCain campaign declined to comment on the source 's account , and would not confirm it .
An aide to Lieberman tells CNN he decided to endorse McCain because he considers him " the most capable to be commander in chief on day one of his administration , and the most capable of uniting the country so that we can prevail against Islamic extremism . "
The Lieberman aide insists the senator does not see this as a " commentary on or an endorsement of the Republican party , only the person . "
Lieberman had not planned to endorse anyone until after the primary season , but McCain asked Lieberman for his endorsement a few days after the two men returned from a Thanksgiving trip to Iraq together , and Lieberman decided to do it , according to the same Lieberman aide .
Lieberman will continue to caucus with the Democrats .
Like McCain , Lieberman has been a vocal supporter of the Iraq war .
For Lieberman , it is an issue that caused him to split with his own political party after losing the Democratic Senate primary in 2006 .
Lieberman refused to back down , and won reelection as an Independent .
Lieberman was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2000 .
Lieberman 's Democratic colleagues welcomed him back to the Senate , and he is the 51st vote that gives Democrats a razor thin majority in the 100 member chamber .
Lieberman chairs the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee , and he still attends weekly Democratic strategy meetings .
" I have the greatest respect for Joe , but I simply have to disagree with his decision to endorse Senator McCain , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement to CNN .
Lieberman 's office called Reid 's office Sunday to inform the Democratic leader of his decision to endorse a Republican .
A longtime Lieberman adviser described it as a " hangover " from the 2006 campaign when Democrats , including Connecticut Sen.
Chris Dodd , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , and other longtime friends declared they could and would not support his reelection bid after he lost the primary .
Instead , they backed the Democratic nominee Ned Lamont .
This endorsement could help emphasize McCain 's national security standing , show he is able to work across party lines , and perhaps help persuade independent voters in New Hampshire to support his presidential bid .

The Rev. Jesse Jackson last night headlined a panel that encouraged people to battle voter fraud and disenfranchisement by casting early ballots and registering multiple times to vote .
Jackson , founder and president of the Rainbow / PUSH Coalition and a presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988 , was joined by investigative journalist Greg Palast and author Jonathan Simon at the Maryland Institute College of Art .
The discussion was moderated by radio host Marc Steiner .
All panelists criticized what they said were rigged presidential elections in 2000 and 2004 .
“ I would urge you not to allow these voter schemes to break our spirit , ” Jackson said .
“ In spite of these schemes , we can still win . ”
Jackson shied away from offering opinions about presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain , instead focusing much of the two - hour discussion on the origins of minority voting and encouraging attendees to fight election fraud .
Although Jackson has endorsed Obama , he issued an apology to the Illinois senator in July after a Fox News microphone picked up private comments Jackson made to another guest in which he said Obama talks down to black people .
Last night 's talk contained no such rhetoric , with Jackson saying Obama is the beneficiary of decades of struggles for minority rights to vote .
“ Barack is running the last lap of a 54 - year race , ” Jackson said .
“ He is the anchor leg of that race . ”
Palast has reported extensively on the two previous presidential elections , and told the audience that nearly 100,000 potential black voters were removed from the rolls in Florida in 2000 .
He added that ensuing elections saw ex-convicts disenfranchised throughout the country .
Palast estimated about 3 million votes were cast and not counted in 2004 .
“ We 're not in this to save Democratic candidates , ” Palast said .
“ We 're in this to save something very important , and that 's democracy . ”
Simon is the co-founder of the Election Defense Alliance , a national coordinating body for citizen electoral integrity groups and individuals .

Peggy had a taste for John Smiths beer and pickled onion crisps
A Tyneside pub has called time on one of its regular visitors after the premises were refurbished .
Peggy , a 13 - year - old mare , used to enjoy a pint of beer and a packet of crisps alongside her owner at the Alexandra Hotel in Jarrow .
However , she is no longer allowed to prop up the bar following a refit which included new carpets .
The horse still accompanies her owner , Peter Dolan , on his trip to the pub but has to stay tethered outside .
Landlady Jackie Gray said : " Although she is probably cleaner than some of my customers , I had to put my foot down and show her the door . "
Mr Dolan , a 62 - year - old retired oil rigger , said : " People come into the pub and the first thing they say is ' Where 's Peggy ? '
" I tell them she 's kicked the habit and is teetotal now . "

All eyes were on the House of Representatives today , as the leadership in both parties tried to rally enough votes to pass the $ 700 billion bailout of the banking sector , but in the end , the bill failed by a vote of 228-205 against , thus possibily dooming both Wall St. and the presidential campaign of John McCain .
Before the vote , Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner emphasized that he did come to Washington to vote for these kinds of bill , but he urged his membership to do what needs done , and vote for the bill .
The Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Rep. Barney Frank said , “ Many of us feel that the national interest requires us to do something which is , in many ways , unpopular .
It is hard to get political credit for avoiding something that has not yet happened . ”
Frank hit the nail on the head .
Opposition to this bill was based on ideology and self - preservation .
The House Republican ideologues were opposed to this bill because it violates their ideology , but also because they are up for reelection this year , and they are terrified that they will go home to campaign , and find that their opponents are running ads against them , and their vote for this bill .

The bill was expected to fly though the Senate , and be signed by President Bush by mid-week .
Politically speaking , this crisis could not have come at a worse time .
The Congress is about to adjourn for the fall to go home and campaign , and the House is even more infused with election year politics than usual .
I think what many people do n’t understand about this crisis is that it started out as a banking and lending crisis , but quickly morphed into an entire market wide crisis of confidence .
Earlier today , John McCain was in Ohio taking credit for making the bailout agreement happen , only to see 133 House Republicans vote against the deal .
Apparently , Sen. McCain is n’t the leader that he claims to be as in the end , he could not get enough House Republicans on board with the plan .
This is a stinging defeat for McCain who painted himself as riding to the rescue of the bailout last week .
The three big losers here are John McCain , Wall Street , and the economy as a whole , because without passage of this bill , nobody knows where the economy is going to go next .
Only 66 Republicans crossed over to join with Democrats and vote for the bill , while 94 Democrats joined with Republicans in voting against it .
Republican
House election year politics won out , over both an economic crisis , and the urging of their own presidential nominee .
In one swoop , House Republicans may have doomed both Wall Street and the presidential campaign of John McCain .
The unemployment rate spiked again in July , to 5.7 percent , its highest level in more than four years and a strong signal that come Election Day millions of Americans will still be hunting for work .
“ We are not seeing a catastrophic collapse in the job market , like you often see in recessions , ” said James Glassman , senior domestic economist for JPMorgan Chase .
“ What we are seeing instead is a steady hemorrhaging of jobs , and that is going to continue until housing stabilizes and stops dragging down the rest of the economy . ”
The nation ’s employers cut their payrolls for the seventh consecutive month , this time by 51,000 jobs , the government reported Friday .
For millions still at work , hours were reduced , a hidden form of unemployment , and the average raise was less than enough to keep up with inflation .
The steady erosion in payrolls  463,000 jobs have disappeared since January  cut across nearly every sector in July .
Teenagers , 16 to 19 , trying to land work , were particularly hard hit .
Their unemployment rate , 20.3 percent , up 2.2 percentage points in just a month , was the highest since 1992 , contributing significantly to the jump in the overall unemployment rate .
That rate jumped from 5.5 percent in June and 5 percent in April .
MediaDefender and parent company ArtistDirect have had some serious setbacks recently .
Last September they suffered a huge security breach when internal emails and a phone call were leaked to BitTorrent .
They received even more bad press recently for DDoSsing Revision3 .
As a result , MediaDefender 's parent company stock dropped from $ 2.00 down to just 16 cents .
Mediadefender has had a rough year , and the future is n’t looking much better .
Last month , MediaDefender lost one of its larger customers .
The business accounted for roughly 18 % of MediaDefender ’s revenues .
In a recent financial statement , the company stated that there is a decrease in interest for their anti-piracy services , and that the results of their p2p - advertising model are also disappointing .
This news led to further decrease in the stock price , which was sitting at an all time low of just 16 cents this Monday .
Surprisingly enough , the company structurally fails to mention the email leak and security breach , which has cost them a significant amount of money .
In September 2007 , disaster struck .
MediaDefender had made many enemies with its anti-p2p activities .
One of them decided to teach the company a lesson by hacking into their systems and leaking their internal emails and closest secrets to the Internet .
The effect on the company and its operations was dramatic .
In an interview with Portfolio , the hacker ( using the pseudonym ‘ Ethan ’ ) explained how things led up to the leak .
Ethan , a polite high - school student who lives with his family , was on his Christmas break when he first gained access to the anti-piracy company ’s servers by exploiting a weakness in their firewall .
This was at the end of 2006 , at a time when business was still good for Media Defender with revenue standing at nearly $ 16 m .
Soon after that Ethan got access to the company ’s email , its networked resources and even its telephone system .
Logging in a handful of times each month through the summer of 2007 , he started to get bored with ‘ Monkey Defenders ’ – his pet name for the anti-piracy outfit .
Deciding to go out with a bang , he and the Media Defender - Defenders gathered thousands of the company ’s internal emails and published them on web .
Last November , MediaDefender said it lost $ 825,000 as a result of the leaked emails , and this amount has probably gone up significantly in the months after that .
Its stock price is falling , and it ’s beginning to look like the company wo n’t recover anytime soon .
The Pirate Bay wished last year that MediaDefender would go bankrupt , and by the looks of it , they might just get what they hoped for …
Attacking Obama at Yad Vashem
The McCain campaign just blasted out a posting on the campaign blog which essentially calls Obama a flip - flopper ... on genocide .
Obama on Genocide Obama today at Yad Vashem : “ Let our children come here and know this history so they can add their voices to proclaim ‘ never again . ’
And may we remember those who perished , not only as victims but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us and who have become symbols of the human spirit . ”
Obama on July 20 , 2007 : Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama said Thursday the United States cannot use its military to solve humanitarian problems and that preventing a potential genocide in Iraq is n’t a good enough reason to keep U.S. forces there .
“ Well , look , if that ’s the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of U.S. forces , then by that argument you would have 300,000 troops in the Congo right now — where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife — which we have n’t done , ” Obama said in an interview with The Associated Press .
The filters do seem to be off over there , for better or worse :
Attacking your rival while he 's visiting a Holocaust memorial , and accusing him of willing complicity in genocide ... well , it 's a way to get some attention .
The AP interview cited is here ; Obama did n't actually use the word genocide , but did seem to suggest it would n't be reason enough to go back into Iraq .
He 's long since walked that back , and his ( current ) website makes it explicit : " He would reserve the right to intervene militarily , with our international partners , to suppress potential genocidal violence within Iraq . "
ALSO : This meeting of snark and genocide reminds me a bit of the RNC 's shot at Obama for getting wrong the name of the concentration camp his uncle helped liberate .
There 's a bit of a gap between the cut - and - paste political frame and the content ; in that case , the RNC fairly quickly walked back its charge that the incident called into question Obama 's " readiness to lead . "
How are things going at the Democratic Party National Convention in Denver this week ?
Are they talking about the fact that the Western world is run by an international financial elite headquartered in London , the financial capitals of mainland Europe ( such as Frankfurt , Hamburg , Amsterdam , Paris , and Milan ) , and , of course , New York City ?
Are they mentioning at their cocktail parties that the financial elite exert control over the world ’s population through the cartels that make up the world ’s producing economies and through the civilian and military bureaucracies who work for the governments that kow - tow to them ?
Of course they know that the most important cartels are those which control energy resources .
And that of these , the commodity of central importance is oil .
But is any of this helping them draw conclusions regarding the doubling of oil prices during the last year or about the largest oil company profits in history ?
Also , they should be drawing the right conclusions from the fact that every private and pubic enterprise operates on the basis of a money economy , though it would be more accurate to call it a credit economy .
This means that whoever controls the issuance of money and credit controls the world .
And the world ’s monetary systems function on the basis of money and credit being introduced into circulation through loans from the banking system , loans for which interest is charged .
So what should that tell them ?
In fact , they should be pointing out to each other and their TV viewers that the charging of interest for the use of money is a chain around the neck of everyone on earth .
Further , that these cumulative interest charges are built into the price of every product that is manufactured or consumed .
And that growth of debt means price increases too .
They should be honest in making it clear that the world is a master - slave society , that the slaves are those who borrow and pay interest , that the masters are those who collect the interest , and that this unjust system has existed in one form or another for thousands of years .
The candidates and delegates are talking about the aspirations of the American people and how everyone should have an opportunity to achieve their dreams .
But if the United States were a free nation , they would also be talking about a financial system that destroys people ’s dreams .
Unfortunately , the highest rung the candidates and delegates have been able to reach on the ladder of modern - day slavery is the need for more jobs — but they fail to note that jobs are not only the means by which people live , but also the instruments for them to pay the heavy burden of interest the masters of finance require .
What they wo n’t say is that the world economy is based on usury , something religions used to consider a crime ( and which Islam still does ) .
Usury is the charging of interest for the use of money .
As the religions backed off from their prohibitions of interest , usury became just excess interest .
But that ’s not what the word really means .
So what have over two centuries of usury done to the United States ?
The best answer ever given to that question was contained in a paper entitled “ Revisiting U.S. Public and Private Debt ” published in January 2005 by Dr. Bob Blain , Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Southern Illinois University .
The paper updated an earlier study by Dr. Blain published for the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) in the International Social Science Journal , November , 1987 , Paris , pages 577-591 .
In his paper , Dr. Blain examined the growth of total public and private debt in the U.S. Total debt includes “ the debts of governments ( federal , state , and local ) , corporations , farmers , home mortgages , and consumer , commercial , and financial debts . ”
In his analysis , Dr. Blain began with data from the Bureau of Economic Analyses of the United States Department of Commerce which covered the years 1916 - 1976 .
After that year the Bureau stopped publishing the data .
The figures showed that from 1916 - 1976 , total U.S. debt grew from $ 82 billion to $ 3,800 billion ( $ 3.8 trillion ) .
But most of that growth was during the last 21 years , from 1955 - 1976 , when it began to grow exponentially .
Dr. Blain wrote , “ The consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work , something that requires debt to increase . ”
Dr. Blain found the answer by researching American history .
He wrote : “ Then I read G.R. Taylor ’s 1950 book , Hamilton and the National Debt , which described the debate over Alexander Hamilton ’s plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money . ”
He continued :
The most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from Georgia , James Jackson , on February 9 , 1790 , in which he predicted that adoption of Hamilton ’s funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt .
Jackson said , ‘ Though our present debt be but a few millions , in the course of a single century it may be multiplied to an extent we dare not think of .
From the very beginning , the U.S. had a monetary system based on borrowing and debt .
First came the thousands of state chartered banks that began operating late in the Revolutionary War period and continued in one form or another until today .
Then there were the two early central banks : the First Bank of the United States ( 1791 - 1811 ) and the Second Bank of the United States ( 1816 - 1836 ) .
Today ’s national banking system began during the Civil War with the National Banking Acts of 1863 - 64 .
Then there is the system we are living under today , the Federal Reserve , chartered by Congress in 1913 .
Even during the times when the government has sold its debt directly to the public , as with war bonds , savings bonds , and Treasury notes and bills , that too has been money borrowed at interest .
Although there have been times in history when money entered into circulation other than through debt , such as with coinage and the Civil War greenbacks , those were exceptions and today are of little importance .
Dr. Blain estimated that from the time Alexander Hamilton placed the U.S. under a debt - based monetary system until today , the debt has compounded at 5.8 percent annually .
The big problem with this system , he said , was “ that no money was created to pay interest . ”
He continued :
Loans created only the principal .
Interest had to be paid out of principal .
So payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity .
Recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid .
Dr. Blain concluded , “ As long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest , debt must grow by compound interest . ”
From a longer - range view , it ’s a system that is constantly collapsing and that must constantly be bailed out .
Dr. Blain next sought to update his figures past the 1976 data from the Bureau of Economic Analyses .
Turning to the Federal Reserve ’s series on “ Total Credit Market Debt Outstanding , ” he found remarkably similar indicators .
He found that adding data from the Federal Reserve from 1945 to 2003 showed the “ debt explosion ” continuing .
In 1945 total debt was $ 463.4 billion .
In 2003 it was $ 44,967.7 billion ( $ 45.0 trillion ) .
When he projected the debt level for 2010 , he arrived at a figure of $ 74.9 trillion .
By this time the debt curve was climbing so steeply there would be almost a doubling of the amount of total debt in only nine years .
It might be argued that these figures do not take into account inflation .
This is because lending at interest is the cause of inflation .
The dollars still have to be repaid with interest .
The problem occurs when economic growth , measured by GDP , does not keep up .
Looking at the growth of GDP from 1945 to 2003 , the increase was from $ 223.1 billion to $ 10,987.9 billion , a factor of 49 .
But the debt ( $ 463.4 billion vs. $ 44,967.7 billion ) grew by a factor of 97 , almost twice the rate of GDP growth .
Thus the total debt burden on the economy has doubled from a ratio of 2:1 to more than 4:1 ( though it was much less than that during the early days of the nation ) .
But with continued compound growth of debt and a slow - or no - growth state of the economy as we head into a recession , we are starting to see what Dr. Blain called an “ acceleration to meltdown . ”
He wrote :
We are buying more and more in the same amount of time .
Witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales , storage units , and big trash pickup days , and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills .
While two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water , food , and shelter , Americans throw away their microwave ovens , televisions , computers , refrigerators , furniture , and cars .
Meanwhile , acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity .
It ’s like arguing that cancer is good because it grows .
These are the things the Democrats in Denver should be talking about , instead of going to so many parties .
They should be making note that the U.S. , to quote economists close to the Federal Reserve , is “ functionally bankrupt . ”
In fact , the debt this nation owes to the banks , to foreign creditors , and to each other can never be paid off .
Further , one big reason for all of our fruitless military endeavors overseas may simply be to escape unpleasant economic realities at home .
But this is pointless .
Nothing creates more debt than war , as the bankers have always known .
The only solution is to adopt a monetary system that is not based on debt .
Dr. Blain makes a couple of specific recommendations : 1 ) “ Stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money ” ; and 2 ) “ Congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt - free and interest - free . ”
The second point is a call for a new monetary system , not one based solely on lending by the banks or on government borrowing .
One organization that has developed a blueprint for such a system is the American Monetary Institute ( AMI ) , headquartered in Chicago .
The director of the AMI is Stephen Zarlenga , author of a massive , groundbreaking work : The Lost Science of Money ( AMI , 2002 ) .
Zarlenga ’s assistant is Jamie Walton , a monetary reformer from New Zealand .
AMI will be holding its fourth annual conference in Chicago on September 25 - 28 .
Expected as keynote speaker is Congressman Dennis Kucinich , whose wife Elizabeth once worked as an intern at AMI .
Dr. Bob Blain will be a featured speaker .
On the AMI website is a remarkable document , the American Monetary Act .
The product of several years of work by Zarlenga and his network , which now includes a number of local chapters around the country , the American Monetary
Act would replace today ’s debt - based monetary system with one where the government spends or loans money directly into circulation .
Under the Act , the Federal Reserve would be retained as a national financial clearinghouse but would no longer be a bank of issue .
The system would be overseen by a Monetary Control Board within the U.S. Treasury Department .
The Act also includes a provision for a citizens ’ dividend , similar in some respects to the Alaska Permanent Fund , which would inject desperately needed purchasing power into the economy without additional government debt or taxation .
Also promoting a citizens ’ dividend , by the way , is Stephen Shafarman in his important new book , Peaceful , Positive Revolution ( Tendril Press , 2008 ) .
It ’s the American Monetary Act the candidates and delegates in Denver should skip one of their parties to read , because it ’s the only way any of their hopes for America can ever be realized .
Says AMI ’s Jamie Walton :
This is a crucial time .
Things are happening .
We have got some key media people talking and writing about our kind of reforms .
The inertia is starting to yield .
Things are starting to roll .
The worsening conditions in 2009 will give us a once - in - a - lifetime chance to be heard above the propaganda .

( CNN ) -- A North Carolina man has been charged with murdering a pregnant Fort Bragg soldier , police said Tuesday .
Fayetteville detectives arrested Edgar Patino , a fellow soldier , at his home in Hope Mills , North Carolina , about 15 miles south of Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
He is accused of killing Spc. Megan Lynn Touma , 23 , found dead on June 21 in a hotel near Fort Bragg .
She was seven - months pregnant at the time of her death , authorities said .
Touma , a five - year veteran of the Army , had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg , Germany , and in Fort Drum , New York , before her stint at Fort Bragg .
Two of Touma 's friends told CNN that Touma and Patino had been stationed together in Germany and dated in the past .
Touma 's friends said Patino proposed to her in Germany before Touma learned , on her return to North Carolina , that Patino was still married .
The two friends , female soldiers who said they were stationed with Touma in Germany , asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case .
Touma is is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances since June .
Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc was killed in early July .
Her Fayetteville , North Carolina , apartment was torched July 10 and her charred body was found nearby a few days later .
Her husband , Marine Cpl. John Wimunc was charged with arson and first degree murder in connection with the death .
Another Marine , Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden , was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first - degree murder .

The sex - life of young Roald Dahl : How author had ' a parade of women ' while he was a spy in America during the war
Roald Dahl pictured when he was a dashing RAF fighter pilot
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The BFG are still some of the most popular children 's stories across the world .
But a new biography which reveals the sexual exploits of author Roald Dahl , while he was a British spy in America during the war , is certainly not suitable bed - time reading for his younger fans .
The new biography , by American journalist Jennet Conant , draws on previously unpublished Dahl letters and other documents , and is a comprehensive account of the authors wartime exploits as a RAF attache .
Among his conquests were , Millicent Rogers , heiress to a Standard Oil fortune and Clare Boothe Luce , a right - wing congresswoman and sex -mad wife of the publisher of Time magazine .
Dahl once told friends that Boothe Luce , who was 13 years older , had left him ' all f***** out ' after spending three nights in bed with her .
In the biography , to be published in Britain on September 9 , Conant writes :
' Dahl ’s superiors watched his rake ’s progress with grudging admiration .
“ A certain amount of hanky - panky was condoned , especially when it was for a good cause . '
Dahl ended up in the Washington Embassy in 1942 after getting injured while training as an RAF pilot and fighting in the Middle East .
He became friends with Charles Marsh , a Texan newspaper magnate and Winston Churchill fan .
Clare Boothe Luce left Roald Dahl exhausted after they spent three nights together
It was Marsh ’s family that provided Conant with letters the two men wrote to each other during the war .
His daughter Antoinette Marsh Haskell said : ' I think he slept with everybody on the east and west coasts that [ was worth ] more than $ 50,000 a year .
' Roald was a real charmer when he wanted to be .
He was great fun to be around , he was always doing tricks and playing crazy practical jokes .
' There was a parade of women . '
At one point he turned up at the Marshes ’ home with a woman said to be General Dwight Eisenhower ’s mistress .
' I think he liked to show them off to my father , ' Antoinette says .
The biograpy describes a British embassy dinner , when Dahl was placed deliberately next to Boothe Luce , whose anticolonial opinions and dislike of Churchill worried British officials .
His mission was to keep close to Boothe Luce and he succeeded admirably .
Dahl later claimed to have asked his superiors to take him off the assignment because of her sexual exploits but he was told to close his eyes and think of England .
Along with looking very stylish and bigger than other rival products , Hasselblad ’s latest digital SLR camera is looking to win the competition with a photo finish .
Source : Wired
The Hasselblad H3DII - 50 is a new DSLR camera that has not 10 , not 12 , but 50 megapixels .
The mammoth of a camera uses Kodak ’s 50 megapixel 36x48 mm CCD sensor , which is twice the size of most DSLR sensors .
Since its anything but small , the camera can capture 65 MB files , giving you a bigger and more detailed picture .
Other features include :
- Integrated 50 Mpix capture units with 3 ” display .
- Ultra-Focus : integral optimization of digital lens performance .
- Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution .
- Integrated CCD cooling sink for lower noise .
- Direct ISO / WB control .
- Thumbwheel control of digital menus .
- GPS accessory option .
But despite its wide array of features , there are two cons to the H3DII - 50 .
Since it can capture 65 MB files , it does n’t leave you a lot of space to take numerous pictures .
On a 2 GB memory card , you ’ll probably get about 30 frames .
The retail price might be a major flaw as well .
Even though the price and release date are n’t set yet , do n’t expect the camera to be cheap as the previous model , the H3DII - 39 , cost almost US $ 40,000 .
If you ’re interested in finding out more about the specs , you can visit the following website .
Let 's see .
The guys who make the machines will tally up the vote and tell us who won .
What could go wrong with that ?

Vendors are Undermining the Structure of U.S. Elections
A VotersUnite report on the current situation

Executive Summary
As we approach the 2008 general election , the structure of elections in the United States — once reliant on local representatives accountable to the public — has become almost wholly dependent on large corporations , which are not accountable to the public .
Most local officials charged with running elections are now unable to administer elections without the equipment , services , and trade - secret software of a small number of corporations . [ 1 ]

Gas prices are already starting to have a major impact in such areas as vacation planning , free pizza delivery , air travel , and SUV sales .
The effect on the election is not known yet , but historically , when people are worried about bread - and - butter issues , it helps the Democrats .
Barack Obama is beginning to get his post - nomination bump .
Gallup has him leading John McCain 48 % to 42 % and Rasmussen has him ahead 50 % to 44 % ( counting leaners ) .
Every nominee gets a post nomination bump .
The real test is whether it is still there in a month .
Now that we have two presidential nominees , it is time to begin speculating about the Veep .
The choice of Vice President is a very strange election as there is only one voter -- the presidential nominee .
It is amazing that people stand for this actually .
It would be far more logical to have multiple names put in nomination and have the convention delegates vote on them .
But that has only been done once in recent times , in 1956 , when Adlai Stevenson allowed the Democratic convention to choose the Veep .
Be that as it may , some of the choices have been quite conventional ( the person who came in second ) and others have been out of the blue .
It is hard to forecast what the one voter will do .
Nevertheless , some inspection of the past shows that senators , governors , and representatives are common choices .
Here are the tickets for the past 60 years .
Year Democrat ( P ) Democrat ( VP ) Republican ( P ) Republican ( VP ) 2004 John Kerry John Edwards George Bush Dick Cheney 2000 Al Gore Joe Lieberman George Bush Dick Cheney 1996 Bill Clinton Al Gore Bob Dole Jack Kemp 1992 Bill Clinton Al Gore George Bush Dan Quayle 1988 Michael Dukakis Lloyd Bentsen George Bush Dan Quayle 1984 Walter Mondale Geraldine Ferraro Ronald Reagan George Bush 1980 Jimmy Carter Walter Mondale Ronald Reagan George Bush 1976 Jimmy Carter Walter Mondale Gerald Ford Bob Dole 1972 George McGovern Sargent Shriver Richard Nixon Spiro Agnew 1968 Hubert Humphrey Edmund Muskie Richard Nixon Spiro Agnew 1964 Lyndon Johnson Hubert Humphrey Barry Goldwater William Miller 1960 John Kennedy Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon Henry Lodge 1956 Adlai Stevenson Estes Kefauver Dwight Eisenhower Richard Nixon 1952 Adlai Stevenson John Sparkman Dwight Eisenhower Richard Nixon 1948 Harry Truman Alben Barkley Thomas Dewey Earl Warren
Let 's take a look at some of the choices , year by year .
In 2004 , John Kerry picked John Edwards , one of his defeated rivals , despite what the NY Post thought .
George Bush picked his incumbent Veep , Dick Cheney .
In 2000 , Al Gore picked a fellow senator who was not even running for President , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - CT ) .
Lieberman was an odd choice since he came from a small state that any Democrat automatically wins .
Some pundits labeled this as a " bold choice " because Lieberman is an orthodox Jew .
Because he is very public about his belief in God , he was surprisingly popular with evangelical voters .
This choice definitely came out of the blue ; nobody was expecting it .
George Bush 's choice was even more surprising .
Bush assigned old Washington hand Dick Cheney the job of vetting the Veep candidates .
Apparently nobody passed muster since Bush ultimately chose Cheney himself .
At the time that was hailed as a smart move since he had held various positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations and then served five terms in the House representing Wyoming .
Since then , some people have changed their minds about Cheney , but at the time nobody would have predicted the nod going to Cheney .
In 1996 , incumbent President Bill Clinton picked incumbent Vice President Al Gore .
It worked in 1992 so why not try again ?
Bob Dole picked a relatively unknown former congressman from NY and and former cabinet secretary Jack Kemp .
Kemp had run for President in 1988 and not done especially well , but conservatives liked his ideology ( " tax cuts are good ; more tax cuts are better " ) .
he also provided some geographic balance for the Kansas senator .
Dole had plenty of other choices , though , including defeated rivals Gov. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , Sen . Dick Lugar ( R - IN ) , and Gov. Pete Wilson ( R - CA ) .
Only Dole and Liddy Dole ( now senator from North Carolina ) know the real reasons he picked Kemp .
It was not an inspired choice and with a stronger Veep he might have done better .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton picked another southerner , Al Gore .
This went against the conventional wisdom that you should n't have two people from the same region on the ticket .
But the two of the clearly liked each other and got along well and maybe the synergy helped .
George H.W. Bush picked his incumbent Vice President , Dan Quayle .
In 1988 , Michael Dukakis picked Sen. Lloyd Bentsen ( D - TX ) , quickly dubbed the Boston - Austin ticket .
It was widely compared to the 1960 Kennedy - Johnson ticket .
Bentsen was an experienced heavyweight and often appeared more presidential than Dukakis himself .
He was chosen largely in the hope of bringing in Texas , which he failed to do .
He had one notable moment though , during the Vice Presidential debate in which his opponent Dan Quayle compared himself to President Kennedy .
Bentsen retorted : " Senator , I served with Jack Kennedy : I knew Jack Kennedy ; Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine .
Senator , you 're no Jack Kennedy . "
That shut Quayle up and is probably the most famous line from any Vice Presidential debate .
George Bush 's choice of Sen. Dan Quayle ( R - IN ) was certainly strange .
It balanced the ticket but Quayle was a lightweight who brought in no new state and no special experise in anything .
He was widely ridiculed during the campaign .
In 1984 , Walter Mondale made a bold choice in Geraldine Ferraro , a NY representative and the first ( and so far , only ) woman on a major party national ticket .
He could have chosen one of the defeated presidential candidates such as Sen. John Glenn ( D - OH ) or Sen. Gary Hart ( D - CO ) but his choice of Ferraro certainly got a lot of attention .
Her husband 's tax returns caused the ticket a lot of grief .
Choosing a woman was certainly a bold choice , but Ferraro might not have been the right woman .
Ronald Reagan chose his incumbent Veep , George H.W. Bush .
In 1980 , Jimmy Carter chose his incumbent Vice President , Walter Mondale .
Ronald Reagan chose one of his defeated rivals , George H.W. Bush .
Bush was a safe choice since he had demonstrated his vote - getting ability and he a resume as long as your arm ( WWII naval officer , successful businessman , congresssman , ambassador to the U.N. , envoy to China , director of the CIA , and more ) .
He certainly helped Reagan , who knew little about national politics .
In a way , his election foreshadowed the 2000 election , in which Bush 's son , who knew even less about national politics than Reagan , also chose a long - time Washington hand as Veep .
The main difference was that after George H.W. Bush was elected Vice President , he understood that his main duty was to call the White House at 9 A.M. to see if the President was still alive , and if so , could take the day off .
Many people believe that Cheney is co-president , if not more .
This is enough for one day .
To be continued tomorrow .
A poll in Wisconsin shows the general election to be quite close there .
Wisconsin will be a battleground state .
South Carolina is an easy win for McCain .
State Obama McCain Start End Pollster South Carolina 39 % 48 % Jun 05 Jun 05 Rasmussen Wisconsin 45 % 43 % Jun 05 Jun 05 Rasmussen
A surprising Senate poll shows Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) to be in a close race with Republican Dick Zimmer who just won the nomination , but this could be due to his post - nomination bounce .
Lautenberg has been in the Senate for a long time and New Jersey is a Democratic state .
The new Rasmussen poll puts Lautenberg ahead of Zimmer 45 % to 44 % , a statistical tie .
A new poll in Alaska shows challenger Mark Begich ( D ) ahead of the incumbent , Sen . Ted Stevens , 51 % to 44 % .
This will be a very competitive race .
In Texas , Sen. Jon Cornyn ( R - TX ) leads challenger Rick Noriega ( D ) 52 % to 35 % .
A rare House poll has a very interesting result .
In KY - 03 , Rep. John Yarmuth is way ahead of former congresswoman Anne Northup 57 % to 40 % .
After three special elections ( in IL - 14 , LA - 06 , and MS - 01 ) in which Democrats won seats long held by Republicans , a lot of Republicans were wondering ( fearing ) what was going to happen in close districts .
Although Kentucky as a whole is very Republican , KY - 03 is evenly split and the first indication is that in evenly split districts , there could be Democratic landslides .
Now it is still very early in the season , but this is not a good omen for Republicans .
Yarmuth and Northup ran against each other in 2006 , when Yarmuth won his seat by 3 % .

Former Gov. Jesse Ventura will return to the Minnesota political stage Sept. 2 , lending his big voice and strong opinions to an alternative rally for GOP Rep.
Ron Paul during the Republican National Convention .
Rally for the Republic spokesman Jesse Benton predicted Ventura ’s appearance would boost national interest in the two - day rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis for Paul , the Texas congressman and unsuccessful presidential candidate .
“ He ’s a great voice for freedom and limited government , ” Benton said of Ventura .
“ He ’s got a lot of charisma and a lot of credibility , and we ’re very happy that he ’s going to lend his voice to some of the other great freedom advocates that will be there with us that day . ”
In a YouTube video announcing Ventura ’s appearance , Paul said the governor is a “ big draw …
He supports our views .
He ’s against this war .
He ’s for civil liberties . ”
A spokeswoman for Ventura ’s book publisher , Skyhorse Publishing , confirmed that Ventura had agreed to speak at the rally .
“ It ’s something that he wanted to do , ” she said , declining to elaborate .
The author , former professional wrestler and Brooklyn Park mayor could not be reached for comment .
Paul himself asked rally organizers to invite Ventura , said Marianne Stebbins , the candidate ’s Minnesota campaign coordinator .
“ He insisted on it , ” she said .
That may come as a surprise since Ventura did n’t endorse Paul and does n’t embrace all of his anti-tax and small - government views .
For instance , the former governor proposed tax increases to erase a state budget deficit and was an outspoken advocate for light - rail transit .
“ They do n’t agree on everything , ” Benton acknowledged , “ but they do agree that we want real limited government , a strong national defense but not policing the world , and we want to obey the Constitution .
So there ’s a lot of commonality there , a lot of room for agreement and a lot of mutual respect . ”
Stebbins said Ventura would bring some ideological diversity to the rally .
“ The rest of the lineup will be Republican giants .
Jesse brings real independence to the lineup , ” she said .
Earlier this month , Ventura flirted with jumping back into Minnesota politics by running for the U.S. Senate .
But he backed out the night before filings closed , citing personal and family reasons .
Nonetheless , he got a lot of national media attention with his will - he - or - wo n ’t - he ploy .
Ventura ’s return to the Target Center will be a homecoming of sorts .
That ’s where , in January 1999 , he held his governor ’s inaugural celebration before a sell - out crowd of 13,800 .

This list contains men and women who never received Oscars in their respective fields but definitely at some point deserved one .
This list does not include Honorary Oscars or Lifetime Achievement Award Oscars .
10 Albert Finney
Albert Finney has been nominated for 5 Oscars in his lifetime .
His most notable performance came in one of his first , Tom Jones .
He was also nominated for Erin Brokovich , The Dresser , and Volcano .
If you have never seen Finney in a film , I strongly recommend you watch him in The Browning Version – a lesser known but fantastic film about a teacher of classics .
9 Richard Burton
Richard Burton was nominated 7 times for an Oscar and of those 7 ; six were in the best actor category .
His most famous role was in Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Wolf .
8 Angela Lansbury
Ah , Mrs. Lovett .
How I love her , and how the Academy Awards do not .
This star was nominated 3 times for Oscars , most notably for Portrait of Dorian Grey , and The Manchurian Candidate .
She is probably most famous amongst the thespians as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd ( the GOOD one , not the crappy one with Helena Bonham Carter who I do usually enjoy ) .
7 Peter O’Toole
Peter O’Toole holds the record for most nominations without ever winning , he has been nominated 8 times , most recently in 2006 with his amazing performance in Venus .
He would have won in 1962 for Lawrence of Arabia , if it had not been for Atticus Finch aka Gregory Peck .
6 Fred Astaire
He was nominated only once in his long career .
He is ranked fifth on AFI ’s best actors of all time .
He was nominated for Towering Inferno but did not win .
He was later awarded honorary awards .
He was most famous for his musical movies with Ginger Rogers !
5 Greta Garbo
Recently ranked fifth on AFI ’s greatest female stars of all time .
She was the queen of silent film and is credited as having some of the most unforgettable movie performances ever .
She was nominated four times and never won .
The nominations were for films such as Anna Christie , Romance ( nominated for both in 1930 ) , Camille , and Ninotchka .
4 Deborah Kerr
You may know Deborah Kerr best as Anna Leonowens from The King and I .
She was nominated 6 times for an award and never won .
She is considered one of the best female actresses of all time .
She has the most nominations for a woman in the Best Actress role with six .
She was also nominated for Edward My Son , From Here to Eternity , Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison , Separate Tables and The Sundowners .
3 Cary Grant
Cary Grant is ranked second on AFI ’s best actors of all time .
He is most known for some of the greatest movies of all time including North by Northwest , The Philadelphia Story , and To Catch a Thief .
2 Alfred Hitchcock
Hitchcock is widely viewed as one of the greatest directors of all time ; he never won an Oscar .
Known for classics such as Rear Window , The Birds , Rebecca , Lifeboat , and Spellbound ( all of those movies where ones in which he was nominated ) , this Sultan of Suspense deserved one , if not all - 5 Oscars he was nominated for ….
Boo on the Academy !
1 Charlie Chaplin
SURPRISE !
Charlie Chaplin never won an Oscar , EVER !
This is rumored to be because of his public disdain for the Oscars .
Nonetheless , Charlie Chaplin is considered by many to be the most influential and greatest actor of all time .
He received 2 honorary Oscars , but as I said earlier those do n’t count .
No doubt he should have at least won ONE !
Notable omissions ( and there are a few ) : Glenn Close , Orson Wells , Rosalind Russell , Stanley Kubrick , Robert Altman , D.W. Griffith , and King Vidor

Pensees et Fragments Inedits de Montesquieu
Two Orange County ministers were among dozens across the country taking politics to the pulpit Sunday in hopes of influencing the Nov. 4 presidential election .
Unlike some pastors elsewhere who endorsed Republican John McCain during “ Pulpit Freedom Sunday , ” the two ministers stopped short of explicitly recommending that worshipers vote for either McCain or Democrat Barack Obama .
But they were not shy about raising politics in church .
Pastor Stephen B. Orman urged those attending his Warner Avenue Baptist Church service in Huntington Beach to use the Bible as a voters ’ guide and evaluate candidates and issues on the basis of Christian scripture .
The Rev. Wiley S. Drake suggested that those at his First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park vote for him -- and for his presidential running mate on the American Independent Party ticket , Alan Keyes .

Drake asked his congregation to support the challenge to the federal ban on political campaigning by nonprofit groups .
“ I am angry because the government and the IRS and some Christians have taken away the rights of pastors , ” Drake said to about 45 people at his service .
“ I have a right to endorse anybody I doggone well please .
And if they do n’t like that , too bad . ”
Orman told the 75 people in his pews that he shelved a previously planned subject in order to deliver what he called “ An Election Sermon . ”
“ There has been a movement going on to encourage preachers to preach about the upcoming election and even to come out and tell people who you ’re voting for , ” Orman said .
“ And perhaps even tell people who they ought to be voting for . ”

A conservative legal group based in Arizona , Alliance Defense Fund , said it planned to support ministers testing the Internal Revenue Service rule .
Congress made it illegal in 1954 for tax - exempt organizations to publicly support or oppose political candidates .
Other clerics and critics condemned Sunday ’s actions by the 33 pastors in 22 states .
They warned that pulpit politicking would undercut the independence that churches have had to speak out about moral and ethical issues .
“ Pastors have a responsibility to the whole of their flock to provide spiritual support and guidance ” but not partisan political advice , said the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori , presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church .
But Erik Stanley , Alliance Defense Fund senior legal counsel , disagreed .

His group is prepared to defend the 1st Amendment rights of churches investigated for politicking .
“ If the 1st Amendment does n’t protect controversial speech , ” he said , “ it protects no speech at all . ”
It was unclear how many of the ministers taking part in Sunday ’s action were actually crossing the IRS line .
In West Bend , Wis. , the Associated Press reported that Pastor Luke Emrich told 100 worshipers at his evangelical New Life Church , “ I would cast a vote for John McCain and Sarah Palin , ” adding , “ it ’s your choice to make , it ’s not my choice . ”
Pastor Jody Hice of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Bethlehem , Ga. , compared Obama and McCain on abortion and same - sex marriage and concluded that McCain “ holds more to a biblical world view . ”

At the independent Fairview Baptist Church in Edmond , Okla. , Pastor Paul Blair likewise told his congregation of his support for McCain .
In Buena Park , members of Drake ’s congregation called out “ Amen ” and applauded during his sermon .
He urged members to think about their faith when voting and spent much of his 40 - minute sermon giving a partisan speech about the presidential candidates and their issues .
“ According to my Bible and in my opinion , there is no way in the world a Christian can vote for Barack Hussein Obama , ” Drake said .
“ Mr. Obama is not standing up for anything that is tradition in America . ”
He urged prayers for the American Independent Party .
“ We are going to do more damage to the Democrats and Republicans than we have ever done , ” he said .

William Ruffin , who has attended the church for 10 years and is a Bible studies teacher there , said that he believed that denying freedom of speech in the pulpit “ means that this country is living as hypocrites . ”
In Huntington Beach , Orman spoke of personal responsibility , citing home schooling as an example .
He said judges who recently ruled against restrictions on home instruction deserve support as churchgoers check the records of judges and vote out those they feel “ have been doing wrong . ”
He said he favors the separation of church and state , “ but I do n’t believe in the separation of God and government . ”
In terms of the presidential and vice presidential election , “ you can look at the names Barack and Joseph and you can look at John and Sarah and find them all in Scriptures , ” Orman said , prompting loud laughter from those in the 102 - year - old sanctuary .
Advertisement
Orman ended his sermon by urging those in the congregation to vote .
He said a voter registration table would be available outside after the service .
There were no takers at the sign - up table .
Congregant Pamela Dyrud of Santa Ana said most at Warner Avenue Baptist Church promptly register to vote when they turn 18 .
Deacon Kenneth Williams said he felt Orman got his point across without jeopardizing the congregation ’s tax - exempt IRS status -- or pulling any punches .
Visitor Judy Ahrens described Sunday as “ historic ” and Orman ’s sermon as “ courageous and brave . ”
She said she might start attending his church regularly .

July 25 - 27 . twinpeaksfest.com .
Tickets $ 200 or $ 220 including bus tour .
During a typical 12 - hour shift , Hector Hernandez can be found in just about any corner of Kaiser Sunset , tending to premature infants and the elderly , to patients with asthma and those with AIDS , to heart attack victims and survivors of car wrecks .
He connects patients to ventilators , evaluates lung capacity and blood gases and administers oxygen and aerosol medications .
Clad in green scrubs and white running shoes , he is often the first to arrive on a “ code blue ” -- the term that is broadcast when a patient has stopped breathing .
Yet most of those he sees probably could not name his occupation .
Hernandez , 49 , is not a doctor or a nurse but a respiratory care practitioner .
“ A lot of people do n’t hear much about respiratory therapists , ” he said .
“ We ’re there .
We help you .
We ’re gone . ”

Many patients also probably do n’t know that there are barely enough respiratory care therapists to go around .
Most people have heard about the nationwide nursing shortage .
But the country is also experiencing a shortage of trained workers in the “ allied health professions ” -- respiratory care practitioners , medical transcriptionists , radiographers and about 200 other occupations that make up about 60 % of healthcare workers .
“ We call them the hidden healthcare workforce , ” said Susan Chapman , director of allied health studies at the UC San Francisco Center for the Health Professions .
“ In the policy arena , there is n’t a lot of attention being paid to those folks . ”
Yet the care they provide is vital .
Advertisement
“ You ca n’t run a hospital without people to take the X - rays or do the lab tests , ” Chapman said .
According to a recent study , California , with its burgeoning population , lags behind the rest of the nation in the number of allied health professionals per capita .
If he wanted to , Hernandez , who has worked at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center in Hollywood for 22 years , could moonlight at three hospitals a week .
And as baby boomers like Hernandez , who now make up much of the allied health workforce , begin to retire , demand is expected to outstrip supply in at least nine of 15 occupations surveyed .
Those with the highest projected need include pharmacy technicians , dental hygienists and physical therapist assistants .
Advertisement
“ The aging of the population is a double whammy , ” said Michele Siqueiros , executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for College Opportunity .
“ It drives up demand [ for health services ] at the same time that people will be retiring from the very jobs that will be needed . ”
The campaign , a coalition of California business , labor and community groups , joined with Kaiser Permanente and the California Wellness Foundation last fall to commission the study .
The allied health profession is a large and varied group .
Some , like laboratory scientists ( who analyze blood and other bodily fluids ) , need a bachelor ’s degree .
Pharmacists , licensed social workers and physical therapists need advanced degrees .
But most allied health jobs do not require four years of college .
Training programs after high school can lead to state certification to be an emergency medical technician ( who provides emergency care and transport ) or a pharmacy technician ( who counts pills , labels bottles and works the pharmacy counter ) .
Community colleges offer two - year associate degrees for medical radiographers ( who position patients for mammograms and other imaging machines ) and for respiratory care practitioners like Hernandez .
Advertisement
And although some jobs are relatively low - paying -- the median wage for an EMT in 2005 - 06 was $ 12.19 an hour -- others pay two or three times that , according to the study .
The median wage for dental hygienists was $ 36.83 .
The highest median wage was for pharmacists , at $ 53.03 .
Yet despite the decent pay , to meet the need for clinical laboratory scientists -- median wage , $ 32.36 an hour -- the state would have to produce 559 % more graduates in that field alone in the next six years , the study found .
“ Laboratory sciences are just critical to our delivery of healthcare in an acute - care hospital , ” said Roger E. Seaver , president and chief executive of Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia .
“ But they are out of sight , out of mind . ”
Advertisement
The factors driving the shortages are similar to those behind the nursing shortage , experts say .
Allied health workers make more money in the clinic than in the classroom , leading to faculty shortages .
Community colleges , underfunded and independently operated , do a poor job of letting students who are on a waiting list at one college know about available seats at another .
Attrition rates are high because many students are ill - prepared academically when they enter college and juggle classes with work and family obligations .
Little is offered in the way of tutoring , counseling or financial aid .
Public - private partnerships to fix some of these problems in nursing education are already showing results , said Siqueiros , who is calling for similar steps -- and funding -- for the allied health fields .
Advertisement
Some hospitals , Kaiser among them , already work with community colleges to recruit and prepare students .
When Jerry Saldana became manager of respiratory care services at Kaiser Sunset , he knew that wages did n’t explain the problems he was having filling vacancies :
The starting salary for respiratory care practitioners right out of school is $ 29 an hour plus full benefits .
There just were n’t enough applicants to go around .
So he set up partnerships with East Los Angeles College , Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut and Concorde Career Colleges to do the clinical training , which makes up the program ’s second year , at Kaiser .
“ We get to see the students here for a year , train them here , ” he said .
“ I ’ve hired quite a few right out of school . ”
The worsening economy has sparked interest in the program among mid-career workers who have lost their jobs to downsizing or are seeking stable work .
The field also attracts immigrants who worked in a health profession in their home countries .
Advertisement
“ We ’re making some ground on the awareness side , ” said UC San Francisco ’s Chapman .
“ But we still have a long way to go to have a serious , sustained commitment to this .
Like in nursing , it ’s not something that ’s going to be resolved overnight . ”

If GM Wants to Look “ Green , ” it Ca n’t Skip Events Like HybridFest
Recently , I spent time at HybridFest , a car show dedicated to emerging green technologies and fuel economy .
The kind of person who attends HybridFest is that same kind that talks around the water cooler about their MPG and how much money their hybrid has saved them .
And this kind of person is exactly who companies like GM need to convince to buy their products .
That ’s probably why GM was the # 2 sponsor , right after Toyota .
That does n’t explain , however , why GM did n’t show up .
Show organizer , Eric Powers , told me that GM representatives were on hand for dinner Friday night to kick off the show , which began officially on Saturday morning , but after that no one saw them .
Instead of putting their floor space at the show to use , GM chose to leave a musty old city bus sitting in the corner looking inconspicuous ( see first photo ) .
Not too many people wondered where GM was , but personally , I was excited to see what they ’d have at the show to counteract the Toyota party van :
Seeing the GM logo on everything made me sure that at some point I would see GM there .
But alas , it was not to be .
There was no clash of automotive giants , and no GM reps to talk about upcoming designs with .
So , what happened ?
Firstly , let me say that this article is not some cookie - cutter condemnation of GM .
I have spent time with GM and discussed their plans , as well as test - driven their HCCI technology , and I can honestly say that there are a lot of smart people at all levels in the company working to rebuild their image and their product lineup as one that is fuel efficient and environmentally friendly .
We all know that GM is going through hard times , posting $ 15.5B losses and still two years away from releasing the earliest production models of the Volt , which they hope will be their saving grace .
Part of me hoped that GM would come to HybridFest with some surprise mock up of the Volt , or perhaps even one of their drivetrains strapped to the body of another car .
I ’d also hoped to strike up a conversation with someone from GM about the future of the Chevy Aveo , that small , affordable car that seems to get no media attention and surprisingly bad fuel economy ( GM has promised to make it a class leader in 2009 with a total redesign , and I wanted some insight into this ) .
Another , perhaps pernicious part of me did n’t want Toyota to steal the show .
I knew HybridFest would be like a Prius collectors show , but since I knew Honda would n’t be there I feared that Toyota would only increase it ’s legacy as “ the hybrid company . ”
Obviously , other companies can do it ( and Honda did , with the Insight , which was released in the US earlier than the Prius and with better fuel economy ) , but somehow Prius and hybrid have become pretty much the same thing to some people .
Anyway , one can only assume that all the pressures weighing down on GM right now finally got to them , and caused them to back out .
HybridFest is great , but it ’s not like the media is buzzing with this story , so there has been little word of why GM suddenly disappeared .
What does this mean for GM ?
Well , GM is in a tough place , but this was n’t the right place to cut corners , I think .
As I said earlier , the type of people that go to HybridFest are influencers and pushers .
They want to brag about hybrid tech , take their friends on test drives , and change the way people look at fuel consumption .
Sure , GM might have only reached a few thousand people , but they missed an opportunity , for just one weekend ’s work , to have high - quality interaction with the people they are trying to win over to their side .
By not showing up , HybridFest allowed Toyota to dominate , with the only GM in sight ( Honda pun ! ) being a modified Equinox that showed up with the University of Wisconsin .
No one is impressed by a shallow advertising blitz talking about fuel - efficient truck hybrids .
What GM needs to do is generate real , meaningful buzz around their products , and they need to do it at the grassroots level or else their efforts will just be passed off as another round of corporate greenwashing .
I will be in contact with the company soon about their future plans , and there marketing strategies , and am excited at the possibility to share that with you , so stay tuned .

[ Daniel Nocera ] , working with the MIT Energy Initiative , has come up with a method to easily and cheaply store energy generated from solar electricity with water .
The method uses two catalysts of non-toxic and abundant metals to separate the water into both oxygen and hydrogen .
These gases are then stored , and later recombined in a fuel cell to generate power .
The process was inspired by photosynthesis , and helps to make sources such as solar power viable around the clock .
Current storage technologies are both expensive and inefficient , so technologies like solar are only useful when the source is available .
This will allow homes to cheaply and easily store power generated through solar and other technologies .
While this is only part of the solution towards the current energy problem , it could go a long way towards decreasing our use of non-renewable sources .
When combined with other new breakthroughs in the field , you can easily imagine more homes coming off the grid .
Check out the short video after the break .
( CNN ) -- Soul singer and arranger Isaac Hayes , who won Grammy awards and an Oscar for the theme from the 1971 action film " Shaft , " has died , sheriff 's officials in Memphis , Tennessee , reported Sunday .
Singer Issac Hayes seen performing in the U.K. last year .
Hayes was found dead Sunday at age 65 .

Relatives found Hayes , 65 , unconscious in his home next to a still - running treadmill , said Steve Shular , a spokesman for the Shelby County Sheriff 's Department .
Paramedics attempted to revive him and took him to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead shortly after 2 p.m. , the sheriff 's department said .
No foul play is suspected , the agency said in a written statement .
Hayes was a longtime songwriter and arranger for Stax Records in Memphis , playing in the studio's backup band and crafting tunes for artists such as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave in the 1960s .

He released his first solo album in 1967 , and his 1969 follow - up , " Hot Buttered Soul , " became a platinum hit .
In 1971 , the theme from " Shaft " topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks and won an Academy Award for best original theme song .
The song and the movie score also won Grammy awards for best original score and movie theme .
Hayes won a third Grammy for pop instrumental performance with the title track to his 1972 " Black Moses " album .
Do n't Miss iReport.com : Your memories of Isaac Hayes
From the late 1990s through 2006 , Hayes provided the voice of " Chef " for Comedy Central 's raunchy animated series " South Park , " as well as numerous songs .
The role introduced him to a new generation of fans , but he left after the show lampooned his own religion , the Church of Scientology .
He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 .
In a CNN interview at the time , Hayes credited his success to " adjusting and constantly evolving , expanding and trying to stay as young as I can . "
The new generation of popular musicians , he said , " could use a little more substance like we had in the day . "
" They 're standing on our shoulders .
Some of them do n't realize [ it ] because they sample me so much , " he said .
Hayes credited his role on " South Park " with expanding his fan base , and said that he had almost passed on the job .
" I started to walk out .
I thought it was a Disney thing .
I [ had ] never heard of this thing , " he said .
But his agent persuaded him to tape some episodes .
" Toward the opening I started having trepidations -- ' Oh my god , what have I done ?
I 've ruined my career . '
But when it aired , the ratings went through the roof , " he said .
A 1992 visit to the royal family in Ghana was a life - changing experience for Hayes , he said .
" I went back on speaking engagements and encouraged African - Americans to go to Africa [ to ] interact socially , culturally and / or economically , " he said .

" She is a longtime member of the Assemblies of God .
That 's all you need to know . "
That 's how political blogger Andrew Sullivan recently summarized Governor Sarah Palin 's faith background .
But entertain the crazy thought that some people might want to know more .
What would we learn from the media about the Assemblies of God ?
It 's " the evangelical experience on steroids , " " where sitting is an option but clapping is not , " where beliefs " stray a bit from the mainstream " and which " mainstream Christians do n't understand . "
There 's the usual report of tongues , faith - healing , and " end times " — threateningly caricaturized as " a violent upheaval that … will deliver Jesus Christ 's second coming . "
Combine " holy laughter , divine dancing , silver tooth fillings turning into gold , [ and ] the regeneration of a large intestine , " and you see why Palin 's childhood faith has been " deemed irrelevant by the liberal intelligentsia because it is regarded as fundamentalist and … irrational . "
Then again , news accounts of " rational faith " have been rather scarce .
The first wave
About one in four Christian believers worldwide are Pentecostal or charismatic , and the percentage is increasing daily .
The World Christian Database says 8.7 percent of the world 's population is part of this " renewalist " group .
The AG is one of the most prominent Pentecostal groups , it 's only a part of the movement .
An AG study from 2006 found 60 million adherents in more than 300,000 churches worldwide .
About 2.8 million of these are in the U.S .
The renewalist movement in the U.S. is often divided into three historical " waves . "
The first wave began in 1901 , resulting in the " classical " Pentecostal denominations , including the Assemblies of God .
The second ( " charismatic " ) ...

One of those cycling anarchists apparently was shoved off his bike by a cop in Times Square Friday night – but it could have been worse .
Given the traffic havoc that Critical Mass regularly provokes , he might ’ve been hit by a bus .
Now the cop is in trouble , and Critical Mass – which hates cars , and so makes a point to create monthly traffic jams all over New York , just for the hell of it – is in full chortle .
It was bound to happen , of course .
Over the last four years , the activists have aggressively fought the NYPD ’s attempts to keep the streets safe .
It looks like one thing led to another Friday , and the unidentified officer seemingly pushed a Critical Mass rider to the ground as the group snaked through Times Square .
Nobody was hurt .
And , since the rider got a traffic ticket and was cited for resisting arrest , there may be more to the story than what ’s on one online video .
Regardless , the officer has been placed on modified assignment pending an internal probe .
Such a display of temper is , of course , improper .
But – given Critical Mass ’ casual provocations over the years – it was hardly surprising .
And Police Commissioner Ray Kelly will do the right thing .
He usually does .
Contrast that with crazies who conspire to endanger the public every month and dare the police to stop them .
It ’s hard to root against the cops .

The extravagant Vividus bed has been turning heads -- and giving others a serious case of sticker shock .

While a lot of people 's jaws would drop if asked whether they would pay $ 64,950 for a bed , there are others out there who would answer affirmatively -- even outside the typical luxury - purchase crowd .
The luxury mattress industry has capitalized on the recent healthy - living trend and put to rest the idea that a good night 's sleep is n't critical to well - being .
Couple that with a few other factors -- like the deafening groans of affluent , aching agesters -- and you open up a market for top - of - the - line mattresses that cost more than most cars .

The particular bed causing all this commotion is the Vividus bed , made by a Swedish - based company called Hästens .
The company 's ads daringly ask people how much they 're willing to spend to enjoy years and years of blissful shuteye .
If $ 64,950 is a little pricey , someone can scale back and try out one of their less expensive models like the popular 2000T , which will only set you back about a third of the amount .
" " The craftsmanship that goes into each Vividus mattress and frame has been honed to perfection over the past century and a half .
Photo Courtesy of Hästens
­ Each customized Hästens ' Vividus mattress is created by hand and takes between 140 and 160 man-hours to complete .
The frame alone takes a week to create , and is made from slowly growing arctic pine and oiled oak .
Hand - selected horsehairs are another of the all - natural ingredients in each Vividus , and they play an important role .
The hollow horsehairs in the mattress help keep air flowing and moisture levels to a minimum .
The beds also contain cotton , ­ wool , flax , down and 10 - turn steel springs .
Hästens , which was founded in 1852 , says its experience and high - quality artisanship , including the patented bedspring system , contribute to the beds ' impressive signature feel .
Hästens is far from alone on the high - end mattress scene .

IT�S THE DERIVATIVES , STUPID !
WHY FANNIE , FREDDIE AND AIG ALL HAD TO BE BAILED OUT
� I can calculate the movement of the stars , but not the madness of men . �
� Sir Isaac Newton , after losing a fortune in the South Sea bubble
Something extraordinary is going on with these government bailouts .�
In March 2008 , the Federal Reserve extended a $ 55 billion loan to JPMorgan to �rescue� investment bank Bear Stearns from bankruptcy , a highly controversial move that tested the limits of the Federal Reserve Act . �
On September 7 , 2008 , the U.S. government seized private mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and imposed a conservatorship , a form of bankruptcy ; but rather than let the bankruptcy court sort out the assets among the claimants , the Treasury extended an unlimited credit line to the insolvent corporations and said it would exercise its authority to buy their stock , effectively nationalizing them . �
Now the Federal Reserve has announced that it is giving an $ 85 billion loan to American International Group ( AIG ) , the world�s largest insurance company , in exchange for a nearly 80 % stake in the insurer . . . .
The Fed is buying an insurance company ?�
Where exactly is that covered in the Federal Reserve Act ? �
The Associated Press calls it a �government takeover , � but this is not your ordinary �nationalization� like the purchase of Fannie / Freddie stock by the U.S. Treasury .�
The Federal Reserve has the power to print the national money supply , but it is not actually a part of the U.S. government .�
It is a private banking corporation owned by a consortium of private banks .�
The banking industry just bought the world�s largest insurance company , and they used federal money to do it .�
Yahoo Finance reported on September 17 :
� The Treasury is setting up a temporary financing program at the Fed�s request .
The program will auction Treasury bills to raise cash for the Fed�s use .
The initiative aims to help the Fed manage its balance sheet following its efforts to enhance its liquidity facilities over the previous few quarters . �
Treasury bills are the I.O.U.s of the federal government .�
We the taxpayers are on the hook for the Fed�s �enhanced liquidity facilities , � meaning the loans it has been making to everyone in sight , bank or non-bank , exercising obscure provisions in the Federal Reserve
Act that may or may not say they can do it .�
What �s going on here ?�
Why not let the free market work ? �
Bankruptcy courts know how to sort out assets and reorganize companies so they can operate again .�
Why the extraordinary measures for Fannie , Freddie and AIG ?�
The answer may have less to do with saving the insurance business , the housing market , or the Chinese investors clamoring for a bailout than with the greatest Ponzi scheme in history , one that is holding up the entire private global banking system . �
What had to be saved at all costs was not housing or the dollar but the financial derivatives industry ; and the precipice from which it had to be saved was an �event of default� that could have collapsed a quadrillion dollar derivatives bubble , a collapse that could take the entire global banking system down with it .
The Anatomy of a Bubble
Until recently , most people had never even heard of derivatives ; but in terms of money traded , these investments represent the biggest financial market in the world . �
Derivatives are financial instruments that have no intrinsic value but derive their value from something else .�
Basically , they are just bets .�
You can �hedge your bet� that something you own will go up by placing a side bet that it will go down . �
� Hedge funds � hedge bets in the derivatives market .�
Bets can be placed on anything , from the price of tea in China to the movements of specific markets . �
� The point everyone misses , � wrote economist Robert Chapman a decade ago , �is that buying derivatives is not investing .�
It is gambling , insurance and high stakes bookmaking .�
Derivatives create nothing .
�1 � They not only create nothing , but they serve to enrich non-producers at the expense of the people who do create real goods and services .
In congressional hearings in the early 1990s , derivatives trading was challenged as being an illegal form of gambling .
But the practice was legitimized by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , who not only lent legal and regulatory support to the trade but actively promoted derivatives as a way to improve �risk management .�
Partly , this was to boost the flagging profits of the banks ; and at the larger banks and dealers , it worked .
But the cost was an increase in risk to the financial system as a whole .
2
Since then , derivative trades have grown exponentially , until now they are larger than the entire global economy .�
The Bank for International Settlements recently reported that total derivatives trades exceeded one quadrillion dollars � that �s 1,000 trillion dollars .
3�
How is that figure even possible ?�
The gross domestic product of all the countries in the world is only about 60 trillion dollars . �
The answer is that gamblers can bet as much as they want . �
They can bet money they don�t have , and that is where the huge increase in risk comes in .���
Credit default swaps ( CDS ) are the most widely traded form of credit derivative .�
CDS are bets between two parties on whether or not a company will default on its bonds . �
In a typical default swap , the �protection buyer� gets a large payoff from the �protection seller� if the company defaults within a certain period of time , while the �protection seller� collects periodic payments from the �protection buyer� for assuming the risk of default . �
CDS thus resemble insurance policies , but there is no requirement to actually hold any asset or suffer any loss , so CDS are widely used just to increase profits by gambling on market changes . �
In one blogger�s example , a hedge fund could sit back and collect $ 320,000 a year in premiums just for selling �protection� on a risky BBB junk bond .
The premiums are �free� money � free until the bond actually goes into default , when the hedge fund could be on the hook for $ 100 million in claims . �
And there�s the catch : what if the hedge fund doesn�t have the $ 100 million ? �
The fund�s corporate shell or limited partnership is put into bankruptcy ; but both parties are claiming the derivative as an asset on their books , which they now have to write down . �
Players who have �hedged their bets � by betting both ways cannot collect on their winning bets ; and that means they cannot afford to pay their losing bets , causing other players to also default on their bets . �
The dominos go down in a cascade of cross -defaults that infects the whole banking industry and jeopardizes the global pyramid scheme . �
The potential for this sort of nuclear reaction was what prompted billionaire investor Warren Buffett to call derivatives �weapons of financial mass destruction .��
It is also why the banking system cannot let a major derivatives player go down , and it is the banking system that calls the shots .�
The Federal Reserve is literally owned by a conglomerate of banks ; and Hank Paulson , who heads the U.S. Treasury , entered that position through the revolving door of investment bank Goldman Sachs , where he was formerly CEO .��
The Best Game in Town
In an article on FinancialSense.com on September 9 , Daniel Amerman maintains that the government�s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was not actually a bailout of the mortgage giants .�
It was a bailout of the financial derivatives industry , which was faced with a $ 1.4 trillion �event of default� that could have bankrupted Wall Street and much of the rest of the financial world .�
To explain the enormous risk involved , Amerman posits a scenario in which the mortgage giants are not bailed out by the government .�
When they default on the $ 5 trillion in bonds and mortgage - backed securities they own or guarantee , settlements are immediately triggered on $ 1.4 trillion in credit default swaps entered into by major financial firms , which have promised to make good on Fannie / Freddie defaulted bonds in return for very lucrative fee income and multi-million dollar bonuses .�
The value of the vulnerable bonds plummets by 70 % , causing $ 1 trillion ( 70 % of $ 1.4 trillion ) to be due to the �protection buyers .��
This is more money , however , than the already - strapped financial institutions have to spare . �
The CDS sellers are highly leveraged themselves , which means they depend on huge day - to - day lines of credit just to stay afloat . �
When their creditors see the trillion dollar hit coming , they pull their financing , leaving the strapped institutions with massive portfolios of illiquid assets .�
The dreaded cascade of cross - defaults begins , until nearly every major investment bank and commercial bank is unable to meet its obligations .�
This triggers another massive round of CDS events , going to $ 10 trillion , then $ 20 trillion . �
The financial centers become insolvent , the markets have to be shut down , and when they open months later , the stock market has been crushed .�
The federal government and the financiers pulling its strings naturally feel compelled to step in to prevent such a disaster , even though this rewards the profligate speculators at the expense of the Fannie / Freddie shareholders who will get wiped out .�
Amerman concludes :
� [ I ] t�s the best game in town .
Take a huge amount of risk , be paid exceedingly well for it and if you screw up -- you have absolute proof that the government will come in and bail you out at the expense of the rest of the population ( who did not share in your profits in the first place ) .

Desperate Measures for Desperate Times
It was the best game in town until September 14 , when Treasury Secretary Paulson , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , and New York Fed Head Tim Geithner closed the bailout window to Lehman Brothers , a 158 - year - old Wall Street investment firm and major derivatives player .�
Why ?�
� There is no political will for a federal bailout , � said Geithner . �
Bailing out Fannie and Freddie had created a furor of protest , and the taxpayers could not afford to underwrite the whole quadrillion dollar derivatives bubble .�
The line had to be drawn somewhere , and this was apparently it . �
Or was the Fed just saving its ammunition for AIG ?�
Recent downgrades in AIG�s ratings � meant that the counterparties to its massive derivatives contracts could force it to come up with $ 10.5 billion in additional capital reserves immediately or file for bankruptcy . �
Treasury Secretary Paulson resisted advancing taxpayer money ; but on Monday , September 15 , stock trading was ugly , with the S & P 500 registering the largest one - day percent drop since September 11 , 2001 . �
Alan Kohler wrote in the Australian Business Spectator :
� [ I ] t�s unlikely to be a slow - motion train wreck this time .
With Lehman in liquidation , and Washington Mutual and AIG on the brink , the credit market would likely shut down entirely and interbank lending would cease .
�5
Kohler quoted the September 14 newsletter of Professor Nouriel Roubini , who has a popular website called Global EconoMonitor .�
Roubini warned :
� What we are facing now is the beginning of the unravelling and collapse of the entire shadow financial system , a system of institutions ( broker dealers , hedge funds , private equity funds , SIVs , conduits , etc. ) that look like banks ( as they borrow short , are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and in illiquid ways ) and thus are highly vulnerable to bank - like runs ; but unlike banks they are not properly regulated and supervised , they don�t have access to deposit insurance and don�t have access to the lender of last resort support of the central bank . �
The risk posed to the system was evidently too great .�
On September 16 , while Barclay�s Bank was offering to buy the banking divisions of Lehman Brothers , the Federal Reserve agreed to bail out AIG in return for 80 % of its stock . �
Why the Federal Reserve instead of the U.S. Treasury ?�
Perhaps because the Treasury would take too much heat for putting yet more taxpayer money on the line .�
The Federal Reserve could do it quietly through its � Open Market Operations , � the ruse by which it �monetizes � government debt , turning Treasury bills ( government I.O.U.s ) into dollars .
� The taxpayers would still have to pick up the tab , but the Federal Reserve would not have to get approval from Congress first .
Time for a 21st Century New Deal ?
Another hole has been plugged in a very leaky boat , keeping it afloat another day ; but how long can these stopgap measures be sustained ?�
Professor Roubini maintains :
� The step by step , ad hoc and non-holistic approach of Fed and Treasury to crisis management has been a failure .
. . .
[ P] lugging and filling one hole at [ a ] time is useless when the entire system of levies is collapsing in the perfect financial storm of the century .
A much more radical , holistic and systemic approach to crisis management is now necessary .�6
We may soon hear that � the credit market is frozen� � that there is no money to keep homeowners in their homes , workers gainfully employed , or infrastructure maintained . �
But this is not true .�
The underlying source of all money is government credit � our own public credit . �
We don�t need to borrow it from the Chinese or the Saudis or private banks .�
The government can issue its own credit � the �full faith and credit of the United States .��
That was the model followed by the Pennsylvania colonists in the eighteenth century , and it worked brilliantly well .�
Before the provincial government came up with this plan , the Pennsylvania economy was languishing .�
There was little gold to conduct trade , and the British bankers were charging 8 % interest to borrow what was available .�
The government solved the credit problem by issuing and lending its own paper scrip . �
A publicly - owned bank lent the money to farmers at 5 % interest . �
The money was returned to the government , preventing inflation ; and the interest paid the government�s expenses , replacing taxes . �
During the period the system was in place , the economy flourished , prices remained stable , and the Pennsylvania colonists paid no taxes at all . �

Today�s credit crisis is very similar to that facing Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s .�
In 1932 , President Hoover set up the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) as a federally - owned bank that would bail out commercial banks by extending loans to them , much as the privately - owned Federal Reserve is doing today . �
But like today , Hoover�s ploy failed .�
The banks did not need more loans ; they were already drowning in debt .�
They needed customers with money to spend and invest .�
President Roosevelt used Hoover�s new government - owned lending facility to extend loans where they were needed most � for housing , agriculture and industry . �
Many new federal agencies were set up and funded by the RFC , including the HOLC ( Home Owners Loan Corporation ) and Fannie Mae ( the Federal National Mortgage Association , which was then a government - owned agency ) . �
In the 1940s , the RFC went into overdrive funding the infrastructure necessary for the U.S. to participate in World War II , setting the country up with the infrastructure it needed to become the world�s industrial leader after the war . �
The RFC was a government - owned bank that sidestepped the privately - owned Federal Reserve ; but unlike the Pennsylvania provincial government , which originated the money it lent , the RFC had to borrow the money first .�
The RFC was funded by issuing government bonds and relending the proceeds .�
Then as now , new money entered the money supply chiefly in the form of private bank loans . �
In a �fractional reserve� banking system , banks are allowed to lend their �reserves � many times over , effectively multiplying the amount of money in circulation . �
Today a system of public banks might be set up on the model of the RFC to fund productive endeavors � industry , agriculture , housing , energy -- but we could go a step further than the RFC and give the new public banks the power to create credit themselves , just as the Pennsylvania government did and as private banks do now . �
At the rate banks are going into FDIC receivership , the federal government will soon own a string of banks , which it might as well put to productive use . �
Establishing a new RFC might be an easier move politically than trying to nationalize the Federal Reserve , but that is what should properly , logically be done . �
If we the taxpayers are putting up the money for the Fed to own the world�s largest insurance company , we should own the Fed .
Proposals for reforming the banking system are not even on the radar screen of Prime Time politics today ; but the current system is collapsing at train - wreck speed , and the �change� called for in Washington may soon be taking a direction undreamt of a few years ago . �
We need to stop funding the culprits who brought us this debacle at our expense .�
We need a public banking system that makes a cost - effective credit mechanism available for homeowners , manufacturing , renewable energy , and infrastructure ; and the first step to making it cost - effective is to strip out the swarms of gamblers , fraudsters and profiteers now gaming the system .
Ellen Brown , J.D. , developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles .
In Web of Debt , her latest book , she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and � the money trust .�
She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves , and how we the people can get it back .
Her eleven books include the bestselling Nature�s Pharmacy , co-authored with Dr. Lynne Walker , and Forbidden Medicine .
In the first case to review the government ’s secret evidence for holding a detainee at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , a federal appeals court found that accusations against a Muslim from western China held for more than six years were based on bare and unverifiable claims .
The unclassified parts of the decision were released on Monday .
With some derision for the Bush administration ’s arguments , a three - judge panel said the government contended that its accusations against the detainee should be accepted as true because they had been repeated in at least three secret documents .
The court compared that to the absurd declaration of a character in the Lewis Carroll poem “ The Hunting of the Snark ” : “ I have said it thrice :
What I tell you three times is true . ”
“ This comes perilously close to suggesting that whatever the government says must be treated as true , ” said the panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
Bottom line
Patients have been fed genetically modified ( GM ) Russet Burbank potatoes in an experiment to determine their nutritional effects on the human body .
Developed by Monsanto , a multinational biotech company , the potatoes , modified to resist Colorado beetles , were dispensed to Russian heart and blood pressure patients as part of a recent study .

This experiment is detailed in an unpublished report by the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Science . •
The report describes the patients as " volunteers " and states that they are " suffering from hypertensive disease and ischemic heart disease . " •
According to the research , rats that ate similar potatoes suffered reductions in the weight of their hearts and prostate glands , but all changes were " within permissible physiological fluctuation . " •
These same rats suffered " increases of kidneys ' absolute weight " when compared to ones fed conventional potatoes .
•
Some scientists believe that the trials were too short , and performed on too few humans , to produce meaningful results of long - term effects . •
" A certain risk of GM food products for human health does exist , as there can be by - effects of inserted genes besides the designed ones , " according to the report . •
The report concludes : " The genetically modified potato provided by Monsanto did not reveal toxic , mutagenic , immune modulating and allergic effects within the examined parameters of the present experiment " . •
Last year alone , over 10 million farmers grew 250 million acres of GM crops in 22 countries - home to over half the worlds population , according to The Guardian

Subjecting sick and diseased humans to these unnatural foods in " volunteer " clinical trials is a violation of medical ethics standards .
When you 're building a jet that exponentially accelerates past Mach 6 -- as one does -- you need to come up with a way to get it off the ground .
Scramjets , or Constant Volume Combustion ( CVC ) engines , use compressed air and a reduced nozzle to accelerate planes , and they 're a hot technology in aviation .
Problem is , you have to get them to Mach 4 before the magic happens .
Traditionally , scramjet tests have involved strapping the craft to supersonic jets to get the jet up to speed -- not a very cost - effective solution .
DARPA has come up with a hybrid engine design called Vulcan that can power a craft like the Falcon HTV - 3X to the magical point with a turbo jet and then switch to the CVC to get the craft to the promised land .
They expect to have a working prototype by 2012 .

YouTube video exposes cop who attempted to cover up assault on bicyclist

" Cyclists here already face enough obstacles , " said New York City Councilman David Yassky .
" Law enforcement should n't be one of them . "
A New York City police officer has been placed behind a desk after being caught on tape deliberately pushing a man off of his bike during a Friday Critical Mass event in Times Square .
Patrick Pogan , a 22 - year - old rookie cop , former football offensive lineman and son of a retired NYPD detective , claimed in court documents that 29 - year - old Christopher Long of Bloomfield , New Jersey was " forcing multiple vehicles to stop abruptly or change their direction to avoid hitting the defendant . "
Pogan also alleged that Long knocked him to the ground after deliberately aiming the bicycle towards him .
Video uploaded to YouTube appears to contradict that claim , showing Pogan moving in front of Long as he attempted to ride past the line of officers , and shoving Long to the ground .
The footage , the New York Daily News noted , " clearly shows Long trying to dodge Pogan , who appears to have remained upright the entire time . "
" The police officer looked to see who he was going to pick off , " said witness 54 - year - old Craig Radhuber .
" All of a sudden the cop picked this kid out and bodychecked him ... I could n't believe what was going on . "
" If it was n't caught on video people would not have believed it , " rider and documentary filmmaker Christopher Ryan added .
" The video just shows what the cyclists have been saying all along , that the police are still harassing and intimidating them from doing group rides . "
Long was charged with attempted assault in the third degree , resisting arrest , and disorderly conduct .
He was held for 26 hours .
" The video speaks for itself , " Long 's attorney told Gothamist .
Norman Siegel , civil rights attorney and former counsel for enviromental activist group TIME'S UP ! , added his opinion that the video footage showed " unacceptable illegal behavior by this particular police officer . "
" I 'm proud of my son , " said Patrick Pogan Sr. , retired NYPD detective and former Joint Terrorism Task Force member .
" He 's a good kid . "

Your tires are definitely overinflated .
It 's best to stick with the inflation pressure listed on the car 's door frame or in the owner 's manual .
The maximum pressure figure on the tire sidewall is more an indication of the tire 's load limits that of the correct inflation level for everyday driving .

7 , July 2008 .
[ Openly accessible draft here ]
The July IEEE Computer carries an article arguing for the use of scripting languages as first programming languages , and also arguing for a greater study of what the author calls " language pragmatics " ( the original article is behind the IEEE paywall , but you can find a draft that has roughly the same content here ) .
The argument for using scripting languages as educational languages can be summed up by Loui 's abstract :
The author recommends that scripting , not Java , be taught first , asserting that students should learn to love their own possibilities before they learn to loathe other people 's restrictions .
The bulk of the article is devoted to exploring this basic theme in more depth , and provides an interesting contrast to the arguments in favor of moving away from Java ( and scripting languages ) advanced in
The bulk of the article is devoted to exploring this basic theme in more depth , and provides an interesting contrast to the arguments in favor of moving away from Java ( and scripting languages ) advanced in Computer Science Education : Where Are the Software Engineers of Tomorrow ?
( discussed earlier on LtU here ) .
Loui spends the latter part of the article arguing that , in addition to syntax and semantics , research on programming language should include a formal study of language pragmatics .
According to Loui , a formal study of pragmatics would address questions such as :
What is the average lifetime of a program written in language X for programmers of type Y , for a program of type Z ?
What is the average time spent authoring versus debugging a program in language X for programmers of type Y , for a program of type Z ?
What is the consumption of short - term memory when programming in language X for programmers of type Y , for a program of type Z? Comment viewing options

Congressmembers say Chinese hacked Capitol computers
Two longtime House members say computers in their Capitol Hill offices have been hacked by sources apparently working out of China .
Virginia Rep. Frank
Wolf says four of his computers were hacked .
New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith says two of his computers were compromised .
The two lawmakers are longtime critics of Beijing .
In an interview Wednesday , Wolf said the hacking of four computers in his Capitol Hill office began in August 2006 .
He says a computer at a House committee office also was hacked .
Wolf suggests that the problem could be more widespread .
He says that if House computers have been hacked , " do n't you think they 're doing the same thing in the Senate ? "
A spokesman for Wolf says the four computers in his office were being used by staff members working on human rights issues .
The Virginia Republican wants hearings in both the House and the Senate because he fears there could be members of Congress who " may not even know " their computers have been compromised .
The FBI has declined immediate comment .
SANDPOINT , Idaho -- Bill Sali is defying the political odds by making Idaho 's first - district congressional race competitive .

But ...
There is no doubt that some of our most popular lists are ones which revolve around mystery and intrigue .
Fortunately for us all , there is no end to the number of weird and wonderful mysteries in the world , so we are now able to present our fourth list of unsolved mysteries .
So – onwards to the world of the mysterious !
10 The Grooved Spheres
Over the last few decades , miners in South Africa have been digging up mysterious metal spheres .
Origin unknown , these spheres measure approximately an inch or so in diameter , and some are etched with three parallel grooves running around the equator .
Two types of spheres have been found : one is composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white ; the other is hollowed out and filled with a spongy white substance .
The kicker is that the rock in which they where found is Precambrian – and dated to 2.8 billion years old !
Who made them and for what purpose is unknown .
9 The Dropa Stones
In 1938 , an archaeological expedition led by Dr. Chi Pu Tei into the Baian - Kara - Ula mountains of China made an astonishing discovery in some caves that had apparently been occupied by some ancient culture .
Buried in the dust of ages on the cave floor were hundreds of stone disks .
Measuring about nine inches in diameter , each had a circle cut into the center and was etched with a spiral groove , making it look for all the world like some ancient phonograph record some 10,000 to 12,000 years old .
The spiral groove , it turns out , is actually composed of tiny hieroglyphics that tell the incredible story of spaceships from some distant world that crash - landed in the mountains .
The ships were piloted by people who called themselves the Dropa , and the remains of whose descendants , possibly , were found in the cave .
8 The Ica Stones
Beginning in the 1930s , the father of Dr. Javier Cabrera , Cultural Anthropologist for Ica , Peru , discovered many hundreds of ceremonial burial stones in the tombs of the ancient Incas .
Dr. Cabrera , carrying on his father ’s work , has collected more than 1,100 of these andesite stones , which are estimated to be between 500 and 1,500 years old and have become known collectively as the Ica Stones .
The stones bear etchings , many of which are sexually graphic ( which was common to the culture ) , some picture idols and others depict such practices as open - heart surgery and brain transplants .
The most astonishing etchings , however , clearly represent dinosaurs – brontosaurs , triceratops ( see photo ) , stegosaurus and pterosaurs .
While sceptics consider the Ica Stones a hoax , their authenticity has neither been proved or disproved .
7 Giant Stone Balls of Costa Rica
Workmen hacking and burning their way through the dense jungle of Costa Rica to clear an area for banana plantations in the 1930s stumbled upon some incredible objects : dozens of stone balls , many of which were perfectly spherical .
They varied in size from as small as a tennis ball to an astonishing 8 feet in diameter and weighing 16 tons !
Although the great stone balls are clearly man-made , it is unknown who made them , for what purpose and , most puzzling , how they achieved such spherical precision .
6 Oera Linda Book
The Oera Linda Book is a controversial Frisian manuscript covering historical , mythological , and religious themes that first came to light in the 19th century .
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include catastrophism , nationalism , matriarchy , and mythology .
The text alleges that Europe and other lands were , for most of their history , ruled by a succession of folk - mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess Frya , daughter of the supreme god Wr-alda and Irtha , the earth mother .
The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet which was the ancestor of Greek and Phoenician alphabets .
The current manuscript carries a date of 1256 .
Internal claims suggest that it is a copy of older manuscripts that , if genuine , would have been written by multiple people between 2194 BC and AD 803 .

5 Impossible Fossils
Fossils , as we learned in grade school , appear in rocks that were formed many thousands of years ago .
Yet there are a number of fossils that just do n’t make geological or historical sense .
A fossil of a human hand print for example , was found in limestone estimated to be 110 million years old .
What appears to be a fossilized human finger found in the Canadian Arctic also dates back 100 to 110 million years ago .
And what appears to be the fossil of a human footprint , possibly wearing a sandal , was found near Delta , Utah in a shale deposit estimated to be 300 million to 600 million years old .
4 Out - of - Place Metal Objects
Humans were not even around 65 million years ago , never mind people who could work metal .
So then how does science explain semi-ovoid metallic tubes dug out of 65 - million - year - old Cretaceous chalk in France ?
In 1885 , a block of coal was broken open to find a metal cube obviously worked by intelligent hands .
In 1912 , employees at an electric plant broke apart a large chunk of coal out of which fell an iron pot !
A nail was found embedded in a sandstone block from the Mesozoic Era .
And there are many , many more such anomalies .
3 Ark Of The Covenant
The Ark is considered the greatest of all hidden treasures and its discovery would provide indisputable truth that the Old Testament is hard fact .
Its recovery remains the goal of every modern archaeologist and adventurer .
Its purpose was as a container for the ten commandments given on stone tablets by God to Moses on Mount Sinai .
According to the book of Exodus , the Ark is made of shittim wood ( similar to acacia ) and gold - covered inside and out .
It was topped by a mercy seat comprising two cherubs also made of gold .
It was believed to have supernatural powers due to several events , including causing the death of a man , who attempted to steady the Ark as the oxen hauling it stumbled , bringing down the walls of Jericho in one battle , and showering misfortune on the Philistines after they captured it in another .
There are several speculations around the final resting place of the Ark , and whilst it would take a shrewd operator to find it , it would need a brave or even foolhardy person to open it !
2 Angel Hair
Angel Hair is a rare phenomenon that has so far defied explanation .
It is made up of silken threads that rain down on to the earth , but reach out to touch it and it will almost certainly vanish before your eyes .
It is a world wide phenomenon with the most regular occurrences from North America , New Zealand , Australia , and western Europe .
There is no known proof for what causes this substance , or even what it is made up of .
Speculations are that it has come from Spiders or another type of silk - spinning insect , and even UFO ’s as it has often been associated with UFO sightings .
Because of its sensitive nature , it has been difficult to collect , and to analyse as it is subject to contamination from car exhaust fumes , and even human contact , which could skew the chemical results .
1 Piri Reis map
The Piri Reis Map is a famous pre-modern world map created by 16th century Ottoman - Turkish admiral and cartographer Piri Reis .
The map shows part of the western coasts of Europe and North Africa with reasonable accuracy , and the coast of Brazil is also easily recognizable .
Various Atlantic islands including the Azores and Canary Islands are depicted , as is the mythical island of Antillia .
The map is noteworthy for its depiction of a southern landmass that some controversially claim is evidence for early awareness of the existence of Antarctica .
Some scholars claim this and other maps support a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilization .

Remember when Apple got shady with Windows users by pushing out Safari via its own software update tool to everyone , even if you did n't have it installed already ?
Windows users are now up in arms again about iTunes 7.7 bringing along an unwanted MobileMe control panel without asking , and I do n't blame them .
Granted , a control panel is not the same as an entire application , but getting loaded up with extra software that you do n't want is still a shady move .
And unfortunately , that 's just the start of MobileMe 's pushiness .

A HIGH -RANKING commander who armed and led Janjaweed militiamen in attacks on hundreds of villages in Darfur has come forward to say he did so at the behest of the Sudanese Government .
Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court are today expected to take a significant step towards putting Sudan 's leaders on trial by presenting evidence against the President , Omar Hassan al - Bashir .
As the lawyers pursue a case against the country 's rulers in Khartoum , some of the most damning evidence yet that the killing was directed by the Government has been provided by Arbab Idries , who was a commander between 2003 and 2007 .
Men 's battered honour has been documented all over the place these past few days .
Kathleen Parker led the field with her book Save the Males : Why Men Matter , Why Women Should Care .
" Men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all life 's ills , " avers Parkers in a text that had the Sunday papers transfixed .
Yesterday in the Mail , Richard Littlejohn took Michael Vaughan , the former England cricket captain , as both a symptom of and a contributor to our weak - minded , feminised society , which attacks masculinity at every turn , reinforcing failure with cooing sympathy , drugging macho life force with Ritalin .
Poor cricketer .
All he did was shed a tear for his lost career , and he singlehandedly undid our last few threads of cultural resilience .
But there I go again with my cooing sympathy .
While Vaughan was drying his eyes , Michael Gove , shadow secretary of state for children , was making a rather rangy speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research in which he blamed lads ' mags for encouraging young men to have sex hedonistically - ergo failing to understand that women were n't a pleasure , they were a duty , ergo creating single - parent family units .
It all seemed a bit Jesuitical to me .
The missing link that stops an enjoyable act of sexual congress becoming a one - parent family is a contraceptive device , not a respectable magazine culture , surely ?
You can pick holes in these arguments all you like , and I will just take a second out , and do so .
If men work an average 41.9 hours a week and women , 37.6 hours , this is not , as the American " masculinist " and " men 's rights author " Warren Farrell told the Observer , a sign that women have more power over their lives .
It is simply a reflection that they do more of the childcare .
Mothers spend 12 % more time than fathers looking after children , and women generally spend 78 % more time on housework than men .
I am personally in favour of lower standards of hygiene to solve this battle of the gender war , but that 's a minority view .
Still it 's not , I hope , as extreme a conclusion as Farrell 's : " I define power as ' control over one 's life ' .
A balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power : earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner . "
If , as a mother , you are described as " spending someone else 's money " just by bringing up your mutually begat children , that does n't seem to me like a powerful position at all .
Here 's the problem - when you get into a battle of the sexes , both sides have grievances .
Society tends to denigrate men more openly than it does women , but then women are portrayed so routinely as hunks of flesh to be measured out by the pound that we only notice it happening to men because it 's aberrant .
Ultimately , you can carry on about culture , and what it does to self - esteem , how people see fathers , how they see mothers , how parents see themselves and one another ; you can argue about this stuff forever .
You might say boys were discriminated against by the GCSE system .
I would return , who 's to say they did n't just work less hard ?
You might say that culture was fuelling male neurosis , to the degree that 25 % of eating disorders now occur among men ; I would reply that 75 % are still women .
I 'm as guilty of this retort reflex as anyone .
Derisive portrayals of women by mainstream culture enrage me .
Arguments like those of Farrell make me furious .
It 's like a messy divorce in macrocosm : you lose any sense of justice in the proliferation of small outrages .
The only reason feminism gained any ground at all is that there was measurable injustice at the heart of it .
There was a pay gap ; there was an opportunities gap ; there was a straightforward power void , where a woman was fine if she stayed the right side of her husband .
The big mistake of this movement was not that it attacked men , nor that it turned us all into slags ( I think that 's at the core of Gove 's point ) , but that it separated itself from socialism .
It should n't have .
This movement either fights for fairness on behalf of all women , or it's just a petty squabble between middle - class people , fighting for dominance in a conversation no one else is listening to .
Fairness has not yet been established .
Women still earn less than men ( 14 % less full - time , 34 % less part - time ) , still look after the children in 93 % of parental separations , wo n't have fiscal equality in old age from the pension system for about 45 years .
Men are ill - served by the NHS and die of unnecessary cancers , while women are screened much more often .
Let 's attack this stuff that we can measure , attack it even if we 're not the victims of it , attack it even if it 's conflicting , here favouring men , there favouring women , attack it because its tangibility is an open flank .
The rest is just noise .

GlobalSign has revoked the digital certificate of a rogue security application , which acquired the veneer of respectability by parading the credentials while trying to scam users .
Antivirus XP 2008 , identified as malware by Sunbelt Software and other security firms , was digitally signed by Globalsign .
Alerted by The Register on Friday , GlobalSign acted promptly to revoke the certificate , pending an investigation .
In a statement , GlobalSign said that digital code signing only establishes the origin of a piece of software , not whether or not it is malicious .
" Like all CAs [ certificate authorities ] , GlobalSign vets a company within strict guidelines , but we cannot form an opinion on the software they sign with the issued certificate .
While we cannot provide a guarantee around the quality of the software , the certificate does provide proof of which company is responsible for the software , and therefore provides traceability to any parties using that software .
This traceability allows us to perform an appropriate investigation . "
" The concept of code signing certificates from any CA , whoever they are , is designed to provide assurances of origin of the software , but cannot express that it is virus - free , bug - free or malware - free , " it added .
XP Antivirus 2008 is a well - known counterfeit antispyware program .
Distributed through malware - tainted files , which commonly pose as video codecs , the software generates fake and misleading popup messages in an attempt to scare users into buying the package .
The software has been the topic of warnings from the likes of CA ( here ) and the subject of numerous removal tutorials on the web .
There 's even a YouTube video ( below ) .
A simple Google search would have revealed something amiss with Antivirus XP 2008 .
So we can credit GlobalSign ony with moving promptly to nip the problem in the bud .
The company told us the steps it took once it was alerted to the misuse of its code signing certificate .
" GlobalSign was made aware of this alleged misuse of a code signing certificate on 15 August at approximately 14:00 .
The vetting archive was immediately checked to determine what was file for the company LLC AJSBIRI .
We were found to have the appropriate company documentation and incorporation documentation needed to vet the origin and existence of a company in line with the practice statement for vetting code signing certificate applicants . "
" Within an hour of the reported incident we had attempted to examine the executable .
However , the site was no longer live .
After an unsuccessful attempt to contact the company by telephone we decided the best course of action in the short term would be to revoke the certificate .
The investigation will continue with the company in question to determine why they had potentially been in breach of the subscriber agreement for permitted use of the code signing certificate , " it added . ®
Bootnote
A hat tip to Sunbelt for altering us about the appearance of more digitally - signed malware .
Previous reported examples of the phenomenon include a certificate from VeriSign for an ActiveX install of 180 Search Assistant , a notorious adware package , that offered " Free Porn Access By 180 Search Tools " .
The list is correct .
Battletoads is , without question , THE most difficult game ever made .
Those of you who disagree obviously have n't played the whole thing because while the regular stages are realitively easy , the " bonus " cycle stages are completely impossible .
Also other ports of battletoads ( arcade , snes , ect ... ) are NOT the same , they are quite easy as they came out later and people complained about the original 's difficulty .
So if we wanna get technical , devil may cry 3 was n't the first game to get re-released due to difficulty , battletoads was .
So great list , but I 've gotta wonder ... who is doing the voice over for these things and why is n't he fired ?
Gotta be the most unprofessional voice work I 've ever heard , the dialog is terrible , pronounciations are often wrong and oh yeah " shoomup " is NOT a real word and should never be used in spoken language if you want to be taken seriously .
Saying it out loud in such a serious voice is the equivelent of Dan Rather calmly saying " Doodie Poo Poo Pants " three times for no reason in the middle of a news segment .
Ah , the end of summer .
Just in time for Labor Day road trips , Tropical Storm Gustav ’s approach is sending oil prices up again .
Oil has inched past $ 116 , in large part on fears that Gustav will hit the U.S. Gulf Coast – ground zero of the country ’s oil infrastructure – as a major hurricane .

Advertisement A row has broken out at the University of Manchester after its students ' union toilets were " de- gendered " .
Temporary signs have made the " ladies " simply " toilets " , while the " gents " have become " toilets with urinals " .
The changes are in response to an unspecified number of complaints from trans students who are uncomfortable using the men 's toilets .
A university newspaper criticised the move but the student union said it was needed to tackle transphobia .
There are no figures on the number of transsexual and transgender students believed to be among the university 's population of more than 35,000 students .
The students ' union welfare office declined to reveal the number of complaints , but said it was an important issue .
A student newspaper editorial questioned the wisdom of the move Women 's officer Jennie Killip told the BBC : " If you were born female , still present quite feminine , but define as a man you should be able to go into the men 's toilets - if that 's how you define .
" You do n't necessarily have had to have gender reassignment surgery , but you could just define yourself as a man , feel very masculine in yourself , feel that in fact being a woman is not who you are . "
Asked about the change , some female students questioned the move .
One said : " Girls might not want to use the same toilets as boys , so then you just end up with people complaining about that - so you can't really win .
Another told the BBC : " I personally would n't want to be in the same toilet as a man . "
The move prompted an editorial in campus newspaper Student Direct last week which criticised the new arrangements .
Newspaper spokeswoman Susannah Birkwood said : " The toilets have been provided for men who do n't self identify as men and women who do n't think of themselves as women .
" Whether or not this is political correctness gone mad .. because it certainly seems that way to some members of our student community . "
Union officials have rejected the criticism and permanent signs for its first gender neutral toilets are being made .
Almost 60 people , including Ms Killip , have signed a letter to the student newspaper criticising the editorial .

The best wilderness survival gear on the market !
Backyard campers and Rambo wannabe's ... go buy a Bear Grylls kit .
When you get serious about your wilderness activities ... come see my gear .
Hikers , mountain bikers , cross country skiers , ATV 'ers , off - roaders , and others whose activities carry them far and wide ... discriminating outdoorsmen opt for quality gear .
Survival Myths - Foreword
There are many myths surrounding the subject of wilderness survival .
It 's one of the biggest reasons that I started this site 5 or 6 years ago .
I wanted to dispel these myths , expose them for what they are , and bring some sense of reality and practicality back into the subject .
Many of these myths are highlighted elsewhere on this site , but I decided to put the best ones here on a single page .
Enjoy !
FIRE MYTHS
Survival Matches - I see " waterproof survival matches " listed in more kits than I care to count , and I gotta say ... terrible idea .
While it may add a sense of drama to a movie when " Rambo " is down to his last couple matches , you do n't need that kind of drama if you 're in a life or death situation !
The space and weight taken up in a kit or in your pocket by a dozen " survival " matches would be better filled with a small Bic lighter .
A lighter will start a LOT more fires than those few matches .
If you 're worried about the lighter failing , then bring a magnesium fire starter .
These are 100 % waterproof , will light thousands of fires , and the magnesium burns a lot hotter than matches .
Flashlight Method -
This is a method I 've seen by which you can break the bulb of your flashlight , and then use the coil inside to light a fire .
Simply put ... give it a shot in your backyard and you 'll find that it 's great at destroying flashlights but terrible at actually starting fires !
Recommendation ... bring a lighter , and use your flashlight for ...
LIGHT !
Ice Lens Method -
Can you start a fire with a lens that you fashion from ice ?
Probably not .
Scientifically , it 's possible , but in all practical sense , the odds are really slim to none .
Seriously , give it a try in the comfort of your own backyard on a nice warm day .
Feel free to let me know how well this works .
Also , while you 're wasting hours on this , imagine that you 're also freezing to death in a snowy , icy environment .
You 'll quickly realize that this is a colossal waste of your time and energy , and you wo n't get a fire going .
I guarantee you that .
Recommendation ... bring a lighter !
Soda & Candy Bar Method -
This fire starting method is yet another fun science experiment , but in actual use , it 's another colossal waste of time , at the end of which ... you 'll have no fire .
If you 're lounging in your backyard someday and suddenly decide that you 'd like to piss away the entire afternoon on some fruitless endeavor , go ahead and give this a shot .
However ... in a real survival situation ... eat the friggin ' candy bar and be glad for it .
Drink the friggin ' soda and rejoice .
Be glad for those precious calories , and then keep the can as a canteen and cooking vessel .
Recommendation ... bring a damn lighter !
SHELTER MYTHS
High Ground is Warmer -
This is one survival tale that keeps popping up all over the place .
We 're told that when considering locations for a shelter , we should avoid valleys and low lying areas because cold settles there and it may be several degrees colder than higher ground .
This is scientifically sound , but in actual practice ... it 's pure , unadulterated bullshit .
This is because while a thermometer may show a few degrees difference between two elevations , thermometers are incapable of measuring wind chill factors .
In most cases , higher elevations are exposed to a lot more wind while small valleys and lower areas are sheltered from it .
A thermometer may show that actual air temperature has increased 2 or 3 degrees by moving to higher ground , but the temperature as far as your body is concerned is likely to have dropped by 20 or 30 degrees .
Wind will suck away your body heat faster than you can generate it .
Today as I write this , it 's almost 50 degrees and sunny outside ... a seemingly nice March afternoon .
However , today 's wind chill factor drops that to somewhere between 20 and 30 ... and suddenly it 's not so great !
Now consider what happens once you get a fire going .
Most fires will quickly heat the surrounding area , but when you have some wind factored in , most of that heat is carried off .
Also remember that a fire in the wind is going to consume about twice as much wood .
You 'll spend most of your time and energy finding firewood , and then get very little heat as a reward !
Not a very good tradeoff .
As such , one of your primary concerns is to find a place that 's very sheltered from the wind and elements , and then build yourself a nice , warm fire to keep you warm !
Shelters Should Be Built From Dead Materials -
This one came from our friends in the " green " survival movement .
They are far more concerned that a few trees might get killed than they are about your life .
All advice from them should be considered highly suspect .
Imagine building your shelter as a big pile of dead leaves and wood .
Now imagine having a campfire anywhere near that .
Do you really want to climb in there and go to sleep ?
Nuff ' said .
WATER MYTHS
Boil for 10 Minutes -
This is one so old , I do n't even know where it came from .
I 've also heard 5 minutes , 15 minutes and even 20 minutes of boiling time .
All of these are bullshit .
I 'll keep this short ... if the water reaches boiling point , it 's safe to drink , period , end of story .
Divining Rods -
This is another old wives tale .
Use your common sense and you 'll probably find water .
Use a forked stick and " mystical psychic powers " , and you may find yourself very dead .
I 've heard people claim that a divining rod is simply tapping into one 's subconscious thoughts .
I suppose if you 're some sort of walking emotional wreck who keeps every shred of logic and common sense buried away in your subconscious ... then sure ... go ahead and wave your stick .
Hold a seance while you 're at it .
Maybe the spirits will tell you where to find water .
The rest of us ( sane folks ) will simply think our way through the situation .
Common sense says water runs downhill .
If you walk downhill , you 're pretty likely to find water .
Birds and animal trails can also lead you to water ... they need it as much as you do .
FOOD MYTHS
Plants Are a Good Source of Food in the Wilderness - Unless you 're a certified expert not just in plants , but in the plants of the given region you happen to be in , stay the hell away from the plants !
Here 's the facts ...
- ALL fur bearing mammals are safe to eat , and will provide you with nutrients and calories .
- ALL 6 legged insects are safe to eat , and will provide you with nutrients and calories .
- Almost all freshwater fish and almost all birds are safe to eat , and will provide you with nutrients and calories .
... and finally
- MOST plants will harm you , make you sick , or worse ... poison you .
There are actually very few that will provide you with any nutrients or calories .
It 's a simple equation ... if it walks , crawls , swims , or flies , the odds are in your favor that it 's not only safe to eat , but that it will provide you with the nutrition and energy your body needs .
If it sits there like ... umm ... like a plant , the odds are against you both for your own physical safety , and for nutritional content .
It 's just not worth the gamble unless you 're absolutely sure !

Police have had to intervene to protect Italy 's Roma community Human rights group Amnesty International has said it is extremely alarmed by what it calls a " climate of discrimination " in Italy .
The Italian section of the rights body said recent tough new immigration measures were a worrying trend .
It added that politicians from both sides of the spectrum were legitimising the use of racist language .
Last week , Italy 's new centre - right government introduced a series of measures aimed at improving security .
Illegal immigration will become punishable by up to four years in prison , it will be easier to expel illegal immigrants and there will be a three - year prison sentence for using minors to beg for money .
Attacks on Roma
But the head of Amnesty International in Italy , Daniela Carboni , said the moves represented " heavy restrictions and new crimes that will target , above all , immigrants " .
She said the organisation was particularly worried by the measure that would mean attempted illegal immigrants could be held for up to 18 months in a detention centre .
" Amnesty International is extremely alarmed both by the contents and haste of these measures ... and by the climate of discrimination which preceded them , " Ms Carboni said in the report .
2007 was characterised by the impotence of Western governments
Amnesty International annual report World ' failing on human rights '
There is deep suspicion throughout the country of the Roma community , whom many Italians blame for a disproportionate amount of crime .
In mid-May Italian police were forced to intervene to protect Roma Gypsies who came under attack from local residents in Naples , who set their camps alight .
Ms Carboni urged the Italian government to investigate fully the torching of the two Roma slum communities .
In April 's national elections the centre - right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi - which includes the anti-immigration Northern League and the post - Fascist Alleanza Nazionale - swept to victory , pledging to tackle illegal immigration .
In Rome , Gianni Alemanno , also of the Alleanza Nazionale , was elected mayor on a pledge to expel 20,000 people .

What are these ?
If you are familiar with group rings , you might think that the title of this post is false .
If G is a nonabelian group , multiplying the basis elements g and h in can yield , so we have a problem .
In general , if you have a problem that you ca n’t solve , you should cheat and change it to a solvable one ( According to my advisor , this strategy is due to Alexander the Great ) .
Today , we will change the definition of commutative to make things work .
Given a group G , the group ring is defined to be the free abelian group whose generating basis is given by the elements of G , and with “ convolution ” multiplication .
In coordinates , this means
These sums make sense , because they have finitely many nonzero summands .
In general , we can ask for the coefficients to be elements in other rings , like , and these are still called group rings .
What does it mean for a ring to be commutative ?
Normally , we would say that for any two elements a and b , we have ab = ba .
I ’d like to phrase this more categorically , without referring to individual elements .
Multiplication in a ring A is given by a map .
This is a bilinear operation , in the sense that na*b = a*nb for all integers n , so we can view multiplcation as a linear map ( Chern apparently liked to say that tensor products replace bilinear maps by linear maps ) .
To say that multiplication is commutative is to say that we have an equality of maps : , where is the switching map .
This suggests a relatively easy solution to our problem .
If we adjust the map T suitably ( e.g. using the identity map ) , we can make any ring commutative .
Unfortunately , in solving our problem , we ’ve destroyed any meaningful content in the notion of commutativity .
We can salvage some meaning by demanding that T satisfy some natural sounding conditions , such as .
This conveniently eliminates the identity map from consideration , but we still do n’t have any immediate guidance for making a good choice .
I ’d like to say that T is more than just a map of abelian groups , i.e. , T ought to have some structure that makes it natural in a strong sense .
One clue to turning this vague idea into mathematics is the unit compatibility condition I gave above .
Since the unit can be viewed as a ring homomorphism , we can say that T should produce isomorphisms like in a manner compatible with the unit maps .
One possible first attempt to strengthen this is to demand that T produce isomorphisms for all abelian groups in a manner compatible with all abelian group homomorphisms .
We can give this a categorical interpretation .
Tensor product takes a pair of abelian groups to an abelian group , and transforms maps in a compatible way .
This means tensor product is a functor , and since it satisfies some conditions like associativity , we say that Ab is a monoidal category .
There is also a switch functor , taking an object ( B , C ) to ( C, B ) and also switching homomorphisms .
Our demand on T then translates to the assertion that T is a natural isomorphism .
Unfortunately , there are no natural isomorphisms T that make our group ring commutative in this sense , mostly because the category of abelian groups is really well - behaved .
Tensor products commute with colimits , and any abelian group is a colimit of some diagram of copies of the integers .
Since T is the switch map whenever one of its inputs is a copy of the integers , T is forced to be the usual switch map on all inputs .
Fortunately , we can view the group ring in a different category , namely , it is a G - graded abelian group .
The category of G - graded abelian groups admits a monoidal structure via a graded tensor product that puts the tensor product of a degree g group with a degree h group in degree gh .
However , if G is nonabelian , there is no longer an obvious switch transformation , which we need to describe commutativity , since the tensor product in the opposite order would place things in a different degree .
We can try to solve this problem in the following way .
Recall that the center of a group or a ring is the set of elements that commute with everything else .
We could define the center of a monoidal category to be the subcategory of objects for which the tensor product with anything on the left is isomorphic to the tensor product on the right , and hope the group ring fits in somehow .
This category looks nice at first , but since we do n’t know what the isomorphisms are , we do n’t have a good choice of a natural transformation T .
There is a better version , discovered by Drinfeld , and written up by Majid and Joyal - Street .
Given a monoidal category C , one can construct a new category Z( C ) , called the Drinfeld center .
Its objects are pairs , where x is an object in C , and is a natural isomorphism called a braiding , satisfying a compatibility condition :
( to be precise , I should have inserted some associators ) .
Z( C ) then admits a natural monoidal structure induced by the monoidal structure on C , but it also comes with a canonical transformation T , made out of the isomorphisms .
With this structure , Z( C ) is called a braided monoidal category , and together with the “ forget braiding ” functor , it is in fact universal with respect to braided monoidal categories with a monoidal functor to C .
Our task is now to find our group ring in some form inside the Drinfeld center of the category of G - graded abelian groups , and hope that it is in some sense commutative .
First , we should write down precisely what it means to have a commutative ring in a braided monoidal category .
Baez calls these structures r-commutative in his Hochschild homology paper , so if things work out , we could say that group rings are r-commutative .
Given a braided tensor category C , with associator , commutor
T , and unit structures l and r , a commutative ring is an object A equipped
with a multiplication morphism and a unit
morphism , such that :
Multiplication with the unit yields the identity : , and the corresponding statement on the right .
, and the corresponding statement on the right .
Multiplication can be dragged across the commutor :
,
and the reflected version .
( I ’m omitting the associator here . )
, and the reflected version .
( I ’m omitting the associator here . )
Associativity : .
. Commutativity : .
There are diagrammatic ways of representing these axioms , using bits of string on a table , tied together at trivalent vertices .
There might even be a Youtube video about it .
Also , we need to understand the center itself .
Not every G - graded abelian group admits a braiding transformation .
If lies in the center , we can apply to a copy of the integers in degree g .
Since the natural transformation has to respect degree , we find that we have an isomorphism from the part of A in degree h to the part in degree .
In general , the compatibility condition induces an action of the group ring on A , conjugating degrees .
Objects of the Drinfeld center are then G-equivariant G - graded abelian groups .
We can view these as sums of pairs ( g , A ) , where g is a representative of a conjugacy class and A is a representation of the centralizer .
The G-action on ( g , A ) is given by conjugating g , and acting on the G - module induced from A . From our choice of commutor notation , the G- action on the grading is from the left , and the braiding is given by .
Now , consider the sum .
Under the “ forget braiding ” functor to G - graded vector spaces , this lands on the group ring .
We can pull back the multiplication map to get a copy of the group ring in the center .
To check that it is commutative , we compare the two maps and .
In other words , group rings are commutative because .
I should note that this formalism works if we replace abelian groups with sets .
G - graded abelian groups become sets with a map to G , and the center is the category of G - sets with a G - map to G ( with action given by conjugation ) .
G lives in this category in a straightforward way , and we can say that G is an abelian group object in this category .
One reason I did n’t name this post “ All groups are abelian ” is that the current title seems slightly less blatantly false .
You might be a bit disappointed if you ’ve read this far to find that I ’ve just redefined commutativity to hold using a rather tautological - looking conjugation trick .
I concede that the punch line is a bit anticlimactic .
However , we can think of this example of hidden commutativity as a toy model of a deeper phenomenon , known as transmutation .
There is an old philosophy due to Tannaka that a group is determined by its representation theory , and this was put into a categorical framework by Saavedra - Rivano and later refined by Deligne , Krein , and possibly others .
The statement of Tannaka - Krein duality is that any symmetric tensor category with well - behaved duals and a faithful monoidal functor to vector spaces is equivalent to the category of representations of a proalgebraic group that is unique up to isomorphism .
We will consider the coordinate ring picture , which is that it is equivalent to the category of comodules of a commutative Hopf algebra .
The Hopf algebra is constructed by considering the natural transformations from the faithful functor to itself .
Since the functor is linear , we have an additive structure , and composition makes it an algebra .
We also have a coproduct arising from the tensor struture on the categories , and the counit and antipode are unique if they exist ( this tends to require some completeness assumptions ) .
In some work in the early 1990s , Majid and Lyubashenko pointed out that one does n’t need the functor to go to vector spaces .
If the functor goes to any symmetric tensor category , you can reconstruct a Hopf algebra object in
that category by the same precedure ( assuming existence of suitable colimits ) .
More generally , if you have two braided tensor categories and a faithful braided tensor functor between them , the Hopf algebra of natural transformations has comodule category equivalent to the first category .
This is particularly useful in part because we can use the identity functor , so we do n’t actually need the second category .
Given a braided tensor category , it is the [ co ] representation category of a commutative Hopf algebra in itself .
This can be applied to familiar examples of braided tensor categories , such as representations of quantum enveloping algebras , and the Drinfeld center that we saw earlier .
These particular cases have a nondegeneracy property , known as factorizability : there is a map , called the inverse quantum Killing form ( or “ braided Fourier transform ” ) , that is an isomorphism between the Hopf algebra and its dual .
In particular , if we recast as a Hopf algebra in its own category of representations , it becomes transmuted to something commutative and cocommutative , and it is isomorphic to its dual , the “ braided coordinate ring ” .
This is a phenomenon that only happens in the braided world , since sending q to 1 degenerates the two into a universal enveloping algebra and the coordinate ring of an algebraic group , and they are no longer isomorphic .
One can take an extreme interpretation of this fact , and claim that braided commutative groups are the natural objects in this picture , and that the algebraic groups that we know and love are degenerate manifestations .
Thanks to David Jordan for introducing me to transmutation in the pre-Talbot seminar .
Also , I should point out a neat paper by John Francis and the Davids , that develops Drinfeld centers from the viewpoint of sheaves on loop space , along with other gems .
Toshiba Matsushita Display is about to mass - produce OLED screens that could be used for a wide range of portable devices , according to a report from Japan ’s Nikkei BP .
The joint venture between Toshiba and Matsushita ( Panasonic ) is claimed to be producing as many as one million 2.5 - inch organic screens per month starting from Autumn of 2009 and would be the first Japanese company to do so .
The development would be primarily targeted at cellphones , GPS navigators , and other handhelds , the newspaper says , though no specific products have been announced .
The screen size is also commonly used for portable media players such as the iPod classic and Zune 80 .
OLEDs are currently either under two inches in size and used only in basic players or are else larger and used for TVs , such as Sony ’s 11 - inch XEL - 1 .
The technology is considered crucial to the future of handheld devices as it ’s more color - accurate and thinner than LCDs .
It also does n’t require a backlight and so consumes less power than earlier displays .
The man who brought " The Smurfs " to America has become a real life villain .
Stuart Ross , who made little blue creatures a part of Saturday mornings everywhere , was busted yesterday for trying to extort money from his son - in - law , who is loaded .
Prosecutors say Ross demanded that David Blitzer fork over $ 50,000 in June 2008 , then hiked it to $ 11 million this month .
" The Smurfs " guru allegedly called and emailed Blitzer at home and at work , threatening he 'd destroy his reputation unless he anted up the cash .

Swedish designer Peter Thuvander has designed an induction - powered yo - yo charger for iPhones and other Apple handheld devices .
Housing a lithium ion cell , and based on the OLPC crank and this dandy wind - up remote , Peter is betting that the physics are close to there .
" The remote control needs only 30 cranks -- which is nothing when you yo - yo , " argues Peter .
He 's also thinking about what road warriors call " opportunitic charging " : " I think I 'd at least use it as an emergency device for all the dead iPhone moments I have . "

Giving up some rights means you still have protection under the law Advocates of open source software have hailed a court ruling protecting its use even though it is given away free .
The US federal appeals court move overturned a lower court decision involving free software used in model trains that a hobbyist put online .
The court has now said conditions of an agreement called the Artistic Licence were enforceable under copyright law .
" For non-lawgeeks , this wo n't seem important but this is huge , " said Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig .
" In non-technical terms , the Court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work .
When you violate the condition , the licence disappears , meaning you 're simply a copyright infringer .
" This is a very important victory . "
Copyright infringement According to details outlined in the ruling , Robert Jacobsen had written and then released code under an Artistic Licence .
This meant anyone using that free code had to attribute the author , highlight the original source of the files and explain how the code had been modified .
Mr Jacobsen , who manages open source software group Java Model Railroad Interface , accused commercial software developer Matthew Katzer and his company of ignoring the terms of the Artistic Licence when they took his code and used it to develop commercial software products for trains .
Individual credit for contributions not cash drives the community
An earlier court ruling did not agree with Mr Jacobsen 's stance that Mr Katzer and his company had infringed his copyright and said the licence Mr Jacobsen used was " intentionally broad . "
Instead the court ruled he might be able to claim breach of contract .
Legal experts have said the distinction is important since under federal copyright law a plaintiff can seek statutory damages and can be more easily granted an injunction than under contract law .
But now the US appeals court " determined that the terms of the Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions " .
" Copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials , " Judge Jeffrey White wrote in his 15 - page decision .
" Open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago , " Judge White said .
' Welcome change ' Mark Radcliffe of the Open Source Initiative said : " Although the reasoning is limited to the Artistic Licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions , this decision is a welcome change . "
The ruling has implications for the Creative Commons licence which offers ways for work to go into the public domain and still be protected .
These licenses are widely used by academic organisations like MIT for distributing coursework , scientific groups , artists , movie makers and Wikipedia among others .
Creative Commons releases copyright licences under its name Creative Commons filed an amicus or friends brief on behalf of Mr Jacobsen .
Its general counsel Diane Peters told BBC News " The federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it does n't mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides .
" This opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet ; that even though money does n't change hands , attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy . "
If the case had gone the other way it would have been a real blow to the open source movement , according to Jeff Neuberger a partner at Proskauer Rose LLP .
He told the Wall Street Journal : " Lots of companies rely on open source , and if they had lost their ability to enforce their rights they would have shied away from the software . "

What are these ?
Mac users missing the community spirit they enjoyed at BrokenStones are on an urgent mission to save an endangered manatee - like sea mammal which lives almost entirely on sea cabbage .
But that will have to wait .
There 's a brand new Gazelle - based Mac tracker in town - and it promises to be fun .
We take a look .
For a commnunity more used to a certain calm , things have been quite turbulent in the Mac torrent scene recently .
After hosting issues took down the BrokenStones tracker the mood was low .
So , when another site , Vortex Network , offered much as a potential replacement but ultimately proved too controversial , the mood fell lower still .
What the community needs right now is less drama , a place to call home and some well - deserved fun .
We spoke to a senior staffer at the brand new mac tracker , SaveTheCoratee.org , to get some answers on the important stuff – like what the hell a coratee is ?
“ A coratee is an animal that is similar to a manatee , its primary diet is sea cabbage ” he told us .
“ It was hunted and killed by tuna companies and sold to you because they are easier to fish .
They are slow and stupid animals that are loving and soft and on the brink of extinction , meaning they are in desperate need of saving . ”
The BrokenStones community parallels are obvious – minus the “ slow and stupid bit ” perhaps .
But , an equal ( if not greater ) amount of love , of course .
And cabbage .
“ We picked Save the Coratee because of two real reasons .
One , I try to live my life and everything I do with a healthy sense of the ridiculous .
Two , the mac community is a creative and innovative community .
Hand them a fake animal with no description rather than ‘ It ’s kinda like a manatee ’ and people love it .
It builds community and creates a family feeling that is ‘ fun ’ . ”
So bizarre mammal protection aside , what inspired the staff to start the site ?
Our source told us : “ When BrokenStones went down we started talking with people about getting a site up but Vortex beat us to it . ”
As we know , things did n’t go to plan at Vortex but in the background , slowly but surely , SaveTheCoratee was still in development .
“ We started talking and we were kinda moving slow , brain - storming etc .
Then stuff started to go down hill at Vortex so we kicked it into gear , ” the staff member said .
So , apart from all the regular categories and well - seeded torrents and cabbage - eating sea mammals one would expect at a site like this , what else is there to this site ?
Well , for a start , the site is based on the Project Gazelle codebase , but it ’s been put together ‘ in - house ’ .
The team at What.cd were n’t involved beyond the initial development , although they did save the first coratee ( a female ) , and managed to effect some sort of virgin birth and a successful breeding program .
I did n’t pry any deeper .
Nevertheless , I was told that a big achievement during the development was that the coders managed to convert the music - based source of Gazelle into a multi-app , multi- purpose site in just 4 days , which certainly sounds like an achievement .
The staff member further told us that SaveTheCoratee hopes to develop into a small , dedicated group ( 5,000 members , maybe more ) of users who love both Apple Computers and BitTorrent sites : “ I never want the site to be big or to loose personality ” he told us .
The site currently has around 1000 members but it ’s growing fast .
So what might convince potential users of the site to head over to their IRC channel with a big bucket of sea-cabbage bribes to smooth the entrance interview ?
Our source told us : “ We included a lot of …. how would I put this … win in the site … … or love ……. ”
According to a message on the site , once you have loved a coratee , you cannot go back to a plain old manatee , because it will seem rough and stupid by comparison .
Sounds like a good time to stock up on sea-cabbage .

The price of crude oil climbed slightly higher today – up 45 cents to end the trading day at $ 114.98 – based largely on a U.S. government report which showed a larger than expected weekly drop in gasoline stockpiles .
According to an article published on CNNMoney.com , gasoline inventories fell by over 6.2 million barrels last week , putting the inventory level below what is average for this time of year .
This data , in and of itself , would n’t usually pique my interest , and would be a sufficient reason to see the price of oil jump slightly .
However , in reading the CNNMoney article a little more closely , this inventory drop did n’t seem to make much sense .
According to the same inventories report :
“ Consumers are still driving less than they did at this time last year .
Over the last four weeks , gasoline demand has averaged about 9.5 million barrels per day , which is 1.6 % lower than the same period last year . ”
OK , that certainly seems to be conflicting data coming out of the same report .
On one hand you ’ve got data showing increased gasoline consumption – i.e. falling inventories – but on the other hand you ’ve got data showing continued decreased demand for gasoline .
Granted , I realize the decrease in gasoline inventories was measured over the prior week , while the gasoline demand was measured over previous four weeks .
That being said , the gasoline inventory drop – which was more than double what economists were expecting – seems a bit odd considering demand for gasoline has been falling the past four weeks .
Am I the only one that does n’t get this ?
Let me know your thoughts .
A friend of mine recently asked the following question : “ What do you say to people who are vegans and who educate others about veganism but who are also concerned about circuses , hunting , and other particular forms of animal exploitation .
Do you advise that they not address those issues at all and just focus on veganism ? ”
Of course not .
It is certainly the case that I do not advise that advocates spend their time and resources on single - issue campaigns .
The reason is simple : single - issue campaigns invariably convey the impression that some forms of animal exploitation are morally distinguishable from others and are worse or should be singled out for special criticism .
For example , a campaign against fur conveys the impression that there is some morally relevant difference between fur and other forms of animal clothing , such as leather or wool .
A campaign against eating animal flesh conveys the impression that eating flesh is morally more objectionable than drinking milk or eating eggs .
A campaign against conventional battery eggs suggests that “ cage - free ” eggs are morally desirable .
This problem is inherent with single - issue campaigns in a society in which animal exploitation is regarded as normal .
If X , Y , and Z are all considered as normal practices in a society and are closely related , then a campaign against X , but not against Y and Z , suggests that there is some relevant difference between X on one hand and Y and Z on the other .
For example , we live in a society in which it is considered as normal or “ natural ” to eat animal flesh and other animal products .
A campaign that focuses on flesh conveys the impression that there is a moral difference between flesh and other animal products , which is not the case .
The proof of this is found in the fact that many animal advocates are vegetarians but are not vegans .
If they draw a distinction , then what can we expect from the general public ?
This situation is to be distinguished from one in which X , Y , and Z are all regarded as objectionable activities or practices .
For example , we all regard genocide as a bad thing whether it is happening in Darfur , Somalia , or Bosnia .
If we have a campaign to stop genocide in Darfur , that does not mean that we think that genocide in other places is acceptable .
We regard rape and pedophilia to be morally objectionable .
A campaign against one does not imply any tacit approval of the other or any view that one is morally distinguishable from another .
This inherent problem with single - issue animal campaigns is exacerbated by the fact that animal groups that promote these campaigns often explicitly praise exploiters who may stop or modify some exploitative practice but who continue to engage in other , related practices .
For example some animal advocates praise “ cage - free ” eggs as the “ socially responsible ” alternative to conventional battery eggs .
Many large animal advocacy organizations sponsor or approve of “ humane ” labels that are placed on animal products .
A prominent animal ethicist claims that being a “ conscientious omnivore ” is “ a defensible ethical position . ”
This conveys a very clear and explicit moral message : some forms of animal exploitation are morally acceptable .
Moreover , single - issue campaigns not only create the misimpression that some forms of exploitation are qualitatively different in a moral sense from others , but often result in false “ victories . ”
For example , the single - issue campaign in California against foie gras ( 1 , 2 ) resulted in a law that was actually supported by the one foie gras producer in California because it immunized him against any legal action until 2012 and will probably be repealed before it ever comes into force if foie gras production can be made to be more “ humane . ”
So I am not a fan of putting time and money into single - issue campaigns .
I maintain that our time , effort , and other resources are better placed in promoting veganism .
As long as 99 % + of the planet regards the eating of animal foods and consumption or use of animal products to be acceptable , we will never make the paradigm shift that we need to make if we are going to dislodge the notion that humans have a moral right to exploit nonhumans .
We need to build a nonviolent movement for abolition that has veganism as its moral baseline .
But that does not mean that we should not oppose particular types of exploitation .
For example , last weekend , a horse , Eight Belles , who ran in the Kentucky Derby was killed immediately after the race and on the track when her ankles gave out as a result of her running for a duration and at a speed for which she was not suited .
I was interviewed on a radio show and asked about my views on the matter of Eight Belles .
I explained that I opposed all horse racing but as part of my general view that humans have no moral justification for using nonhumans at all , including for food .
The host of the program picked up on that and talked about how he very much loves and cares for his dog but had a barbecue that past weekend at which he consumed other animals .
So in a matter of a few minutes , the connection between horse racing and other forms of exploitation , particularly eating animal products , was made .
When we do discuss and criticize particular forms of exploitation , it is important to make clear that we regard the particular practice as morally unjustifiable and not that we think that the practice or activity can be made to be better if only we regulate it so that it is more “ humane . ”
And it is crucial to make clear that our opposition to the practice or activity is part of our overall opposition to all animal use .
We should not shrink away from making clear that we seek the abolition of all animal exploitation .
So when you are confronted by a particular practice or activity and want to or are asked to comment , you should do so if you are inclined .
Just be clear that the solution to the problem is not to make the activity or practice more “ humane , ” but to recognize that the practice is transparently frivolous , as are most of our uses of nonhumans , and should be abolished –as should all animal exploitation .
Here are two examples :
Q : I was reading about foie gras .
The way they make it is terrible , is n’t it ?
A : It surely is .
But it ’s not really different from everything else we eat .
The steak you had tonight , or the glass of milk you drank this morning , involved a production process every bit as horrible as that involved in foie gras .
And we have no right to kill nonhuman animals just because we think they taste good irrespective of how well we treat them .
Q : The circus is coming to town .
What do you , an animal advocate , think about the use of animals in circuses ?
A : I think it ’s terrible .
We impose suffering and death on animals for sheer amusement and that is really inconsistent with what we claim to believe when we express our agreement with the idea that it ’s wrong to inflict “ unnecessary ” suffering on animals .
But then , using animals in circuses is really no different from eating animals , which is also something that involves our pleasure or amusement and is just as inconsistent with what we say we believe .
There is no way to make sense out of the fact that we treat some nonhuman animals as members of our families and we stick forks into others or torture them for our enjoyment in circuses , zoos , or rodeos .
Whether you should spend your time and energy on legislation concerning circuses is another matter .
As I have said , at this point in time , the cultural context is such that it makes far more sense to spend our time focused on the use of animals for food , which is the primary practice that , in effect , legitimizes other forms of exploitation .
But if you do decide to campaign against circuses , your campaign should , at the very least , oppose the use of all animals in circuses and have no exceptions , and make clear that circuses are no better or worse than other forms of animal use , all of which should be abolished if we are to take animals seriously .

The World 's First All - glass Undersea Restaurant Opens
The World 's First All - glass Undersea Restaurant Opens
15 th April marks the day that the first ever all - glass undersea restaurant in the world opens its doors for business at the Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
It will sit five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean , s! urrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic offering diners 270 - degrees of panoramic underwater views .
' We have used aquarium technology to put diners face - to - face with the stunning underwater environment of the Maldives ' , says Carsten Schieck , General Manager of Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
' Our guests always comment on being blown away by the colour , clarity , and beauty of the underwater world in the Maldives , so it seemed the perfect idea to build a restaurant where diners can experience fine cuisine and take time to enjoy the views - without ever getting their feet wet . '
Created by MJ Murphy Ltd , a design consultancy based in New Zealand , Ithaa 's distinctive feature is the use of curved transparent acrylic walls and roof , similar to those used in aquarium attractions .
' The fact that the entire restaurant except for the floor is made of clear acrylic makes this unique in the world , ' continues Schieck , ' We are currently planting a coral garden on the reef to add to the spectacular views of the rays , sharks and many colorful fish that live around the area .
The biggest chokepoint in technology is a single roadblock : batteries .
Amidst all of the amazing advances in the last 50 years , battery tech has remained fundamentally unchanged , engineers incrementally squeezing out a few extra drops of power from old tech each year .
With better batteries , you would n't just be able to make it through the day with your iPhone 3G on a single charge , but laptops and phones could run faster , electric cars would rule the highways - it'd be like a brand new world .
There are like a million different kinds , but here 's a rundown of the most common ones we 're stuck with in gadgets for now , and their strengths and weaknesses .
Pretty much all batteries basically work the same way : Chemicals packed inside get freaky and produce electrons , which pool up on the negative end of the battery , essentially turning chemical energy into electrical energy - when you connect a battery to a gadget , the electrons run through the gadget and back to the positive end of the battery , completing the circuit and causing the chemical mojo that produces energy , making your toy robots go go go .
The differences between various kinds of batteries come from the different chemical cocktails inside , which they 're all named for - like your favorite actual cocktails , each one has its properties , making it good for some stuff and not others .

Alkaline are the classics - they powered your Game Boy for 20 solid minutes of fun ( or 2 1/2 on a Sega Nomad ) - they are cheap and disposable .
Energy density , the amount of power packed in the space , is n't bad , but with a demanding , high powered gadget like an MP3 player or digital camera , they die quicker than morbidly obese Mississippians parked in front of an all - you - can - eat biscuits and gravy trough .
With lower power gear , they 're decent enough , as years of use and abuse have probably told you .
Biggest suckpoint , as you Wii owners know , is that they 're not rechargeable .
Silver oxide or silver - zinc batteries pack a good bit of power inside and last a loooong time , so they 're the most common battery in watches and small toys — not to mention torpedoes and submarines , or other applications where performance matters more than cost .
The downside is that the silver makes them expensive if they 're bigger than the button size for gadgets .
Oh , and the mercury leakage issue at the end of their life is kinda uncool .
Lead - acid batteries have two major types : a starting battery , like the one in your ( gas - guzzling ) car , which is designed for short power jolts , and a deep - cycle battery , which delivers a lower , more steady power level , so it 's used on boats , campers , golf carts and backup power in various gadgets .
Rechargeable Alkaline : Surprisingly similar to regular 'ol alkies , they 're slightly tweaked to take recharges - which means giving it some juice pumps electrons back into the battery .
They do n't self - discharge like the more popular nickel metal hydride batteries , but their capacity falls off with every recharge and does n't quite match regular alkies .
You do n't really see these at Wal - Mart , if that tells you anything .
Nickel Cadmium , aka NiCads , some of the first decent rechargeable batteries , and still among the cheapest , so they were popular in toys and other gadgets .
They recharge fairly quickly and will take a beating , but the memory effect ( a recurring issue with rechargeables ) is nasty with these - if you try to recharge it without using all the energy , large crystals build up that limit how much power it'll pump out next time to however much was used before you recharged it ( like it " remembers " ) .
Also , they 'll leak out all their power after about 90 days , so you do n't wanna leave them on your shelf or in a charger for a long time .

Nickel metal hydride , aka NiMH , replaces the cadmium in NiCads with an alloy that makes it hold more 40 percent energy in the same space than NiCads .
Memory effect issues are n't as severe , but NiMH are kinda finicky about recharging / discharging .
Still , do they well with the systems in hybrid cars , so giant packs of them are what 's in current hybrids .
They 're not bad substitutes for alkalines either in terms power / space / price and hold up well to high drain from gadgets , so they 're the most common kind of rechargeable you 'd buy at Wal - Mart for your Walkman or something .

Lithium ion aka Li-ion set the gold standard in a gadget battery and are a major bump in energy efficiency and density from nickel - based batteries while not suffering from by the dreaded memory effect .
On the other hand but they 're not as thrashable and have that whole infamous propensity for explosion ( really , it 's only a few per million ) .
Another major issue with them is that if they 're spent too hard and drop below a certain voltage , its energy capacity can be permanently lowered , so they 're designed to shut off whatever they 're plugged into after a certain point .
Little advances allow researchers and scientists to wring modestly more power out of it ever year .
Basically , if you 've got a gadget with a rechargeable , it 's probably one of these , or , increasingly , a li-poly battery ( see below ) .

Lithium ion poly or lithium poly or li-poly , sprung out of lithium ion ( obvs ) , but uses a gel polymer - based electroltye — hence the name .
They 're more durable ( less explode -y ) than standard Li-ion , plus they 're lighter and can be molded into whatever shape you want , so it 's not surprising you 're seeing them replace lithium ions in laptops and other gadgets , like the the iPod .
One issue is that they do wear a bit more quickly than regular Li-ion , but that 's getting better .

Lithium iron phosphate is another spin on lithium ion that replaces the cobalt oxide mix in li-ion .
Advantages are that it 's less likely to go boom and it can discharge and recharge incredibly quickly .
But until now , they 've been expensive and kinda complicated to make .
Mostly famously , it's in the OLPC XO Laptop , but is on its way to a hybrid car near you .
And that just about covers where we are now with portable gadget power .

In fact the dissolution of the insolvent parts of the U.S. banking sector -- yes , the investment banks , the money - center banks , the regional banks , and the savings and loans -- would actually be an enormously positive development for the nation and indeed the world .
Let 's start with the fact that a huge number of these lenders are insolvent .
If all their bad loans , bad derivative bets and off - balance sheet losses were forced to be marked to market / liquidated to raise capital , then major bank after major bank would fold / enter bankruptcy .
And what exactly would be so bad about that ?
Businesses go under all the time .
The truth is these banks will never ever recover the loans they wrote , so why try to prop them up with taxpayer funds ?
To bail out the ultra - wealthy owners of those banks , of course .
Recall that 1 % of the citizenry own the bulk of all stocks and bonds :
Look at this chart : most of the banks have already lost half or more of their value .
And has civilization fallen because the poor owners have lost half or more of their investment in the banking sector ?
No .
Even at its peak of bubble hubris , the entire sector was less than 20 % of the S&P stock index 's value .
Now it 's under 10 % , like it used to be .
The world did n't collapse when the banking sector declined , and it wo n't fall when insolvent banks are ushered through the bankruptcy process .
Look , WAMU has already fallen from $ 35 / share to under $ 5 / share .
So what if it goes BK ?
Banks are businesses , and businesses go bankrupt all the time .
United Airlines went BK and the next day employees showed up and the planes flew .
When banks are liquidated / go BK , then the tellers will come to work and people will go in and do their normal banking .
If a bunch of branches close , people will adapt .
It will be tough on the employees let go , but how different is this than when millions of industrial and manufacturing jobs vanished over the past 20 years ?
It 's called creative destruction , and it's like the tide : you can't stop it , and all the government - funded sand castles in the world can't stop the tide .
That 's what the Japanese government tried , and look what it got them : two decades of malaise and decline .
Trying to cover up losses and keep bad debt off the books does n't solve anything ; the money 's already lost .
All these absurd bailouts have one goal : enable insolvent homeowners to bail out insolvent lenders with new loans which will inevitably go bad , too .
Only it will be the taxpayer who 's stuck with the bill , not the banks who wrote the loan in the first place .
So let me repeat : not only should we as a nation let the banks go belly up , we should insist on it .
Regulators should force every lender to declare all its assets and liabilities and mark them to market immediately .
If the bank is insolvent , then let it enter bankruptcy .
The money 's already lost ; let 's just be honest about , repudiate the debt and move on .
Yes , some pension funds and 401K accounts have suffered losses due to banking sector ownership .
But those losses have already be chalked ; there 's not much downside left , so the big losers will be the fat cats , not the pensioners whose retirement fund owns a shriveling piece of WAMU or Citicorp .
Now let 's move to the other big topic : how housing costs have essentially impoverished average Americans .
The number one cause of poverty in the U.S. is housing prices and rents which have risen three times faster than income since the 1960s .
As David Fischer noted in The Great Wave : Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History ( page 219 ) :
The cost of rent and real estate in the United States multipled sixfold from 1960 to 1992 , while the consumer price index increased threefold .
Prime real estate went up tenfold or more .
Take a look :
If you go the BLS CPI page and fire up the CPI inflation calculator , you 'll find that $ 100 in 1965 works out to be $ 600 in 2005 .
Meanwhile , housing prices rose 20 - fold or more in that timeframe even as real wages dropped :
Hmm--productivity ( and profits ) soar , but wages actually decline , even as house prices skyrocket .
Put this all together and there is only one conclusion : to restore housing and rents to their rightful , historic levels , all 10 million distressed / foreclosed houses should be auctioned off for a $ 1 each .
Let 's give the current tenant or former homeowner first dibs , with the caveats ( written into the deed ) that they must maintain the property and that they have no other real estate property or assets .
( In tony neighborhoods , auction the houses for cash .
The main point : get rid of them all at once , on the cheap , done in a day nationwide , and give priority to homeowners with no other real estate assets .
Investors get to pick over what 's left . )
Editor 's note :
After receiving a number of well - stated emails from readers , I now think the best approach is to auction the properties off at whatever the market will bear and give the proceeds to the bondholders .
My main point remains : do n't enable banks to hide bad debt if they are insolvent ; it 's better to face the music and get the houses into the hands of whomever will fix them / live in them / rent them , etc .
Some resident is better than no resident or a criminal resident .
( see reader comments at the end of the entry . )
You can massage the data however you want , but big - picture , here are the facts : there are about 50 million mortgages in the U.S. , and about 10 million are either behind in payments , foreclosed , bank - owned ( REO ) or on the slippery slope down to one of these three endpoints .
And there are some 22 million vacant / unused dwellings in the U.S .
I 've published these numbers ad nauseum ; please scan the archives below for the many entries which detail the statistics .
Just to recap :
1. banks / lenders are already insolvent ; the money 's already been lost .
Trying to hide the fact or paper it over with taxpayer bailouts changes nothing .
2. the only people who will be hurt by the recognition of bank insolvency is fat cats / the top 1 - 5 % of citizenry .
3 , housing and rents have risen three or even four times faster than wages ; to reverse poverty , the historical ratio should be re-established .
4. the best way to do this is repudiate all the bad mortgage debt and sell all the distressed homes for $ 1 to low and moderate - income people who will maintain them .
Now let 's count the ways this will help the nation .
1. Instead of struggling to pay a bloated mortgage or skyhigh rent , millions of people will be paying nothing but property taxes .
They have a stake in their house and neighborhood and every incentive to improve it .
If they wo n't maintain the property , they lose the house and it is given to someone who will keep it up .
2. banks do n't need to write mortgages for 10 million homes .
No fees will be generated , and there is no investment banker needed to package the mortgages into deceptive securities .
Good riddance .
Loans are essentially commodities and should be as cheap as any other financial commodity .
3. Property values take a huge one - time hit .
OK , so we are collectively not going to retire as millionaires based on a real estate bubble .
If we are collectively paying much less for rent and mortgages , then we can start saving actual money rather than feeding off a frenzy which was doomed to collapse anyway .
4. the best way to do this is repudiate all the bad mortgage debt and sell all the distressed homes for $ 1 and up to whomever will restore them to liveability and live in them / rent them -- no government funds required .
Now who would be hurt ?
1. owners of lenders ' stocks -- mostly insiders , hedge funds , financial elites .
Pension fudns who did n't exit yet will take a hit but 75 % of the losses have already occured .
2. investors who bought the mortgage - backed securities and derivatives .
Again : the money has already been lost , and trying to obscure this does n't help anyone .
3. Wall Street and the thousands of jobs created spinning bad debt into bad securities .
Many industries have been forced to shed hundreds of thousands of jobs ; now it 's the banking industry 's turn .
The benefits and costs will be equitably divided according to housing demand and supply .
Since there will be relatively few distressed homes in desirable areas like Manhattan , San Francisco , west Los Angeles , neighborhoods in Seattle , Portland , Des Moines , Austin , Boston , you name it , then these scattered homes sold at auctionwo n't have much effect on real estate values .
In areas already devastated by 40 % declines and massive numbers of vacant homes , once again : the money 's already been lost , and no slight - of - hand or government handout can change that .
So having 200 vacant houses sold for $ 1 + each would be a tremendous boon in the sense that the neighborhood 's slide into criminal anarchy will be halted .
Yes , current homeowners with high mortgages will be stuck with homes which are worth less than their mortgages ; but that 's already the case .
What 's changed , except the reality that the money has already been lost has finally been accepted ?
The received wisdom is that allowing banks and lenders to go bankrupt would be a national tragedy .
Quite the opposite : trying to prop them and the overpriced , poverty - creating housing market up is the national tragedy .
The money 's been lost already , so let 's just admit the reality and move on .
That 's what bankrupcty is all about -- a healthy recognition of reality .

WEST GREENWICH , R.I. 
Last summer , Kerry Beaudry heard yelping from her German shepherd , Holly , and went outside to investigate .
What she found still gives her chills .
A small , mangy creature was on top of Holly , digging its claws into the scruff of her neck and gnawing at her face .
“ I had never seen anything like it , ” Ms. Beaudry recalled .
“ I did n’t know what it was .
It kind of looked like a fox .
But it was very , very ratty looking and had fangs and claws .
It was creepy looking , but not that big . ”
The animal was a fisher , a weasel - like predator of the deep woods that was saved from extinction in the Northeast and Midwest and has migrated into suburban backyards .
The small , sleek animal has cultivated a reputation as a ferocious killer of small pets , including cats and chickens , putting animal owners on edge .
Holly escaped when Ms. Beaudry ’s husband beat the fisher away with a broom .
SEATTLE , July 2 ( UPI ) -- A Seattle man accused of peering at his young female neighbors with binoculars could n't help it because the women 's blinds were up , his wife says .
Police reported the man acknowledged watching the neighbor women through their uncovered windows , but the man 's wife defended him , saying the women left their blinds up and were " putting on a show " by walking around naked , the Seattle Times reported Wednesday .

Officers did n't cite the man and told the neighbor women , whose ages were not provided , to get their blinds fixed , the newspaper said .
The report noted that the women said the blinds were broken but that they would ask their landlord to make repairs .

Camels are like edible cargo vans , as useful for their sturdy backs as for their milk and meat .
But a new study by Iranian researchers suggests the health of that country 's fleet is in jeopardy .
Nearly 84 percent of male camels in eastern Iran may be infected with helminths ( parasitic worms ) that can cripple reproduction and afflict other organs , the scientists report in the journal Parasitology Research .
The mosquito - borne helminths , Dipetalonema evansi , have long been known to beset camels and other species of livestock .
The latest finding , however , is the most thorough estimate of their prevalence in Iranian camels , a key stock species in that country .
The parasites can cause filariasis , a disease that infects both sexes of a host species but is particularly destructive to the male genitalia , causing often grotesque deformities of the testes .
The researchers looked for evidence of D. evansi in samples of blood and tissue from 1,070 dromedaries — camels with a single hump — slaughtered for meat between 2003 and 2006 .
Blood tests from more than one fifth of the animals showed signs of infection with the worms ; further study revealed that 83.7 percent of the male camels had parasites in their lungs and reproductive organs .
" The high prevalence rate of this infection surprised me , " says Ahmad Oryan , professor of veterinary pathology at Shiraz University in Iran , who led the research .
" Due to the effects of this nematode [ a type of roundworm ] on breeding of the male camels , this infection , if not treated or controlled , could have adverse outcomes and will affect the calving rate of this animal . "
D. evansi had previously been found in camels from southern and central Iran by Oryan and others .
" It seems this infection is reported in most areas of this country that normally rear camels , " he says .
Saudi Arabia 's camel population has been severely hurt by a mysterious die - off that has claimed thousands of animals over the past year .
The cause of those deaths is unknown , with theories ranging from viral infections to toxic chemicals in camel feed , but Oryan says filariasis probably is not to blame .
" This disease will affect the fertility of male animals , but the rate of mortality due to this disease is low and no clinical symptoms are present in the low - infected camels , " he says .
" So we can not correlate the deaths of the camels in Saudi Arabia to this disease . "
The U.N. puts the world 's camel population at about 20 million .
That number has been falling in many countries , as camels are increasingly used for food rather than as " ships of the desert " .
The recent surge in oil prices , however , has been a boon to camels , making them an economical alternative to trucks and tractors for transporting cargo .
In Iran , at least , endemic filariasis among the creatures " constitutes an important health problem to camels in this area , " the study authors wrote , " resulting in high morbidity , impaired working capacity and lowered productivity . "
On Once -' Quixotic ' E- Vote Coverage From BRAD BLOG : ' We 're Watching History Bend Their Way '
Brad Friedman Byon
9/17/2008 , 10:45 am PT
Over at HuffPo , Nancy Scola files a nice piece asking whether or not " New Media 's obsessiveness " can save democracy , given that " Elections in the U.S. involve countless moving parts and ... so many different players [ that ]
Improving the way we vote demands sustained , focused attention --- not exactly the strong suit of the American Press . "
It 's a job for bloggers , she suggests , since the corporate media have , at least so far , not proven up to the task .
She may be right , even though the thought simply exhausts me more than I am already .
She goes on to mention a few of us ( yes , she names me specifically ) who have been fighting this battle for quite some time .
" From the sidelines , their campaign often seemed quixotic , " she writes , " But [ as electronic voting machines are now being scrapped for junk , recycled and / or sold on eBay ] we 're watching history bend their way . "
Nice .
Though not as nice as the following turn of phrase , so well writ that I had to share it :
When it comes to injustice , there are the " overlooked Americans " : soldiers and other overseas Americans voting still have to hop over hurdles to cast their vote .
( While I 'm on this point , it 's inconceivable to me that someone serving in Iraq or Afghanistan should have anything less than a ballot served to them on a silver platter that 's then carried directly to the ballot box in the beak of a bald eagle . )
Game , set , match .
Well done , Nancy .
With that , one friendly critique for her if I could be so bold : Paperless electronic voting is not the problem --- as she suggests in the piece --- as if adding " paper trails " to touch - screens makes a damned bit of difference ( this article and its accompanying video from the Computer Security Group at UC Santa Barbara should make that crystal clear , no matter what some computer scientists like Princeton 's Ed Felten and Verified Voting 's David Dill keep saying out loud . )
The problem is that democracy in this country demands nothing short of the transparency offered by a hand - marked paper ballot --- one that is actually counted , and counted accurately --- for every vote cast in America .
Period .
And that point should be served from a silver platter , and carried directly to every election official and election official in the country , in the beak of a bald eagle .
Not sure why I ’m spending the time on this problem , but it looked interesting .
For starters read a Hacker ’s News article that mentioned Python vs. Ruby performance , which in turned liked to a polish blog post .
The core of the blog post was this :
20 threads * 100,000 iterations Ruby 1.9 = 1.54 s. Ruby Enterprise = 3.01 s. JRuby 1.1.2 = 5.82 s. Jython 2.2.1 = 11.86 s. Python 2.5.2 = 12.32 s. Ruby 1.8.7 = 22.68 s.
Which is totally amazing for a performance improvement stand point , but in digging further the original code is :
from time import time from random import Random from threading import Thread rand = Random ( ) .
randint # alias class Test ( Thread ) : def __init__ ( self ) : Thread . __init__( self ) print " Starting %s " % self . getName ( ) def run ( self ) : a = [ rand ( 0 , SIZE ) for x in xrange ( SIZE ) ] a . sort ( ) print " %s finished " % self . getName ( ) print " Start " start = time ( ) THREADS , SIZE = 20 , 100000 threads = [ ] for i in xrange ( THREADS ) : t = Test ( ) threads .
append (t ) t . start ( ) while True in [t . is Alive ( ) for t in threads ] : pass print " Time : %s s " % ( time ( ) - start )
The first observation is that ( unlike the ruby version ) the python version has the overhead of a busy wait on the threads , so with than tiny fix ( reduced runtime by 1 second )
for t in threads : if t . is Alive ( ) : t . join ( )
Time : 17.6256890297 s
Doing a quick decomposition of this , we really have a program that ’s doing the following
from time import time from random import Random rand = Random ( ) .
randint # alias THREADS , SIZE = 20 , 100000 print " Start " start = time ( ) for t in xrange ( THREADS ) : a = [ rand ( 0 , SIZE ) for x in xrange ( SIZE ) ] a . sort ( ) print " Time : %s s " % ( time ( ) - start )
Time : 14.3786399364 s
Not getting into numbers , but this executes in almost the same time as the threaded version …
Hmm , so is the ruby version really all about “ Threading Performance ” ?
Ca n’t be , has to be either in the random or the loop …
Lets look further .
from time import time from random import Random rand = Random ( ) .
randint # alias THREADS , SIZE = 20 , 100000 print " Start " start = time ( ) for t in xrange ( THREADS ) : for x in xrange ( SIZE ) : rand( 0 , SIZE ) print " Time : %s s " % ( time ( ) - start )
Time : 10.9540541172 s
There we have it , the rand ( ) is taking 70 % of the total time , while it does appear that the array append overhead is still 30 % ( ~4 seconds ) it ’s at least useful to notice that there ’s nothing that possible to improve it beyond this point .
Conclusion : Ruby might be faster , but to mix up a bunch of performance stats with threading is going to be problematic .
Update :
In digging deeper python ’s random number generator is written in python , thus of course it ’s slow …
It ’s competing against a C version .
Report : US troops abroad giving 6 x more to Obama than McCain Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email
This A new analysis shows the vast majority of US troops serving abroad have donated to candidates running on strong anti-war platforms , with presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama out - raising his Republican opponent by a 6 - to - 1 margin .
The Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks money in politics , analyzed donations from US troops in a report released Thursday .
According to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , Democrat Barack Obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has Republican John McCain , and the fiercely anti-war Ron Paul , though he suspended his campaign for the Republican nomination months ago , has received more than four times McCain 's haul .
Despite McCain 's status as a decorated veteran and a historically Republican bent among the military , members of the armed services overall -- whether stationed overseas or at home -- are also favoring Obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 , by a $ 55,000 margin .
Although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to Republicans this cycle , of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees , 57 percent has gone to Obama .
Only Marines are more likely to donate to McCain , according to the report , with Obama leading in fundraising from members of the Army , Air Force and Navy .
The report found Obama raised about $ 60,600 from troops deployed abroad , compared to $ 45,500 for Paul and $ 10,600 for McCain ; the Democratic candidate brought in more than $ 335,000 from all military personnel , compared to about $ 280,000 for the Republican .
" That 's shocking .
The academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly Republican and some who say it 's about equal , but no one would point to six - to - one " in Democrats ' favor , Aaron Belkin , a professor of political science at the University of California who studies the military , told the Center 's Luke Rosiak .
" That represents a tremendous shift from 2000 , when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in Florida and elsewhere , and leaned heavily towards the Republicans . "
The military donations streaming to Obama , Rosiak reports , breaks a historical trend that saw Republicans lead among the enlisted ranks .
According to the report , George W. Bush out - raised Al Gore by a nearly 2 - to - 1 margin in 2000 and brought in $ 1.50 from the military for every $ 1 raised by Democratic candidate John Kerry in 2004 .
Two different questions must be distinguished in the current political debate on free trade for America : Should we have free trade ?
If we agree that we should , how should we trade freely ?
Often , the press announces that the consensus on the desirability of free trade among economists has disappeared .
But in each instance , they have been disproven .
Today , the most potent argument is that free trade may increase income and wealth , but that it suppresses workers ' wages ands even harms the middle class .
Nearly all research shows that this claim also is mistaken .
My own research demonstrates that trade even may have moderated the fall in wages that labor - saving technical change is producing .
There is little doubt that , on this issue , Senator McCain has the better of the argument over Senator Obama .
But Mr. McCain , like many others in America , is mistaken in thinking that freeing trade through Free Trade Agreements is a good idea .
FTAs , which are better described as Preferential Trade Agreements , or PTAs , since they free trade for members only , is like freeing trade on a discriminatory basis .
As I argue in my book , " Termites in the Trading System , " FTAs have several crippling downsides that must be recognized .
First , they will often divert trade from cheaper nonmember sources to more expensive member sources , bringing harm rather than good .
Also , the enormous growth of such FTAs , now more than 350 and still growing , has led to a systemic effect : creating a " spaghetti bowl " of preferences and chaos in the world trading system .
In one - on - one negotiations between America and weak , smaller FTA partners , several lobbies have imposed demands unrelated to trade on these nations , increasing resentments abroad .
In Seoul , there was a street demonstration against the proposed U.S. - South Korea FTA .
These lobbies include labor unions seeking to raise standards and production costs of rival firms abroad , financiers seeking absence of capital controls , and firms wanting higher patent protection .
There are plenty of reasons to believe that these preferential trade agreements have slowed down our progress on the multilateral freeing of trade , as with the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations .
The Doha Round 's success is essential to strengthening the multilateral trading system , which is beneficial to all .
But the American doctrine of inducing multilateral trade liberalization by signing on FTAs has proven to be a chimera .
Much attention and lobbying has been diverted to inconsequential deals .
So we need to put a moratorium on more FTAs , while treating those already ratified as water under the bridge .
The free traders who are passionate supporters of these FTAs are undermining everything that we have worked for to produce and strengthen a non-discriminatory trading system .
There is no better example of folly wrought by good intentions .
The following are excerpts From " Termites in the Trading System : How Preferential Agreements Undermine Free Trade " :
Proliferating Preferential Trade Agreements
Perhaps the most striking historical flirtation with preferences in trade came from John Maynard Keynes , arguably the 20th century 's most influential economist .
At the end of World War II , the British were skeptical of non-discrimination as implied by the most favored nation , or MFN , clause , which would automatically extend to every member country of the proposed trade institution the lowest tariff extended to any member .
They also wished to hold on to their imperial preference , which extended British protection to its colonies and dominions .
On the other hand , the Americans vigorously supported the MFN clause and favored nondiscrimination in the trading arrangements being contemplated after the conclusion of the war .
They were led by Cordell Hull , the Secretary of State between 1933 and 1944 and a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace ; he believed , not without substance , that free trade would also lead to peace , not just prosperity .
Keynes sided with his own , and made the following characteristically flamboyant statement :
" My strong reaction against the word ' discrimination ' is the result of my feeling so passionately that our hands must be free ...
The word calls up and must call up ... all the old lumber , most - favoured - nation clause and all the rest which was a notorious failure and made such a hash of the old world .
We know also that it wo n't work .
It is the clutch of the dead , or at least the moribund , hand . "
Yet once they had thought more deeply about the issue , Keynes and other British economists who were engaged in the negotiations with the United States that led to the final agreement in Proposals for Expansion of World Trade and Employment had come to accept the Cordell Hull view that nondiscrimination was a key principle that had to prevail in the proposed new regime for international trade .
Keynes , who thought that intellectual inflexibility was a mark of inferior minds , then spoke in the House of Lords what are among his most eloquent words :
" [ The proposed policies ] aim , above all , at the restoration of multilateral trade ... the basis of the policies before you is against bilateral barter and every kind of discriminatory practice .
The separate blocs and all the friction and loss of friendship they must bring with them are expedients to which one may be driven in a hostile world where trade has ceased over wide areas to be cooperative and peaceful and where are forgotten the healthy rules of mutual advantage and equal treatment .
But it is surely crazy to prefer that . "
As it happens , Keynes was reverting to an anti-discrimination view that had begun to make increasing sense to economists during the 1930s .
World trade had gradually been shifting to a multilateral non-discriminatory regime by growing acceptance of the MFN principle , under which any member of a trade treaty , later the GATT as well , would receive the same lowest tariff that any other signatory of the treaty would enjoy .
But world trade would soon turn disastrously to bilateralism and attendant preferences in trade .
Read almost any of the splendid accounts of world trade in the 1930s and you will find fulsome and fulminating accounts of how the tit - for - tat protectionism and the competitive depreciations of currency , which were intended to divert limited world demand to one 's own goods to reinflate one 's economy , led to extensive use of quotas , which are necessarily discriminatory .
They led also to explicit bilateral treaties aimed at balancing trade flows bilaterally wherever possible .
It was manifest that protectionism , each trading nation acting on its own , had damaged the world trading system : each nation followed what the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously called " beggar my neighbour policies , " and many were beggared in the end .
By contrast , coordinated action , eschewing protection and agreeing to increase world aggregate demand ( rather than seeking to divert to oneself a given , insufficient amount of world demand ) , would have produced a better result .
The Pandemic of PTAs
There is yet another irony .
The interwar proliferation of preferences was a result of an uncoordinated pursuit of protectionism , itself aided by the breakdown of financial stability and macroeconomic equilibrium in the world economy .
But the current tide of preferences has been a result of politicians mistakenly , and in an uncoordinated fashion , pursuing free trade agreements because they think ( erroneously ) that they are pursuing a free trade agenda .
So today we have a cumulative total of over 350 PTAs reported to the WTO .
Even if only active PTAs are counted , the estimated total is still large .
By either count , the PTAs are evidently increasing continually .
Among economists , I was the earliest to warn against PTAs , starting in 1990 when I sensed that we were facing a systemic threat to the principle of nondiscrimination in world trade .
I was then in a minority of one , even among economists , many of whom thought I was a " multilateralist freak . "
Arrayed on the other side were truly eminent economists , among them Larry Summers , who became the U.S. Treasury Secretary , and the remarkable Paul Krugman , my former MIT student and now New York Times columnist .
But now that the proliferation and its many downsides have become evident , and ever more threatening , I daresay that the profession has moved like a herd into my corner .
Pascal Lamy , currently the Director General of the WTO , once remarked that half the economists in the world were now opposed to FTAs .
I retorted mischievously that this was an English understatement by a distinguished Frenchman ; in fact , nearly all were .
I discovered that the European Union which started the pandemic while the United States had grossly aggravated it , applied its MFN tariff to only six countries  Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Japan , Taiwan , and the United States  with all other nations enjoying more favorable tariffs .
I asked Pascal Lamy , who was then the E.U. Trade Commissioner , Why not call it the LFN ( least favored nation ) tariff ?
In short , we now have once again a world marred by discriminatory trade , much as we had in the 1930s .
And we know how that turned out .
Mr. Bhagwati , a senior fellow of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations , recently published his newest book , " Termites in the Trading System . "
Life 's a hoot for Shrek the baby long - eared owl adopted by a greyhound called ' Torque '
Best friends :
Shrek and his doggy pal
In the childhood fairytale it was the owl and the pussycat who were the very best of friends .
But in real life it is this greyhound and owl who have formed a rather bizarre friendship at an animal centre .
The six - month - old dog , Torque , adopted tiny baby owl Shrek when she was taken from her mother for her own protection after just three days .
Keepers feared Shrek 's mother would eat her first clutch if she became stressed .
Adoptive dad Torque is now guarding the rare bird at the home of head falconer John Picton .
They spend their evenings together watching Eastenders and Coronation Street .
Shrek is free to roam the lounge as she strengthens her legs and often snuggles up to Torque on the sofa .
Outdoors at the Ringwood Raptor and Reptile Centre in Hampshire 's New Forest , they often sit together , with the greyhound guarding his feathered friend .
Their friendship started slowly as John introduced the unlikely pair gradually - first by feeding three - inch - high Shrek her meals of marsh rats and quail in the same room , and then holding them close so Torque could smell her .
Tamed Shrek will be used as a display owl at fetes and open days and John believes her interaction with dogs and humans from an early age is ideal training .
He said : ' Their relationship is so unusual but also rather sweet .
' Torque seems to have adopted Shrek as his daughter and is now very protective .
He follows her around at home and keeps his eye on her .
Sofa , so good : Shrek and Torque get comfy
' They play with each other in the evenings while I 'm watching television and it is an opportunity for Shrek to wander and strengthen her legs .
' I was a little wary of introducing them to start with but I now trust Torque 100 per cent .
Because he is only a puppy he did n't feel so threatened by a new animal joining his pack .
' Shrek is doing well and becoming used to human and animal contact .
I 'm sure that will be beneficial when she is taken to shows because nothing will phase her . '
The unnamed mother laid four eggs , of which two hatched .
Shrek was the first owlet to hatch and was taken away because it was thought she had the highest chance of survival .
The second chick is still with his mother and his chances of survival are growing each day .

When a wave reaches the shallow shoreline of an ocean or other large body of water , the upper portion of the wave pitches forward and the wave begins to break — a motion often indicated by crests of foam called whitecaps .
The size and forward motion of the wave subsequently diminish .
The basic idea behind surfing is to ride the unbroken portion of a wave for as great a distance as possible , using a variety of maneuvers to speed up , slow down , and maneuver around the breaking portion of the wave .
Proficient surfers continue to ride until the entire wave has broken and become whitewater .
In competition , shortboarders , longboarders and bodyboarders lock horns in a series of timed heats .
There are a set quota of waves competitors are allowed to ride .
Each competitor is judged on the tricks they attempt , and points are awarded based on the degree of difficulty and variety of maneuvers .

The eggs of peregrine falcons living in California 's big cities contain some of the highest levels ever found in wildlife of a flame retardant used in consumer products , a new study has found .
Studies of peregrine falcon eggs and chicks by state scientists reveal that the birds hunting in San Francisco , Long Beach , Los Angeles and San Diego are ingesting the flame retardant called PBDEs , believed to leach out of foam mattresses , synthetic fabrics , plastic casings of televisions , electronics and other products .
The research shows that the indoor chemicals can contaminate the outdoors and even humans .
The predator birds - which can fly 200 mph - feed on pigeons and other birds , which probably pick up the chemicals in the environment from sewage , landfills and runoff , scientists say .
Humans can be exposed by inhaling household dust and absorbing the chemicals through the skin .
" Urban wildlife are the sentinel species that can tell us about chemicals of emerging concern that are coming from city exposures .
Information from these species can be useful to us in protecting the sensitive members of our population like infants , children and pregnant women , " said Kim Hooper , one of the leading research scientists with the California Environmental Protection Agency 's Environmental Chemistry Laboratory .
The work , which Hooper will present today at the annual meeting of the Northern California Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry at UC Berkeley , is part of the state 's Wildlife Early Warning System supported by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control .
Included in the study are unhatched eggs and a dead chick from nests of San Francisco 's celebrity pair of peregrine falcons , George and Gracie , and in the future might include an unhatched egg from Carlos and Clara , who are raising young at San Jose City Hall .
The prevalence of PBDEs , or polybrominated diphenyl ethers , is raising concern among research scientists .
The flame retardants are known as endocrine disrupters because they interfere with the function of the thyroid hormone , which is critical to the proper development of the brain and nervous system .
Hooper is concerned that the levels of PBDEs in peregrine falcons are close to levels damaging developing neurological systems in lab rats and mice .
Compared to PCBs
Scientists compare the flame retardants to the notorious PCBs , or polychlorinated biphenyls , because of their potential for harming wildlife and humans , the persistence in the environment and the enormous amounts in commercial use .
Three decades after PCBs were banned as insulators in transformers and capacitors , they are still found in San Francisco Bay , although their concentrations in birds and fish are diminishing as levels of PBDEs rise .
Two years ago , California was the first state to ban two of the commercial mixtures of PBDEs - octa and penta .
State chemists Hooper and Myrto Petreas and their teams had found that women in Northern California had some of the world 's highest PBDE levels in breast milk and tissue .
Researchers also found that the flame retardants were contaminating the bay 's harbor seals and seabirds , which feed on fish .
A third mixture , called deca , is still in use and represents 70 percent of the PBDEs put into consumer products .
Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , has introduced a bill ( AB706 ) to ban all brominated and chlorinated flame retardants , a measure supported by environmental groups .
The four major manufacturers of flame retardants - Albemarle Corp. and Chemtura in the United States , Tosoh in Japan and Israeli Chemicals Ltd. - oppose the legislation , as does the trade group Bromine Science and Environmental Forum .
John Kyte , a spokesman in Washington , D.C. , said the group maintains that deca is one of the most studied and effective chemical flame retardants available for electrical and electronic equipment and contributes to saving thousands of lives a year .
One of the concerns over deca is that the amount in the environment is under - reported and might be more prevalent than is measured in the environment because it is unstable and breaks down to other forms of PBDEs .
But the trade group 's literature says the deca mixture is not a significant source of the wide array of PBDEs found in the environment .
The state findings that will be released today appear to contradict that argument .
The state chemists found high deca levels when they measured the concentrations in peregrine falcons that live in California 's big cities .
Overall , the eggs from the birds in urban areas contained higher levels of PBDEs than eggs from coastal or inland regions .
They also found what could be the breakdown products of the deca in the peregrine falcons .
These and other data are consistent with the breakdown of the deca to the banned PBDEs , they say .
State scientists decided to study the predatory birds , although there are only seven known nesting pairs in the Bay Area .
Along with other raptors and brown pelicans , their numbers plummeted when DDT and other chlorinated compounds caused thinning and breakage of eggshells .
Scientists fear the PBDEs will do the same .
The UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group at the Long Marine Lab in Moss Landing had 131 eggs on hand for the study , including 95 from California .
Researchers had been saving and freezing unviable eggs since the mid-1970s when the scientists started trying to repopulate the species .
Most were found as unhatched eggs in wild birds ' nests .
" We certainly were n't thinking about flame retardants , but when you have a biological sample , you do n't just throw it away , " said biologist Janet Linthicum , a research associate at the bird research group .
George and Gracie
In the study , two eggs and one dead chick produced by San Francisco 's George and Gracie were among the samples containing high levels of PBDEs , including deca , Hooper said .
The high - flying pair gained fame as Market Street observers watched them hunt birds on the wing downtown .
In 2005 , they set up a nest on the 33rd floor ledge of PG&E headquarters , where a video camera recorded their intimate personal life for the Web .
The next year , they moved to a skyscraper across the street at 201 Mission St. Last year , the Santa Cruz lab removed the eggs from their nest on the west span of the Bay Bridge , saying it was necessary to safeguard the babies when they fledged .
The mating pair returned briefly to the PG&E nest box to produce an egg that was incubated by the bird lab .
Since then , the birds have disappeared from public life .
George and Gracie have n't been seen at all this nesting season .
" We do n't know what happened to George and Gracie , " said Linthicum .
" We 're hoping they 'll show up someplace else . "

First Greenfreeze Climate - Safe Freezer Launches in the United States
September 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Ice cream lovers of the United States , rejoice .
Greenpeace and Ben & Jerry ’s have teamed up to bring the first climate - safe ice cream freezer to the USA .
The Greenfreeze refrigerator eliminates the use of hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) , an extremely potent greenhouse gas that has 1,400 times the global warming impact of CO2 .
Greenfreeze technology has been around since 1992 and is installed in over 300 million refrigerators worldwide .
But it was n’t allowed into the United States until earlier this year when the Environmental Protection Agency gave Ben & Jerry ’s the go - ahead to test 2,000 Greenfreeze units .
HFCs and other fluorinated gases are the most dangerous greenhouse gases that you ’ve probably never heard of .
Together , they are responsible for 17 percent of global warming pollution in the atmosphere .
It ’s sad that the USA has had to wait 16 years to receive such a widely - used technology , especially since Greenfreeze refrigerators make up 40 percent of all refrigerators produced worldwide each year .
But with the US on board , perhaps that number will jump even higher .

Coal - fired power stations will rely on imports from countries such as Russia .
Photograph : Robert Nickelsberg / Getty Images
As the controversy over building new coal - fired power stations in ' low carbon ' Britain heats up by the week , the defence for doing so relies more and more on ' energy security ' .
Without so - far - unproven technology to capture and bury pollution out of harm 's way , coal power is mankind 's most carbon - polluting habit .
To justify more if it , the UK government argued coal was a cheap back - up to unreliable renewables and fickle gas suppliers , and would protect jobs and investment in the industry .
But costs of building the stations and buying the fuel are rising steeply , and a growing list of experts are arguing the UK can easily keep the lights on and create jobs and prosperity by investing in renewable energy and efficiency .
But reducing the country 's dependence on gas from Russia , so the argument goes , is still vital to protect the country from future power cuts and economic gloom .
So what to make of the latest figures published by the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( DBERR ) ?
They show not only that seven out of 10 lumps of coal come from overseas , but that nearly half of those imports come from our same friends in Russia .
Coal experts point out that , unlike gas which often travels down expensive fixed pipes , it is relatively easy to switch suppliers of their product , and Russia has only a fraction of the global market .
In 2006 , it was the sixth biggest producer but still supplied less than 5 % of global consumption .
But more importantly a closer look at gas imports shows that the UK is not yet dependent on Russian gas either – its biggest supplier is Norway , and Russian gas comes in the mix through the European grid .
Gas might eventually be more of a risk , but reliance on Russian coal does seem to back - up those who argue that no fossil fuel is as politically neutral as wind ( simply " it 's there " , as one campaigner says ) or efficiency .
Whatever your preferred alternative , coal imports do seem to further weaken the government 's increasingly fragile case for building unabated new coal power .
If ministers do decide to press ahead , they might have some explaining to do .
It 's no secret that humans are having a huge impact on the life cycles of plants and animals .
UC Santa Barbara 's Steven D. Gaines and fellow researcher Dov Sax decided to test that theory by studying the world 's far - flung islands .
Their research , published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , sheds surprising light on the subject of extinction rates of species on islands .
The paper , " Species Invasions and Extinction : The Future of Native Biodiversity on Islands , " is one in a series of reports by this team studying how humans have altered the ecosystems of the planet .
Gaines and Sax started the project with a question :
What effect are humans really having on biological diversity ?
" The presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels , " said Gaines , who directs UCSB 's Marine Science Institute .
" Certainly , if you think about it at the global level , this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct . "
However , when studied on the smaller scale of islands , the findings showed something completely different .
Diversity is on the rise – markedly so in some instances .
Diversity has gone up so dramatically that it might cause some to wonder if the health of the ecosystems might not be better because the number of species is twice as high as it used to be .
But it 's not that simple , Gaines said .
" What Dov and I worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions ( of species ) do n't have large negative effects , " Gaines said .
" Indeed , most species that get introduced do n't have much effect at all .
It does n't mean that they 're not altering the ecosystem , but they 're not driving things extinct like some of the big poster - child stories we 've been hearing about . "
Still , the study showed that human colonization has had a massive impact on ecosystems of islands , with the introduction of new , exotic plants and animals .
In New Zealand , for example , there were about 2,000 native species of plants .
Since colonization , about 2,000 new plant species have become naturalized .
Over the same period , there have been few plant extinctions , so the net effect is that humans have transformed New Zealand 's landscape by bringing in so many new species .

Sax , a former postdoctoral researcher at UCSB who is now assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University , did much of the fact - finding for this report by painstakingly digging through data that had been collected over hundreds of years on islands around the world .
" This is Dov 's specialty , " Gaines said .
" Finding really old data sets that are very interesting . "
" The dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions , " Sax said .
" Changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter .
So , it 's not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing . "
With birds , it 's a different story .
The number of bird species on islands today is almost exactly the same as it was prior to human colonization , but the species of birds on the islands are very different .
About 40 percent of the species of birds that you find on islands today are introduced species , Sax said , which means that a comparable number of birds has gone extinct .
" In the case of birds , " he said , " lots of extinctions , no change in total biodiversity . "
All of this caused Gaines and Sax to ask new questions :
• Are the islands undersaturated ?
Can you still keep throwing species in there , with the result that nothing is going to happen ?
advertisement
• Are they now oversaturated ?
Are there limits in how many species an ecosystem can hold ?
• Are we building an extinction debt ?
" Which means , " Gaines said , " that by going in and mucking up the system , we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in , and we just have n't waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen .
" The whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right , " Gaines added .
" We have n't nailed the answer yet , but we 've set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not . "
What made the research possible was that many of the explorers who colonized the islands included naturalists on their boats .
From the time they landed on the islands , the naturalists were busy cataloging and documenting the plants and animals of each colony .
" It was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world , " Sax said .
" In ecological research , a ‘ strong ' correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation .
Here , the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation .
In other words , if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there . "
The study , which took a year and a half , included islands such as Lord Howe Island east of Australia and Tristan da Cunha , a group of remote volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean , among others .
" These were all oceanic islands , " Gaines said , " which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that they 're not getting regular exchanges with the mainland . "
Some experts estimate more than half of the antibiotics produced in this country are fed to farm animals , mostly to boost their growth rate .
In this excerpt from her book Secret Agents , Madeline Drexler chronicles how that practice has led to strains of drug - resistant bacteria , forcing doctors to prescribe higher and higher doses of medicine to combat these more resilient pathogens .
" Farms are some of the most insidious sources of antibiotic resistance , " Drexler writes .
" Whether carnivore or vegetarian , you cannot avoid the aftermath of antibiotics applied lower in the food chain . "
A former medical columnist for The Boston Globe , Drexler was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1996 to 1997 .
Not all resistant microbes spring from misguided human medicine .
Farms are some of the most insidious sources of antibiotic resistance .
As mentioned in Chapter 3 , antibiotics are routinely fed in tiny amounts to farm animals -- not to fend off disease , but to boost growth .
And low - level use of antibiotics is a perfect way to foster resistant organisms .
In recent years , livestock industry experts had estimated that 40 percent of antibiotics produced in the United States went to farm animals .
In 2001 , however , a report from the Union of Concerned Scientists , a Cambridge , Massachusetts - based environmental advocacy group , raised this estimate to a whopping 70 percent .
Public health experts have long worried that farmers are squandering human life - saving drugs on animals that are not even sick .
Take Campylobacter , the most common bacterial cause of foodborne illness .
In 1995 , American poultry farmers began using a fairly new class of drugs known as fluoroquinolones to treat respiratory infections in poultry .
In people , these broad - spectrum , low - toxicity drugs are some of the most prized antibiotics today , because they are slow to breed resistance and are effective against some of the hardest - to - treat infections .
Almost immediately after poultry farmers began dosing their birds with the medication , thousands of people who ate undercooked chicken contaminated with fluoroquinolone - resistant strains of campy themselves became infected with the drug - resistant bacteria .
Before the drug was used , no Campylobacter specimens cultured from hospital patients had been resistant ; today , nearly a fifth are , and the figure is sure to rise .
Even more dangerous than drug- resistant Campylobacter is resistant Salmonella , which is also present in poultry and meat .
In human medicine , fluoroquinolones are the preferred treatment for invasive , and often life - threatening , Salmonella infections .
Yet today , doctors are resorting to higher and higher doses of fluoroquinolones to treat Salmonella -- a possible prelude to full - blown resistance .
And now there 's a frightening new wrinkle in treating the organism .
In 1998 , a 12 - year - old Nebraska boy picked up a Salmonella infection from his family 's cattle that was resistant to ceftriaxone -- one of the cephalosporin class of antibiotics -- as well as a dozen other antibiotics .
Fortunately , he survived when doctors treated him with a combination of other drugs .
But when this unprecedented case was reported in 2000 , it terrified public health officials .
Ceftriaxone is one of the few antibiotics that reliably kills most bacteria .
And it is the drug of choice for children whose Salmonella infections have entered the bloodstream -- a condition that kills about 1,000 Americans every year .
Ceftriaxone is also the drug that doctors turn to when treating young victims ; because of worries about bone growth , quinolones are not approved for children .
Since 2000 , more cases of ceftriaxone - resistant Salmonella in people have turned up .
" This Salmonella is so multiresistant , " says the CDC's David Bell , " there are no good drugs left that are approved for children . "
To history - minded physicians , the situation evokes futile attempts at the turn of the last century to treat typhoid fever , another Salmonella infection .
Extrapolating from subsequent studies of patients , health officials calculate that tens of thousands of Salmonella cases each year are ceftriaxone - resistant .
The clinical problem also touches on a moral quandary : ceftriaxone is not used as a growth promoter , but rather to treat sick animals .
" It portends a dilemma , " says the CDC's Fred Angulo .
" Societally , what do you want to do : treat sick people or sick animals ? "
Another foodborne infection is VRE -- yes , the same bug that wreaks so much havoc in critically ill hospital patients .
In this country , VRE is n't primarily foodborne ; the organism is most often bred by massive vancomycin use in hospitals .
It 's a different story in Europe .
Soon after farmers there began feeding avoparcin , a growth promoter related to vancomycin , to livestock in 1974 , the animals developed vancomycin - resistant enterococci .
( Because it may be a carcinogen , avoparcin never received approval in the United States . )
In 1986 , France found its first human patient with VRE .
Within a few years , the bacterium spread throughout human intestinal tracts on the Continent .
U.S. public health experts believe that at least some of the VRE organisms in this country may have come from Europe and then proliferated under the selective influence of vancomycin in hospitals here .
But while foodborne vancomycin - resistant enterococcus infections are uncommon in the United States , a similar chain of events is starting to happen here with another drug .
For more than a quarter century , American poultry farmers have used the growth promoter virginiamycin in chicken feed .
In chickens , the drug helped breed enterococci that are resistant to virginiamycin 's human - use cousin , Synercid .
Synercid is the other " last - resort " antibiotic , approved for humans in 1999 .
Yet as a frightening presentiment to the drug 's potential downfall , more than half of grocery - store chickens carry bacteria impervious to this end - of - the - line human drug .
People are picking up these resistant bacteria in their meals .
At any one time , at least 1 percent of the U.S. population is carrying Synercid - resistant enterococci .
Usually , these intestinal bacteria are expelled as food moves through the intestines , never causing a problem .
But in the rare instance that such an individual enters the hospital -- say , for a hip replacement -- and happens to be treated with Synercid , the resistant enterococcal bacteria in the gut will go wild , threatening an infection that no antibiotic can quell .
One of the most frightening and enigmatic foodborne pathogens is a drug- resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium .
Known as Definitive Type 104 , or DT 104 , it defies five important classes of drugs in the United States ; in Europe , where it surfaced in 1984 , it thwarts seven .
This monster resistance has helped it spread in cattle , because in animals that receive any one of these drugs , DT 104 gains an advantage .
In the U.S. , hundreds of thousands of people suffer DT 104 infections annually .
Raw milk is a common culprit , the bacterium having infiltrated dairy herds .
In 1997 , for example , more than 100 Californians became sick from DT 104 in two overlapping outbreaks in Hispanic communities , where residents ate homemade Mexican - style cheese made from unpasteurized milk and sold by street vendors and specialty markets .
When scientists tried to figure out where this renegade came from , they were shocked .
DT 104's resistance genes were a strange combination -- so strange , they had never before been seen in Salmonella .
Where they had turned up was worlds away : in Asian aquaculture , where fish have been regularly treated with antibiotics since the early 1980s .
So how did they land in the American heartland ?
One theory holds that some of those Asian fish may have been ground up into fish meal , an international commodity often fed to pigs and poultry .
Or DT 104's resistance genes may have found their way into animal breeding stock , perhaps through the rendered protein of other animals .
However it happened , DT 104 appeared more or less simultaneously around the world in the 1980s , suggesting that the animals acquired these alien bacteria en masse .
In 1969 , Britain 's Swann Committee concluded that antibiotics used in human therapy or those that promote cross-resistance in people should be banned from animal growth promotion .
Unfortunately , livestock producers hew to the position that whatever drugs they feed their animals are proprietary secrets .
Besides , say industry officials , they need antibiotics to produce safe and affordable food .
A 1999 report published by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council questioned this claim .
Using the livestock industry 's own estimates , the report calculated that if farmers quit using antibiotic growth promoters , the added costs would be less than $ 10 per American consumer per year .
And a 2001 United States Department of Agriculture report showed that hog farmers actually lose money by giving pigs antibiotics that promote growth ; while animals do fatten up more , the extra poundage expands overall supply and drives down market prices .
Poultry and livestock are n't the only creatures being dosed with drugs .
Salmon , catfish , and trout on domestic fish farms get antibacterial drugs in the water .
Honeybees get antibiotics in their hives .
And each year , an estimated 300,000 pounds of antibiotic pesticides drift down on fruit trees and other crops to control or prevent bacterial infections such as fire blight .
That disease is caused by the pathogen Erwinia , a bacterial cousin of E. coli , Salmonella , and Shigella .
Erwinia now resists both streptomycin , an old drug , and tetracycline .
Researchers do n't know if the fresh fruit invitingly stacked in your supermarket is delivering drug - resistant genes to your intestines .
According to microbiologist Abigail Salyers , both the use of untreated or partially treated water for irrigation or for washing vegetables , or the use of manure as a fertilizer for vegetables and fruits could contaminate food plants with antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
Proving that no good deed goes unpunished , a 1993 study found higher levels of multidrug - resistant bacteria in intestines of vegetarians than in meat eaters .
Whether carnivore or vegetarian , you cannot avoid the aftermath of antibiotics applied lower in the food chain .

So Gary McKinnon , the hacker who cracked the computer systems of the Pentagon and Nasa from his bedroom in north London more than seven years ago , is to be extradited to stand trial in the US .
That was the ruling this week of the law lords as they departed on their summer holidays .
They brushed aside the arguments of McKinnon 's distinguished legal team that he could not be guaranteed a fair trial there .
" The difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellant 's argument suggests , " said Lord Brown of Eaton - under - Heywood , in his ruling .
" It is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him . "
Well , who knows what news gets through to Eaton - under - Heywood these days , but if Lord Brown and his four colleagues had done some cursory research on the current state of the US criminal justice system they would know there is a very stark difference between the way he could be treated by the US courts and how he would be treated here .
There may be much wrong with the British criminal justice system but , compared to the lottery that is the American judicial process , there are a number of sober differences .
For a start , here you would not find yourself in jail for 50 years for stealing $ 160 worth of video tapes , or for 25 years for smoking marijuana .
Nor does the UK operate a Guantánamo Bay where the most basic legal principles have been abandoned as part of a post - 9/11 panic .
And there is no guarantee that , if tried in the US , McKinnon would not be confronted by some grandstanding , publicity - seeking judge deeply offended that a chap in a flat in north London can leave a message saying " your security is really crap " on the Pentagon computer , as McKinnon did .
After all , one American official in this case has already said that he would like to see him " fry " .
Gary McKinnon started his hacking long before the events of September 11 and his offence has nothing to do with terrorism .
In fact , much of his exploration was in pursuit of information about UFOs .
But , because of the embarrassment he has caused the Pentagon , he is being pursued as if his offence was in some way connected to US national security .
He will not , in reality , face 60 years in jail , but he could well receive a grossly disproportionate sentence for an offence that would be dealt with in this country with a fine and community service .
Maybe he would have to pay some compensation , although the real financial cost to the Pentagon and Nasa systems is small , certainly nothing like the fanciful , inflated claim of $ 700,000 being made by the US authorities .
The real loss is one of face .
What McKinnon did was expose a faulty security system in a mischievous fashion .
Previous hackers in this country who have transgressed in this way , out of curiosity rather than for financial gain , have been rewarded with jobs as security consultants by the very firms whose systems they cracked .
McKinnon himself has been congratulated by some members of the US military for showing up the failings of their system .
If the US authorities had been smart , they would have invited McKinnon into the embassy and asked him for advice rather than seeking to make him a scapegoat for their own inadequacies .
This week , the law lords had a wonderful opportunity to assert our independence from the US and to make a point about the abandonment of legal principles there since September 11 .
They have failed to do so .
We must now hope that the European court of human rights will step in to prevent a great injustice to a man whose real offence was to tell the Pentagon a blunt truth .
A new way to fly !
Turtle Airships company announces the beginning of construction iof a demonstration model of a new form for lighter - than - air airships .
The airships are not blimps .
They are solar powered and will reach speeds of 200 mph .
We can save over $ 100 billion each year on fuel costs alone , another several hundred billion dollars in airport construction , and eliminate a major source of carbon emissions .
Airships are a trillion dollar industry , still in its ' infancy , that will grow for decades .
Turtle Airships company will change the world aviation industry with 200 mph solar powered airships .
Constructed with rigid shelled hulls of aluminum and carbon fiber , the airships look like giant turtles .
These " turtle " airships are not blimps or zeppelins .
The airships are being designed in Spain and the U.S .
Construction has started on a first prototype and the first flight and testing is scheduled to be done in Singapore this year .
Turtle Airships will make a demonstration around - the - world flight of the new solar powered airship in 2009 .
The airships ' hulls are covered with solar cells which power the airships during daylight hours .
For flying at night or cloudy weather , the airships use bio - diesel fueled jet engines as a back - up system .
The airships cruise at speeds which are comparable to some airplanes .
The airships take off and land straight up and down like a helicopter and are amphibious .
They land directly onto the water and take on water ballast for stability like a boat .
The airships can land in harbors , rivers , mountain lakes , or the middle of the ocean .
The airships will also land on any empty field or at airports , and use built in systems to anchor to the surface without ground crew assistance .
Turtle airships do not need huge hangers and can fly in any weather .
" Almost everyone immediately thinks of blimps or the Hindenburg , " says company president , Darrell Campbell .
" The Turtle airship is far more advanced in technology and capabilities . "
Although there are less than fifty blimps or zeppelins in the world now , Turtle Airships expects to field hundreds of its ' solar powered airships .
Turtle Airships plans to invest over $ 200 million in airship manufacturing plants and airship operations by 2012 ; with an expected ( IPO ) public offering to raise over $ 3 billion scheduled for 2015 .
To reach these goals the company will work with local and national Economic Development agencies throughout the world to train workers and develop solar powered airship programs .
Turtle Airships will also enter into joint ventures and is seeking venture capital and private investments which are directed toward alternative fuels and solar energy .
The company will concentrate on building airships meant for the travel market , with secondary emphasis given to military applications .
The company had been originally considered for a U.S. Department of Defense airship program called " WALRUS " , which was to create giant airships for military transport .
Turtle Airships is designing airships for security surveillance and interdiction of pirates in the waters off of Somalia , Indonesia , and Nigeria .
Turtle Airships will also use " flying hospitals " to deliver worldwide humanitarian aid .
Carrying doctors , foods , emergency equipment and other supplies , airships can avoid delays and complex delivery systems by flying to disaster areas and landing directly where help is needed .
The airships will be made available to the United Nations , International Red Cross , Red Crescent , and other aid organizations .
" Turtle Airships is the only company in the world that is focused on creating a new aviation industry based on solar powered flight , " says Campbell .
" We can save over $ 100 billion each year on fuel costs alone , another several hundred billion dollars in airport construction , and eliminate a major source of carbon emissions .
Airships are a trillion dollar industry , still in its ' infancy , that will grow for decades . "
Campy 1960s TV show Batman could be the real target of 20th Century Fox 's legal battle with Warner Bros .
over next year 's Watchmen movie , according to comics blog Lying in the Gutters .
Fox filed its Watchmen suit as a tool to win the right to release the Batman show on DVD , the blog theorizes :
" Sources tell me that Fox want the 1960s Batman TV series , " writes columnist Rich Johnston .
" Currently Fox own the TV footage , but Warner Bros. own the characters and trademarks , via their ownership of DC Comics .
The rights to a DVD release have been held up for a long time now , and this case looks like it may be the instrument to release them . "
Another site , TVShowsOnDVD.com , says
Fox faces plenty of other legal hurdles with regards to releasing Batman on DVD .
In addition to the typical rights - clearance issues – music , writers , directors , on - and off - camera talent – the show featured tons of cool cameos and guest stars .
The show 's running " Bat - climb " gag , in which the Dynamic Duo appeared to climb up a wall and often passed other ABC stars , contributes to what the site calls a " rights hell " faced by Fox as it tries to bring Batman to DVD .
The frequent cameos and other pop culture tidbits buried in the Batman TV show helped make it a pop culture classic , equally loved and loathed by Bat - fans around the world .
Do you have any favorite cameos or enduring peeves about the show ?
Let us know in the Bat - comments section below .

George W. Bush might have now nationalized more companies than Hugo Chavez .

Who knew George Bush would turn out to be such a socialist ?
You might even argue , communist .
What happened , I thought the government was unnecessary ?
I thought " unfettered " markets would do their magic if you just deregulated them .
Why are you fettering ?
It turns out , all that talk about not needing big government flies right out the window when the shit hits the fan .
Did we need government during Hurricane Katrina ?
Did we need the government during Sept. 11th ?
That was a day when we certainly could have used some more government help , like a president reading a briefing that said they were determined to attack us .
And now , do we need the government when there is a financial meltdown ?
You betcha .
All of a sudden , the Republicans are huge advocates of big government coming to the rescue .
Why do n't we toss a pair of bootstraps at AIG and see if that does the trick ?
Oh I see , that 's just for poor and middle class people who need a little bit of help .
They get the bootstraps and AIG gets the $ 85 billion government bailout .
So , now that we have basically bought these companies , what the hell are we going to do with them ?
Is the United States government going to run these companies indefinitely ?
Is the Bush administration saying that it's a terrible idea for the federal government to provide health insurance to everyone , but it 's a great idea to provide other kinds of insurance ?
Remember , AIG is in the insurance business .
Is health insurance the only kind of insurance the government should n't be involved in ?
I 'm for sensible government regulation of these industries , but I believe in capitalism .
So , George Bush 's socialism is wigging me out .
He privatizes the army but socializes the mortgage industry .
I understand how this came about , but does Bush have a plan ?
Do they have any idea how they are going to get out of this business or are they planning on running a quasi - socialist government from now on ?
If other industries head south , will Bush nationalize those too ?
Who has more nationalized companies now -- the US or Russia ?
Could George Bush 's administration have been any more disastrous ?
He comes in promising to shrink the size of the government and let free markets reign supreme .
He leaves while nationalizing more private companies than possibly any president in United States history .
Could there be a clearer indication of the failure of conservative ideology ?

“ It appears that every time we peel away this onion , there is another layer , ” said Curtis D. Ishii , the senior investment officer for fixed income at Calpers , the large California pension fund .
He added that investors were starting to realize that the pain in the credit market would persist for some time .
One measure of that stress is found in falling home prices .
“ To the extent that home prices keep spiraling down , the need for capital keeps increasing , ” said Alejandro H. Aguilar , a portfolio manager at American Century Investments , the mutual fund company .
Investors will be able to better estimate the size of their losses once it becomes clear how far prices will fall and when they will hit bottom .
As they wait for the housing market to recover , many investors have continued to rush to safe havens like Treasuries and other debts with a government backing or a short payoff , a sign that investors remain unwilling to invest in mortgages , even though lending standards have improved from the go - go days of the housing boom .
Money market funds , the short - term cash alternatives , grew to $ 2.9 trillion in June , up from $ 2.1 trillion a year ago , according to Crane Data .
Those funds , in turn , have more than tripled their holdings of Treasuries and other government debt while reducing the share of their portfolios invested in somewhat riskier corporate notes .
Patrick Ledford , chief investment officer at the Reserve , one of the nation ’s largest operators of money market funds , said some institutional investors had moved assets into government funds from broader money market funds to avoid exposure to commercial paper , which are short - term debts .
Some of the slack in the credit market has been taken up by the government chartered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae .
The three firms have securitized $ 692 billion in home mortgages through June , putting them on track to match , approximately , the $ 1.2 trillion they securitized in 2007 , according to Inside Mortgage Finance , a financial trade publication .
But prices for these securities have fallen in the last two months , despite the backing of the government companies and initiatives by Congress and the Treasury to create a stronger government safety net for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .

Introduction
The Perl language is commonly used by IBM ® AIX ® operating system administrators and developers and can be found on nearly every successful Web site and most AIX systems .
Although Perl scripts are powerful , they produce a Web interface that lacks a graphical front end and forces the user to type information instead of using the mouse , which can be an unsatisfying experience for the customer .
This problem has been resolved with the introduction of the Tk module in Perl .
An administrator or developer can quickly breathe new life into their Perl script with the Tk module and satisfy their customer 's desire for an X11 product .
Widgets
As discussed in Part 1 of this series of articles , a widget can be defined as a graphical object that performs a specific function .
Any graphical object in the Perl / Tk module can be considered a widget .
When you think of a GUI application , the buttons , text , frames , and scrollbars are all widgets .
This article , the third part of the article series , discusses such widgets as DirTree , LabEntry , LabFrame , and Table .
DirTree
A major visual component to programming is how to handle searching files and directories .
One solution to this dilemma is using the DirTree widget .
Creating a directory listing is simple with the Perl / Tk module :
#!/usr /bin/perl –w #create a directory listing with DirTree use Tk ; use strict ; use Tk: : DirTree ; use Cwd ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x400 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " DirTree Example " ) ; my $ CWD = Cwd : : cwd ( ) ; my $ DIR_TREE = $ mw -> Scrolled ( ' DirTree ' , - scrollbars => " osoe " , - width => 30 , - height => 25 , - exportselection => 1 , - browsecmd => sub { $CWD = shift} , - command => \&show_cwd ) -> pack ( - fill => " both " , - expand => 1 ) ; $ DIR_TREE -> chdir( $ CWD ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Ok " , - command => \&show_cwd ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; sub show_cwd { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Directory Selected : $ CWD " , - type => " ok " ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing this script will generate the GUI application shown in Figures 1 and 2 :
Figure 1 .
An example of the DirTree widget
Figure 2 . Displaying the selected directory
Let 's break down the script .
To review what was discussed in Part 1 and Part 2 of this series , the first section of the code will be only discussed once , unless anything has changed in the following examples .
The first part ( /usr / bin / perl ) defines the location where the Perl executable resides on the computer and instructs the computer to use this copy of the Perl executable to execute the file multiple_windows_at_once - demo.pl :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
The second part of this line ( - w ) is a valuable tool in Perl .
It enables warnings when executing the script , informing the end user of any possible errors found .
Comments and text that should n't be evaluated at execution are preceded with an octothorp ( # ) :
# create a directory listing with DirTree
In order for a Perl script to use the Tk module , it must be included ; hence use Tk .
Adding the use strict statement to a Perl script also helps find any possible typos or logic errors :
use Tk ; use strict ;
To use the DirTree widget , you must include it into the Perl script , because it is n't a general widget in the base Perl modules .
The second inclusion is Cwd .
Using this , the script can find and store the CWD , or current working directory :
use Tk: : DirTree ; use Cwd ;
To create the primary window of the application , you use MainWindow and assign it to $ mw .
$ mw acts as the parent to all other widgets created ( as discussed further in this article ) :
my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ;
Set the main window size to 300x400 , and title the main window DirTree Example :
$ mw -> geometry ( " 300x400 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " DirTree Example " ) ;
Find the CWD , and store it in a variable named $ CWD :
my $ CWD = Cwd: :cwd ( ) ;
Create a scrollable directory tree .
The browsecmd option resets $ CWD every time the end user selects a directory .
If the end user double - clicks or presses Enter on a directory , the command option executes the subroutine show_cmd :
my $ DIR_TREE = $ mw -> Scrolled ( ' DirTree ' , - scrollbars => " osoe " , - width => 30 , - height => 25 , - exportselection => 1 , - browsecmd => sub { $CWD = shift} , - command => \&show_cwd ) -> pack ( - fill => " both " , - expand => 1 ) ;
Refresh the directory tree showing the user 's CWD :
$ DIR_TREE->chdir( $ CWD ) ;
Create a frame , and place two buttons inside it .
The first button , labeled " OK , " executes the subroutine show_cmd ; the second button exits the script :
my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Ok " , - command => \&show_cwd ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ;
When the subroutine show_cmd is executed , a messageBox widget is displayed , showing the user his CWD :
sub show_cwd { $ mw->messageBox ( - message => " Directory Selected : $ CWD " , - type => " ok " ) ; }
Prior to executing MainLoop , everything in the script is read , defined , and prepared to execute .
Then , when MainLoop is called , all functions and data read prior are executed , and the GUI is displayed :
MainLoop ;
LabEntry
Many GUI applications require manual input from the end user .
One method of displaying instructions and requesting input uses the Label and Entry widgets ( discussed in Part 1 of this series ) .
Another method uses the LabEntry widget .
LabEntry combines the Label , Entry , and Frame widgets into one easy - to - use widget :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk ; use Tk:: LabEntry ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow -> new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " LabEntry Example " ) ; my $ name = " " ; $ mw -> LabEntry ( - label =>
" Enter your name : " , - labelPack => [ - side => " left " ] , - textvariable => \ $name ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Ok " , - command => \&show_greeting ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; sub show_greeting { my $ msg =
" Who are you ? " ; if ( $ name ne " " ) { $ msg = " Nice to meet you $ name ! " ; } $ mw->messageBox ( - message => " $msg
" , - type => " ok " ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application shown in Figures 3 and 4 .
Figure 3 .
An example of the LabEntry widget
Figure 4 . Results of the LabEntry widget
Let 's break down the script .
Like the previous example with DirTree , the LabEntry widget needs to be included .
If you do n't include the widget , the Perl script does n't know how to interrupt or execute LabEntry widgets :
use Tk:: LabEntry ;
Define a variable named $ name , and set its value to NULL , or nothing .
After the variable has been defined , create the LabEntry widget with the label Enter your name : , pack the label left of the entry , and assign the value entered to the variable $ name :
my $ name = " " ; $ mw -> LabEntry ( - label =>
" Enter your name : " , - labelPack => [ - side => " left " ] , - textvariable => \ $name ) -> pack ( ) ;
Create a frame , and include two Button widgets inside it .
The first button , labeled " OK , " executes the subroutine show_greeting ; the second exits the script :
my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Ok " , - command => \&show_greeting ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ;
When the OK button is clicked , the subroutine show_greeting is executed .
The variable $msg is defined with the value " Who are you ? "
The variable is defined with this value in case the end user forgets to enter his name in the LabEntry .
If the user forgets , the variable $ name is still set to NULL .
If the user enters a name , the value " Nice to meet you $ name ! " will be set to $msg , which can be seen in the next line of code .
Finally , a messageBox widget is displayed to the user , either greeting him or letting him know the program has no idea who he is :
sub show_greeting { my $ msg = " Who are you ? " ; if ( $ name ne " " ) { $ msg = " Nice to meet you $ name ! " ; } $ mw->messageBox ( - message => " $msg
" , - type => " ok " ) ; }
LabFrame
The Frame widget has been used throughout this series of articles .
Frames are used to organize other widgets , making the application look cleaner and more structured .
A handy widget to accompany a frame is the LabFrame .
Using the LabFrame widget , you can place labels on or by the frame with little work :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk ; use Tk: : LabFrame ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow -> new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x200 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " LabFrame Example " ) ; my $ labeled_frame1 = $ mw-> LabFrame ( - label => " Caption Across Top of Frame " , - labelside => " acrosstop " ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ labeled_frame2 = $ mw -> LabFrame ( - label => " Caption Below Frame " , - labelside => " bottom " ) -> pack ( - fill => " x " ) ; $ labeled_frame1 -> Label ( - text => " Inside Frame # 1 " ) -> pack ( ) ; $ labeled_frame2 -> Label ( - text => " Inside Frame # 2 " ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 .
An example of the LabFrame widget
Let 's break down the script .
The LabFrame widget is no different from the previous widget examples in this article and needs to be included :
use Tk:: LabFrame ;
Create a frame , and label it Caption Across Top of Frame .
To place the caption on the top of the frame as the caption suggests , you must configure the LabFrame widget with the value " acrosstop " for the option labelside :
my $ labeled_frame1 = $ mw-> LabFrame ( - label => " Caption Across Top of Frame " , - labelside => " acrosstop " ) -> pack ( ) ;
Create a second LabFrame widget , but instead of running the caption along the top of the frame , place the label Caption Below Frame below the frame with the option labelside set to " bottom " :
my $ labeled_frame2 = $ mw-> LabFrame ( - label => " Caption Below Frame " , - labelside => " bottom " ) -> pack ( - fill => " x " ) ;
To demonstrate widgets inside a LabFrame , create two Label widgets by their parent LabFrame widgets :
$ labeled_frame1 -> Label ( - text => " Inside Frame # 1 " ) -> pack ( ) ; $ labeled_frame2 -> Label ( - text => " Inside Frame # 2 " ) -> pack ( ) ;
Table
The Table widget is a powerful addition to a Perl script .
This widget creates a two - dimensional table of widgets .
Instead of showing a long listing of data that is n't organized , you can use a table :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use Tk ; use Tk : : Table ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow -> new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 475x125 " ) ; $ mw -> resizable ( 0,0 ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Table Example " ) ; my $ table_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ table = $ table_frame -> Table ( - columns => 8 , - rows => 4 , - fixedrows => 1 , - scrollbars => ' oe ' , - relief => ' raised ' ) ; foreach my $ col ( 1 .. 8 ) { my $ tmp_label = $ table -> Label ( - text => " COL " .
$ col , - width => 8 , - relief =>' raised ' ) ; $ table -> put ( 0 , $ col , $ tmp_label ) ; } foreach my $row ( 1 .. 8 ) { foreach my $ col ( 1 .. 8 ) { my $ tmp_label = $ table -> Label ( - text => $ row . " , " . $ col , - padx => 2 , - anchor => 'w ' , - background => ' white ' , - relief => " groove " ) ; $ table -> put ( $row , $ col , $ tmp_label ) ; } } $ table -> pack ( ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( - borderwidth => 4 )-> pack ( ) ; $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub {exit} ) -> pack ( ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 .
An example of the Table widget
Let 's break down the script .
You guessed it !
Another new widget must be included , for Perl to know how to handle the Table widget :
use Tk : : Table ;
In the previous examples , the end user could resize the applications .
This script prohibits the user from resizing the window :
$ mw ->resizable ( 0,0 ) ;
Create a frame to contain the new table .
Then , create the Table widget , which displays eight columns and four rows :
my $ table_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ table = $ table_frame -> Table ( - columns => 8 , - rows => 4 , - fixedrows => 1 , - scrollbars => ' oe ' , - relief => ' raised ' ) ;
To place data in the table , you use the put operation .
Looping through eight times , the text " COL " is added to the number of the column and placed in the first ( 0th ) row of the table :
foreach my $ col ( 1 .. 8 ) { my $ tmp_label = $ table -> Label ( - text => " COL " .
$ col , - width => 8 , - relief =>' raised ' ) ; $ table -> put ( 0 , $ col , $ tmp_label ) ; }
Now that the header has been created , the coordinates are placed in the respective cell .
Again , using the put operation , loop through each row and each column and assign the cell 's text .
Then , pack the finalized table :
foreach my $row ( 1 .. 8 ) { foreach my $ col ( 1 .. 8 ) { my $ tmp_label = $ table -> Label ( - text => $ row . " , " . $ col , - padx => 2 , - anchor => 'w ' , - background => ' white ' , - relief => " groove " ) ; $ table -> put ( $row , $ col , $ tmp_label ) ; } } $ table -> pack ( ) ;
Canvas
The Canvas widget is a useful drawing tool in the Perl / Tk module .
Using this widget , a user can draw and manipulate different shapes and objects such as lines , ovals , rectangles , and polygons :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 400x400 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Canvas Example " ) ; my $ canvas = $ mw -> Canvas ( - relief => " sunken " , - background => " blue " ) ; $ canvas->createLine ( 2 , 3 , 350 , 100 , - width => 10 , - fill => " black " ) ; $ canvas->createLine ( 120 , 220 , 450 , 200 , - fill => " red " ) ; $ canvas->createOval ( 30 , 80 , 100 , 150 , - fill => " yellow " ) ; $ canvas->createRectangle ( 50 , 20 , 100 , 50 , - fill => " cyan " ) ; $ canvas->createArc ( 40 , 40 , 200 , 200 , - fill => " green " ) ; $ canvas->createPolygon ( 350 , 120 , 190 , 160 , 250 , 120 , - fill => " white " ) ; $ canvas -> pack ( ) ; $ mw -> Button ( - text => ' Exit ' , - command => sub {exit} ) -> pack ( ) ; ; MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 7 .
Figure 7 .
An example of the Canvas widget
Let 's break down the script .
This code creates the Canvas widget :
my $ canvas = $ mw -> Canvas ( - relief => " sunken " , - background => " blue " ) ;
Create a black line that has a width of 10 , and draw it from ( 2 , 3 ) to ( 350 , 100 ) .
When you 're working with objects and shapes in a Canvas widget , the first group of numeric values are the coordinates .
It 's easiest to view an object with the formula < object >( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , .... ) :
$ canvas->createLine ( 2 , 3 , 350 , 100 , - width => 10 , - fill => " black " ) ; $ canvas->createLine ( 120 , 220 , 450 , 200 , - fill => " red " ) ;
Create a yellow oval from ( 30 , 80 ) to ( 100 , 150 ) on the Canvas widget :
$ canvas->createOval ( 30 , 80 , 100 , 150 , - fill => " yellow " ) ;
Create a cyan rectangle from ( 50 , 20 ) to ( 100 , 50 ) on the Canvas widget :
$ canvas->createRectangle ( 50 , 20 , 100 , 50 , - fill => " cyan " ) ;
Create a green arc from ( 40 , 40 ) to ( 200 , 200 ) on the Canvas widget :
$ canvas->createArc( 40 , 40 , 200 , 200 , - fill => " green " ) ;
Create a white polygon from ( 350 , 120 ) to ( 190 , 160 ) and ( 250 , 120 ) on the Canvas widget :
$ canvas->createPolygon ( 350 , 120 , 190 , 160 , 250 , 120 , - fill => " white " ) ;
After all the objects have been created , as always , pack the widget :
$ canvas -> pack ( ) ;
Conclusion
Introducing Perl with the Perl / Tk module into an AIX environment can benefit the developer , administrator , and customer or end user .
What began as a script that may look dull to the customer can be enhanced into a professional - looking GUI application .
It may take you a short time to get the hang of the widgets , but once you 've mastered them , the results are worth the effort !

We ’ve talked before that metered access is a boneheaded idea that is bad for innovation , bad for Microsoft and Google , and ultimately bad for you .
Until today , the idea seemed like an eventuality , not an immediate reality .
But then NBC and TonicTV launched a new service that lets you download video from the Olympics and watch it offline .
Right next to the installation instructions was this “ important ” note :
That ’s the first warning I ’ve seen about a particular service not being recommended for folks with metered broadband access .
But the real bummer ?
That is just a taste of things to come — especially if you ’re a fan of video services like Hulu .
We ’re not even talking P2P throttling , just straight video consumption .
In fact , P2P is n’t even a huge deal for networks anymore ( but not because of that slap on the wrist the FCC gave Comcast ) .
DSLReports writes that as of June “ AT&T traffic was about 1/3 Web ( non video / audio streams ) , 1/3 Web video / audio streams , and 1/5 P2P . ”
Those audio and video streams — that ’s Hulu and YouTube .
And as they provide more content at higher quality , those streams are only going to increase .
[ digg=http://digg.com/tech_news/Warning_Sign_Metered_Broadband_Already_a_Hassle]
If metered access becomes standard , there will come a day when you spend less time watching videos , and more time counting the number of videos you watched to avoid going over your cap .
You have been warned .

Health reporter , BBC News
Imagine you are an Olympic athlete who has spent most of your life training towards what could be your one shot at a gold medal .
A finely tuned training programme has enabled you to acclimatise to conditions you are unaccustomed to , such as heat or altitude .
But on the big day there is one aspect you have no control over - the quality of the air you are breathing in .
BBC tests suggest the level of pollution in Beijing is currently well outside international air quality standards .
The organisers have to take a responsible attitude to endurance events and be brave enough to change the start time if needed
John Brewer , Lucozade Sports Science Academy
It has been reported that the International Olympic Committee is being flooded with applications from athletes to use asthma medication during the Games .
But is this an over - reaction or can pollution really affect an athlete 's chances ?
John Brewer , performance director at the Lucozade Sport Science Academy in Slough , says it absolutely can but the extent of the effect will depend on the event .
Endurance
The outdoor competitors least at risk of suffering from the effects pollution will be the sprinters who barely take a breath before the race is over and others doing short sharp intensive events such as the shot put and javelin .
Athletes competing for longer lengths of time , such as rowers and medium distance runners may notice the effects more , he says .
And those playing team sports should not be forgotten - hockey players for example have short bursts of activity from which they need to recover quickly .
But competitors who should be most worried are those doing endurance races , such as cycling and most notably the marathon .
Marathon runners , such as Paula Radcliffe may suffer most from pollution " Marathon runners take about 40 to 50 breaths per minute and there is a real need for oxygen to be transported to the muscles .
" In normal conditions oxygen makes up about 21 % of the air , if that 's compromised , because the very complex transport process in the lungs is compromised , there will be less oxygen getting to the muscles .
" Add in the heat and the humidity and there could be some major implications , " says Brewer .
No one has done a study comparing the effects of say running a marathon in clean air and in a polluted environment .
But what evidence there is suggests there will be an impact .
" If the pollution is still at the level that has been recorded by the BBC on the day of a distance endurance event then it is almost certain that performance times will be affected , " Brewer says .
PM10 LEVELS IN CENTRAL BEIJING WHO maximum : 50 micrograms / cubic metre
01/07/08 : 121 02/07/08 : 172 03/07/08 : 122 04/07/08 : 351 05/07/08 : 112 06/07/08 : 27 07/07/08 : 242
" The organisers have to take a responsible attitude to endurance events and be brave enough to change the start time or withdraw athletes if needed - they need to protect the health and wellbeing of the competitors . "
The BBC has measured the levels of tiny particles ( known as PM10 ) in the air for 10 minutes at the same time each day .
Research shows the size of the particles enables them to get right down into the part of the lungs where oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream .
Once there they cause irritation and inflammation in healthy people and are liable to exacerbate existing conditions such as asthma .
High levels of PM10 have also been directly linked with higher mortality rates by the World Health Organisation .
Undesirable Professor Sir Malcolm Green , vice president of the British Lung Foundation said it was important to measure air pollution over 24 hours because it can be affected by rush hour traffic or weather conditions .
" But if the 24 - hour average for PM10 is 100 or 150 , it is unacceptably high and it would be highly undesirable for people to be doing marathons with that level of pollution .
" And particularly for Olympic athletes who are pushing their heart and lungs to the absolute maximum . "
If the 24 - hour average for PM10 is 100 or 150 , it is unacceptably high and it would be highly undesirable for people to be doing marathons with that level of pollution
Professor Sir Malcolm Green
He said closing the roads before the start of the Olympics , as was planned by the Beijing authorities should help .
Such pollution can cause greater problems in those with underlying respiratory conditions .
Paula Radcliffe , who is still hoping to compete despite recovering from a stress fracture , is one athlete who famously suffers from asthma .
" Anything that causes irritation of the lungs is likely to exacerbate an existing condition , " Sir Malcolm warned .
For their part the British Olympic Association is increasingly confident that the air quality in Beijing is improving .
They have warned athletes that the heat and humidity are likely to have more of an impact on performance and have taken expert advice on how to mitigate the effects .
Brewer adds : " I was in Seoul in 1998 when they banned the traffic and the problems that had been predicted did n't materialise .
" I hope that 's the case this time and do n't forget the athletes will have been prepared for it . "

The story about a Georgia school 's struggle to teach evolution in Jesusland may be the most emailed story on the Times website right now , but you had to read it on paper to get the full experience .
( Well , this time you can just click for our scan . )
Amid fresh fighting by US forces in Iraq , Sunday 's meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and President Bush at his Texas ranch serves as a reminder of America 's deep involvement in this other key Arab nation .
Aid is central to Washington 's relationship with Cairo .
The US has provided Egypt with $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid since 1979 , and an average of $ 815 million a year in economic assistance .
All told , Egypt has received over $ 50 billion in US largesse since 1975 .
The money is seen as bolstering Egypt 's stability , support for US policies in the region , US access to the Suez Canal , and peace with Israel .
But some critics question the aid 's effectiveness in spurring economic and democratic development in the Arab world 's most populous country - a higher US priority after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" Aid offers an easy way out for Egypt to avoid reform , " says Edward Walker , the US ambassador to Egypt from 1994 to 1998 .
" They use the money to support antiquated programs and to resist reforms . "
Egypt 's economy is deeply troubled .
Unemployment has climbed to 25 percent , foreign investment last year dropped to a 20 - year low , and until recently the currency was losing value on a weekly basis .
Rather than helping , American aid is " depressing the need for reform , " according to former Ambassador Walker .
Meanwhile , the Mubarak regime is inching towards political reform and democratic pluralism at a pace so slow that many question the sincerity of the government 's pro-democracy rhetoric .
In the past , issues like democracy and economic reform were of secondary concern to policymakers looking to shore up a friendly government .
Support for Egypt jumped after it made peace with Israel in 1979 .
However , US policy has changed since 19 hijackers demonstrated that bolstering stable , pro-American , but undemocratic regimes in the Middle East affected America 's security .
The ringleader and four of the 9/11 hijackers were Egyptian .
In 2002 , the US National Security Strategy articulated a new aid doctrine , saying that money should go to " countries whose governments rule justly , invest in their people , and encourage economic freedom . "
Colin Powell 's Middle East Partnership Initiative ( MEPI ) is refocusing funding priorities in the Middle East - including those at USAID 's 300 person Cairo office - on economic reform , democracy , education , and women 's issues .
" We 're shifting our emphases to reflect changes in US foreign policy , " said Ken Ellis , the director of USAID Egypt .
USAID is a government - to - government economic assistance program .
It operates on the premise that economic development will spur democratic development .
In the words of Mr. Ellis , " There is a correlation between strong , vibrant , open economies , and a strong , vibrant , open political system . "
But many say that USAID needs to alter its approach if it is going to push successfully for substantive reform in Egypt .
Ismail Sabry Abdallah is the former Egyptian minister of development and planning , and negotiated the first USAID contract on behalf of Egypt in 1974 .
Now an independent economist , Abdallah says USAID needs to decrease support for the Egyptian government , and increase its support for civil society in order to realize the sort of economic and political reforms that the United States and the Egyptian people desire .
" [ USAID ] is distributed by the Egyptian government in an anarchic way , through personal contacts and political influence , " Abdallah says .
Each year USAID gives $ 200 million to the Egyptian government in cash handouts to do with as it pleases .
The money is theoretically conditional upon economic reforms in problem areas such as deregulation , privatization , and free trade .
Most Egyptian economists and businessmen , however , agree that few positive economic reforms have occurred .
" The role of the state in Egypt is still very similar to the role of the state in Eastern Europe in the 1960s , " says Tarek Heggy , the former head of Shell Oil in the Middle East , and a prolific writer on Egyptian society .
" I am not aware of much economic reform . "
USAID has been ineffective at changing economic policy here because Cairo knows that in the end it will get the US money regardless of its economic policy , according to Walker , who since leaving the State Department has become head of the Middle East Institute in Washington .
" Egypt remains as anti-investment as it has ever been because we have never made our aid program conditional , " says Walker .
At Sunday 's meeting in Crawford , Texas , geopolitics may temper any US push for Egyptian reform as Bush seeks cooperation from Mubarak on Iraq and Israel 's plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip .
Ellis , who has been in Cairo for eight months , disagrees with the critics of USAID .
The Egyptian government is making slow progress toward economic and democratic reform , he says .
The doomsday prognoses are coming from those frustrated with the pace of reform , but they do not reflect the reality on the ground , according to Ellis .
" I think Egypt has made significant progress in economic reform , " he said .
He later added , " I do n't accept the fact that [ Egypt ] is stagnating , and I do n't accept the fact that the government of Egypt does n't want to change . "
But Ellis does concede that there is more to be done in Egypt .
The country is dominated by the ruling National Democratic Party , which uses a 23 - year - old emergency law to restrict civil liberties .
There are strict limitations on the establishment of newspapers and political parties , and presidential elections are single - candidate referendums .
Top recipients of US aid each year
IrAQ - In 2004 , it will become the largest recipient of US aid , receiving $ 18.4 billion .
Israel -
The largest recipient of US largesse in 2003 , getting $ 2.1 billion in military aid annually ; $ 600 million in economic aid .
Egypt -
Out of a US foreign aid budget of about $ 14 billion in 2003 , Egypt was the second largest recipient with $ 1.3 billion in military aid ; $ 615 million for social programs .
Colombia - Got $ 540 million to battle the drug trade , and local terrorist groups .
Jordan -
Got $ 250 million in economic support ; $ 198 in military financing .
Peru , Ukraine , Russia Received approximately $ 200 million each in economic and military aid annually .

Right to Life group claims its DNC sign is Guinness record John Byrne
Published : Tuesday August 26 , 2008
Print This Email This American Right to Life Action , an anti-abortion group , claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history , towering over the Democratic National Convention in Denver at 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide .
The sign says " Destroys uNborn Children " [ sic ] , with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym " DNC . "
According to a release from the group , " thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign .
Sponsored by American RTL
Action , the message initially appeared with three enormous 160 - foot tall , bright yellow letters , D - N - C , stacked on top of each other . "
In a press release , the group 's president sought to call on visceral emotions and the love of children .
" The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected , " ARTL Action president Steve Curtis said in a release .
" But as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes , the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother 's voice , sleep and dream , suck their thumbs , and play with their toes . "
Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number : 228132 , according to the group .
The protest sign weighs nearly three tons " and was sewed together with more than four miles of seams connecting 2,400 sheets and backpacked onto location and unfurled by 44 letter carriers with spotters a mile away to ensure proper letter placement . "
Just like they did last year , Paramount has chosen Creation ’s official Star Trek convention to give fans a new poster for JJ Abrams ’ Star Trek .
Actually they are giving fans eight posters ; the four that were given out at Comic Con and four new ones in the same style but with the rest of the main crew from the film .
TrekMovie has a first look below .
Here they are
Just like with the Comic Con posters ( which are also being given out ) , the new posters form the Star Trek delta emblem when put together , but each is a large sized poster on its own .
The four new Star Trek posters feature ( clockwise from upper right below ) : John Cho ( Sulu ) , Simon Pegg ( Scotty ) , Anton Yelchin ( Chekov ) , and Karl Urban ( McCoy ) .
Four new Star Trek posters
UPDATE :
The following are some glare - free versions of the posters , but admittedly still not perfect .
They are a bit cropped as well to remove the edges .
Higher res pictures of four new Star Trek posters ( click to enlarge )
Old school is back
This second set of posters makes the design of the new crew uniforms even more apparent and confirms what TrekMovie previously reported about the uniforms , specifically that they are very similar to the Original Series uniforms , but comprised of two pieces ( undershirt and overshirt ) and also have small ‘ delta shield ’
Starfleet emblems woven into the fabric .
Fans get two
At Comic - con fans were officially allowed one poster each ( meaning you only get one cast member ) , however many fans just kept coming back to the Paramount booth until they collected all four .
Here in Las Vegas , to ensure everyone gets something , a two poster per person rule has been put in place .
It is likely that these posters from both Vegas and San Diego will be hot collectors items .

Hundreds of baby penguins swept from the icy shores of Antarctica and Patagonia are washing up dead on Rio de Janeiro 's tropical beaches .
More than 400 of the birds have been found dead on the area 's beaches in the past two months , and more are being found in a distressed or sickly condition .
While it is common to find a few dozen penguins swept here from the Straits of Magellan by strong currents , there have been more this year than at any time in recent memory .
Experts are divided over the possible causes .
Thiago Muniz , a veterinarian at the Niteroi zoo , said he believed overfishing has forced the penguins to swim further from shore to find fish to eat , " and that leaves them more vulnerable to getting caught up in the strong ocean currents " .
Niteroi , the state 's biggest zoo , has already received about 100 penguins for treatment this year , many of them drenched in petroleum .
The Campos oil field that supplies most of Brazil 's oil lies offshore .
But biologist Erli Costa of Federal University suggested weather patterns could be involved .
" I do n't think the levels of pollution are high enough to affect the birds so quickly .
I think we 're seeing more young and sick penguins because of global warming , which affects ocean currents and creates more cyclones , making the seas rougher , " he said .

Most the penguins found are too young to out - swim the currents they encounter while searching for food .
Every year , Brazil airlifts dozens of penguins back to Antarctica or Patagonia .
Families of 9/11 victims urge reconsideration of settlement rejection Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This NEW YORK -- Lawyers for the families of four 9/11 victims are urging a judge to reconsider his decision to reject $ 28.5 million in settlements that he now says are excessive compared with those other survivors received .
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein had approved four settlements ranging from $ 5.5 million to $ 8 million weeks ago , but reversed himself July 24 , saying the amounts were " disproportionately large " and that they " embarrass and prejudice " those who settled earlier .
He referred to the four victims as " modest wage earners at the Pentagon . "
Their families were among fewer than 100 who sued over deaths or injuries from the Sept. 11 attacks .
More than 5,000 others received money from a special fund established by Congress that distributed more than $ 7 billion .
Hellerstein said individuals who went to court generally won larger awards than those who opted to file claims with the Victim Compensation Fund , but that those who filed lawsuits may have faced more expenses , as well as the added risks and challenges of litigation .
The specifics of settlements that were not rejected have been kept secret .
Hellerstein harshly criticized the lawyers in the four rejected settlements , saying the 25 percent fee they requested was far above the 15 percent given most other lawyers handling the cases .
He accused the lawyers of trying to get a " very large windfall " of more than $ 7 million of the total $ 28.5 million agreed to by insurance companies for airlines and airport - security companies .
Baltimore lawyer Jonathan Asrael , who represented the families , said in papers filed in federal court Monday that the settlements were fair and should be reinstated .
" Vacating settlements which were previously approved for these families has rubbed raw the wounds of September 11 .
It has caused severe upset , disappointment and for some , anger , " he wrote .
Families who filed lawsuits have said they did so seeking answers rather than money , on matters such as how the terrorists made it through airport checkpoints .
Asrael said the plaintiffs were not available to comment on the judge 's ruling , but in an affidavit unsealed Wednesday , one of the four plaintiffs , a 57 - year - old woman whose husband worked for the Army at the Pentagon , supported the law firm 's 25 percent fee .
She said she pursued the suit in part for " moral reasons of corporate responsibility and a desire that U.S. taxpayers not be required to pay for my family 's loss , " adding that she has been satisfied by the outcome .
Even with her lawyers ' 25 percent fee , she wrote , she is still getting about $ 1.75 million more than she would have had she followed the mediator 's recommendation .
" My attorneys ' fees were agreed at 25 percent , were earned at 25 percent and I request that Your Honor please pay these attorneys ' fees at 25 percent of my recovery , " she wrote April 16 .
" Ultimately , I believe that ' a deal is a deal . '
I received what I bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well . "
Hellerstein said he was concerned that the hefty sums would not be fair to the plaintiffs who settled their lawsuits long ago .
" Although I approved the settlements , I did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them , " he wrote .
He also scolded the lawyers for " coasting " on the efforts of the attorneys who handled the previous settlements , essentially accusing them of playing a waiting game in order to get more money for their clients .
In response , Asrael said his law firm had done considerably more work than most other lawyers in the cases , including participating in depositions of airport workers who had screened the hijackers of the plane that struck the Pentagon .
With the seven - year anniversary of the 2001 attacks just weeks away , Hellerstein 's ruling provided a status report on the more than 10,000 lawsuits slowly winding through the courts .
He said settlements had been reached in all but a dozen of the 95 wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits he oversees stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks .
The judge also is responsible for thousands of lawsuits brought by workers involved in the search , rescue and clean - up efforts at the World Trade Center after the attacks .
Hellerstein frequently comments on the shortcomings of the legal process after a national tragedy .
" The wounds of 9/11 will not easily be assuaged , " the judge wrote in his July 24 ruling .
" But neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards . "

Shares of Whole Foods , which had already dropped 44 percent since the first of the year , dropped nearly 18 percent in after - hours trading , to $ 18.84 .
Because of the slowing sales , Mr. Mackey announced that the company would reduce the number of stores it plans to open in fiscal 2009 to 15 , instead of 25 or 30 .
He also said the company would aggressively cut administrative costs and discretionary capital expenses not related to store openings .
The company ’s weak report comes amid a difficult time in the supermarket industry , one in which consumers are trading down to cheaper products and discount stores .
Whole Foods is trying to recast its upscale image by offering more store label products , which are cheaper , and more sales , not only among grocery items in the center of the store but also in the produce , seafood , meat and prepared foods sections on the perimeter of the store where the company makes most of its money .

Public Choice and Austrian Economics
18 August 2008 at 4:41 pm Peter G. Klein
| Peter Klein |
The Austrian school and the Public Choice or Virginia school of economics are often tightly linked , both among the lay public and within academic circles .
The connection is n’t obvious , however .
While members of both schools tend to have classical - liberal views on political economy , the Virginia school emerged from the Chicago public finance tradition ( Buchanan , after all , was a student and disciple of Knight ) and is thoroughly “ neoclassical ” in orientation .
Public choice economists tend to look to Chicago , not Vienna , for inspiration .
Anamaria Berea , Art Carden , and Jeremy Horpedahl take a different tack , drawing out common threads in Buchanan ’s and Hayek ’s subjectivist approach to cost .
Cost and Choice and The Sensory Order represent tangents from the basic research programs of their respective authors , James M. Buchanan and F.A. Hayek .
These seeming diversions into methodology by two political - economic philosophers help to shed light on their underlying assumptions about cost and rationality .
We argue that Buchanan and Hayek , and consequently Public Choice and Austrian Economics , have very similar underlying assumptions about the nature of cost .
This can help to explain other similarities between the two schools , especially regarding the role of the state .
These contributions are synthesized and applied to debates over the “ new paternalism ” and military conscription .
Tom DiLorenzo ’s 1990 paper “ The Subjectivist Roots of James Buchanan ’s Economics ” is also worth consulting on this connection .
The question , though , is whether Cost and Choice ( and the later Buchanan and Thirlby - edited volume , LSE Essays on Cost ) is a consistent with the rest of the public choice tradition ( including Buchanan ’s own work ) .
NB : In graduate school I was exposed to the “ positive political theory ” ( PPT ) literature associated with Riker , Shepsle , Weingast , etc. and was surprised that the Virginia school was never mentiond in the discussion .
A prominent PPT scholar told me once that PPT is “ scientific , ” while public choice is merely “ ideological ” and “ low - tech . ”
Fair or not , I think this view is widespread among younger scholars .
Has anyone written a good comparison of PPT and the public - choice approach ?

Police : US - led coalition airstrike kills 76 Afghans
Aug 22 , 2008 , 16:15 GMT
Kabul - The Afghan Interior Ministry said on Friday that 76 civilians , including women but mostly children , were killed in a coalition airstrike in western Afghanistan .
' Today in the afternoon during a bombardment of coalition forces 76 people , including 19 women , seven men and the rest children , all under 15 years - of - age were martyred , ' the interior ministry said in a statement .
The ministry has sent a ten - member - delegate to the area to investigate the case , it said , adding that a number of civilians were also wounded with some of them in a critical condition .
US - led coalition forces earlier had said that they had killed 30 Taliban militants in a combat operation , backed by close air support in the district .
The US military said in a statement that the dead militants also included one of their commanders , Mullah Sadiq , killed in the Shindand district of western Herat province on Friday .
The militants according to the statement attacked the combined forces from inside houses as they were on their way to detain a Taliban commander .
Joint forces responded to their attack with small arms fire and called in aircraft to pound the insurgents ' positions .
General Zahir Azimi , Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman , confirmed the clash , but said that five of the 30 killed in the operation were civilians .
Civilian casualties during the international operations against the Taliban have become a matter of severe concern for the Western - backed Afghan government as it tries to win the hearts and minds of the people .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai earlier this month called on the international forces to shift their attention from fighting the terrorism in Afghan villages , where he said it caused nothing but civilian casualties , to bases of terrorism .
Afghan officials said that the Taliban have safe havens in tribal areas of Pakistan from where they cross the border and attack Afghan and coalition forces , a claim Islamabad denies .
In April 2007 , more than 50 civilians were killed in the same district when coalition forces bombed suspected Taliban militants in the area , according to a United Nations investigation .
For the regulatory category of finance and banking , inflation - adjusted expenditures have risen 43.5 percent from 1990 to 2008 .
It is not unusual for the Federal Register to publish 70,000 or more pages of new regulations each year .
In other words , financial regulation has produced a lot of laws and a lot of spending but poor priorities and little success in using the most important laws to head off a disaster .
The pattern is reminiscent of how legislators often seem more interested in building new highways  which are highly visible projects  than in maintaining old ones .
The biggest financial deregulation in recent times has been an implicit one  namely , that hedge funds and many new exotic financial instruments have grown in importance but have remained largely unregulated .
To be sure , these institutions contributed to the severity of the Bear Stearns crisis and to the related global credit crisis .
But it ’s not obvious that the less regulated financial sector performed any worse than the highly regulated housing and bank mortgage lending sectors , including , of course , the government - sponsored mortgage agencies .
In other words , the regulation that we have did n’t work very well .
There are two ways to view this history .
First , with the benefit of hindsight , one could argue that we needed only a stronger political will to regulate every corner of finance and avert a crisis .
Under the second view , which I prefer , regulators will never be in a position to accurately evaluate or second - guess many of the most important market transactions .
In finance , trillions of dollars change hands , market players are very sophisticated , and much of the activity takes place outside the United States  or easily could .
Under these circumstances , the real issue is setting strong regulatory priorities to prevent outright fraud and to encourage market transparency , given that government scrutiny will never be universal or even close to it .
Identifying underregulated sectors in hindsight is n’t a useful guide for what to do the next time .
Both presidential candidates have endorsed regulatory reform , but they have yet to signal that it will become a priority .
That is n’t surprising .
Fixing these problems may seem a very abstract way of helping the average citizen , and it will certainly require taking on special interests .
It ’s easier to tell voters that the regulators have taken care of last year ’s problem , even if that accomplishes nothing for the future .
In the meantime , if you hear a call for more regulation , without a clear explanation of why regulation failed in the past , beware .
The odds are that we ’ll get additional regulation but with even less accountability and even less focus on solving our very real economic problems .

Current - day seers seeking out this method of prophecy would normally be out of luck , but a crate containing 100 factory - sealed Virtual Boy consoles has been discovered in a warehouse in Dubai .
My own prophecies uncover eBay sales in the future .
The National says that this bunch of consoles was found " under some old cartons , " among others that were marked for trash .
“ This product was just left years ago and nobody knew it was in stock , ” said Vijay Chandrabota , the purchasing manager for Geekay Games in Dubai .
“ For me , it was dead stock .
I did n’t even know that this Virtual Boy existed until we found it . ”

Pelosi : At-risk Dems back drilling
California Democrat Nancy Pelosi may be trying to save the planet — but the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides when it comes to gas prices as Republicans apply more and more rhetorical muscle .
But what looks like intraparty tension on the surface is part of an intentional strategy in which Pelosi takes the heat on energy policy , while behind the scenes she ’s encouraging vulnerable Democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically , according to Democratic aides on and off Capitol Hill .

Pelosi ’s gambit rests on one big assumption : that Democrats will own Washington after the election and will be able to craft a sweeping energy policy that is heavy on conservation and fuel alternatives while allowing for some new oil drilling .
Democrats see no need to make major concessions on energy policy with a party poised to lose seats in both chambers in just three months — even if recess - averse Republicans continue to pound away on the issue .
“ The reality is we will have a new president in three months , and what Bush and the Republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies , ” said one senior House Democratic aide involved with party strategy .
“ I do n’t think we have to give in at all pre-election — we have many more options postelection . ”
It ’s a reality that Rep. Nick J. Rahall ( D - W.Va . ) personally delivered to President Bush recently .
Rahall spent more than an hour last week talking to the president about energy .
Bush spent the entire flight aboard Air Force One , and much of a subsequent limousine ride , grilling the West Virginia Democrat about legislative solutions to the high price of gasoline , Rahall said last week .
So , does the president think Congress can get anything done this year ?
“ No , ” Rahall replied in a short interview with Politico .
“ He ’s realistic about it . ”
Asked if Congress will produce a comprehensive energy bill in September before Congress adjourns again for elections , Rahall replied , “ This year ?
No . ”
Instead , the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources believes Democrats are all about 2009 .
“ We ’ve laid the groundwork this year , ” Rahall said .
Democratic
House aides say the energy agenda has been carefully gamed out in strategy sessions , and Pelosi always intended to take heat on gas prices while tacitly encouraging more vulnerable Democrats to publicly disagree with her and show their independence .
Freshman Democrats like Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania and Don Cazayoux of Louisiana have taken her up on the offer .
Altmire has said a drilling vote “ will happen , ” while Cazayoux , hoping to hang on to his seat in a conservative Baton Rouge - area district , on Friday sent a letter to Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) demanding a vote on more domestic oil exploration .
“ There will be a vote , ” said Altmire , who faces a rematch with former GOP Rep.
Melissa
Hart this fall in the Pittsburgh suburbs .
Indeed , Congress must vote before Sept. 30 to renew the annual moratorium ; otherwise , it will lapse on its own , giving states the right to decide whether private companies can search for potential drilling sites three miles offshore . .
“ My view is that if we have a vote , let ’s make it a rational policy , ” said Altmire , whose district includes viable coal and nuclear industries .
“ We ca n’t let Republicans hold this issue hostage because of one vote . ”
Cazayoux , in his letter , says “ the current debate seems to be bogged down in partisan one - upmanship . ”
To some extent , House Republicans seem to be playing right along with the strategy , taking Pelosi ’s name in vain dozens of times during their rebel House sessions over the past few days and making her the villain who wo n’t allow oil drilling votes .
“ It ’s grossly unfair to the Democrats who want a vote , ” said Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) .
“ [ Pelosi ] needs to cut that out . ”
The Senate has also gone with a run-out - the - clock strategy , with Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) calling for a bipartisan energy summit but promising no major energy votes .
Reid embraced the drilling and conservation proposals of the bipartisan Senate “ Gang of 10 ” last week , but he made further commitment on the energy debate .
Reid , like Pelosi , is expecting to have a much stronger governing majority in the Senate next year , so he has little incentive to give in to Republicans on energy policy as long as he thinks it wo n’t hurt Democrats .
Even as they face heat from constituents during the August break , Democrats say they are n’t going to cave in to popular pressure .
“ We feel pretty comfortable with where we are , ” said Rep. Michael E. Capuano ( D - Mass. ) , who is close to the Democratic leadership .
“ This is a not a new issue .
This just did n’t happen today .
We ’ve been working on this for months . ”
Democratic insiders said that Pelosi and other party leaders were “ not rattled ” by the GOP floor rebellion , and at this point , it ’s not clear if the Democrats will even pay a price on energy .
State - level polling conducted by Democrats suggests that voters still view President Bush and the GOP as the incumbent power in Washington , and Democratic strategists believe any anti-incumbent wave would hurt Republicans more than Democrats .
Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas , one of the leaders of the rogue GOP House session , said he realizes that Democrats are “ in a four - corners stall right now , ” and admits that “ it gets more challenging ” for Republicans if they lose more seats in Congress .
Democrats are also comforted somewhat by the fact that crude oil prices have gone down more than 10 percent from their summer highs , and if the U.S. economy enters a recession , prices may fall further due to slackening demand .
“ There is no crisis on our side of the aisle , ” a top House Democratic leadership aide said .
“ We have a plan , and we will stick to it . ”

The governor 's husband , however , refuses to answer questions to a panel that he believes is politically motivated , according to campaign officials for Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Palin .
" The objections boil down to the fact that the legislative council investigation is no longer a legitimate investigation because it has been subjected to complete partisanship , " campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said .
Todd Palin could be found in contempt of the legislature for failing to comply , but the whole body would have to be in session to do so , and it is not scheduled to reconvene until January .
From a person 's point of view , the beam of electrons driving down the linear accelerator at close to the speed of light would appear as a single thread .
" But from the point of view of precision electronics , " explains Jachin Spencer , " you might see something , you might see nothing . "
To a non-specialist , the word " beam " may be associated with columns of material or light .
But on a microsecond time scale , the beam in an accelerator is actually a series of electron - bunches , more like machine gun fire than a shaft of sunshine .
Spencer , a summer student in the SULI program at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center , is studying the performance of what is called the " fiducial pulse , " a pulse of electromagnetic waves used to coordinate the timing of the accelerator .
It 's the job of the fiducial pulse , Spencer says , to let electronics know " when they can look at the beam , when there 's something to see . "
Both clock and courier , the fiducial pulse travels just ahead of the electron bunch , and alerts the monitoring devices that line the beam tunnel .
Beam position and length monitors , cameras rigged to phosphorescent screens , and other sorts of diagnostics tools use the early warning to shutter their sensors in rhythm with the electron bunches , 30 times a second .
It 's no exaggeration to call the fiducial pulse the linchpin of the linac .
Without the regularity of its preceding pulse , instruments monitoring the beam would fall out of synch with the bunches , and therefore out of synch with one another .
There are two kinds of triggering signals available and the question of which is preferable is the subject of debate .
It 's Spencer 's project to determine which is best .
" My job is to define what better is .
They want whichever 's better , but they do n't know what that means . "
Both fiducial signal types consist of very brief pulses added to a sinusoidal wave .
Electronics in the linac are sensitive to the voltage difference between this normal wave and the pulse .
The fiducial pulse was originally designed to be what 's called a " bipolar waveform . "
However , ever since it was constructed 20 years ago , the linac has been operating with a close cousin , the unipolar waveform .
Because the decision behind the signal change was never officially recorded , the question of which is better for the linac has never been adequately broached , much less answered .
The constant operation of the trigger system since it was implemented in 1984 has made it difficult and expensive to schedule actual experiments , thus warranting the use of simulations .
The choice of which waveform to use seems to be a question of power versus clarity .
The unipolar wave contributes comparatively more power to the carrier wave by the time it reaches the end of the drive line , but creates a slightly distorted waveform .
The bipolar wave preserves the waveform but becomes attenuated by the end of its course .
So far , it 's unclear whether the unipolar 's added power actually helps the triggering system .
Spencer says , " The strengths of one make up for the weaknesses of the other ... it's almost perfectly balanced that way . "
Man , quantum mechanics jokes are hard to write .

The KDE development community announced today the official release of version 4.1 , the first major update of the new 4.x series .
This release finally delivers on the promise of a next - generation desktop environment and resolves most of the problems that afflicted the original 4.0 release .
The new version includes a huge number of interface enhancements , application improvements , bug fixes , new software , and new infrastructure components ; according to statistics released by the KDE developers , over 20,803 separate changes have been committed to the version control system since the 4.0 release .
We have been testing KDE 4.1 prereleases since the early stages of the development cycle .
The desktop environment has evolved at a swift pace and some of the most experimental components have been transformed from mediocre proof - of - concept implementations into fully functional and highly polished parts of the user experience .
The Plasma desktop shell , which was one of the weakest pieces in the 4.0 release , has matured considerably and now offers some unique and beneficial features .
The most notable improvement is the addition of the folder view plasmoid , which displays icons representing the contents of a specified folder .
It provides all of the same functionality as the conventional desktop icon display from the 3.5.x series , but it allows users to place several of these folders on the desktop at once , thus providing immediate access to more locations in the filesystem .
It 's not just a quick fix , it 's really a tangible improvement over the original desktop paradigm .
Plasma also got full support for graphically configuring and resizing the main containment panel , a feature that was painfully absent in 4.0 .
The user can activate panel configuration mode by clicking a small icon on the far right edge of the panel .
When the configuration mode is enabled , it becomes possible to move the panel to a different edge of the screen or change its position along the screen edge by clicking and dragging .
Users can also adjust the panel 's vertical and horizontal size by dragging the top sizer or the sliding arrows .
This release also introduces the new KDE 4 port of Kontact , the desktop environment 's integrated PIM suite .
It includes a calendar , mail program , address book , and several other components in a unified user interface .
KDE 4.1 also includes the Akonadi storage framework , which will provide support for accessing Kontact data in third - party applications .
Other new applications added in this release include the DragonPlayer video playback program , the Oketa hex editor , and the KSCD audio CD player .
Some noteworthy improvements landed in KDE desktop applications , too .
Dolphin gained support for tabbed file browsing and the old tree view has been restored in both Dolphin and Konqueror .
Although the weaknesses of the flawed 4.0 release provoked widespread criticism from users , version 4.1 is so polished that it feels like a completely different piece of software .
This version truly delivers on KDE 's promise of a next - generation Linux desktop environment , and it completes the foundation for a strong 4.x series .
The initial doubts and skepticism I experienced when using 4.0 are completely gone .
This is , frankly , what 4.0 should have been .
The question now is whether users who were burned by the inadequacies of the 4.0 release will give KDE 4 a second chance .
I certainly hope so , because there looks to be a whole lot of room for innovation .
witty does n't even begin to do this guy justice .
The Great Slob ( from " Septuagenarian Stew " 1994 ) I was always a natural slob I liked to lay upon the bed in undershirt ( stained , of course ) ( and with cigarette holes ) shoes off beer bottle in hand trying to shake off a difficult night , say with a woman still around walking the floor complaining about this and that , and I 'd work up a belch and say , " HEY , YOU DON'T LIKE IT ?
THEN GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE ! " I really loved myself , I really loved my slob - self , and they seemed to also : always leaving but almost always coming back .
Not to be confused with the wittiness of Burroughs , who shot his 2nd wife in the head doing the William tell apple on the head scene .

I told the guy -he was watering his lawn -
you ever squirt my dog
again and you 'll have to deal with me .
he just kept on watering , looking straight ahead ,
and he said , I ain't worried , you punks talk about
doing it but you never do it .
he was an old white - haired guy , kind of dumb .
I could
feel the dullness radiating off him .
I yanked the hose from his hand , turned him around and
sank a hard right to his gut .
he dropped like a stone and just lay on his
back on the lawn
holding his stomach and breathing
hard .
he looked pitiful .
I picked up the hose and watered him down good ,
soaked his clothes , then gave him a good dose
in the face and walked off .
I went down to the store and got a fifth of scotch and a six - pack .
when I came back he was gone .
I went up to my apartment and told Marie that I
had taken care of the matter with the guy who
squirted our dog .
she asked me , what did you do , kill him ?
and I told her , no , I just explained things to him .
and she wanted to know , what did I mean , I
explained things to him ?
and I told her , never mind , where are some clean
glasses ?
and then the dog came walking in .
Koko .
you gotta know I liked him
plenty .

Got it ?
You might want to try because that 's the kind of password you 'll need if you really want your wireless network to be secure .
That 's the word from Keith Maynard - who goes by the name Seric - and he should know .
Not only is he a longtime computer security guru - when he is n't riding with the Vampire motorcycle club in Santa Cruz - Seric is one of the original wardrivers , hobbyists who deck out their cars with computers and sensitive antennas and go cruising the streets looking for wireless networks .
Wardriving got some bad ink earlier this month when federal prosecutors announced indictments against an international ring of hackers who allegedly used the technique to find poorly secured networks at several East Coast restaurants and stores .
Secret Service investigators said Aug. 5 the thieves downloaded more than 40 million credit card numbers from those networks , which they used or sold online , netting millions of dollars and a condo in Florida .
But many wardrivers have nothing so nefarious in mind .
Some just enjoy the Easter egg hunt of finding networks .
Others , like Seric , use wardriving to draw attention to the scope of the emerging digital world .
Their hope is that they can persuade people to think about their own wireless security by displaying the weakness they detect in articles , on panels and to professional clients .
" Once you buy a tool , you need to learn how to use it correctly , " Seric said .
Original wardrivers
That was the idea that led Seric to join some of the earliest wardriving efforts with fellow enthusiasts from Berkeley 's Dis .
Org Crew - DOC - a group of self - described amateur troublemakers and professional consultants .
The crew 's Peter Shipley coined the term wardriving , which evolved from the term wardialing - finding open networks by randomly calling phone numbers with a modem - which itself came from the movie where the technique played a central role : " WarGames . "
When the DOC started wardriving back in the early part of this millennium , wireless networks were difficult to find , but only about 15 percent of them , Seric said , featured any type of security .
Wardriving eventually went mainstream , with Skyhook Wireless , the company behind the iPhone 's location tracking abilities .
Founder Ted Morgan said he stumbled upon wardriving in 2002 , and today the company maintains a fleet of 500 scanning vehicles in Europe , Asia and the United States , all collecting data that allow the iPhone to find its user 's location using the nearest Wi -Fi network as part of its mapping software .
Wardriving faded a bit as the networks went from being hard to find to being hard to miss , although enthusiasts - some of whom have recorded more than a million networks - still upload new finds to sites such as WiGLE.
net .
But on Thursday , at the request of The Chronicle , Seric dusted off his wardriving rig and took a spin around the Bay Area to look for potential vulnerabilities like the ones exploited by the ring indicted Aug .
5 .
" I got like 135 ( access points ) off the freeway on my way up here from Santa Cruz , " said Seric , as he adjusted his equipment - laptop , Wi-Fi antenna , GPS antenna - in the parking lot of Stanford Shopping Center .
After a five - hour cruise around the Bay Area - including residential and downtown sections of Palo Alto , San Francisco and Oakland before returning to Palo Alto across the Dumbarton Bridge - Seric 's list included more than 2,600 individual networks , spotted at businesses , in homes , on campuses and within moving buses .
Open networks appeared every block or so , beaming from homes in West Oakland and near the Hewlett - Packard garage in Palo Alto , from Stanford University to Oakland 's Federal Building and San Francisco 's City Hall , along freeways , on tree - lined streets and in dusty industrial parks .
That 's a crime ?
Overall , about one - third of the networks found during the tour showed no encryption , although some might have featured some other forms of protection not visible without a more intrusive - and possibly illegal - probe .
Attempting to access the network to find out could cause Seric to cross from legal wardriving , where networks are passively detected and recorded , into the legally gray area of computer trespassing .
That such a crime exists will come as disturbing news to the legions of iPhone and laptop users who have become accustomed to seizing the closest open network for their own use .
But while legal experts say the law is murky , the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco has tracked a handful of cases where people have been successfully prosecuted for theft of service or computer trespassing for using open networks at libraries or cafes without permission .
The sentences have included probation , suspended sentences and fines .
But nobody , according to the EFF , has gone to trial , where a judge and jury could clarify the law .
" I think most people would presume that you have permission to access that open network , that 's become the social norm .
But it 's a little unclear what the law is , " said Jason Schultz , acting director of the Law and Technology Clinic at UC Berkeley 's Boalt Hall School of Law .
" The law has not yet had a definitive decision . "
At the same time , security experts have n't made a definitive decision about how much security is enough , with some insisting upon maximum levels of encryption behind a 63 - character hexadecimal password like the one at the top of this article - not memorized , but saved on a portable flash memory drive to be retrieved when needed .
Others , including Schultz , take the opposite extreme , advocating for leaving networks open unless they are used for some sensitive or confidential purpose .
" I think for most people , an open network is a nice neighborly thing to do , " Schultz said .
" Everyone gets more access to information . "
Seric , like many security consultants , lands between the extremes , calling for making informed decisions - choosing your level of security based on your needs and your situation .
A bank needs better security than a library ; Joe Smith does n't require the same level of protection as does Brad Pitt .
Unaware of the threats
The problem , Seric and other security consultants say , is that too many network owners - individuals and businesses alike - do n't really know the potential threats posed by open or poorly secured networks so that they can make informed decisions .
Headline crimes like those announced earlier this month offer a red flag to big businesses that their customer - friendly wireless networks can give a malicious hacker entree to their sensitive financial data .
Assemblyman Dave Jones ( D - Sacramento ) also has introduced legislation that would bar businesses and state agencies from sending payment data over open networks unless strongly encrypted .
But security experts say homeowners and small businesses , too , need to recognize that leaving their networks open could expose their computers , DVRs , printers , and other networked devices .
Even a firewalled system can be compromised through an open wireless network - like locking your front door but leaving a bathroom window wide open .
" People can walk right into your network , " said Ed Skoudis , the author , with Tom Liston , of " Counter Hack Reloaded " and a fellow at the SANS Institute , a security research and training organization .
" You 've given that person access to your home .
And he can hack your home . "
The threat may be remote , but there are lesser concerns that security consultants describe .
The local sex offender borrowing a neighbor 's signal to download child pornography .
The local teenager downloading terabytes of movies who would rather cripple a neighbor 's bandwidth than Mom and Dad's .
Or the random hacker or prankster looking for a server to send spam to millions or threatening messages to the White House .
In all of those cases , the trail followed by investigators would lead to the open network - your network .
" How much do you trust your neighbors ?
And how much do you trust , well , anybody that can get geographic proximity to your network ? " asked Skoudis .
" If a bad guy wants to commit a crime , he usually wants to avoid committing it in a place that it can be traced back to him . "
Growing awareness of those threats may explain an increase in security since the early days of wardriving - early scans found as few as 15 percent of networks were encrypted , Seric said , while Thursday 's scans found about two - thirds of sampled networks were encrypted in some fashion .
But in many cases , Seric and other security experts say , those networks are , in fact , effectively unprotected , using old code and outdated techniques that leave their owners living in an illusory bubble of security .
A thing to know about WEP
Then there is WEP - a form of encryption long in use and still used by many networks , either because the network owners do n't know there 's anything better or because there is older equipment on the network that can't understand newer encryption .
In other cases , homeowners or businesses set up their network five years ago and assume they were still secure .
But while WEP once was the standard , type " hack WEP " into Google today and you 'll get 170,000 responses , including instructional videos and step - by - step instructions .
Even a robust network , protected by the latest WPA2 encryption , internal and external firewalls , and alphabet soup passwords can be cracked in theory , Seric said .
But for many home users and small businesses , that level of security is plenty , he said .
And many people can get by with even lower security , if their comfort level allows - especially if their neighbor is doing even less .
" People are always going to look for the easy targets .
...
If you 're too much of a headache , unless there 's something they specifically want from you , they 're going to look for an easier target , " Seric said .
" It 's really about making yourself tougher than the next guy . "

PHYSIOGNOMY , the art or science of predicting inward character from outward form , has had its ups and downs over the years .
A century ago , the idea that a person 's character could be seen in his face was more or less taken as given .
It then fell out of favour , along with the idea that behaviour is genetically determined , as Marxist ideas of the pliability and perfectibility of mankind became fashionable .
Now , it is undergoing something of a revival .
It has been found , for example , that women can predict a man 's interest in infant children from his face .
Trustworthiness also shows up , as does social dominance .
The latest example comes from a paper just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society by Justin Carré and Cheryl McCormick , of Brock University in Ontario , Canada .
This suggests that in men , at least , it is also possible to look at someone 's face and read his predisposition to aggression .
The thesis developed by Mr Carré and Dr McCormick is that aggressiveness is predictable from the ratio between the width of a person 's face and its height .
Their reason for suspecting this is that this ratio differs systematically between men and women ( men have wider faces ) and that the difference arises during puberty , when sex hormones are reshaping people 's bodies .
The cause seems to be exposure to testosterone , which is also known to make people aggressive .
It seems reasonable , therefore , to predict a correlation between aggression and face shape .
To test their thesis , Mr Carré and Dr McCormick looked at the fine , old Canadian sport of ice hockey .
This is , famously , not a gentle game .
It is also a game in which the rules provide a plausible proxy for aggressiveness , namely the amount of time a player spends off the ice in the penalty box for such infringements as knocking his opponent 's teeth out with a well - aimed stick .
The two researchers obtained photographs of several university and professional ice - hockey teams , and measured the facial ratios of the players .
They also obtained those players ' penalty records .
Just as they expected , the wider a player 's face , the more time he spent in the cooler .
Ice hockey , though , is mostly a man 's game ( women might argue that they are too sensible to get involved , although the Canadian ladies did win a gold medal at the last winter Olympics ) .
To find out whether the theory was true for females as well , Mr Carré and Dr McCormick turned to that stock experimental subject , the university undergraduate .
They recruited several dozen of both sexes and got them to play a game against what they thought was a person in another room but was actually a computer .
Various measures of aggression taken during this game suggest that men are the same everywhere , be they students or sportsmen .
Aggression was not , however , predictable in women students — or , at least , not from the shapes of their faces .
It seems , therefore , that facial ratio in men is a biologically honest signal of aggressiveness .
Honest signals are those , such as luxuriantly feathered tails , that cannot be mimicked by individuals who would like the benefits without the costs .
In the case of aggressiveness , the benefit to the aggressive individual is , paradoxically , that he will not have to get into fights in order to prove the point .
The fear induced by his face should be enough by itself .
At least , that is the hypothesis .
The experiment to prove it has yet to be done .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia will face increased Western pressure on Wednesday when a senior British official flies to Ukraine to build a coalition to counter Russia ’s conflict with ex-Soviet Georgia .
The United States , NATO and European powers condemned as unacceptable Russia ’s recognition on Tuesday of two breakaway Georgian regions as independent states , and demanded Moscow recognize Georgia ’s territorial integrity .
U.S. President George W. Bush condemned Moscow ’s decision to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia , saying they must remain part of Georgia .
“ Russia ’s action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations , ” Bush said in a statement from his Texas ranch .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Tbilisi ’s desire to seize back Abkhazia and South Ossetia by force had killed all hopes for their peaceful co-existence in one state with Georgia .
Russian tanks and troops continue to occupy parts of Georgia after crushing Tbilisi ’s bid to retake South Ossetia -- the first time Moscow has sent troops into another country since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
EU president France earlier this month brokered a ceasefire in the conflict and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would talk to Russia ’s leadership before Monday ’s emergency EU summit on the crisis to get the bloc ’s viewpoint across .
“ I think each and every member state is very clear ... that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position , and I am going to do whatever I can so that we succeed , ” she said .
COALITION
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , whose attempt this month to retake South Ossetia sparked the war with Russia , said the fate of the free world was being played out in his country .
“ The Russian Federation ’s actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation - the nation of Georgia , ” he said in a statement released by the Foreign Ministry .
“ This a challenge to the entire world .
Not just Georgia . ”
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband was due in Kiev to meet the leadership of Ukraine , home to a large Russian - speaking population and a major Russian naval base .
“ I am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting Ukraine ... to ensure the widest possible coalition against Russian aggression in Georgia , ” Miliband said on Tuesday .

Ukraine , like Georgia , has angered Moscow by actively seeking membership of NATO .
But divisions within the pro-Western camp there may complicate Miliband ’s mission .
President Viktor Yushchenko believes Ukraine should enter NATO and the European Union but Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has grown cooled towards NATO membership , which is unpopular with voters .

The West could exlude Russia from some top world bodies but its ability to punish Russia is limited given Russia ’s veto in the U.N. Security Council .
The West needs also Moscow ’s support over Iran ’s nuclear program and supply routes for NATO forces in Afghanistan .
The United States appeared to pull back from the prospect of an immediate confrontation with Russia , cancelling the delivery of relief supplies by U.S. warships to Poti , a busy Georgia cargo port still patrolled by Russian forces .
Kremlin chief Medvedev said he did not want a new Cold War with the West but was not scared of one .
And he told Europe , a major consumer of Russian oil and gas , that it had to decide what sort of ties it wanted with Moscow .
“ The ball is in the Europeans ’ court .
If they want a worsening in relations , they will get it of course , ” he told France ’s LCI television .
“ If they want to maintain strategic relations , which is in my opinion totally in the interests of Russia and Europe , everything will go well . ”
Europe and Russia are major trading partners and the conflict has rattled financial markets as well as raising concerns over the stability of a key oil and gas transit route from the Caspian Sea .
If people , viewed from a great height , look like ants , do ants , viewed at close range , look like people ?
Of course not .
Ants have six legs , compound eyes , no lungs , and impossibly narrow waists , and they tend to hang around with aphids and mealybugs .
Still , behavioral similarities make them excellent analogues .
Ants , like humans , are into career specialization , livestock herding , engineering , climate control , in - flight sex , and war ; for them , as for us , free will may or may not be an illusion .
As for whether ants look to humans for insight into themselves , science has no answer .

A few years ago , Marko Pecarevic , a Croatian graduate student studying conservation biology at Columbia University , met with his adviser , the urban ecologist James Danoff - Burg , to come up with a subject for his master ’s thesis .
Danoff - Burg had some data on ants in city parks and wondered if Pecarevic wanted to work on that .
Pecarevic thought not .
But afterward , crossing Broadway , he saw ants crawling around a garbage bin on one of the avenue ’s medians .
Medians !
As habitats , the planted medians of Broadway were ubiquitous but overlooked , suitably biodiverse but extraordinarily distressed .
For someone interested , as Pecarevic was , in the ecology of heavily compromised urban environments , medians were like remote , unexplored island chains — a Galápagos in Manhattan .
He decided to be their Darwin .
Employing Google Earth ( forgive him , he ’s from Zagreb ) , he chose three median - rich stretches — Park Avenue , the West Side Highway , and Broadway — then made himself an official - looking ID , dressed in parkish green , and started collecting ants , travelling the city with a duffelbag of garden tools and Evian bottles filled with antifreeze .
No one bothered him .
On a recent afternoon , Pecarevic , a trim , wry thirty - two - year - old , went out on a survey of his medians .
For demonstration purposes , he had cadged a plastic cup from a coffeeshop , and pocketed a spoon .
He carried , as he always does , an aspirator , a plastic tube that he uses to collect ants .
He inhales them , alive , into a chamber .
“ Sometimes , when you suck up ants , they ’re not happy about it , ” he said .
“ If you blow cigarette smoke on them , they calm down . ”
Really , this was a farewell tour — he was returning to Zagreb the next day , to pursue a doc-torate .
His thesis ( “ Ant Diversity and Abundance Increase with Increasing Plant Complexity and Amount of Garbage Bins in New York City Street Medians ” ) was done , and he was bequeathing to New York some interesting conclusions about its ants .
“ Funny — all the king ’s horses do n’t seem to be helping at all . ”

For example , ants seem to have an astute sense of neighborhood stereotypes .
The Upper West Side , as it happens , is more diverse , ant - wise , than the Upper East Side .
Diversity is a function of habitat , and habitat , on the medians , is reflective of the people who live around them .
As you might expect , Park Avenue medians contain fewer gar - bage cans ( the greatest determinants of ant variety and abundance ) and less complex flora ; they are more manicured , less riotous .
“ On some parts of Broadway , it does n’t look like anyone ’s been there for years , ” Pecarevic said .
Ants like that .
Pecarevic surmised that ants got from one median to another mostly via intercourse .
A queen and a male , both winged , mate in the air — the nuptial flight , as it ’s known .
The male dies , and the female , alighting in a new place , starts a colony .
One mating session provides her with enough ant sperm to last a lifetime ; she can produce an egg every few seconds for the rest of her life .
( This arrangement holds on both sides of Central Park , so we should infer nothing about the connubial difficulties of 10021 versus those of 10024 . )
To collect the ants , Pecarevic had also laid pitfall traps , three per median .
These were clear plastic cups dug into the dirt , and partly filled with antifreeze .
The ants fell in and died quickly , before they could dismember one another .
He left the traps for three days .
To warn off maintenance crews , he had affixed tiny signs to toothpicks , which he stuck in the ground .
After emptying the traps , he spent three minutes around each one , sucking up live ants with the aspirator .
Back home , he poured the antifreeze through a colander , over the toilet .
He washed and preserved the ants in alcohol .
Over the course of two years , he had collected six thousand six hundred and nineteen ants , from forty - four medians , and identified fourteen species .
There are roughly twelve thousand known species of ant .
The three most common , on the medians , were , in ascending order , the cornfield ant , the thief ant , and , from Europe , the pavement ant .
“ If you see an ant walking on pavement , it ’s probably a pavement ant , ” Pecarevic said .
Also , if you see ants fighting on the pavement .
“ They have huge fights .
They bite each other . ”
The day was hot and hazy — maybe not so good for anting .
On the median at Seventy - fourth Street , on Broadway , Pecarevic turned up spoonfuls of earth and sifted through them , as though digging for steamers .
Nothing .
Ants : never there when you need them .
On Seventy - sixth Street , he found a colony of pavement ants in some rotting wood bordering a flower bed .
They ran wild over a Popsicle stick , a plastic spoon , pistachio nuts , Marlboro butts , and degraded credit - card receipts .
No fighting and biting today .
On Park Avenue , south of Seventy - ninth , he prowled a begonia bed and a bit of parched lawn , under some cherry trees .
Antless .
Two summers ago , on Broadway , north of 100th Street , Pecarevic discovered a species that had previously never been found north of Virginia , the Chinese needle ant , an invasive predator with a powerful sting .
He ’d found four of them — a colony , perhaps .
He went back again last summer , but the needle ants were gone .
He theorized that the cold winter had wiped them out .
“ I was hoping to find more , ” he said .
“ It would have been nice to get some funding for more research . ”
There will be ants in Zagreb . ♦
Pentagon closes controversial intelligence unit
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon on Monday said it was closing a controversial intelligence office that had raised concerns about domestic spying by the military after the September 11 attacks .
The Defense Department said it had " disestablished " the Counterintelligence Field Activity office , or CIFA , created in February 2002 by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to manage defense and armed service efforts against intelligence threats from foreign powers and groups such as al Qaeda .
Those responsibilities will now be carried out by a new organization called the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center , overseen by the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency .
CIFA 's operations stirred concern among members of Congress and civil liberties advocates .
A CIFA database known as Talon , set up to monitor threats against U.S. military installations , was found to have retained information on U.S. antiwar protesters including Quakers after they had been found to pose no security danger , officials said .
Talon , the acronym for Threat and Local Observation Notice , was ended last year as a result of the outcry .
But the controversy , leading the Defense Department to reorganize CIFA 's functions after a broad review of Pentagon intelligence operations , officials said .
A senior defense official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Defense Secretary Robert Gates approved the change after the review found the office 's functions could be performed more effectively by another agency .
The Army , Air Force and Navy operate their own separate counterintelligence operations .
Officials said coordinating and management function previously performed by CIFA would be taken over by the new center , which will also oversee DIA 's operations in traditional espionage .
" Integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap , " Army Maj .
Gen .
Theodore Nicholas , the center 's new director , said in a statement .

Martian Sunrise at Phoenix Landing Site , Sol 101
This sequence of nine images taken by the Surface Stereo Imager on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander shows the sun rising on the morning of the lander 's 101st Martian day after landing .
The images were taken on Sept. 5 , 2008 .
The local solar times at the landing site for the nine images were between 1:23 a.m. and 1:41 a.m .
The landing site is on far - northern Mars , and the mission started in late northern spring .
For nearly the entire first 90 Martian days of the mission , the sun never set below the horizon .
As the amount of sunshine each day declined steadily after that , so has the amount of electricity available for the solar - powered spacecraft .
The Phoenix Mission is led by the University of Arizona , Tucson , on behalf of NASA .
Project management of the mission is by JPL , Pasadena , Calif .
Spacecraft development was by Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver .

Today is my last day at work !
No more corporate rat race for me .
I ’ve been planning an early retirement for as long as I can remember .
Those close to me have been hearing about it for years .
At age 29 I left the corporate world behind and I ’m embarking on a new chapter in my life : spending more time with my kids ( ages 1 and 2 ) , following my passion ( teaching others about personal finance ) , and an overall life of freedom not tied to a JOB !
Here ’s how I did it ( and how you can too ! )
Leaving the Rat Race at Age 29
What ’s Next ?
I ’m working on creating some new goals , learning how to cook , and beginning early Roth IRA withdrawals .
I ’m also going on a field trip with preschool , getting to watch my favorite t.v. shows again , and spending more time with my spouse … all things I would n’t have gotten to do with my job .
Update : Reflections on Leaving My Job… Six Months Later .
An Open Letter to Ben Bernanke By Arnold Kling
Dear Ben ,
The Wall Street Journal reports ,
“ If it does n’t pass , then heaven help us all , ” responded Mr. Paulson
He is referring to legislation to authorize the next round of bailout activity by the Treasury , with rules , methods and accountability all to be determined .
You should oppose this legislation .
It is an attempt to avert a financial meltdown by means of a political and fiscal meltdown .
I fear you may be seeing this crisis through the lens of the Great Depression .
Then , the wave of bank failures was an element in the severity of the downturn .
However , keep in mind that there is still controversy over the relative weights of various causes of the Depression , and not everyone is convinced that bank failures per se were the main factor .
Today , it is clear that the U.S. financial sector needs to shrink .
As another one of your former classmates , Ken Rogoff , has pointed out , the financial sector has accounted for an unusually large share of corporate profits in recent years .
It is time for this country to shift talent and capital elsewhere .
In order for that to happen , some firms in the industry need to tighten their belts , some weaker firms need to merge with stronger firms , and the weakest firms need to fail .
As tempting as it is to intervene in this process to try to make it more orderly , dislocation is inevitable , and intervention may only make it worse .
We have excesses .
Too many housing units .
Too many “ homeowners ” who do n’t have equity in their homes and never did .
Too many banks and financial institutions .
The excesses need to be worked out by the markets .
Henry Paulson is not the first strong Treasury Secretary to appear in a crisis .
John Connally held that job in the Nixon Administration , In response to a run on the dollar , he abandoned the Bretton Woods agreement and introduced wage and price controls .
In the short term , this was well received , and it allowed the economy to rebound in time for Nixon ’s re-election .
In the long run , it was a disaster , ultimately unleashing virulent inflation and , as oil prices rose , leading to the painful disorder of rationing and lines at gasoline stations .
Connally ’s cure was worse than the disease .
I strongly suspect that Paulson ’s cure will prove similarly harmful .
My suggestion to you is that you get out of your financial industry cocoon for a while .
Talk to people who are concerned about the direction that policy is taking , including former colleagues of yours in academia .
A Central Banker should stand up to fear - mongering .
Even when it comes from a Treasury Secretary .

The following is the Introduction to On the Emancipation of Women , a collection of the key articles and speeches on women ’s liberation by Russian revolutionary V.I. Lenin , published by Resistance Books .
On the Emancipation of Women is available online at http://www.resistancebooks.com.
* * *
The persistence of gender inequality in the most advanced capitalist societies , with the most complete bourgeois democracy in which women have full formal equality , has put paid to the idea that women 's liberation is possible within the framework of capitalism , even in its " healthiest " periods of expansion .
Today , in a period of global capitalist stagnation and crisis , as the " gender gap " widens and women , especially in the Third World , bear the brunt of the capitalist class 's neo-liberal offensive against the working class as a whole , the correctness of the Marxist analysis of women 's oppression as a cornerstone of class society and its revolutionary approach to achieving women 's liberation is clearer than ever before .
Since Karl Marx and Frederick Engels first developed their materialist conception of history in the 1840s , Marxism has sought to understand and combat the specific oppression of women .
Engels ' explanation of the roots of women 's oppression in the main institutions of class society - private property and the family - rather than in the realm of the natural or biological , was an enormous advance , laying the foundations for a scientific approach to women 's plight which posed , for the first time , liberation as possible .
In his 1884 work ,  The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State1 , Engels identified the source of the oppression of women as their exclusion from social production and the conversion of household tasks into a private service .
Both resulted from the replacement of collective production and communal property ownership with private male ownership of the basic means of production during the emergence of class society .
In pre-class societies , there was no material basis for exploitative relations between the sexes .
Males and females participated in social production , the labour of both sexes being necessary to ensure the survival of the human group as a whole .
The social status of men and women reflected the indispensable roles that each played .
The change in women 's status occurred alongside the growing productivity of human labour as a result of developments in productive technologies , and the private appropriation of the resulting economic surplus .
With the possibility for some humans to prosper from the exploitation of the labour of others , women , because of their role in production ( both social production to maintain the existing generation and the biological production of the next generation ) , became valuable property .
Like slaves and cattle , they were a source of wealth : they alone could produce new human beings whose labour power could be exploited .
Thus the purchase of women by men , along with all rights to their future offspring , arose as one of the economic and social institutions of the new order based on private property .
Women 's primary social role was increasingly defined as domestic servant and child - bearer ; their independent role in social production became secondary .
The oppression of women was thus institutionalised through the family system .
Women 's role in production came to be determined by the family to which they belonged , by the man to whom they were subordinate .
They were rendered economically dependent .
In the words of Engels :
" The modern individual family is based on the open or disguised domestic enslavement of the woman ; and modern society is a mass composed solely of individual families as its molecules .
Today , in the great majority of cases , the man has to be the earner , the breadwinner of the family , at least among the propertied classes , and this gives him a dominating position which requires no special legal privileges .
In the family , he is the bourgeois ; the wife represents the proletariat . "
The class divisions of society - between those who possessed property and those who , owning no property , had to work for others to live - were perpetuated through the legal institution of monogamous marriage , which enabled private property ownership to be passed from one generation to the next .
The consolidation of the sexual division of labour in the family also enabled the propertied class to abrogate responsibility for the upkeep of members of society they could not immediately exploit ( children , the elderly and sick ) .
In so far as the family , founded on the oppression of women , arose as a indispensable pillar of class society , it follows that women cannot be liberated without dismantling class society itself .
While the development of industrial capitalism created the material conditions that made gender equality possible by incorporating women into waged work and giving them a degree of economic independence from men , and while advanced capitalism granted women full legal rights , women have and will remain the " second sex " for so long as private property , and the economic and social shackles of the family which prop it up , remain intact .
In Engels ' words :
" The democratic republic does not abolish the antagonism between the two classes ; on the contrary , it provides the field on which it is fought out .
And , similarly , the peculiar character of man 's domination over woman in the modern family , and the necessity , as well as the manner , of establishing real social equality between the two , will be brought out in full relief only when both are completely equal before the law .
It will then become evident that the first premise for the emancipation of women is the reintroduction of the entire female sex into public industry ; and that this again demands that the quality possessed by the individual family of being the economic unit of society be abolished . "
That is , for gender inequality to be abolished , not only must women be brought fully into production , but private domestic labour must be replaced by socialised services .
" With the passage of the means of production into common property , the individual family ceases to be the economic unit of society .
Private housekeeping is transformed into a social industry .
The care and education of children becomes a public matter . "
It was this understanding of the origins of women 's oppression , and therefore the path to women 's full liberation , that informed the most thoroughgoing and successful program yet implemented for the emancipation of women - in the early years of the Russian Revolution .
Deconstructing the family
The Bolshevik - led revolution in Russia indicated the potential for the liberation of women that comes from a successful struggle against capitalist rule .
The measures enacted by the new Marxist government under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky demonstrated that a proletarian revolution meant immediate and substantial steps forward for women .
Between 1917 and 1927 , the Soviet government passed a series of laws giving women legal equality with men for the first time .
Striking at the heart of women 's oppression , the 1918 Code on Marriage , the Family and Guardianship was the most progressive family legislation the world has yet seen .
It recognised only civil marriage which , by 1927 was a simple registration process based on mutual consent , and enabled divorce at the request of either partner .
In 1926 , de facto relationships were given legal equality .
The code abolished illegitimacy and endeavoured to make familial relations independent of the marriage contract .
It also abolished adoption as the first step in transferring child ‑care from the family to the state , and separated property ownership and inheritance from marriage .
All children were entitled to financial support when their parents separated , and women with children consistently won significant payments through the courts .
For single mothers , where individual paternity could not be established , often all the men named by the woman as possible fathers were ordered to pay support .
Abortion was made free and legal at any stage in pregnancy and laws giving the foetus human rights were abolished .
Anti-homosexual laws were eliminated in 1918 .
Gender discrimination in hiring and firing workers was forbidden , prostitution was decriminalised and legislation gave women workers special maternity benefits .
Even given this enormous progress , the Bolsheviks understood the limitations of formal gender equality .
They recognised that only when the household tasks performed by millions of individual unpaid women are transferred to the public sphere , taken over by paid workers , would women be free to enter the public sphere on an equal basis with men - equally educated , waged and able to pursue their own individual goals and development .
Under such circumstances , free union would gradually replace marriage as relationships were constructed and deconstructed unrestrained by the deforming pressure of economic dependency .
The family , stripped of its previous social functions , would gradually wither away , leaving in its place fully autonomous , equal individuals living in relationships based on love and mutual respect .
In his speech " A Great Beginning " 2 , first published as a pamphlet in Moscow in July 1919 , Lenin emphasised the centrality to women 's emancipation of socialising domestic labour :
" Notwithstanding all the laws emancipating woman , she continues to be a domestic slave , because petty housework crushes , strangles , stultifies and degrades her , chains her to the kitchen and the nursery , and she wastes her labour on barbarously unproductive , petty , nerve‑racking , stultifying and crushing drudgery .
The real emancipation of women , real communism , will begin only where and when an all ‑out struggle begins ( led by the proletariat wielding state power ) against this petty housekeeping , or rather when its wholesale transformation into a large ‑scale socialist economy begins . "
The limitations of backwardness
While considerable resources were allocated to establishing public child‑care , kitchen and laundry facilities , especially during the period of war communism , the Bolsheviks were acutely aware that the facilities were insufficient and not nearly of high enough quality .
Many of the speeches by Lenin and Trotsky reflect the Bolsheviks ' frustration at the material limitations on their ability to implement their program for dismantling the family and freeing women .
The catastrophic decline of the productive forces in Russia as a result of the civil war and the imperialist military intervention and economic blockade that followed the revolution had created terrible conditions of scarcity in the country .
At the end of the civil war in 1920 , national income was less than one - third of the 1913 figure and industrial production less than one - fifth of the pre-war level .
And as the civil war ended , Russia 's chief agricultural regions were hit by drought ; the resulting famine claimed 2 million lives .
At the time of the revolution , the overwhelming bulk of Russia 's population were peasants ( consequently the family was still the main unit of production ) .
Only 30 % were literate , and far fewer had the knowledge and skills needed to rebuild an industrial economy .
While a certain economic revival began with the introduction of the New Economic Policy in 1921 , the situation in post - revolutionary Russia can only be described , to use Marx 's term , as one of " generalised want " .
In his chapter " Thermidor in the Family " in The Revolution Betrayed3 , Trotsky remarked :
" It proved impossible to take the old family by storm , not because the will was lacking , and not because the family was so firmly rooted in men's hearts .
On the contrary , after a short period of distrust of the government and its child - care facilities , kindergartens , and like institutions , the working women , and after them the more advanced peasants , appreciated the innumerable advantages of the collective care of children as well as the socialisation of the whole family economy .
Unfortunately , society proved too poor and too little cultured .
The real resources of the state did not correspond to the plans and intentions of the Communist Party .
You cannot `abolish ’ the family ; you have to replace it .
The actual liberation of women is unrealisable on a basis of `generalised want ’ . "
In her book Women , the State and Revolution4 , Wendy Z. Goldman documents in some detail the huge barriers that the economic underdevelopment of the country presented to implementing the Bolsheviks ' program for women 's liberation .
In every sphere - from divorce and alimony arrangements , to abortion access , to affirmative action in the workplace - the ability of Soviet women to make full use of their new rights was undermined by the inability of the government to rapidly solve the larger social problems of extensive poverty , unemployment and lack of social services .
The limitations imposed by economic underdevelopment were exacerbated by the backward social relations and attitudes that prevailed at the time .
Feudal traditions and customs still imbued society , not only in the peasantry but also in significant sections of the unskilled workers who had only recently been drawn into industrial production .
The program of the Russian Communist Party5 , adopted by the eighth party congress in March , 1919 , stated :
" The party 's task at the present moment is primarily work in the realm of ideas and education so as to destroy utterly all traces of the former inequality and prejudices , particularly among backward strata of the proletariat and peasantry . "
At the centre of this battle against backward ideas about women and men's roles in society was the Bolsheviks ' tireless struggle to involve more women directly in politics .
In his speech " The Tasks of the Working Women 's Movement in the Soviet Republic " 6 , presented to the Fourth Moscow City Conference of Nonparty Working Women on September 23 , 1919 , Lenin said :
" In order to be active in politics under the old , capitalist regime special training was required , so that women played an insignificant part in politics , even in the most advanced and free capitalist countries .
Our task is to make politics available to every working woman ...
The participation of working women is essential - not only of Party members and politically conscious women , but of the non‑party women and those who are least politically conscious .
...
The work that Soviet power has begun can only make progress when , instead of a few hundreds , millions and millions of women throughout Russia take part in it .
We are sure that the cause of socialist development will then become sound . "
Despite the massive economic and social difficulties the Bolsheviks confronted after the revolution , the advances for women of the Soviet Union between 1917 - 1930 were remarkable .
Just how remarkable is made clear when the situation of Soviet women in the 1920s is compared to the state of women 's rights in the far more technologically and economically advanced capitalist societies almost a century later - where women in parts of the United States may soon be charged with infanticide for having an abortion , where employed men get rewarded with tax discounts if their wife stays at home full ‑time , where single mothers are being increasingly penalised for not being economically dependent on the fathers of their children , and where almost all public policy extends rather than ameliorates women 's unpaid familial tasks .
Indeed , in the advanced capitalist countries , it was not until the " second wave " of feminism in the late 1960s and 1970s , after the " first wave " had won for western women the basic democratic rights , that many elements of the Bolsheviks ' program for women 's liberation became core demands of the movement .
A question of consciousness
The Bolsheviks did not conceive of and implement such a thoroughgoing program for women 's liberation because they themselves were all or mostly women .
In fact , while around 10 % of party members in 1917 were women , and while the October revolution mobilised millions more women , the prevailing social conditions , which made participation in politics very difficult for women , meant that the new government was comprised largely of men .
Nor were the advances for women forced out of the Bolsheviks by mass pressure .
On the contrary , to the extent that there was any feminist movement in Russia at the time , it was largely comprised of and led by bourgeois women , whose demands for rights only for women of property reflected their lack of concern for the conditions of life for the majority of peasant and working - class women .
The Bolsheviks therefore had to lead strongly from the front , against both the limits of liberal reformism and the generally backward attitudes on gender relations , not least among the mass of exploited women .
Rather , such progress towards the emancipation of women was made because the Bolshevik revolution was a profoundly conscious revolution led by Marxists who had a thorough understanding of the foundations and character of class oppression in all its forms , and how to dismantle it by mobilising all the oppressed for their own interests .
At the heart of Marxists ' singularly consistent championing of women 's rights is their understanding that the struggle for women 's liberation is central to the struggle for socialism - both before and after the socialist revolution .
It is not just that , as Lenin put it , " The proletariat cannot achieve complete liberty until it has won complete liberty for women " .
It is also that the process of constructing that complete liberty is a thoroughly conscious one and requires the active involvement of the majority of society .
Freeing and encouraging women to organise in every sphere against their specific oppression as women provides the best conditions within which they can develop class consciousness and join the struggle to overthrow capitalism and then to build a socialist society .
Women and the revolutionary party
In the course of the many debates and experiments undertaken in carrying out this perspective in the new Soviet Union , the basic elements of a Marxist party 's approach to women 's liberation work were worked out .
Reviewing these reveals that most of the questions we confront today regarding the relationship between a revolutionary party and an independent feminist movement , and its leadership , are not new .
The Bolshevik 's point of departure was that socialist women should be in the socialist party , not organised separately .
The “ Methods and Forms of Work among Communist Party Women : Theses ” 7 , adopted by the Third Congress of the Communist International in July 1921 , noted :
" All women who fight for the emancipation of woman and the recognition of her rights must have as their aim the creation of a Communist society .
But Communism is also the final aim of the proletariat as a whole and therefore , in the interests of both sides , the two struggles must be fought as `a single and indivisible struggle ' . "
In this framework , the Bolsheviks campaigned tirelessly to recruit women activists to their organisation and leadership .
The correctness of this emphasis on integrating women and the struggle for women 's liberation fully into the socialist project and therefore the party is revealed most clearly in the consequences of later Communist parties ' departure from this approach under the influence of the bourgeois feminist movements .
In the Communist Party of Australia , for example , but also in many other Communist parties , the separate organisation of women members - in women - only party caucuses and committees - resulted in the marginalisation and ghettoisation of both many women activists and " women 's issues " .
The Bolsheviks were adamant that the winning of women 's emancipation must be the work of the whole party , not just the women in the party .
As Lenin constantly pointed out , Marxists ' approach to organisational questions must flow from their political analyses , and there is no " women 's issue " that is not also of vital importance to the entire revolutionary movement and struggle .
Lenin had to fight for this anti‑separatist approach within the Third International .
As he told Clara Zetkin ( reprinted in Zetkin 's " My Recollections of Lenin " 8 ) , the national sections " regard agitation and propaganda among women and the task of rousing and revolutionising them as of secondary importance , as the job of just the women Communists .
None but the latter are rebuked because the matter does not move ahead more quickly and strongly .
This is wrong , fundamentally wrong !
It is outright separatism .
It is equality of women ... reversed ...
In the final analysis , it is an underestimation of women and of their accomplishments . "
At the same time as insisting on an anti-separatist approach to party members , the Bolsheviks ' stressed the need for special sections in all socialist parties to organise women from all social layers into a mass movement , win its leadership and convince women that building socialism is the only path to meeting their special needs .
As Lenin noted in a discussion with Zetkin before the third congress of the International ( in Zetkin 's " My Recollections of Lenin " ) :
" The communist women 's movement itself must be a mass movement , a part of the general mass movements ...
She who is a communist belongs as a member of the party , just as he who is a communist ...
However , we must not shut our eyes to the facts .
The Party must have organs - working groups , commissions , committees , sections or whatever else they may be called - with the specific purpose of rousing the broad masses of women , bringing them into contact with the party and keeping them under its influence .
This naturally requires that we carry out systematic work among the women .
We must teach the awakening women , win them over for the proletarian class struggle under the leadership of he Communist Party , and equip them for it .
When I say this I have in mind not only proletarian women , whether they work in mills or cook the family meal .
I also have in mind the peasant women and the women of the various sections of the lower middle class .
They too are victims of capitalism ...
We must have our own groups to work among them , special methods of agitation , and special forms of organisation .
This is not bourgeois `feminism ' ; it is a practical revolutionary expediency . "
To achieve this , the 1921 congress resolution , reaffirmed in 1922 , directed every member party to organise " special apparatuses " at every level of their party to : " strengthen the will " of working women by drawing them into all forms and types of struggle ; fight the prejudices against women held by the mass of proletarian men and increase the awareness of working men and women that they have common interests ; educate women in Communist ideas and recruit them to the party ; put on the party 's agenda questions directly concerning the emancipation of women ; and conduct a well ‑planned struggle against the power of tradition , bourgeois customs and religious ideas .
The Communist parties were directed to make available whatever resources the departments needed to do this work , which they characterised as " agitation and propaganda through action " .
This meant : " ... above all encouraging working women to self‑activity , dispelling the doubts they have about their own abilities and drawing them into practical work ... teaching them through experience to know that every action ... directed against the exploitation of capital , is a step towards improving the position of women . "
Concretely , this involved ensuring that women were represented in all organisations which strengthened revolutionary activity .
It also involved intervening in all public meetings and debates on women 's issues ; doing house ‑to‑house agitation to reach unemployed women ; having special supplements and regular articles in the party and trade union press on the question ; distributing leaflets and pamphlets on women 's liberation ; and making effective of use of all educational institutions in the party .
The Comintern discouraged special courses and schools for women only , but stressed that all general party schools must " ... without fail include a course on the methods of work among women " and should be attended by representatives chosen by the women 's department .
Of course , these approaches to doing women 's liberation work were carried out unevenly by the Communist parties , reflecting the unevenness of their Marxist understanding and development .
But the leadership of the International always led , striving to educate and convince the member parties through discussion and example .
In every case where their orientation was carried out it was proven correct .
The Stalinist counter - revolution
Tragically , the Russian revolutionaries ' vision , program , policies and methods of work for women 's liberation were never fully developed ; indeed they were substantially reversed under the bureaucratic leadership that had , by the late 1920s , wrested power from the original Bolshevik leadership of the revolution .
Establishing and maintaining working - class political power in a backward , peasant - based economy through the vicissitudes of civil war , foreign intervention and economic blockade exacted a huge toll on the revolutionaries in Soviet Russia .
The decimation of this layer and the crushing of post - war revolutionary upsurges in more industrialised countries in Western Europe weakened and demoralised the Soviet working class , and laid the basis for the usurpation of political power by a bureaucratic caste , headed by Joseph Stalin .
While the economic foundations of the new workers ' state were not destroyed , a privileged social layer that appointed for itself many of the benefits of the new economic order grew rapidly in the fertile soil of generalised poverty .
To protect and extend its new privileges , the bureaucracy reversed the policies of the Bolsheviks in virtually every sphere and murdered , exiled or imprisoned almost the entire surviving Bolshevik leadership .
For women , this political counter - revolution led to a policy of reviving and fortifying the family .
Under Stalin 's policies of forced collectivisation and industrialisation , women poured into the labour force and by the end of the first five - year plan , the falling birthrate and growing number of " unsupervised " children provided the ammunition the new bureaucratic leadership needed to move against the idea that the state should assume the functions of the family .
Official propaganda began instead to glorify the family system , and measures which bound families together through legal restrictions and economic compulsion were introduced .
In 1936 , the year before the principal author of the Bolsheviks ' 1918 family code was imprisoned in a mental institution , a new law was drafted and passed with virtually no opportunity for public discussion that made divorce more difficult , increased penalties for non‑payment of alimony , criminalised abortion , instituted a wide range of pro‑natalist measures , and re‑criminalised prostitution and homosexuality .
In 1944 , the Family Edict eradicated the last vestiges of the 1926 code , withdrawing recognition of de facto relationships , banning paternity suits and reintroducing the category of illegitimacy .
These legal changes were accompanied by a reneging on the provision of socialised alternatives to domestic labour and a propaganda campaign which simultaneously exhorted women to participate fully in the effort to increase industrial productivity and appealed to the need for " social stability " , emphasised the importance of individual family responsibility , and lectured on the joys of motherhood and the happiness of the worker - mother .
Trotsky explained the process in The Revolution Betrayed :
" The triumphal rehabilitation of the family , taking place simultaneously ... with the rehabilitation of the rouble , is caused by the material and cultural bankruptcy of the state .
Instead of openly saying , `we have proven still too poor and ignorant for the creation of socialist relations among men , our children and grandchildren will realise this aim ' , the leaders are forcing people to glue together again the shell of the broken family , and not only that , but to consider it , under threat of extreme penalties , the sacred nucleus of triumphant socialism .
It is hard to measure with the eye the scope of this retreat . "
By the 1940s , while Soviet women made up more than half of the waged work force , the cooking , cleaning , child - care , laundry - all aspects of the maintenance and reproduction of labour power - fell almost exclusively on their shoulders .
The result was that the overwhelming majority of women became less able to participate in social , economic and political life , let alone on an equal basis with men .
The Stalinist bureaucracy reinforced the family system for the same reasons it is maintained by capitalist society - as a means of inculcating attitudes of submission to authority , perpetuating the division within the working class between man as head of the household and woman as domestic servant , encouraging the attitude of " each family for itself " , and minimising the costs of social service provision .
All these outcomes served to reinforce the bureaucracy and maintain its privileges .
In its drive to shore up the family system , the Soviet bureaucracy laid part of the groundwork for the eventual restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union from the 1990s .
Having entrenched and extended ( rather than whittled away ) the bourgeois norms of distribution that are unavoidable in the transition period between capitalism and socialism , the next step for a self - serving bureaucratic elite was to restore bourgeois economic relations and thereby transform themselves into a new capitalist class .
Even given the huge step backward that Stalin 's defeat of the Bolsheviks represented for Soviet women , it was not until the process of restoring capitalism was well under way that the gains women had made as a by ‑product of the 1917 revolution 's socialisation of production became starkly evident .
UNICEF 's Women in Transition report , released in October 1999 , surveyed a wide range of social indicators among women and children in 27 former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries .
It found that considerably more than half of the 26 million jobs lost to privatisation between 1989 and 1997 were women 's jobs .
In Russia alone , between 1990 and 1995 , women lost 7 million jobs while men lost 1 - 2 million .
The report shows that the rate of decline in women 's employment between 1989‑97 was greatest in those countries furthermost along the path of capitalist " reform " .
It also reveals that women 's unemployment rate was directly proportional to the number of children they had .
With a rapidly rising rate of single motherhood and declining economic security , it is not surprising that maternal and infant mortality rates began to increase and the number of women in prostitution skyrocketed .
Conclusion
There are enormous lessons to be learnt about the path towards women 's liberation from both the positive and negative experiences in Soviet history .
The progress achieved by the Bolsheviks , as well as the defeats inflicted on women in terms of their life conditions and choices during the subsequent counter - revolution , demonstrate the absolute correctness of Engels ' analysis that because women 's oppression is rooted in the family as the basic unit of class society , the liberation of women will require not only their complete re-integration into social production , but also the socialisation of all of the functions of the family .
Having overthrown capitalist property relations , granted women full legal equality , begun the process of socialising domestic labour ( albeit with major limitations ) , and consciously striven to eradicate the backward social attitudes and ideological justifications for women 's second - class status , the Bolsheviks ' program for women 's liberation remains the most radical , thorough and successful yet seen .
On the Emancipation of Women , a collection of writing that document the main ideas , debates and experiences in the Bolsheviks ' struggle for the emancipation of women , is therefore essential reading for all socialists and feminists .

We all know that Google Maps is great for helping you get around , find a location or a good route , but there are so many other features that you have n’t probably tried .
It ’s time you go for a walk or get in your car and try these useful features , because you wo n’t regret it !
You already know about zooming in and out on your handheld device , but there ’s more !
You can zoom in or out on a map with one hand by double tapping and keeping your finger , you can slide up or down to zoom in or out .
If you want to spin the map , place your index finger and your thumb on the screen and twist both of them to left or right .
If you want to shift the perspective , place two fingers on a map and slide them upward .
This will take you in a ‘ fly ’ mode over the area you are visiting .
You can press and hold the ‘ Directions ’ button and it will get you to the navigation mode , which will provide you the best route and which means of transportation you could use to get to your destination .
Hands - Free
If your hands are on the wheel , then you can use Google Maps Hands - Free .
There are voice commands for Google Maps to help you navigate with nothing but your voice .
And it will also tell you back the directions , so that you do n’t need to glance at your phone .
Say ‘ Okay Google ’ and try some of these commands : “ What road is this ? ” , “ What ’s my next turn ? ” , “ What ’s my ETA ? ” , “ How ’s traffic ahead ? ” , “ Avoid tolls ” / “ Avoid highways ” , “ Find gas stations ” , “ Navigate home ” , “ What ’s the closest hotel ? ” , “ Exit navigation ” .
Remembers Where You Park Your Car
By tapping the blue dot that shows you the current location , will show you a menu that has more options , including the one allowing you to save your parking location .
You can also add a timer to alert you when you must move your car .
Share Your Own Location
When you need someone to find you or know where you are , you can share your location , by tapping the blue dot .
You will be able to put a timer for location sharing to one contact or until you turn the sharing off .
You can also share your ‘ trip progress ’ to whomever you want until you have reached your destination .
Search Places Along Your Route
You can swipe - up while you navigate , and you will see a menu that shows you the option of finding places along your route , such as restaurants , supermarkets , coffee shops and so on , ever service being on your way from your starting point to the desired destination .
Find Near Places
You can also find near services around your location or a certain spot that you ’ve chosen .
For example , you can write : “ Restaurants near here ” , “ Gas stations near the airport ” , “ Things to do near the ‘ X ’ Theatre ” .
Street View Navigation
You can also use Street View to find your way .
You will have to tap on the image of the location in which you are ( or you can also do this from the comfort of your home ) and tap on the compass , up – in the right corner .
If you hold and move your phone around , you will see the image shift as you move the phone .
Navigate in Time
You can use this feature on your desktop version of Google Maps , as it is n’t available on phones .
Take the little yellow person from the right - corner ( bottom of page ) and drag him on the map , dropping him wherever you want .
Looking at the top left of the screen , you will see a clock icon with a gray box that shows you an image of the place .
Under the image there is a slider that you can drag so that you can see images of the same places back in time ( 10 years of photographs ! ) .
Send a Map to Your Phone / Car
You can search for different locations or routes on your desktop and them save your directions and send them on your phone or on your car .
After you ’ve searched for a place , you can opt for sending the information to your phone or to save it .
To send it to your car , you must add your car manually – if it is compatible to Google Maps .
Traffic Estimations
With this feature , you can find out if there is traffic , after you ’ve asked for directions .
You can choose ‘ Leave now ’ / ‘ Depart at ’ or ‘ Arrive by ’ .
In all cases , the traffic estimation tool will tell you how much time you ’ll spend on road and if you choose ‘ Arrive by ’ , it will tell you when you ’re supposed to hit the road .
Add Extra Destinations to Directions
Some adventures require stops , and the brains behind Google Maps are aware of this issue .
They have added this feature , so that you can add stops on your route .
After you tap ‘ Directions ’ , tap the icon that has three dots .
It will open a menu where you can add more destinations and drag and drop them to arrange them as you wish .
Distance Measuring
You can measure the distance that exists between more locations .
Tap and hold the finger on where you start your journey .
There will be a red pin that will show you a white bar with more information on that location .
If you swipe the bar and select ‘ Measure distance ’ and then tap the blue + to find a second point .
Do that for as many routes you want to measure between those points .
So , here we are again .
Those of you with eagle eyes may already have seen this rolling out , but just to make everyone else aware - 18.8 is here .
In our ongoing quest to make your lives as simple and fulfilling as possible , we 're proud to present what is likely to be ...
Selenium :
Too slow and to brittle for any decent size test suite .
There 's more on that if you wish .
Some javascript unit testing framework .
I can't even remember the name .
The syntax was ugly , the tests were n't easy to write , and the runner did n't integrate with any automated tools we used -- lame .
At RailsConf Europe , in the Q & A portion of my talk on Functional Testing someone asked what I recommend for testing Javascript .
Ugh.
Testing Javascript .
Is it possible to recommend something when everything you 've seen is terrible ?
Usually I 'm cool with picking the tool that sucks the least , but when it comes to Javascript testing the only words that come to mind are : epic fail .
In the past I 've failed in two different ways .
My response in Berlin was " The pivotal guys are smart , so if I were going to try something new it would be Screw Unit . "
Of course , I just googled and found the RubyForge project and two with the same name on GitHub .
I 'm sure one of those is the current trunk .
A few days later it occurred to me what the correct answer was --
Do n't use Javascript and you wo n't have to test it .
No , I 'm not suggesting that we should all go back to mostly static websites .
Static content is fine for some things , but GMail is an obvious example of a site that is better done dynamically .
However , Javascript is n't your only choice for highly dynamic websites .
These days , if I were writing a website that required any dynamic interaction I would absolutely use Flex or Silverlight .
I 've done Flex , and it was nice to work with , but I must admit that I 'm lured to Silverlight because it 's going to ( or does already ? ) support Ruby .
I 'm not sure what the Silverlight testing story is , but I found Flex ( and ActionScript ) to be quite testable .
The single biggest win ( as I 've said before ) is that I no longer need to do in - browser testing .
Removing the browser from the equation is huge .
No more IE bugs causing your tests to fail , no long start up times as the browser is run , etc.
Testing with FlexUnit ( with it 's drawbacks ) is an order of magnitude better than any experience I 've had testing Javascript .
I 'm comfortable saying that I would still use Javascript for trivial features that provided so little business value that they did not warrant testing .
However , any features that provide noticeable business value must be tested , and I would move to a RIA solution instead .
In my experience , the benefits of switching to a RIA solution are dramatic , one of the largest being : you no longer need to worry about testing Javascript .

The hacking incident should not draw attention away from the following : Sarah Palin has used her private email account to conduct state business , and she was doing so to circumvent the state 's public records law and avoid public scrutiny .

I have , for the past 35 years , expressed my grave concern for the future of America .
The course we have taken over the past century has threatened our liberties , security and prosperity .
In spite of these long - held concerns , I have days � growing more frequent all the time � when I 'm convinced the time is now upon us that some Big Events are about to occur .
These fast - approaching events will not go unnoticed .
They will affect all of us .
They will not be limited to just some areas of our country .
The world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed .
Though the world has long suffered from the senselessness of wars that should have been avoided , my greatest fear is that the course on which we find ourselves will bring even greater conflict and economic suffering to the innocent people of the world � unless we quickly change our ways .
America , with her traditions of free markets and property rights , led the way toward great wealth and progress throughout the world as well as at home .
Since we have lost our confidence in the principles of liberty , self - reliance , hard work and frugality , and instead took on empire building , financed through inflation and debt , all this has changed .
This is indeed frightening and an historic event .
The problem we face is not new in history .
Authoritarianism has been around a long time .
For centuries , inflation and debt have been used by tyrants to hold power , promote aggression , and provide �bread and circuses� for the people .
The notion that a country can afford �guns and butter� with no significant penalty existed even before the 1960s when it became a popular slogan .
It was then , though , we were told the Vietnam War and the massive expansion of the welfare state were not problems .
The seventies proved that assumption wrong .
Today things are different from even ancient times or the 1970s .
There is something to the argument that we are now a global economy .
The world has more people and is more integrated due to modern technology , communications , and travel .
If modern technology had been used to promote the ideas of liberty , free markets , sound money and trade , it would have ushered in a new golden age � a globalism we could accept .
Instead , the wealth and freedom we now enjoy are shrinking and rest upon a fragile philosophic infrastructure .
It is not unlike the levies and bridges in our own country that our system of war and welfare has caused us to ignore .
I 'm fearful that my concerns have been legitimate and things may even be worse than I first thought .
They are now at our doorstep .
Time is short for making a course correction before this grand experiment in liberty goes into deep hibernation .
There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than any the world has ever experienced .
Instead of using globalism in a positive fashion , it 's been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians , bureaucrats and central bankers .
Being an unchallenged sole superpower was never accepted by us with a sense of humility and respect .
Our arrogance and aggressiveness have been used to promote a world empire backed by the most powerful army of history .
This type of globalist intervention creates problems for all citizens of the world and fails to contribute to the well - being of the world 's populations .
Just think how our personal liberties have been trashed here at home in the last decade .
The financial crisis , still in its early stages , is apparent to everyone : gasoline prices over $ 4 a gallon ; skyrocketing education and medical - care costs ; the collapse of the housing bubble ; the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble ; stock markets plunging ; unemployment rising ; massive underemployment ; excessive government debt ; and unmanageable personal debt .
Little doubt exists as to whether we 'll get stagflation .
The question that will soon be asked is :
When will the stagflation become an inflationary depression ?
There are various reasons that the world economy has been globalized and the problems we face are worldwide .
We cannot understand what we 're facing without understanding fiat money and the long - developing dollar bubble .
There were several stages .
From the inception of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to 1933 , the Central Bank established itself as the official dollar manager .
By 1933 , Americans could no longer own gold , thus removing restraint on the Federal Reserve to inflate for war and welfare .
By 1945 , further restraints were removed by creating the Bretton - Woods Monetary System making the dollar the reserve currency of the world .
This system lasted up until 1971 .
During the period between 1945 and 1971 , some restraints on the Fed remained in place .
Foreigners , but not Americans , could convert dollars to gold at $ 35 an ounce .
Due to the excessive dollars being created , that system came to an end in 1971 .
It 's the post Bretton - Woods system that was responsible for globalizing inflation and markets and for generating a gigantic worldwide dollar bubble .
That bubble is now bursting , and we 're seeing what it 's like to suffer the consequences of the many previous economic errors .
Ironically in these past 35 years , we have benefited from this very flawed system .
Because the world accepted dollars as if they were gold , we only had to counterfeit more dollars , spend them overseas ( indirectly encouraging our jobs to go overseas as well ) and enjoy unearned prosperity .
Those who took our dollars and gave us goods and services were only too anxious to loan those dollars back to us .
This allowed us to export our inflation and delay the consequences we now are starting to see .
But it was never destined to last , and now we have to pay the piper .
Our huge foreign debt must be paid or liquidated .
Our entitlements are coming due just as the world has become more reluctant to hold dollars .
The consequence of that decision is price inflation in this country � and that 's what we are witnessing today .
Already price inflation overseas is even higher than here at home as a consequence of foreign central banks ' willingness to monetize our debt .
Printing dollars over long periods of time may not immediately push prices up � yet in time it always does .
Now we 're seeing catch - up for past inflating of the monetary supply .
As bad as it is today with $ 4 a gallon gasoline , this is just the beginning .
It 's a gross distraction to hound away at �drill , drill , drill� as a solution to the dollar crisis and high gasoline prices .
It 's okay to let the market increase supplies and drill , but that issue is a gross distraction from the sins of deficits and Federal Reserve monetary shenanigans .
This bubble is different and bigger for another reason .
The central banks of the world secretly collude to centrally plan the world economy .
I 'm convinced that agreements among central banks to �monetize � U.S. debt these past 15 years have existed , although secretly and out of the reach of any oversight of anyone � especially the U.S. Congress that does n't care , or just flat does n't understand .
As this �gift� to us comes to an end , our problems worsen .
The central banks and the various governments are very powerful , but eventually the markets overwhelm them when the people who get stuck holding the bag ( of bad dollars ) catch on and spend the dollars into the economy with emotional zeal , thus igniting inflationary fever .
This time � since there are so many dollars and so many countries involved � the Fed has been able to �paper� over every approaching crisis for the past 15 years , especially with Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , which has allowed the bubble to become history 's greatest .
The mistakes made with excessive credit at artificially low rates are huge , and the market is demanding a correction .
This involves excessive debt , misdirected investments , over - investments , and all the other problems caused by the government when spending the money they should never have had .
Foreign militarism , welfare handouts and $ 80 trillion entitlement promises are all coming to an end .
We do n't have the money or the wealth - creating capacity to catch up and care for all the needs that now exist because we rejected the market economy , sound money , self - reliance and the principles of liberty .
Since the correction of all this misallocation of resources is necessary and must come , one can look for some good that may come as this � Big Event� unfolds .
There are two choices that people can make .
The one choice that is unavailable to us is to limp along with the status quo and prop up the system with more debt , inflation and lies .
That wo n't happen .
One of the two choices , and the one chosen so often by government in the past is that of rejecting the principles of liberty and resorting to even bigger and more authoritarian government .
Some argue that giving dictatorial powers to the President , just as we have allowed him to run the American empire , is what we should do .
That 's the great danger , and in this post - 911 atmosphere , too many Americans are seeking safety over freedom .
We have already lost too many of our personal liberties .
Real fear of economic collapse could prompt central planners to act to such a degree that the New Deal of the 30's might look like Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence .
The more the government is allowed to do in taking over and running the economy , the deeper the depression gets and the longer it lasts .
That was the story of the 30s and the early 40s , and the same mistakes are likely to be made again if we do not wake up .
But the good news is that it need not be so bad if we do the right thing .
I saw � Something Big� happening in the past 18 months on the campaign trail .
I was encouraged that we are capable of waking up and doing the right thing .
I have literally met thousands of high school and college kids who are quite willing to accept the challenge and responsibility of a free society and reject the cradle - to - grave welfare that is promised them by so many do - good politicians .
If more hear the message of liberty , more will join in this effort .
The failure of our foreign policy , welfare system , and monetary policies and virtually all government solutions are so readily apparent , it does n't take that much convincing .
But the positive message of how freedom works and why it 's possible is what is urgently needed .
One of the best parts of accepting self - reliance in a free society is that true personal satisfaction with one 's own life can be achieved .
This does n't happen when the government assumes the role of guardian , parent or provider , because it eliminates a sense of pride .
But the real problem is the government can't provide the safety and economic security that it claims .
The so - called good that government claims it can deliver is always achieved at the expense of someone else 's freedom .
It 's a failed system and the young people know it .
Restoring a free society does n't eliminate the need to get our house in order and to pay for the extravagant spending .
But the pain would not be long - lasting if we did the right things , and best of all the empire would have to end for financial reasons .
Our wars would stop , the attack on civil liberties would cease , and prosperity would return .
The choices are clear : it should n't be difficult , but the big event now unfolding gives us a great opportunity to reverse the tide and resume the truly great American Revolution started in 1776 .
Opportunity knocks in spite of the urgency and the dangers we face .
Let 's make � Something Big Is Happening � be the discovery that freedom works and is popular and the big economic and political event we 're witnessing is a blessing in disguise .

What Vim Can Do Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the de-facto Unix editor ' Vi ' , with a more complete feature set .
It 's useful whether you 're already using vi or using a different editor .
Users of Vim 5 and 6 should consider upgrading to Vim 7 .
The main advantages of Vim 6 compared to Vim 5 can be found on this page .
A General Overview Copyright ( c ) 2007 Laurent Gregoire What Is Vim ?
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing .
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems .
Vim is often called a " programmer 's editor , " and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE .
It 's not just for programmers , though .
Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing , from composing email to editing configuration files .
Despite what the above comic suggests , Vim can be configured to work in a very simple ( Notepad - like ) way , called evim or Easy Vim .
What Vim Is Not ?
Vim is n't an editor designed to hold its users ' hands .
It is a tool , the use of which must be learned .
Vim is n't a word processor .
Although it can display text with various forms of highlighting and formatting , it is n't there to provide WYSIWYG editing of typeset documents .
( It is great for editing TeX , though . )
Vim's License Vim is charityware .
Its license is GPL - compatible , so it 's distributed freely , but we ask that if you find it useful you make a donation to help children in Uganda through the ICCF .

After Jim Leach put Sen. Chuck Hagel ’s name out there as a potential running mate for Barack Obama , Hagel ’s office put out a statement which said that he is not endorsing McCain or Obama .
“ Senator Hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate , ” Hagel spokesman Jordan Stark said in a statement to USA TODAY .
The bigger bombshell is that Hagel wo n’t even be attending the Republican convention .
Of course Hagel is n’t alone in skipping the and late summer funeral for the Grand Old Party , he will be joined by fellow senators Ted Stevens of Alaska , Gordon Smith of Oregon , Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine all of whom are locked in tough reelection contests and want to avoid being seen with Bush and McCain .
Wayne Allard of Colorado and Larry Craig of Idaho also wo n’t be there because they are retiring .
Advertisements
Hagel himself is set to retire at the end of his current term , but he and McCain are friends , who strongly disagree about the war in Iraq .
It is probable that his friendship for McCain is what caused him to sit this one out .
However , Hagel ’s decision leaves the door open for him to serve in a potential Obama administration .
Hagel accompanied Obama on his recent Iraq trip , so it would not be a surprise to see him involved if Obama wins the election .
How bad are things for the Republican Party right now ?
One seventh of their Senate delegation has already announced that they wo n’t be attending the convention where one of their own accepts their party ’s nomination .
In modern political history , I do n’t think that this has ever happened before .
The party ’s brand is so tainted right now , that many Republicans will skip their own convention , just to avoid the taint of the GOP .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday dismissed former CIA analyst Valerie Plame ’s lawsuit against Vice President Dick Cheney and several former Bush administration officials for disclosing her identity to the public .

A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday dismissed former CIA analyst Valerie Plame 's lawsuit against Vice President Dick Cheney and several former Bush administration officials for disclosing her identity to the public .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque / Files
The Court of Appeals in Washington dealt another setback to the former spy , who has said her career was destroyed when officials blew her cover in 2003 to retaliate against her husband , Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson .
Plame ’s outing led a lengthy criminal investigation , which resulted in the conviction of Cheney ’s top aide , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , for perjury and obstruction of justice .
President George W. Bush commuted Libby ’s 2 1/2 - year prison sentence last year .
Plame and Wilson sought money damages from Cheney , Libby , former White House aide Karl Rove and former State Department official Richard Armitage for violating their constitutional free speech , due process and privacy rights .
But a three - judge panel of the appeals court upheld a federal judge ’s ruling that dismissed the couple ’s lawsuit .
The court ruled Cheney and the others were acting within their official capacity when they revealed Plame ’s identity to reporters .
Government employees who engage in questionable acts , such as abusing prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay facility or engaging in defamatory speech , cannot be held individually liable if they are carrying out official duties , the court said .
“ The conduct , then , was in the defendants ’ scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the United States , ” Appeals Court Chief Judge David Sentelle wrote in the opinion .
Plame ’s lawyer said she was disappointed .
“ We ’re considering all of our options , including appeal , which I think is likely , ” said Plame attorney Melanie Sloan , who added that she is still studying the decision .
Wow .
I have had a lot of hostility from women who do n’t want men to “ man up . ”
They do two things :
1 ) They say it indicates men want to dominate women and 2 )
They try to twist the phrase to mean men should obey women ( “ man up and do what ’s right ” ) .
Look , ladies , did you think men were just going to lay on the couch waiting for you to finish calling them slobs ?
No .
They ’ve been making plans to rise up again .
They ’ve been making plans to quit taking your bitching and complaining and critcizing and get back to living like free men .
They do n’t want to dominate you , they just want a beer once in awhile without explaining themselves to death .
They do n’t think they ’re better than you , they think they ’re entitled to be themselves without your input .
Ladies , do n’t expect to ridicule , mock and manipulate without consequences .
He will leave one day .
He is making a plan now .
He may even know the address where he ’ll be living .
He ’s got his finances planned , and he ’s got his friends on alert .
He wo n’t leave you with angry words .
He ’ll be too relieved to be free of your control .
He ’ll be too glad to be away from someone who is so cranky .
And guess what ?
He ’ll easily meet a woman who likes him being a man .
He wo n’t have to explain , justify or defend .
He wo n’t bring you down to rise up .
He ’ll just man up and move on .
Guys , read the book .
Make a plan .
Life is too short .

Post subject : 10 pc Cybercafe for 30ukp !!!!
Posted : Tue 14 Nov 2006 , 12:11 Post subject:10 pc Cybercafe for 30ukp !!!!
( Updated 15 Jan 2007 , see here
Software Setup for the cybercafe released , details
Hiya Everyone , I just wanted to share with you what has been made possible using Puppy Linux in our area .
At our local community centre weve manged to literally piece together a ten computer Cybercafe and teaching suite with an I.T. budget of a mere � 30 British pounds ( about 50 Dollars ) !!!!
Most of this was spent on headphones ( 1 pound each ) , printer refills , a few ethernet cables and some 4 way mains adaptors .
The cybercafe has 9 am - 5 pm Monday to Saturday internet access , with free uk landline calls from skype , word processing , spreadsheets , amsn etc etc .
The computers range from a pentium 500/ 128 to 1ghz /256 .
All of these have been donated from local companies through freecycle or our local linux user group , a few schools , and even at times the odd skip !!!
Weve used MU 's supurb icewmultra package to theme them to look like xp .
Most people dont even realise they are not running doze , but remark on how fast they are compared to their computers at home .
Then they find out theyre using linux ...
There is a beginners and intermediate computer class running there which is quickly becoming oversubscribed ( we had to double up today ! ) .
We are also transferring the system used there onto peoples laptops and distributing Puppy CD 's from the centre .
Word is spreading quickly around the town about what has been achieved , and now other places want similar setups , even if they already have XP computers !!!
Just wanted to say a big thank you to you the puppy team from us and the people of Scunthorpe , Lincolnshire .
Without you this would not have been possible .

Is it possible to get the ISO of your customizations ?
I 'd like to try it out on some low end systems here for the same purpose .
Do you have any URLs for us ?
Nice work !
Thanks !

How we did this is create a stock pup001 file ( Yes were still using 1.09 ce ! ) to which we added Mark Ulrichs icewm ultra , plus rox 2.5 , and the standard " Bliss " xp backdrop .
We added amsn and skype and we were literally ready to roll .
We cloned the machines by using the smoothwall box as a dhcp server ( most 4 - port servers will do this ) .
We shared the pup001 file on one machine using betaFTP and a symlink from / root / ftp to / mnt / home / pup001 , then opened a console window and did " ifconfig " to find out the i.p.
adress on the network that had been assigned to it using the ethernet wizard .
We then booted a " new " machine using the " memory only " option and ran the ethernet setup wizard on that .
We then went into either firefox and type ftp://192.168.0.xxx of the other machine , downloaded the pup001 file off the other machine into the root directory .
We found if we did this with the 2.xx series puppy then we could use gparted at the same time to create swap partition first .
After I had transferred the pup file , I reloaded with 1.09ce and rebooted .
On bootup the computer would drop to the command line where I ran " xorgwizard " to set up the graphics .
I then typed " xwin " and ran the alsa sound wizard in the the wizard wizard and I had created a clone of the system !!!
Average time about ten minutes and I could do several at once .
I really wouldnt know how to create an ISO , but any tips would be handy .
A " public access " version of puppy for cybercafes with all of the privacy settings and software already poreconfigured would make an excellent puppy project though !
Any feedback welcome .
At a push I think I might be able to uploa the 256 mb pup001 file to our webservers for interested parties to play with .
Let me know .

Post subject : zip it
You could zip a pup001 file that has no user files in it ( that is , the / root is clean of user files ) and then upload it - it must be much reduced in size .

Posted : Thu 16 Nov 2006 , 13:29 Post subject : Puppy File for Download
This is the pup file I created .
Im just in the process of refreshing all of the computers in the suite with a fresh cloned copy as Im posting this .
Simply download this file and unzip the pup001 file contained in it t the root directory of any pc , boot with puppy 1.09ce , run ' xorgwizard ' , then ' xwin ' and you should have a copy of the system that we use here .
Please note , the suite has not been operational for long so there are likely to be quite a few oversights .
Here is a basic added package list .
- Streamtuner Radio
- Amsn 0.94 with the option for remembering email addresses turned off
- Firefox with cookies set to expire after a day , do not remember form fields or passwords etc .
- Skype Telephony
Heres the link .
http://www.ecomoney.eu/puppy/puppyfiles/cybercafepup.zip
Enjoy
Would anyone using it please make a post here with some picture , would be nice to see .
P.S. Have finished cloning the 9 pc's from one " master " pc over a 10 mb network , took just 20 minutes !!!!!
WOW !!!!
80 mb zipped up !!!

Subject description : Amazing achievement
One of my main clients is a Postgraduate " Deanery " - part of Britain 's National Health Service .
I am sickened by the sheer waste I see around me - perfectly good kit being slung in skips because it wo n't run the latest Windoze .
I constantly have to struggle with dinosaur NHS IT managers whose sense of self - worth seems based more on the size of their budgets rather than the quality of service they deliver .
Consequently my attempts to sow the seeds of open source software have often fallen on stony ground .
But your project gives us great hope .
Anyway out of frustration , a few like - minded colleagues and I recently set up a site called DEOSS - Development & Education in Open Source Systems .
It is a site of many parts including a Moodle section for running distance learning projects , and a magazine called Positive .
We really would like to cover this story in more depth and show our " leaders " how different things could be if they applied a little open source imagination .
@ Ecomoney : perhaps we could arrange a convenient time to come up and see you please ?
We are based in Southampton / Winchester .
Could you email or PM me please ?
Your project deserves as much publicity as possible !
http://www.deoss.org/positive
On a completely different tack , did you know that considering open source software alongside proprietrary products as part of the procurement process is actually UK Government Policy ?
Not that one would notice , of course !
Check out this document published by the Cabinet Office , 2004 - 10 - 28 ...

Meantime , best wishes to all you puppies from one very respectful goose .

A pessimist is like an optimist but better informed ... "

An Italian priest who wants to host a beauty pageant for nuns called " Miss Sister 2008 " should consider coming to Phoenix to take a Holy See at Christa Parra .
Phoenix publications including the Catholic Sun , Arizona Republic and Arizona State University 's State Press have already held a contest for the best - looking nun , it seems , and they 've decided Parra 's the winner .
Antonio Rungi , the ecclesiastical Bert Parks - wanna - be who came up with the idea , believes a beauty pageant would make the contribution of nuns " more visible " to the world .
Considering how rare it is for a nun to land on the front page of a major newspaper like Parra did this month , Rungi may have something there .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) has just taken the wraps off what it claims is the world ’s largest single - memory computer – a prototype from ‘ The Machine ’ research project .
This line of research is all about HPE ’s memory - driven computing , an architecture specifically built to crunch through the ever - increasing quantities of big data floating around these days .
Of course , big data is a key factor across a range of industries , and HPE believes that when it comes to analytics , throwing more and more processors at vast sets of data is not the answer .
Rather , a different approach to computing is needed , built around memory rather than the CPU – thus eliminating the relatively clunky and inefficient manner that the processor , memory and storage interact in today ’s machines .
HPE ’s prototype computer boasts some 160TB of memory spread across 40 physical nodes , and uses an optimised Linux - based operating system driven by a Thunder X2 dual - socket ARMv8 - A workload - optimised processor .
HPE says it ’s capable of simultaneously working with all the data held in every single book in the Library of Congress – five times over .
In other words , 160 million books – a truly immense dataset that can be held in this single - memory system .
Or it can hold 6,400 Blu-ray discs , for the less bookworm - ish .
The best Chromebooks do n't have tons of memory , but they 're hella practical
Scaling mountains of data
The company believes this architecture could easily scale from terabytes to exabytes , and indeed beyond that to a system with ‘ near - limitless ’ quantities of memory to draw on : 4,096 yottabytes is the figure HPE quotes as the sort of scale to expect in the future .
A single yottabyte is a trillion terabytes , to give you some perspective there .
Mark Potter , CTO at HPE and Director , Hewlett Packard Labs , commented : “ We believe Memory - Driven Computing is the solution to move the technology industry forward in a way that can enable advancements across all aspects of society .
The architecture we have unveiled can be applied to every computing category – from intelligent edge devices to supercomputers . ”
Sleeping with the fishes is getting a lot harder these days .
And not because the FBI finally has the mob on the run , either -- rather , because noise levels in the world 's oceans are lately reaching staggering levels , in some areas doubling each decade .
Whales , dolphins and other marine mammals are finding their feeding and mating patterns disrupted , and some of the noise -- like that produced by high - energy military sonar systems -- have been linked to outright death in some species of whales .
It 's not so much that the noise we humans produce underwater is greater than what we produce on land , but that creatures of the sea are so much more sensitive to it .
Baleen whales emit low - frequency calls that can travel a thousand miles in water -- an essential kind of long - distance calling plan for an animal whose kind are far more sparsely distributed than before commercial whaling took hold .
Other kinds of whales and dolphins use high - frequency clicks to locate prey , and sound is important to all marine mammals " in ways that are clearly important to their survival , though not completely understood , " according to the BBC .
And it 's not just high - energy sonar from naval operations that 's drowning them out -- the engines and propellers of large ships , whose movements across the open ocean are mostly unrestricted , can be a major problem , as well as the seismic blasts associated with offshore drilling operations ( drill , Willy , drill ! ) .
Some companies and the Navy have voluntarily turned down the noise ( after pressure from the International Fund for Animal Welfare ) , but the IFAW says it 's not enough : " Humanity is literally drowning out marine mammals , " says its director , Robbie Marsland .
" While nobody knows the precise consequences for specific animals , unless the international community takes preventive measures we are likely to discover only too late the terrible damage we 're causing . "
Here 's a sad little video about the effect of sonar on whales :
The crime of the century .
The greatest one ever .
Author Danny Schechter calls it “ Plunder . ”
The title of his important new book on the subprime and overall financial crisis .
Economist Michael Hudson and others refer to a kleptocracy .
A Ponzi scheme writ large .
Maybe an out - of - control Andromeda Strain .
An economic one .
Deadly .
Unrecallable .
Science fiction now real life .
Potentially catastrophic .
World governments trying to contain it .
Trying everything but not sure what can work .
Maybe only able to paper it over for short - term relief .
Buy time but in the end vindicate the maxim that things that ca n’t go on forever , wo n’t .
The world as we know it is changing .
Industrial capitalism .
The entire global economic system .
Interconnected .
What affects one nation touches others .
If the troubled country is America it reaches everywhere , and if the crisis is great enough , the disease may be fatal and human wreckage catastrophic .
Precisely the current dilemma that world leaders and financial experts are scrambling to figure out .
Desperate to contain , and not sure what , if anything , can work .
How did this happen and why ?
The result of unfettered capitalism ’s fatal flaw – unbridled greed in a rigged system that rewards the few at the expense of most others .
First an explanation of how it works .
Free - wheeling , “ free market ” Chicago School fundamentalism the way economist Milton Friedman championed it in his 1962 book “ Capitalism and Freedom ” and taught it to students for decades .
He believed that government ’s sole function is “ to protect our freedom both from ( outside ) enemies …. and from our fellow - citizens . ”
Preserve law and order .
Enforce private contracts .
Protect private property and “ foster competitive ( unregulated ) markets . ”
Everything else in public hands is “ socialism ….blasphemy . ”
Not to be tolerated .
He said “ free markets ” work best .
Unfettered by rules , regulations , onerous taxes or any at all , trade barriers , entrenched interests , and human interference .
That anything government does , business does better , so let it .
That the best government is one that governs least .
That public wealth should be in private hands .
The accumulation of profits unrestrained .
Corporate taxes abolished .
Social services also , and that “ economic freedom is an end to itself …. and an indispensable means toward ( achieving ) political freedom . ”
He called most all government interference a restriction of freedom .
Opposed foreign aid .
Subsidies .
Import quotas and tariffs , and illicit drug laws for being a subsidy to organized crime , but he found no fault with major banks laundering their profits .
He believed business should be unrestrained in maximizing them , even the illegal kind apparently .
He opposed the minimum wage and right of unions to bargain collectively on equal terms with management .
He believed high wages and benefits harm everyone .
They raise prices , and in the end , hurt workers as well as management .
He called Social Security “ The Biggest Ponzi Scheme on Earth , ” even though it ’s been the most effective poverty reduction program ever for millions of seniors who’d be desperate without it .
Especially today given a deepening economic crisis .
The nation ’s social safety net disappearing , and heading everyone toward managing on his or her own .
Dependent on their ingenuity , resources , and good fortune .
Milton Friedman ’s ideal world .
For those who ca n’t make it , it ’s their own fault .
It ’s everyone for him or herself in his judgment , and let the devil take the hindmost .
As for today ’s largest ever unraveling Ponzi scheme , it ’s just the workings of the “ free market . ”
Creative destruction .
“ Freedom to choose . ”
The best of all possible worlds , and unfettered capitalism will figure out the right solutions .
Provided government gets out of the way and gives it free reign .
Free money also to wreck world economies and human lives even more than what ’s already done .
The Chickens Are Home to Roost
Are they ever , and here ’s what we ’ve got .
A global asset bubble .
A predictable crisis allowed to build and mushroom .
Begun after Chicago School economics took hold under Ronald Reagan .
Continued under GHW Bush .
Became religion under Bill Clinton , and ultimately fundamentalism under GW Bush .
The result – a “ slow motion train wreck ” gaining speed .
Banks and other financial institutions failing globally .
On September 25 , the largest bank failure in US history with Washington Mutual ’s collapse .
Earlier it was giant insurer AIG .
Before that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch a forced liquidation to Bank of America .
Others are now teetering on the edge .
Strapped by toxic debt .
The result of out - of - control greed for easy profits .
Massive fraud to get them .
Thinking they ’re the best and brightest , and only mere mortals mess up .
Knowing
Fed moral hazard will cushion them if they do .
True for some .
Not for others , and learning that the Federal Reserve ( the world ’s key central bank ) failed in its primary job .
To protect the country ’s financial system from insolvency .
By contributing to a financial crisis and one of confidence .
By creating near - limitless amounts of capital .
Fueling a housing bubble .
Outsized consumer debt , and irresponsible investments free from government oversight .
Fraudulent ones involving multi-trillions of dollars .
Partnering with government to make it easy .
Risking a global economic meltdown as a result .
Scrambling to find solutions .
Unsure if there are any .
The present crisis is unparalled .
Maybe it can be fixed , and maybe not .
The problem is multi-fold .
A perfect storm involving :
— residential housing ;
— commercial real estate ;
— consumer over - indebtedness ;
— unknown amounts of toxic debt ( in the multi-trillions ) ;
— affecting world finance and economies ;
— causing bankruptcies ;
— many more will follow ;
— selected ones bailed out ;
— the entire system endangered ;
— consumer money market , bank accounts and private pension funds as well ; government backing is needed to protect them ; there ’s not enough money to do it ; and
— the contagion is spreading ; threatening world economies and people everywhere .
This time is really different .
A $ 700 billion bailout ( called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 – EESA ) is just a down payment .
Trillions will be needed in the end .
Other nations contributing to help .
The problems are deeper and more intractable than anyone expected .
Before this ends , unimaginable amounts of capital will be written off .
Too much to even contemplate .
Bad investments contaminating good ones .
Threatening world financial structures with paralysis .
Severe economic damage to their economies as a result .
Eroding industrial capitalism as we know it .
At best managing a short - term fix and delaying a final denouement for a later time .
Under new management with the current and past ones claiming no responsibility .
And unmindful of millions of homeowners facing foreclosure and bankruptcy .
One in ten currently behind in their payments .
Others losing their jobs and way of life .
They ’re the most vulnerable .
Least able to cope , and for some their ability to survive .
According to The New York Times , here ’s how the Paulson scheme helps them : “ it requires the government to use its new role as owner of distressed mortgage - backed securities to make ‘ more aggressive ’ efforts to prevent home foreclosures . ”
Weasel words .
No specifics .
No assurances , and nothing apparently for homeowners already in foreclosure .
On September 22 , ahead of the announced agreement , American Research Group ( ASG ) published its latest public sentiment poll results , and they were stunning .
At 19 % , George Bush scored lowest ever for a US president , surpassing Harry Truman at the depth of the Korean War and Richard Nixon during Watergate .
It came at a time ASG ’s results showed 82 % of Americans believe the economy is getting worse , and only 17 % approve of how Bush is handling it .
Among registered voters , the number is 18 % at a time no one surveyed ( zero percent ) said the economy is improving and 68 % say it ’s in recession .
True or false , it ’s how they feel .
How the crisis affects them , and that ’s what counts most .
Yet on September 24 , the president addressed the nation audaciously .
Callously dismissing public pain and anger .
Deceitfully stating outright lies .
A typical performance .
Demanded that Congress give the treasury secretary carte blanche authority over $ 700 billion to address “ a serious financial crisis . ”
Asked taxpayers to pay for corporate fraud .
Reward criminals and ignore their crimes .
Said nothing about the root cause .
The effect on ordinary people , or how Paulson ’s scheme will help them .
Ignored growing public opposition .
Large numbers of credible observers believing the proposed solution is worse than the problem .
The most honest of them saying it will enrich fraudsters and offer no help for homeowners .
Yet Bush concluded that “ democratic capitalism ( is the ) best system the world has ever devised ” in spite of clear evidence that it ’s broken and corrupted .
Exploits people for profit .
Enriches the few at the expense of the many .
Rewards criminals for their crimes .
Protects the rich from beneficial social change .
Ahead of the president ’s address on September 24 , The New York Times showed a rare display of candor in a critical Timothy Egan opinion piece .
About “ nearly nationalizing the banking system and giving the treasury secretary more power than a king …. whose decisions may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . ”
He asked readers to remember “ where the biggest heist took place , and how Wall Street dragged down the rest of the country once before , ” referring to the Great Depression but leaving out everything in between .
He stressed , however , “ how Wall Street brought down main street , ” and things have now come full circle .
Deregulation unleashed casino capitalism , and bankers made a killing .
Now they ’re in trouble and Bush demands “ the biggest bailout in American history … .or the world will crumble .
He said the a similar thing in the run-up to war ” so who can believe him now .
Egan quotes a dirt farmer asking why not the same “ concerns ( for ) average Americans . ”
Because “ we the people ” Bush speaks for are them , not us .
As for Paulson ’s plan , here ’s what the Financial Times writer Martin Wolf said on September 23 .
He called it “ not a true solution to the crisis . ”
It does n’t address the “ fundamental problem . ”
It ’s “ neither a necessary nor an efficient solution .
It is not necessary because the ( Fed can ) manage illiquidity through its many lender - of - last resort operations .
It is not efficient because it can only deal with insolvency by buying bad assets ( overpriced junk ) at far above their true value , thereby guaranteeing big losses for taxpayers and providing an open - ended bail - out to the most irresponsible investors . ”
Wolf also objects to Paulson getting unchecked powers .
Providing little or no help to the poor and “ ill - informed ” ( read duped ) borrowers , and lists other operational suggestions “ essential for the long - run health of any financial system ” without needing “ a penny of public money . ”
Among them , forcing creditors to take losses and not taxpayers .
Unmentioned in his article is the underlying fraud behind the crisis and a lack of regulatory oversight that made it easy .
Also , omitted was what ’s covered in the section below .
The 1937 Housing Act ’s Empowering Section 8 Authority
One Section 8 sentence provided the basis for the treasury secretary ’s empowerment .
It reads :
“ Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administration agency . ”
In other words , unchallengeable czarist powers .
In contrast to the 1930s Reconstruction Finance Corporation ’s ( RFC ) closely supervised operations .
That era ’s Home Owners ’ Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) that refinanced homes to prevent foreclosures .
And the 1980s Resolution Trust Corporation ( RTC ) mandate to liquidate assets from failed S & Ls .
Not dispense free money for bad investments unchecked .
The above authorities subject to judicial review .
Not governed by a financial boss to run as he pleased .
The Announced “ Bailout ” Deal – The Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008 ( ESA )
According to The New York Times , EESA calls for “ strict oversight of the program by a Congressional panel and conflict - of - interest rules for firms hired by the Treasury to help run the program . ”
Also “ a change in the bankruptcy laws sought by some Democrats to give judges the authority to modify the terms of first mortgages . ”
Given the bipartisan blame for today ’s crisis .
The post -9/11 willingness to give the administration near - carte blanche authority across the board .
Eight years of indifference to social needs and public welfare .
Who now believes that policy going forward will change and that the agreed - on scheme will protect people or curb the secretary ’s authority .
On his own initiative , George Bush usurped supreme power post - 9/11 while few in Congress blanched .
None in leadership positions .
Little today has changed .
Disclaimers notwithstanding from both sides of the aisle , Wall Street is pleased .
Paulson got what he wanted .
The plan ’s fine print will assure it .
Public money .
Far more , if needed , than $ 700 billion .
The power to dispense it freely .
With weak at best oversight and judicial review , and the ability to conceal fraud and malfeasance .
In short , the between - the - lines meaning of Paulson saying : “ We have made great progress toward a deal , which will work and be effective in the marketplace . ”
The same one that fleeced the nation and betrayed the public trust .
Now empowered to take more with the full faith and blessing of the government from both sides of the aisle .
Belying George Bush ’s insult that “ The rescue effort ….is not aimed at Wall Street ; it is aimed at your street . ”
And Nancy Pelosi ’s hypocrisy that : “ All of this was done in a way to insulate Main Street and everyday Americans from the crisis on Wall Street … .
I want to congratulate all of the negotiators for the great work they have done . ”
Who in banker boardrooms would disagree .
Some Relevant Facts
Clearly the present crisis is unprecedented .
As stated above , maybe it can be fixed and maybe not .
No one is sure because no one understands it fully .
Where all the problems lie .
To what degree can they be contained .
How great their fallout may be .
Their full effect on world economies .
How bad things may get before they stabilize and improve , and the way the world will look like when they do .
Whatever ’s coming , industrial capitalism is eroding .
A kleptocracy replaced it .
If the system is saved , it will be temporary , and an even greater one will emerge .
Why this article is called Grand Theft America .
A criminal class runs it , and they ’re rewarded for their crimes .
Backed by the full faith and credit of the government with taxpayer money .
A near - limitless amount created and borrowed .
Who said crime does n’t pay !
For over 30 years , an unimaginable wealth transfer to the rich has been ongoing .
To the top 1 % and corporate America from most others .
It proves the failure of a system that rewards the few at the expense of the many .
Licenses greed and creates this kind of global financial crisis so far uncontained .
It begs the questions : what caused it and what ’s the fallout :
— the ruinous effects of militarization ; insane amounts of spending on it ; “ military Keynesianism ; ” believing capitalism thrives on foreign wars ; “ Global Wars on Terrorism ” currently ; their costs are unsustainable and are heading the nation toward bankruptcy ;
— the drain on an already weakened economy ;
— maxed out consumers now debt slaves ;
— so is government from unrepayable obligations in the tens of trillions ; not the fictitious “ official ” reported numbers ;
— the possibility of future default ; hyperinflation ; national bankruptcy , and the demise of the republic ;
— human default as well : mass bankruptcies ; home foreclosures ; rising unemployment ; increased poverty ; and growing numbers of families unable to survive ;
— the subprime crisis is just part of it ; seven million mortgages sold to the unwary ; the idea was to criminally defraud them ; offer two - year teaser rates ; then reset them higher semi-annually based on an interest rate benchmark ; payments soared as much as 30 % and became unaffordable ; the scheme was to cash in at the expense of mortgage holders , and five million risk losing their homes and life savings ;
— an “ economic Pearl Harbor ” for Warren Buffett ; for Senator Chris Dodd a “ 50 - state Katrina ; ” a “ house of cards ( built on ) reckless finance ” for author Kevin Phillips ; Frankenstein finance ; casino capitalism ; for most Americans , a human catastrophe ;
— the demise of our manufacturing base ; letting malls replace factories as the economy ’s engine ;
— permitting the financialization of the economy ; speculative finance writ large ; replacing productive investment ; totally deregulated ; run by fraudsters ; free from government oversight ; letting investment banks game the system at up to 40 to 1 leverage ; until 2004 , 12 to 1 was the maximum ;
— a government – business conspiracy for global dominance and the single - minded pursuit of profit ; unfettered amounts of it through cleverly manipulated schemes ; transferring multi-trillions of dollars from workers to the most wealthy ; doing it without people even noticing ;
— creative destruction to let giant businesses grow larger by removing and devouring smaller ones ; even large ones ;
— permitting and / or ignoring massive fraud ; involving multi-trillions of dollars ; the largest ever Ponzi scheme ; a calculated crime with media complicity through silence ; not reporting a growing problem as it emerged ; waiting until it mushroomed and still not explaining it accurately and honestly ; and
— wondering won if the best and brightest can fix things or if no amount of money or ingenuity can do it .
The Plan ’s Architect – Henry Paulson
From a Nixon administration staff assistant to the assistant secretary of defense .
To assistant to key Watergate official John Erlichman .
To Goldman Sachs in 1974 .
To a partnership in the firm in 1982 .
Then Chief Operation Officer ( COO ) in 1994 and CEO in 1998 by a palace coup against co-chairman and now New Jersey governor Jon Corzine , according to New York Times columnist Floyd Norris .
Even before the current crisis , Goldman was the preeminent Wall Street firm .
A survivor .
The largest , and along with Morgan Stanley , the remaining two Street giants left standing .
But no longer as investment banks after the Federal Reserve ’s September 21 announcement that both companies will become bank holding companies after a mandatory five - day waiting period , now over .
In theory , they ’ll be under stricter Fed oversight but will get Fed help to complete their transition and thereafter .
As a well - connected financial powerhouse , whatever Goldman wants , Goldman gets .
Always in the past by recycling top executives into Democrat and Republican administrations , and now more than ever given Henry Paulson ’s extraordinary financial czar powers .
Before his $ 700 billion giveaway plan , the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery
Act gave him authority to fleece taxpayers by rescuing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as raise the national debt by over $ 5 trillion dollars .
He also orchestrated the demise of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual .
The forced sale of Merrill Lynch , and arranged the government takeover of AIG .
He has near - open checkbook authority to reward close allies with loans and free money and let them acquire troubled assets on the cheap .
This from a man with much responsibility for today ’s crisis .
A June 12 , 2006 Business
Week cover story titled “ Mr. Risk Goes to Washington ” called him “ one of the key architects of a more daring Wall Street , where securities firms are taking greater and greater chances in their pursuit of profits . ”
Such as assuming huge amounts of debt and “ placing big bets ( with their own money ) on all sorts of exotic derivatives and other securities . ”
Advising clients to do the same .
Casino capitalism at up to 40 to one leverage .
Hugely profitable in up markets .
Disastrous in down ones .
Paulson earned millions and now has an estimated $ 700 million + net worth .
For 2007 overall , according to Bloomberg.com , “ Wall Street ’s five biggest firms ( paid out ) a record $ 39 billion in bonuses ( and did it in ) a year when three of the companies suffered the worst quarterly losses in their history and shareholders lost more than $ 80 billion . ”
Speculative finance pays well , even in down years , and it even raised Bloomberg ’s ire in a Michael Lewis September 24 commentary titled “ America Must Rescue the Bonuses at Goldman Sachs . ”
It reflected on a possible global financial collapse but sacrificing Goldman bonuses is another matter .
If firm “ employees ( take ) pay cut (s ) , it will be ( tantamount to failure and ) our country may never recover . ”
How will the company induce new talent to come aboard .
Goldman is well - positioned to get maximum gain from its former CEO ’s $ 700 billion handout .
Why else would Warren Buffett bet $ 5 billion on the firm !
For preferred shares paying an annual 10 % dividend .
Warrants as well to buy $ 5 billion in common stock at a $ 115 a share strike price .
Well off its $ 251 peak and below the latest September 26 $ 138 a share .
Joseph Stiglitz on the Economy
Stiglitz was formerly part of the system he now criticizes .
Free market fundamentalism in its most extreme form .
For many months , he warned about a worsening global economy and growing financial crisis that ’s as bad or worse than the Great Depression .
He sees similar problems now as then :
— outsized speculation through excessive leverage ;
— pyramid schemes ;
— multiple bubbles through so - called Wall Street innovations ; and
— a lack of transparency and government oversight .
Combined they created a crisis “ so great that no one knows exactly the magnitude of the risk they face .
It is particularly bad because our financial institutions are based on trust .
You put money in the bank and you trust that you can get ( it ) out , so trust is absolutely essential for the functioning of our financial markets and economy . ”
The problem is exacerbated by those providing the news .
The dominant media and frequent spokespeople .
Industry representatives like Lehman Brothers CEO saying last April that “ we turned the corner , and the economy is on the uptick . ”
Also from the president , treasury secretary and others in government as things keep worsening .
Stiglitz calls this a “ top down crisis . ”
The “ $ 3 trillion cost ” of foreign wars a key .
Creating huge deficits and consuming vital resources needed for growth .
“ This is the first war in American history that has been totally financed on the credit card .
For the last five years …. we have been a debt economy . ”
Not since the Revolutionary War have “ we have had to turn to foreigners , ” so now “ 40 % of our national debt is financed by ( them ) .
Even as we went ( to war ) we had a big deficit , and yet the president called for tax cuts for upper middle class Americans . ”
Insane but we did it .
Another factor is other countries trusting that our economy is working well , and when the president says it is he ’s believable .
“ This administration burned that trust …. no wonder everybody around the world is losing confidence . ”
Even worse is that the administration is n’t dealing responsibly with these problems , mostly because they ’re of our own making .
Stiglitz worries about the “ real economy : ” home prices dropping ; owners forced into foreclosure ; more financial firms in crisis ; and a good many wo n’t survive .
He sees a weakening financial system unable or unwilling “ to provide credit ( the lifeblood of the economy for ) loans , mortgages , ” and that means lower home prices , contracting businesses , rising unemployment , and a “ downward vicious cycle .
You have to be in fantasy land to say that everything is fine ( or even ) that we have turned the corner . ”
He sees at least another 18 months of pain .
Maybe longer .
Who can know or how much .
For sure , real economic stimulus is needed .
Productive investment .
Not the phony “ bailout ” kind proposed .
Aiding state and local governments .
Better unemployment insurance and more for infrastructure .
Providing a basis for long - term growth .
Not feeding markets and starving the hungry , as one writer put it .
Not believing markets on their own will fix things .
Understanding that government must intervene .
Responsibly .
Facilitate job creation .
End casino capitalism .
Provide incentives for real economic growth .
Let foreclosed and threatened homeowners stay in their homes .
Work out an equitable way to do it .
“ We learned a painful lesson in the 1930s and today :
The invisible hand often seems invisible because it ’s not there . ”
It led to the kind of predicament now confronting the country .
The solutions proposed will just compound it .
Ones that Can Fix It
Good ones not considered .
From figures like Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
Others as well with solid advice to :
— make fraudsters eat the bulk of their losses ;
— use public funds only “ to sustain the orderly operation of the financial system ; ”
— minimize speculative finance ; the root of the current problem ;
— “ minimize moral hazard ” – the Paulson ( and Bernanke ) “ put ” picking up where Greenspan left off ;
— let delinquent homeowners stay in their homes and pay rent ;
— curtail executive compensation for companies getting government aid ;
— make a key Fed responsibility the prevention of asset bubbles ; reinstitute regulations to do it ; Glass - Steagall for starters that prohibited commercial and investment banks and insurance companies from combining ;
— impose a modest financial transactions tax to curb excesses and raise revenue ;
— trade assets , like credit default swaps , openly on exchanges to establish fair value for them ;
— impose strict limits on leverage ;
— keep Fannie and Freddie public institutions ; their status before being privatized in 1968 ; and
— restructure the Fed democratically ; a far better solution is abolish it and let government control its own money ; use it responsibly for all Americans , not just the privileged few .
Other recommendations recognize no quick or easy solutions to problems this great .
Economist James Galbraith says borrowers need collateral .
A new Home Owners Loan Corporation to rewrite mortgages .
Manage rental conversions , and decide what degraded properties should be demolished .
Which ones to save and refurbish .
Set it up in communities under federal guidelines and do it quickly .
Help state and local governments strapped for cash .
Reestablish federal revenue sharing .
A National Infrastructure Bank making capital available for infrastructure .
Put people to work building it .
Protect seniors and near - retirees from wealth loss .
Extra Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid revenue will help .
Get money in the hands of people who ’ll spend it .
Address other crucial issues like energy conservation , reconstruction and renewable power .
Infrastructure overall .
Tuition help for students .
Another GI bill .
Credit card and mortgage interest rate caps .
Rescind anti-consumist laws like the misnamed 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act .
A boon for credit card companies and other businesses .
Unfairly burdensome to the public .
A whole range of other projects and ideas to redirect the economy away from speculative finance and militarism and toward high - return public investment .
Do it before it ’s too late .
Recognize that the present course is unsustainable .
Imagine a government working for everyone and not just the privileged few .
Imagine it not tolerating fraud and malfeasance .
Instead , Congress agreed to a “ bailout ” and passed a record $ 634 billion omnibus spending bill ( to run the government through March 6 , 2009 ) to include a record Pentagon budget ; $ 25 billion in low - interest auto industry loans ; maybe with no provision for repayment ; lifting a quarter - century ban on Atlantic and Pacific off - shore drilling ; billions more in earmarked pork ; and likely more coming later for the airlines and other endangered companies .
Taxpayers for Common Sense criticized the bill at the same time it noted that government “ bailout ” appropriations will reach about $ 1.2 trillion with the $ 700 billion Paulson scheme .
Others put the total above $ 1.5 trillion , and many say it ’s only for starters .
Paying “ hold - to - maturity ” prices compounds the fraud .
For securitized assets worth a fraction of full value .
Much of it pennies on the dollar , if anything .
Trillions of dollars of toxic ones .
All sorts of them .
Newly invented ones .
Structured finance and insurance .
Asset - backed securities .
Repackaged into marketable pools .
Sold to investors .
It ’s been done for decades but only recently so out of hand .
Greed and deregulation created an alphabet soup of levered - up , high - risk securitized assets .
Financial alchemy .
Largely outright fraud , including :
— collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , including auto loans , credit and corporate debt ;
— collateralized ( asset - backed home ) mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) ;
— commercial mortgage - backed securities ( CMBS ) ;
— mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and levered loans ;
— structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) ;
— special purpose vehicles ( SPVs ) ;
— pass - through securities ;
— credit and interest rate default swaps ;
— commercial paper and more ;
— repackaged arcane stuff most people do n’t understand ; even investors who bought them ; like eating a stew with no idea what ’s in it ; a recipe with no list of ingredients ; learning too late it ’s toxic and you ’re in trouble ;
Credit card companies as well from growing amounts of unrepayable credit card debt .
The auto industry already assured of a low - interest $ 25 billion loan ( or maybe handout ) for starters .
Airlines coming next .
Select homebuilders and troubled companies called too big to fail .
If they ’re too big to fail , says one observer , they ’re too big to exist .
EESA will give the treasury secretary near - carte blanche powers to conceal fraud and help the fraudsters , including his former company , Goldman Sachs , now in trouble .
Pick and choose among others .
Which will survive , and what less favored ones will go on the block at fire sale prices or disappear .
Today there are 9000 banks in the country .
In a decade , half or more of them may be gone .
Economist Michael Hudson calls EESA “ cash for trash ” and a “ giveaway , ” not a bailout .
A “ transfer of wealth to insiders . ” A financial coup d’etat .
The “ largest and most inequitable ( kind ) since the ( 19th century ) land giveaways to the railroad barons . ”
In this case , socializing losses to let fraudsters “ sell out all their bad bets . ”
Junk of all sorts : a stew of securitized assets , bad mortgages , car loans , credit card loans , student loans , anything for insiders stuck with too much of them .
A doomed scheme that will raise the debt level instead of lowering it .
Enrich fraudsters with taxpayer funds .
Stick the public with toxic junk .
Maybe buy time before more people and markets catch on , but , in the end , cripple the economy and erode industrial capitalism with it .
Hudson is justifiably angry given the amount of fraud and deceit .
The government - concocted scheme to whitewash it .
Reward criminals .
Harm most others , and wreck the country at the same time .
He says a “ kleptocratic class has taken over the economy to replace industrial capitalism ….’ banksers ’ ” for FDR and earlier condemned by Jefferson with this stinging comment :
“ I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs . ”
A half century later Lincoln said :
“ I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country …. corporations ( including bankers ) have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow , and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed . ”
Lincoln refused to pay bankers usurious rates to finance the Civil War and got Congress to pass the 1862 Legal Tender Act .
It empowered the US Treasury to issue “ greenbacks ” that were interest - free because government printed its own money .
When Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 , the “ Greenback Law ” was rescinded .
A new national banking act was passed , and the government once again had to pay interest to bankers .
On June 4 , 1963 , President Kennedy issued executive order ( EO ) 11110 giving the president authority to issue currency .
He ordered the treasury to begin printing “ United States ( Treasury ) Notes ” to replace “ Federal Reserve Notes . ”
He began a process to let government control its own money and no longer private bankers under the guise of the Federal Reserve .
Months later , Kennedy was assassinated .
Once Lyndon Johnson took office , he rescinded EO 11110 and reestablished the current system .
More on that below .
The Two Greatest Ever Financial Crimes – Today ’s Fraud and the 1913 Federal Reserve Act ’s Privatization of Money Creation
Most people think the Federal Reserve is a government agency , subject to its control .
It ’s sometimes mistakenly called a quasi - governmental decentralized central bank to disguise its real identity and purpose .
Its Eccles building headquarters compounds the subterfuge .
Below it ’s stripped away .
The Federal Reserve is a private for - profit banking cartel .
Owned and run by major banks and Wall Street in each of its 12 Districts .
It was created and operates in violation of Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution that states that Congress alone shall have the power to create money and regulate its value .
In 1935 , the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot constitutionally delegate this power to another authority , but , in fact it did .
On December 22 , 1913 , between 1:30 – 4:30 AM , the Federal Reserve Act was shepherded through a special Congressional Conference Committee .
Then voted on and passed the next day .
Two days before Christmas with many members gone and most others with no time to read or consider this momentous document .
By enacting this law , Congress and President Woodrow Wilson defrauded the public .
Wilson later said ( when it was too late to matter ) he made a mistake and “ unwittingly ruined my country . ”
This from a man who was an intellect .
Trained in the law .
A PhD in political science and president of Princeton University in his earlier years .
The Federal Reserve
Act gives private bankers the most important of all powers .
The one most of all that governments should never relinquish .
The authority to print money .
Control its supply .
Its price through the Fed Funds rate and how it influences the whole yield curve .
Loan it out for profit , and charge government interest on its own money .
It ’s later returned minus operating expenses and a guaranteed 6 % profit .
Taxpayers foot the bill .
An early and continuing example of wealth transfer from the public to powerful bankers .
Illegally sanctioned by Congress and the president .
The Fed literally creates money out of nothing .
Expands or contracts its supply as it wishes – with no government oversight or control .
Gold once backed it until Nixon closed the gold window in August 1971 .
Suspended dollar convertibility into the metal , and ended compliance with the Bretton Woods core provision .
The US dollar became fiat currency .
Mere paper .
Backed by nothing except the faith of the issuing authority .
Given today ’s crisis , that faith is fast eroding and is to blame for dollar weakness .
Mostly because of profligate policies by private bankers running the country ’s monetary policy for their own gain .
The grandest of grand thefts along with today ’s all - consuming fraud .
Backed by the full faith and credit of the government , and up to now at least , with most people none the wiser .
A Growing Public Response to the Crisis
For how long is the question given growing public anger and people expressing it publicly .
It has administration officials worried enough to order what Michel Chossudovsky wrote in his September 26 article titled “ Pre-election Militarization of the North American Homeland . ”
He cites an Army Times article saying that the 3rd Infantry ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team is coming home ( in October ) from Iraq as ( according to the Times ) “ an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
Perhaps with a manufactured incident as pretext .
To defend the homeland against ourselves .
Be deployed against dissent .
Erupting public anger .
On city streets like in Denver and St. Paul .
Displaying civil disobedience .
Defiance against fraud , deceit , illegal foreign wars , and nearly eight intolerable years under George Bush and a complicit Congress .
Capped by the current financial crisis touching everyone while government rewards crime and hangs its victims out to dry .
The 3rd Infantry ’s 1st Brigade is for combat .
It ’s not the National Guard or local police .
It ’s trained for war .
“ Equipped to kill people ” with potent weapons , and a last hurrah scheme may be planned to divert public attention from the financial crisis .
A “ terrorist ” attack with “ chemical , biological ” or other dangerous weapons .
A possible pretext for martial law at a time the administration and Congress are vulnerable .
When people are angry about Washington protecting the privileged .
Partnering with them in crime .
Defrauding the public and stifling dissent .
Moving one step closer to tyranny and away from silly notions about democracy .
Proving crime indeed does pay and awfully well on Wall Street .
“ It ’s the economy , stupid . ”
Theirs , not ours .

The Coronavirus outbreak is currently making headlines all over the world .
Luckily it has not spread worldwide and killed millions , but there ’s a very slight chance that this could happen in the near future .
It is going to be important to learn as many Covid - 19 facts as possible in order to stay safe and avoid the coronavirus disease .
One should be able to ascertain relevant Covid - 19 facts without the use of translation services , but the coronavirus disease , like any medical issues , can be difficult to understand .
Are you at risk of contagion from Covid - 19 ?
Can the coronavirus disease be transmitted by someone not showing any symptoms ?
To be forewarned is to be forearmed .
While the first wave of the global pandemic seems to be coming to an end , a second wave may be here in the near future .
Here are 10 Facts You Should Know About the Coronavirus
1. Coronaviruses are actually group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds
In humans , the viruses cause respiratory infections – including the common cold – which are typically mild .
Rarer forms such as SARS , MERS and the novel coronavirus can be lethal .
2 . In December 2019 a new Coronavirus , designated 2019 - nCoV , was identified in Wuhan , China
Wuhan is the capital city of China ’s Hubei province .
This happened after 41 people developed pneumonia without a clear cause .
This new COVID - 19 strain that has not been previously been identified in humans .
Little is known about it , although human - to - human transmission has been confirmed .
3 . The name “ Coronavirus ” is derived from the Latin word corona
Corona means crown or halo .
It refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles .
They have a fringe reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona .
4 . You ca n’t get the virus from drinking Corona
There are actually some people who think that that this the Coronavirus is related to the Mexican beer brand Corona .
It ’s not .
5 . More than 33 million million cases have been reported worldwide
Most of them are in China ’s Hubei province .
A man from Wuhan died in the Philippines on 2 February 2020 and Hong Kong reported its first death on 4 February 2020 .
The virus has spread to many Asian countries , as well as Australia , Europe , North America , the Middle East and South Africa .
The majority of cases outside China are in the USA ( where more than 7.3 million people have been infected ) , Spain , the UK , Italy , Russia , South Africa , Brazil , India , France & Germany .
In fact , people have been infected in 188 countries around the world .
To date more than 33 million people have been infected worldwide and more than 1 million people have died .
More than 24 milion people have recovered .
6 . There are various Coronavirus symptoms
According to the World Health Organisation , signs of infection include fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties .
In more severe cases , it can lead to pneumonia , SARS , kidney failure and even death .
The incubation period of the Coronavirus remains unknown .
Some sources say it could be between 10 and 14 days .
7 . It ’s likely that it ’s not as deadly as SARS
Some scientists believe that the new Coronavirus is not as deadly as SARS .
In case you forgot , SARS killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2002 - 2003 .
More than 300 people died in China ( where it originated ) .
MERS , which did not spread as widely , was more deadly , killing one - third of those it infected .
However , the new Coronavirus infection is more widespread than SARS in terms of case numbers in China .
8. Scientists are working on a Coronavirus vaccine
However , they have warned that one is unlikely to be available for mass distribution before 2021 .
9 . Measures have been taken to stop it from spreading
Chinese authorities have effectively sealed off Wuhan .
They have placed restrictions on travel to and from several other cities .
This has affected about 56 million people .
Many airlines have cancelled flights to China .
Some countries have even banned Chinese nationals from entering and have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan .
10 .
There are 671,669 confirmed Coronavirus cases in South Africa
The first case was reported early in March 2020 .
That number has risen to 671,669 .
16,586 people have died so far .
604,478 people have recovered .
This means that there are currently 50.605 active cases in the country .
Initially people who were infected were mostly people who traveled from Italy / China to South Africa , but this changed on the 17th of March 2020 when the first non-traveling South Africans tested positive for the virus .
South Africa have joined multiple countries that are on lockdown .
The lockdown came into effect at midnight on the 26th of March 2020 .
The list of countries that went on lockdown include the UK , India , Italy , Spain and Denmark .
South African is moving to level 1 of lockdown on the 21st of September 2020 .
International travel will resume from the 1st of October 2020 .
BONUS FACTS :
11 . Lockdowns have slowed down economic activity in various countries around the world .
This resulted in some quite significant job losses .
More than 3 million people have lost their jobs in South Africa .
This is bad .
South Africa ’s unemployment rate was already at nearly 30 % before a lockdown was imposed .
More than 121 million lost their jobs in India and more than 40 million people lost their jobs in the United States .
12 . The Dow Jones and the FTSE saw their biggest quarterly drops in the first three months of the year since 1987 .
This was definitely due to the reduction in economic activity globally .
13 . Demand for oil all but dried up as lockdowns across the world kept people inside .
The crude oil price had already been affected by a row between Opec , the group of oil producers , and Russia .
The Coronavirus pandemic drove the price down further .
14 . Production on TV Shows and Movie shows have been halted to stop the spread of the Coronavirus .
15 .
By the end of March 2020 , the global film industry suffered a revenue loss of +/- $ 7 billion due to the coronavirus and its impact on industries around the world .
Theaters closed , movie premieres were postponed , screenings were canceled and box offices were closed .
It ’s estimated that the movie industry lost another $ 10 billion dollars in revenue ( In April & May 2020 ) .
16 .
The entertainment industry as a whole could be starting at a loss of $ 160 billion over the next 5 years ( due to the effects of virus on the industry ) .
17 . Hollywood set a world record with movie ticket sales in 2019 .
Tinseltown generated more than $ 42 billion in ticket sales last year .
Hollywood is facing its worst financial year in 20 years .

If you did n’t know about it , the OnePlus 5 is the successor of the OnePlus 3/3T .
According to a leak that was released these days , the specs found on the upcoming flagship of the Chinese producer are quite interesting .
The report said that we wo n’t be getting an OnePlus 4 device , since number four means bad luck in China .
However , it seems that we are going to get a OnePlus 5 .
Features
Roland Quandt , from WinFuture , found the OnePlus A5000 on a public listing on MIIT , which is the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology .
He also found a number of technical details about the phone ’s frequencies on the list .
As such , we saw that the OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3 wear the model numbers A3000 , A3003 , while OnePlus is the A3010 .
Meanwhile , the OnePlus 2 has assigned the numbers A2001 , A2003 and A2005 .
Thus , a model with the number A5000 can only be the OnePlus 5 .
Sadly , we have no more details about the flagship of the company at this point .
However , according to some earlier rumors , the hardware that comes on the phone will rival the Galaxy S8 model .
Moreover , it seems that it will include an all - screen design , just like the one Samsung went for .
The phone should bring a 5.5 inches display that offers 2 K resolution , paired with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU .
Moreover , it will include 8 GB RAM , a dual - lens camera with 23 MP , topped with OIS ( optical image stabilization ) and optical zoom , plus a 3,000 mAh .
If all this is true , then indeed the OnePlus 5 is going to be an awesome device .
Up until now , OnePlus made no official announcements , but the best thing is to stay tuned .
Under these circumstances , it ’s probably better not to buy yourself a OnePlus 3T , since the new phone will arrive quite soon .

Dream of Life : An Intimate Portrait of Patti Smith
Dream of Life : A Meditation on Aging and Mortality
Patti Smith : Dream of Life is a film that ’s been 12 years in the making , a work that reveals an intimate , impressionistic portrait of a woman who is still blazing her own trail through late middle age , a woman who has seen and suffered great loss and who is perhaps the only major surviving connection from New York City ’s Beat generation , to the 1970s Manhattan art scene , to the birth of punk , to the present .
For the most part , the film has been described as a paean to life , resoundingly joyous and elegiac , warm and vibrantly present , a collage of moods and moments from one immensely talented woman ’s richly lived time on earth .
Patti Smith arrived in the big city 40 years ago and made her first residence in a room at The Chelsea Hotel , which in those days was also home to William S. Burroughs , Jefferson Airplane , Leonard Cohen , Janis Joplin , Sam Shepard , Arthur Miller , Robert Mapplethorpe and some of the Warhol crowd .
Patti soon became the muse , friend and partner of Robert Mapplethorpe , became a poet and then a performance poet and then an underground rock musician and then a rock star .
She left the stage and the city to settle down in Michigan as a wife and mother .
Then , following the 1994 death of her husband , the musician Fred “ Sonic ” Smith , she returned to New York City , to music , to poetry and to political activism .
Dream of Life is a beautiful and occasionally haunting artistic creation , a meditation on aging and mortality , an intimate study of an unusual kind of fame and the portrait of a genuinely remarkable person .
The film as received with great acclaim at The Sundance Film Festival last year , as well as in Berlin and all over the film - festival world .
The videos presented here include a short film comprised of number of vignettes from the longer documentary , the official trailer of Patti Smith : Dream of Life and a short film about the Chelsea Hotel .
Following the videos , biographic notes and a gallery of photographs about The Chelsea Hotel are presented .

Biographic Notes : A Portrait of One Woman ’s Richly Lived Time on Earth
Patti Smith : The Early Years
Patti Smith was born in Chicago in 1948 and grew up in Woodbury , New Jersey .
After graduating from high school , Patti did a brief stint as a factory worker , which convinced her to move to New York City to pursue a life in the arts .
Soon after her arrival , she connected with the young photographer Robert Mapplethorpe , whom she met while working at a book store .
This was a close friendship that she maintained until his death in 1989 .
In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started doing performance art .
When Smith returned to New York City , she lived in The Chelsea Hotel with Mapplethorpe , and they began frequenting the then fashionable Max ’s Kansas City and CBGB nightclubs .
She helped put New York ’s punk - rock landmark CBGB on the map , at a time when New York ’s East Village was becoming a burgeoning center of experimental artistic creativity .
She organized The Patti Smith Group and in 1975 released her debut album , Horses , to critical acclaim .
Produced by John Cale , the album was described as an original mixture of exhortatory rock & roll , Smith ’s poetry , vocal mannerisms inspired by Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison , and the band ’s energetically rudimentary playing .
In 1976 , Aerosmith producer Jack Douglas oversaw the Patti Smith Group ’s second album , Radio Ethiopia , and the result was a more bombastic guitar - heavy record , tempered by the title cut , the height of Smith ’s improvised free rock .
After an almost nine - year hiatus , Smith returned to recording with the 1988 album Dream of Life , the work of a more mellow , but still rebellious songwriter .
Smith ’s comeback album was co-produced by her husband , Fred “ Sonic ” Smith , with songs that included her call - to - arms , People Have the Power .
Grief and Mourning
In 1994 , her husband died of a heart attack at the age of 45 .
Just a month later , her younger brother ( and former road manager )
Todd , also died of a heart attack .
Her longtime friend and companion Robert Mapplethorpe had already died of AIDS in 1989 .
Determined to carry on as a tribute to the encouragement that her husband and brother had shown her before their passings , Smith performed a string of opening dates with Bob Dylan in late 1995 and issued the intensely personal Gone Again in 1996 .
The album offered a potent mix of songs about mourning and rebirth , reflecting Smith ’s belief that the beauty of life survives death .
But another eight years would pass by before her second artistic comeback , marked by a trio of acclaimed albums released in quick succession , which found her fighting her way out of a period of intense personal grief stemming from the loss of several of the most important people in her life .
The documentary Patti Smith : Dream of Life premiered at last year ’s Sundance Film Festival and is currently opening in theaters nationwide and in Europe .
Life in The Chelsea Hotel : A Documentary
People are always asking what it ’s like to live in The Chelsea Hotel .
Well , it ’s not always easy .
There are times when you can end up feeling felt like a fly caught in a spider ’s web , at risk of being eaten alive if you make the wrong move .

If denial is the first sign of addiction , then Drug Czar John Walters is hooked to the gills .
He ’s addicted to targeting and arresting marijuana consumers , and he ’ll do and say anything to keep this irrational and punitive policy in place .
Speaking earlier this month on C - Span , the reigning Czar stretched his usual deceit to outrageous new heights .
Responding to a question from the Marijuana Policy Project ’s Dan Bernath , Walters flatly denied the charge that over 800,000 Americans are arrested annually for violating pot laws .
“ We did n’t arrest 800,000 marijuana users , ” Walters proclaimed .
“ That ’s [ a ] lie . ”
If only it were .
According to data released yesterday in the FBI ’s annual Uniform Crime Report , police in 2007 arrested over 872,000 US citizens — that ’s nearly one out of every two Americans busted for illicit drugs — for weed .
( The raw data is available from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation here and here . )
That figure is a five percent increase over the total number of Americans busted in 2006 .
It ’s more than three times the number of citizens charged with pot violations sixteen years ago .
Of those arrested in 2007 , 89 percent — some 775,000 Americans — were charged with simple pot possession , not trafficking , cultivation , or sale .
( By comparison , 27 percent of those arrested for heroin and cocaine offenses were charged with sales . )
Three out of four were under age 30 ; one in four were 18 - years - old or younger .
The FBI ’s tally is the highest marijuana arrest total ever - reported in law enforcement history .
If this pace continues , annual arrests for pot will surpass one million per year by 2010 .
But to hear America ’s top drug cop tell it few , if any , citizens are ever arrested for pot possession , and absolutely no one goes to jail for breaking marijuana laws .
“ The fact is today , people do n’t go to jail for the possession of marijuana , ” Walters alleged on C - Span .
“ Finding somebody in jail or prison for possession of marijuana is like finding a unicorn .
It does n’t exist . ”
Not true says the U.S. Department of Justice ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics , which reported last year in black and white — perhaps the Drug Czar is reading impaired — that 12.7 percent of state inmates and 12.4 percent of federal inmates incarcerated for drug abuse violations are serving time for marijuana offenses .
Combining these percentages with separate U.S. Department of Justice statistics on the total number of state and federal drug prisoners suggests that , at a minimum , there are now about 33,655 state inmates and 10,785 federal inmates behind bars for marijuana offenses .
( The report failed to include estimates on the percentage of inmates incarcerated in county or local jails for pot-related offenses , nor did it take into account the number of inmates serving time for violating the terms of their marijuana - related probation , such as those who submitted a " dirty " urine to their parole officer . )
No matter how one slices it , that ’s a lot of unicorns .
It also begs the question :
Why does the Drug Czar feel the need to go to such absurd lengths to hide this overt outgrowth of American drug policy ?
After all , the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy typically issue chest - thumping press releases when they achieve record busts for offenses involving cocaine , heroin , and methamphetamine .
Why then do they shy away from making similar proclamations for pot ?
Perhaps it ’s because , deep down , even the Drug Czar knows that the use of cannabis does not pose anywhere near the health and safety threat as does the use of other intoxicants , including alcohol , and that most Americans — rightly — would be outraged to learn that our nation ’s so - called war on drugs is really just an assault on young adults caught with small bags of weed .
The Best of Paul Armentano
Broadcaster showed Georgian forces attacking South Ossetia , claimed it was Russians attacking Gori
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , August 12 , 2008
CNN is airing misleading footage of the war between Georgia and Russia , skewing public opinion in favor of the Georgians , according to a Russia Today cameraman interviewed this morning .
The Russia Today satellite TV company aired the interview on its English language news channel but the story is yet to appear on the Internet or in any other news outlet .
The Russian cameraman charged that CNN had used his footage of Georgian forces attacking Russian civilians in Tskhinvali , the provincial capital of South Ossetia , but then claimed it showed Russians attacking Georgians in the Georgian town of Gori .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The Georgian assault on Tskhinvali , described as an act of genocide and a war crime by Russian officials and other eyewitnesses , led to the slaughter of at least 2,000 civilians .
The fact that Georgia , backed by the U.S. and Israel , were responsible for the provocation that led to the Russian response , has been buried by the majority of western corporate media .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Western media bias to skew popular opinion in favor of the U.S. and NATO client state Georgia was evident from the very start of the conflict .
As we reported yesterday , a prime example of media bias in shielding Georgia from responsibility for the carnage is the fact that news outlets like the BBC continue to report that thousands of civilians were killed in Georgia , with the obvious inference being that these are victims of the Russian onslaught .
But these victims were not killed in Georgia , they were killed in Ossetia – by Georgian forces .
As the Chimes of Freedom Blog elaborates , “ While the Ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the BBC neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of Ossetia showing the destruction caused by the Georgian shelling of the breakaway republic .
All we are getting is one - sided reports of the destruction being caused by the Russians . ”
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev this morning ordered an immediate halt to Russia ’s military operations against Georgia .
“ The purpose of the operation has been achieved … .
The security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored , ” Interfax quoted him as saying .
UPDATE : Russia Today has now posted the following on their website and uploaded a video .
CNN accused of using misleading war footage
American broadcaster CNN has been accused of using misleading footage in their coverage of the conflict in South Ossetia .
A Russian cameraman says footage of wrecked tanks and ruined buildings , which was purported to be the town of Gori , was in fact the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali .
Gori was said to be about to fall under the control of the Russian army but the cameraman says the video was actually shot in Tskhinvali , which had been flattened by Georgian shelling .
Aleksandr Zhukov , from the Russiya Al - Yaum channel , said : “ When we arrived and news came that Gori was being shelled , I saw my footage .
I said : that ’s not Gori !
That ’s Tskhinvali .
Having crawled through the length and breadth of Tskhinvali , I do n’t need much to tell from which point this or that footage was recorded .
I can swear in front of any tribunal .
I can point at this location on the map of the town , because I and the cameraman of the Rossiya channel videotaped that . ”

Nick Saber is n’t happy now .
Monday afternoon , after lunch , Nick came back from lunch to find out that he could n’t get into his Gmail account .
Further , he could n’t get into anything that Google made ( beside search ) where his account credentials once worked .
When attempting to log in , Nick got a single line message :
Sorry , your account has been disabled . [?]
That ’s it .
Nick sent a message or three to Google for support .
He got back this :
Thank you for your report .
We ’ve completed our investigation .
Because our
investigation was inconclusive , we are unable to return your account at
this time .
At Google we take the privacy and security of our users very
seriously .
For this reason , we ’re unable to reveal any further information
about this account .
And that ’s it .
Suddenly , Nick ca n’t access his Gmail account , ca n’t open Google Talk ( our office IM app ) , ca n’t open Picasa where his family pictures are , ca n’t use his Google Docs , and oh by the way , he paid for additional storage .
So , this is a paying customer with no access to the Google empire .
If he was doing something wrong / illegal / invalid , they might ’ve said so ( not thinking that he was ) .
If he had been hacked , would n’t that be something vaguely apparent ?
I dunno , but it seems like that ’d be the way .
So , what happens now ?
What does Nick do ?
He ’s sent a bunch of emails .
But now what ?
Locked out of ALL of Google ’s apps , the apps that I praise daily , the apps where Julien Smith and I are writing a book .
Should we be doing that ?
I did n’t see a problem until this .
What if we ’re the next Nick ?
What ’s your take ?
And what do you think of hands off customer service in this case ?
** UPDATE : Nick got back in after quite a lot of work .
** UPDATE : Jay explains in the comments how this is supposed to work .
Mind you , I ’ve used Google for years as a non-paying customer , so Jay ’s advice would n’t help .
Right ?
**UPDATE : Google Gets Back to Nick .
We ’ll be talking about some ideas based on this in the next newsletter .
For those who still can’t grasp the concept of white privilege , or who are looking for some easy - to - understand examples of it , perhaps this list will help .
White privilege is when you can get pregnant at seventeen like Bristol Palin and everyone is quick to insist that your life and that of your family is a personal matter , and that no one has a right to judge you or your parents , because “ every family has challenges , ” even as black and Latino families with similar “ challenges ” are regularly typified as irresponsible , pathological and arbiters of social decay .
White privilege is when you can call yourself a “ fuckin ’ redneck , ” like Bristol Palin ’s boyfriend does , and talk about how if anyone messes with you , you 'll “ kick their fuckin ' ass , ” and talk about how you like to “ shoot sh*t ” for fun , and still be viewed as a responsible , all - American boy ( and a great son - in - law to be ) rather than a thug .
White privilege is when you can attend five different colleges in six years like Sarah Palin did ( one of which you basically failed out of , then returned to after making up some coursework at a community college ) , and no one questions your intelligence or commitment to achievement , whereas a person of color who did this would be viewed as unfit for college , and probably someone who only got in in the first place because of affirmative action .
White privilege is when you can claim that being mayor of a town smaller than most medium - sized colleges , and then Governor of a state with about the same number of people as the lower fifth of the island of Manhattan , makes you ready to potentially be president , and people do n’t all piss on themselves with laughter , while being a black U.S. Senator , two - term state Senator , and constitutional law scholar , means you ’re “ untested . ”
White privilege is being able to say that you support the words “ under God ” in the pledge of allegiance because “ if it was good enough for the founding fathers , it ’s good enough for me , ” and not be immediately disqualified from holding office -- since , after all , the pledge was written in the late 1800s and the “ under God ” part was n’t added until the 1950s -- while if you 're black and believe in reading accused criminals and terrorists their rights ( because the Constitution , which you used to teach at a prestigious law school , requires it ) , you are a dangerous and mushy liberal who is n't fit to safeguard American institutions .
White privilege is being able to be a gun enthusiast and not make people immediately scared of you .
White privilege is being able to have a husband who was a member of an extremist political party that wants your state to secede from the Union , and whose motto is “ Alaska first , ” and no one questions your patriotism or that of your family , while if you 're black and your spouse merely fails to come to a 9/11 memorial so she can be home with her kids on the first day of school , people immediately think she ’s being disrespectful .
White privilege is being able to convince white women who do n’t even agree with you on any substantive issue to vote for you and your running mate anyway , because suddenly your presence on the ticket has inspired confidence in these same white women , and made them give your party a “ second look . ”
White privilege is being able to fire people who did n’t support your political campaigns and not be accused of abusing your power or being a typical politician who engages in favoritism , while being black and merely knowing some folks from the old - line political machines in Chicago means you must be corrupt .
White privilege is when you can take nearly twenty - four hours to get to a hospital after beginning to leak amniotic fluid , and still be viewed as a great mom whose commitment to her children is unquestionable , and whose " next door neighbor " qualities make her ready to be VP , while if you 're a black candidate for president and you let your children be interviewed for a few seconds on TV , you 're irresponsibly exploiting them .
White privilege is being able to give a 36 minute speech in which you talk about lipstick and make fun of your opponent , while laying out no substantive policy positions on any issue at all , and still manage to be considered a legitimate candidate , while a black person who gives an hour speech the week before , in which he lays out specific policy proposals on several issues , is still criticized for being too vague about what he would do if elected .
White privilege is being able to attend churches over the years whose pastors say that people who voted for John Kerry or merely criticize George W. Bush are going to hell , and that the U.S. is an explicitly Christian nation and the job of Christians is to bring Christian theological principles into government , and who bring in speakers who say the conflict in the Middle East is God ’s punishment on Jews for rejecting Jesus , and everyone can still think you ’re just a good church - going Christian , but if you ’re black and friends with a black pastor who has noted ( as have Colin Powell and the U.S. Department of Defense ) that terrorist attacks are often the result of U.S. foreign policy and who talks about the history of racism and its effect on black people , you ’re an extremist who probably hates America .
White privilege is not knowing what the Bush Doctrine is when asked by a reporter , and then people get angry at the reporter for asking you such a “ trick question , ” while being black and merely refusing to give one - word answers to the queries of Bill O’Reilly means you ’re dodging the question , or trying to seem overly intellectual and nuanced .
White privilege is being able to go to a prestigious prep school , then to Yale and then Harvard Business school , and yet , still be seen as just an average guy ( George W. Bush ) while being black , going to a prestigious prep school , then Occidental College , then Columbia , and then to Harvard Law , makes you " uppity , " and a snob who probably looks down on regular folks .
White privilege is being able to graduate near the bottom of your college class ( McCain ) , or graduate with a C average from Yale ( W. ) and that 's OK , and you 're cut out to be president , but if you 're black and you graduate near the top of your class from Harvard Law , you can't be trusted to make good decisions in office .

Pelosi , a California Democrat who reversed her outright opposition to expanded offshore drilling earlier this month , said the oil industry and its allies in Congress must also agree to royalties on oil profits to fund the development of renewable energy resources .
She criticized President George W. Bush and other Republicans for presenting offshore drilling as an answer to the recent rise in U.S. gasoline prices , saying expanded drilling would not affect prices for a decade and then only by a small degree .
“ I do n’t think that ’s a good alternative .
But if they can prove that it is , and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer ... then we have something to talk about , ” the top congressional Democrat told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” program .
“ I ’m prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach , ” she said .
“ Include that ( drilling ) .
Let it compete and see where we come down on it , and if that in fact is a good alternative , then that is something that we should do . ”
Congress is scheduled to return from its summer recess next month and Democrats in the House of Representatives have offered the prospect of legislation that could give oil companies drilling access to more offshore areas .
CHANGED POSITIONS
By moving to open additional federal waters to exploration , Democrats hope to narrow differences with Republicans on how to address public concerns about energy costs ahead of November ’s presidential and congressional elections .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has changed his position on the issue by saying he would be willing to consider new offshore drilling as a part of comprehensive energy legislation .
His Republican challenger , John McCain , also switched his position and called for opening most U.S. waters to drilling .
Democrats have called for releasing supplies from the U.S. emergency oil stockpile , increasing drilling in an Alaskan oil reserve already open to exploration and requiring utilities to generate a portion of their electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind energy .
The legislation would also seek to rein in excessive market speculation blamed by many critics for driving up oil and gasoline prices .
Energy prices surged to record highs earlier this year but have since fallen back sharply .
House Republicans have said the Democratic proposal falls short of their party ’s legislation to open new areas to drilling , including Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Bush , in his latest weekly radio address , said Democrats were simply trying to block expanded offshore drilling by “ bringing up a bill that is designed to fail . ”
Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina , the House majority whip , told CNN on Sunday that a separate up - or - down vote on expanded offshore drilling is unlikely when Congress returns next month .
“ There ’s going to be a vote on an energy program of which I think offshore drilling will be a part , ” he said .

Marine Corps Statement
MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII , Oahu --
The Marine Corps has disciplined two Marines for their involvement in a video that showed a Marine throwing a puppy off a cliff while on patrol in Iraq .
Lance Corporal David Motari received Non-Judicial Punishment from the commanding officer of 1st Battalion , 3d Marine Regiment and is being processed for separation from the Marine Corps for his role in the episode , which gained international attention March 3 after the video was posted on the Internet .
Sergeant Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion , Weapons and Field Training Battalion , Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego , also received Non-Judicial Punishment .
The results of Non-Judicial Punishment are not releaseable according to the Privacy Act .
The Marine Corps conducted a thorough investigation as soon as it learned of the event and acted as swiftly as possible .
The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated .
The vast majority of Marines conduct their duties with honor and compassion that makes American people proud .
On Sunday Michel Chossudovsky reasoned that the US - backed attack on the capital of South Ossetia was designed to produce a humanitarian crisis .
On Wednesday , President Bush declared that the US military would spearhead a humanitarian mission to Georgia , which the Russians had better not bother .
Now Chossudovsky is concluding that the South Ossetia operation , by putting Russian troops in check , is one last step in the encirclement of Iran .
All pieces are practically in place for a blockade , including plans to use a warship from Brazil .
The anti-Iran coalition , which is global and bi-partisan , will be considering the use of pre-emptive nuclear strike .
And because of Iran ’s strained relations with the International Atomic Energy Agency , which continues to express worry about Iran ’s “ transparency and full disclosure , ” Iran now finds itself not only encircled but virtually friendless .
Markets , they say , hate uncertainty .
Since this is what WWIII looks like , Dow futures this morning were up .
But speaking of “ transparency and full disclosure ” where is the international agency that will demand an answer to this question : were the civilian populations of South Ossetia and Georgia deliberately sacrificed to achieve these military ends ?
Professor Kevin Depew was discussing the continuing woes of housing as well as soup lines in today 's Five Things You Need to Know : Mortgage Woes Stubbornly Persist .
Let 's consider point number five , Soup Lines .
Where Are the Soup Lines ?
In response to a recent piece on The Modern Stealth Depression , some of the outraged letters I received asked how in the world someone could claim we are entering a new depression when there are no soup lines , no starving people in the street .
Well , the simple answer is that 's why it 's a stealth depression .
Despite the rapid transfer of information across the globe , we still have a way of only seeing what we want to see .
According to the Akron Beacon Journal , demand for food from the Akron - Canton Regional Foodbank increased by 14 % year - over - year in the first six months .
At the same time , agencies that receive food are reporting an increase of 20 % in the number of people being served .
Food distribution at the food bank increased by 7 % in the second quarter alone .
The figures are out there , you just have to dig beneath Paris Hilton residential ad spoofs to find them .
In the Sarasota , Florida Herald Tribune today there 's an interview with Vicki Escarra , president and CEO of the nation 's largest food bank network .
The network feeds 25 million people annually through food banks around the country .
Escarra says a survey of the network 's 200 food banks in January showed a 20 % increase in demand over the prior year .
Escarra estimates there are 35 million Americans " living without knowing consistently where their next meal will come from . "
Escarra said she expects this to be " pretty severe for the next 18 months at least . "
Ohio Food Bank Needs Rising
Demand for food from the Akron - Canton Regional Foodbank is increasing rapidly .
The food bank released statistics Wednesday showing that for the first six months of this year , compared with the same period last year , food distributions increased by 14 percent .
At the same time , agencies that receive food are reporting an increase of 20 percent in the number of people being served .
Food distribution at the food bank increased by 7 percent in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter , said Dan Flowers , president and CEO of the food bank .
At the current rate of distributing food to area shelters and food cupboards , Flowers said , the agency could distribute 14 million pounds of food this year , compared with 12 million in 2007 .
As a result , Flowers said this is " a historic and unprecedented time in the history of the anti-hunger movement . "
Sutton , who has volunteered at the food bank , spoke of the " newly poor " who are receiving help from food banks .
She said she has heard of people who " used to be donors to the food bank and now are in need of services . "
" Almost daily , the number of people seeking food assistance continues to rise , " Flowers said .
For more on the food bank , go to the Akron - Canton Regional Foodbank .
Insight Into Hungry U.S .
Vicki Escarra , president and CEO of the nation 's largest food bank network , stopped in Sarasota on Wednesday on a weeklong tour of Florida .
Escarra left her job as vice president of customer service at Delta Air Lines and took charge of America 's Second Harvest in 2006 .
The network feeds 25 million people annually through food banks around the country .
It distributes 2.2 billion pounds of food , enough to make it comparable to the largest grocery chains in the nation .
Q: How much has demand at food banks increased nationally , and who is visiting them ?
ESCARRA : In January we surveyed our 200 food banks and demand was up 20 percent over last year .
We 're seeing more and more people visiting food banks for the first time because they 've lost their jobs or they 're not getting raises .
They can't afford vegetables or protein , the essentials of a good diet .
Most of the people who come to food banks are on food stamps , but those are only $ 3 per person a day .
Q: On the network 's Web site , there is a lot of talk about " food insecurity . "
What does that mean ?
ESCARRA : There are 35 million Americans living without knowing consistently where their next meal will come from .
I think that 's pretty stunning .
Where Are the Soup Lines ?
Stealth Depression
On 28 August , 1963 , Martin Luther King delivered his magnificent " I have a dream speech " on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington .
Below is the full text of his speech .
I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation .
Five score years ago , a great American , in whose symbolic shadow we stand , signed the Emancipation Proclamation .
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice .
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity .
America has given the Negro people a bad cheque which has come back marked ' insufficient funds '
But 100 years later , we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free .
One hundred years later , the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination .
One hundred years later , the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity .
One hundred years later , the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land .
And so we 've come here today to dramatize an appalling condition .
In a sense we 've come to our nation 's capital to cash a cheque .
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence , they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir .
This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of " Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of colour are concerned .
Instead of honouring this sacred obligation , America has given the Negro people a bad cheque which has come back marked " insufficient funds . "
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt .
We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation .
So we 've come to cash this cheque - a cheque that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice .
Sweltering summer ... of discontent
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now .
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism .
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice .
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood .
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God 's children .
The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment .
This sweltering summer of the Negro 's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality .
1963 is not an end , but a beginning .
Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual .
There will be neither rest nor tranquillity in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights .
The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges .
But there is something that I must say to my people , who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice : in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds .
Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred .
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline .
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence .
Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force .
The marvellous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people , for many of our white brothers , as evidenced by their presence here today , have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny .
They have come to realise that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom .
We can not walk alone .
And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead .
We can not turn back .
Trials and tribulations
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights : " When will you be satisfied ? "
We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality .
We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies , heavy with the fatigue of travel , cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities .
We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro 's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one .
We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating " For Whites Only " .
We can not be satisfied and we will not be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote .
No , no , we are not satisfied , and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream .
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave - owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations .
Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells .
Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality .
You have been the veterans of creative suffering .
Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive .
Go back to Mississippi , go back to Alabama , go back to Georgia , go back to Louisiana , go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities , knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed .
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair .
I say to you today , my friends , that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment , I still have a dream .
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream .
The dream I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed - we hold these truths to be self - evident : that all men are created equal .
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave - owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood .
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi , a desert state , sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression , will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice .
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character .
I have a dream today !
I have a dream that one day , down in Alabama , with its vicious racists , with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification ; one day right there in Alabama little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers .
I have a dream today !
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted , every hill and mountain shall be made low , the rough places will be made plain , and the crooked places will be made straight , and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together .
This is our hope .
This is the faith that I will go back to the South with .
With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope .
With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood .
With this faith we will be able to work together , to pray together , to struggle together , to go to jail together , to stand up for freedom together , knowing that we will be free one day .
This will be the day , this will be the day when all of God 's children will be able to sing with a new meaning : " My country , 'tis of thee , sweet land of liberty , of thee I sing .
Land where my fathers died , land of the pilgrim 's pride , from every mountainside , let freedom ring . "
And if America is to be a great nation , this must become true .
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire .
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York .
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania !
Let freedom ring from the snow - capped Rockies of Colorado .
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California .
But not only that .
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia .
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee .
Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi , from every mountainside , let freedom ring !
And when this happens , when we allow freedom to ring , when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet , from every state and every city , we will be able to speed up that day when all of God 's children , black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics , will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual : " Free at last !
Free at last !
thank God Almighty , we are free at last ! "

Amazing 5,000 - year - old skeletons laid on bed of flowers found in Sahara - proving desert was once green and lush
A tiny woman and two children were laid to rest on a bed of flowers 5,000 years ago in what is now the barren Sahara Desert .
Researchers discovered the slender arms of the youngsters still extended to the woman in a perpetual embrace .
The remarkable cemetery is providing clues to two civilisations who lived there , a thousand years apart , when the region was moist and green .
Proof of life :
The three skeletons buried at Gobero in the Sahara desert
The body of one of the children , an 11 - year - old girl Tenerian girl buried wearing an upper - arm bracelet carved from the tusk of a hippo
Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago and colleagues were searching for the remains of dinosaurs in the African country of Niger when they came across the startling find .
Some 200 graves of humans were found during fieldwork at the site in 2005 and 2006 , as well as remains of animals , large fish and crocodiles .
' Everywhere you turned , there were bones belonging to animals that do n't live in the desert , ' said Sereno .
' I realized we were in the green Sahara . '
The graveyard , uncovered by hot desert winds , is near what would have been a lake at the time people lived there .
It 's in a region called Gobero , hidden away in Niger 's forbidding Tenere Desert , known to Tuareg nomads as a ' desert within a desert . '
The human remains dated from two distinct populations that lived there during wet times , with a dry period in between .
The triple burial contained a woman and two children , their limbs intertwined
The first group , known as the Kiffian , hunted wild animals and speared huge perch with harpoons .
They colonised the region when the Sahara was at its wettest , between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago .
The researchers said the Kiffians were tall , sometimes reaching well over 6ft .
The second group lived in the region between 7,000 and 4,500 years ago .
The Tenerians were smaller and had a mixed economy of hunting , fishing and cattle herding .
Their burials often included jewellery or ritual poses .
For example , one girl had an upper - arm bracelet carved from a hippo tusk .
An adult Tenerian male was buried with his skull resting on part of a clay vessel ; another adult male was interred seated on the shell of a mud turtle .
Pollen remains show the woman and two children were buried on a bed of flowers .
The researchers preserved the group just as they had been for thousands of years .
' At first glance , it 's hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place , ' said team member Chris Stojanowski , a bioarchaeologist from Arizona State University .
Zooarchaeologist Helene Jousse holds up a belly plate from a soft - shelled turtle found in a Tenerian garbage dump ... in the desert
Stojanowski said ridges on the thigh bone of one Kiffian man show he had huge leg muscles , ' which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active , strenuous lifestyle .
The Kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy - it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition . '
On the other hand , ridges on a Tenerian male were barely visible .
' This man 's life was less rigorous , perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies , ' Stojanowski said .
Paleontologist Paul Sereno stabilizes the nearly perfectly preserved skull of the Tenerian woman
Paleontologist Paul Sereno is seen with the jaw of the Eocarcharia dinops - a meat - eating dinosaur that lived on the Sahara
Helene Jousse , a zooarchaeologist from the Museum of Natural History in Vienna , Austria , reported that animal bones found in the area were from types common today in the Serengeti in Kenya , such as elephants , giraffes , hartebeests and warthogs .
The finds are detailed in the journal PLoS One and the September issue of National Geographic Magazine .
While the Sahara is desert today , a small difference in Earth 's orbit once brought seasonal monsoons farther north , wetting the landscape with lakes with lush margins and drawing animals and people .
Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan qualified Friday for a November showdown with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , collecting the signatures needed to get on the ballot as an independent candidate for Congress .
" We 're very excited , " said Sheehan , 51 , the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who is well - known for her protest outside President Bush 's Texas ranch .
" Now we have to get organized and regroup . "
Republican Dana Walsh and Libertarian Philip Berg will join Pelosi and Sheehan on the Nov. 4 ballot .
The collection of signatures by Sheehan 's campaign was more exciting than usual .
On Wednesday , the campaign was well short of the 10,198 signatures needed to get on the ballot after San Francisco elections officials found that more than 40 percent of the people who signed were n't registered in the city 's Eighth Congressional District .
Sheehan 's supporters redoubled their efforts to collect enough signatures to beat the 5 p.m .
Friday deadline , ultimately turning in more than 17,000 signatures to ensure that she qualified .
" It was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures , " Sheehan said from her Mission Street headquarters , where more than 100 supporters gathered to celebrate .
" The last couple of days , I 've been checking the registrations myself on the computer . "
With her ballot spot guaranteed , Sheehan can focus on the fall campaign , where she will challenge Pelosi from the left , slamming the speaker for refusing to start impeachment proceedings against President Bush and not taking a stronger stance against the war in Iraq .
" The next part is going to be exciting , " she said .
" I want at least one debate with all four candidates so that Nancy Pelosi has to answer for her record . "
Sheehan , a former Vacaville resident who lives in the Mission District , became involved in the anti-war movement in 2004 , after her son Casey was killed while serving in Iraq .
A year later she founded Gold Star Families for Peace and spoke out against the war in Iraq .
For months , she stayed at " Camp Casey , " an area near President Bush 's Crawford , Texas , ranch where she and other peace activists demonstrated against Bush and the war .
Sheehan will be the longest of longshots in her attempt to oust Pelosi , one of the nation 's best - known and most powerful Democrats .
While Sheehan said Friday that she has raised more than $ 300,000 for the race , Pelosi had collected more than $ 2.3 million by the end of June and had $ 455,138 in the bank .
Sheehan 's campaign also missed the July 15 filing deadline for her most recent federal campaign statement , which Sheehan blamed on the frantic efforts to qualify her campaign for the ballot .
" One of the first things we need to do is hire a professional accountant to deal with those reports , " she said .

ユーザー視点の新機 能
個人的に不満に思っていたところを改善しました。
anything - sourcesがシンボルのリストを取れるようになった
anything情報源はanything-c-source-*の形の変数に代入するのが慣例となっています。今までは
( setq anything - sources ( list anything - c - source - buffers anything - c- source - recentf ) ) )
のように巨大リストを構成していましたが、次のようにシンボルのリストも取れるようになりました。
( setq anything - sources '( anything - c - source - buffers anything - c- source - recentf ) ) こうすることでdescribe-variableしたときにどの情報源がセットされているのかが一目でわかります。おまけに、anything-c-source-*の定義を変更してもanything-sourcesを更新する必要がありません。
anything - input-idle-delayでdelayedではない情報源も遅延させる 今までは重い処理をする情報源には( delayed)をつけることで処理を遅延させてきました。しかし、軽い処理でもanything-sourcesの長さが増えていくにつれて処理が重くなってしまいます。塵も積もれば山となる、というわけで、( delayed)ではない情報源についても遅延時間を設定できるようになりました。
僕 は0.2秒に設定しています。キーボード打鍵間より少し長く、なおかつもっさり感がありません。
anything - input-idle-delay秒間入力がないときに*anything*バッファを更新します。さらに
( anything - idle - delay - anything - input - idle - delay ) 秒後 に( delayed ) な情報源を処理します 。
anything - resume アクション実行後に * anything *バッファが閉じられますが、再び同じ候補を表示させるには再度パターンを入力しなければなりませんでした。そこでM-x anything -resumeを実行することで直前の*anything*バッファを復元させることができます。
anything-c-moccurで他のマッチ箇所に移動するときに重宝しています。
デフォルト以外のアクションを選択する 候補を選択すると、デフォルトの（action属性の最初のもの）アクションが実行されます。他のアクションを実行する場合はTabでアクションを選択する必要があります。しかし、実行するアクションがわかりきっている場合は面倒です。そこで、候補選択のところからデフォルトの以外のアクションを実行できるようにしました。
M-x anything - select - 2nd - action で2番目のアクション（( nth 1 action ) なるアクション）を実行します。同様に anything - select - 3rd- action 、anything - select - 4th - action 、 anything - select - nth- action もあります 。
anything - mapの空いたキーに割り当てると便利です。
たとえば、行末でC-eを押したときに2番目のアクションを実行するにはこんなコマンドを作成します。行末のC-eは意味がないのでそこを利用したものです。 ( defun anything - select - 2nd-action-or-end- of- line ( ) ( interactive ) ( if ( eolp ) ( anything - select - nth - action 1 ) ( end - of - line ) ) )
If you have not catch up on the history already go read this decent NYT article first .
The war is not a surprise to anyone and this explain the level of readiness of the Russian .
Do not pay too much attention to the rhetoric on both side .
Georgia may be a democracy but more in the Russian sense than what the founding father had in mind when they wrote the US constitution .
The most important element that western media tend to forget is that Gerogia started this round .
On August 7 they fired rounds of heavy artillery , large - caliber mortar and Glad multiple launch rockets on Tskhinvali .
A clear and brutal act of aggression that begged a response from Russia .
The real question is why ?
Ossetia is an impoverished piece of land with no natural resources .
The province has been more or less autonomous for a while and short of an ethical cleansing impossible for the Georgian to control .
I try to never underestimate the stupidity of politicians that use patriotic rhetoric but provoking Russia is pure suicide .
It is a loosing move for Georgia from the beginning .
There must be more to it so lets zoom out a bit .
So where does the move come from ?
The players are Europe and the US .
Europe has a strong interest in keeping peace around its borders and want to avoid confrontation with Russia at all price .
This leave the US as the architect .
I can see two possible reasons for this move .
The Russian drew the red line on Georgia and Ukraine .
After the war is over the US will have the green light to come protect " the peace " .
Georgia will become a direct NATO / US protectorate even if they will not become an official member in the short run .
What is here for Georgia ?
Reconstruction money , a lot of it .
This will be a god send for the ruling party .
Also they will clearly move out of the Russian sphere of influence .
For the US ?
A big finger at Russia next to their border , but more importantly the control of a chock point .
Just look at the map of the region .
It will help isolate Russia from the middle east and surround Iran even more .
The US will also be able to personally protect the pipelines in the region .
Also this crisis will reinvigorate the importance of NATO in Europe .
Europe as lost interest in NATO after the cold war was over .
There is no more direct utility for it , therefore no good reason to accept US military dominance inside Europe .
But with Russia showing its claws again Europe will probably reinforce their commitment to the alliance .
The second reason might be .
Military actions in Iran , in the form of air strikes or a maritime blockade , are becoming more and more likely as the electoral victory of Obama seem unavoidable .
There is two possibilities here .
Just distracting the Russian or creating a bargaining piece .
We do not flood Georgia with advanced weapons system like we did in Afghanistan if you let us fuck Iran .
The timing is also critical .
The Olympic game makes it easy to push all the action under the radar .
More importantly ; China , the other potential player in Iran , will have its hands tied for the duration of the games .
If this is about Iran things will be moving very fast to keep taking advantage of the game .
Our President ’s Personal Health Matte rs All voting US citizens will have to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of John McCain and Barack Obama when voting November 4 , 2008 to choose the President of the United States .
The personal health of these two candidates will play a determining role in their performance over the next four to eight years .
This grueling job requires the highest level of physical and mental fitness .
A serious disability or the death of our national leader during office would disrupt the function of our government and require the vice - president to take office .
The president ’s personal health will affect his ( or her ) policies and decisions .
Our views are biased by our own personal habits .
More to the point , people have a hard time seeing beyond their own dinner plates .
A president interested and knowledgeable about good diet and exercise habits , not only incorporates this wisdom into his own life , but will also share this understanding with others .
The impact will be as far reaching as national healthcare ( health insurance ) , the USDA , the FDA , the EPA , the diet of the military , the school lunch programs , the pharmaceutical industry , the global impact of livestock on the environment , health education , and your own personal doctors ’ practice of medicine .
For all the above reasons you need to be well aware of , and take into serious consideration , the personal health and health habits of McCain and Obama when you cast your vote .
I consider it to be my obligation to my newsletter subscribers , and especially to my patients , to share with you the facts that I have gathered about our candidates and my opinion as to how their health and habits may affect their ability to serve you and the rest of our nation .
The Candidates ’ Personal Heath Habits Their Diet : McCain : February 25 , 2008 the New Yorker magazine describes John McCain 's campaign bus as “ stocked with Dunkin ’ Donuts and Coke , the staples of the McCain diet . ”
He grabs a candy bar or a bag of potato chips while he engages reporters for interviews .
The Senator has been said to have a weakness for Butterfinger candy bars , jellybeans , coffee , and doughnuts .
Obama :
Most candidates gain weight on the campaign trail , however , Obama has lost about 5 pounds , following what he believes to be a healthy diet of salmon and broccoli .
Their Exercise Programs : McCain :
He hikes whenever he can find the time and walked the Grand Canyon rim to rim in August 2006 .
He is limited by his post - traumatic ( brought on by war injuries ) degenerative arthritis affecting especially his hands and shoulders .
Obama :
He plays pickup basketball , runs three miles , and exercises at hotel gyms with lightweights and treadmills daily .
Their Cigarette Smoking History : McCain :
He smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 25 years before quitting in 1980 .
Obama :
He has quit smoking on several occasions and currently uses Nicorette gum with success .
He promises his wife , Michelle , he will give up smoking .
My Comments : Obama ’s personal diet and exercise regime , and his personal appearance of robust health provide a positive image for a president .
Based on these observations I believe he is much more likely to make decisions and take actions that will result in better health and healthcare for the average American than is McCain .
Mortality Based on Age Alone McCain : 72 . Date of Birth : August 29 , 1936 Obama : 47 . Date of Birth : August 4 , 1961 My Comments : Based solely on their age , and no other health issues , McCain ’s life expectancy is 12 years and Obama ’s is 31 years .
1
Over the next 4 years a man of 72 years has a probability of dying of 16 % and over 8 years , 38 % .
At age 47 a man has a 2 % probability of dying of within 4 years , and 5 % within 8 years .
During the “ golden ” years a person also has a significant risk of becoming disabled from a variety of conditions , including stroke , dementia , Alzheimer 's Disease , heart attack , cancer , and arthritis .
After age 70 , the risks of all these disabilities increase rapidly with each passing month and are related to the quality of a person ’s diet and lifestyle .
Relevant Past and Present Medical History McCain :
He allowed a select group of 20 reporters to view for only 3 hours his 1,173 pages of medical records on May 23 , 2008 , and these records were in addition to 1,500 pages distributed the last time he ran for the Republican candidate for president in 2000 .
Obama : A one page medical letter on Obama 's most recent medical checkup , done on Jan. 15 , 2007 , gave him a report of " completely normal . "
My Comments : Future history almost always follows past history when it comes to health .
The exception is seen when people make serious changes in their diet and lifestyle ; not by taking more medications .
McCain appears to be unaware of the importance of a healthy diet .
Medications Taken by the Candidates McCain : Simvastatin ( Zocor ) — a statin for lowering cholesterol .
Hydrochlorothiazide — a diuretic commonly prescribed for hypertension .
Also rarely prescribed for kidney stone prevention ; he has small stones in his right kidney .
Amiloride — a potassium - sparing diuretic used to treat hypertension .
Aspirin — commonly prescribed for prevention of heart attacks and other blood clots .
Zyrtec — an anti-histamine , used as necessary for nasal allergies .
Ambien CR — a sleeping pill , used as necessary for sleep induction .
A multiple vitamin tablet
Obama : Nicorette gum — for tobacco addiction .
The Candidates ’ Heart Disease Risk McCain : Framingham CHD Score = 27 % Obama : Framingham CHD Score = 3 % as a smoker and 1 % as a non-smoker .
The Framingham Heart Disease Risk Calculator combines several risk factors in order to give a score , as a percentage , that represents the probability of having a coronary heart disease ( CHD ) event within 10 years .
2
Candidates ’ Risk Factors : McCain : Weight : 163 to 168 pounds
Height : 5 feet , 7 inches Cholesterol : 226 mg/dL ( before medication ) Cholesterol : 192 ( on simvastatin* ) HDL cholesterol : 35 mg/dL ( before medication ) Triglycerides : 260 mg/dL ( before medication ) Triglycerides : 135 mg/dL ( on simvistatin ) Blood pressure : 134/84 mmHg ( on two anti-hypertension medications ) Blood Sugar : 111 mg/dL ( slightly elevated above ideal )
Obama : Weight : trim ( no excess fat ) Height : 6 feet , 1 inch Cholesterol : 173 mg/dL ( no medication ) HDL cholesterol : 68 mg/dL ( no medication ) Triglycerides : 44 mg/dL ( no medication ) Blood pressure : 90/60 mmHg ( no medication ) *
For people without a solid previous history of previous heart disease or stroke , therapy with statins has been shown to cause little or no reduction in their risk of future cardiovascular disease .
3 My Comments : The Framingham Heart Disease Risk Calculator gives McCain a 27 % chance of having a coronary heart disease ( CHD ) event , such as a heart attack , heart surgery , and / or death within 10 years .
2
His slightly elevated blood sugar and moderately elevated body weight push this risk even higher .
A heart attack or surgery ( angioplasty or bypass ) would at a minimum put the vice president in charge for weeks to months during his recovery .
I strongly encourage McCain to change to the McDougall diet , since his excess weight , kidney stones , and elevated cholesterol , triglycerides , sugar , and blood pressure are due to his unhealthy eating .
My recommendations to Obama : quit smoking by the only method that works , which is to refuse the next cigarette .
He should also learn that fish is not health food , at least for the sake of our dying oceans .
The Significance of McCain ’s Melanomas Melanoma is a serious , and often fatal , form of skin cancer .
His first bout with this disease came in 1996 after the biopsy of a lesion on his left temple , which showed atypical junctional melanotic proliferation .
In 2000 a lesion in the same area was diagnosed as invasive melanoma ( Stage IIA melanoma ) .
Actually , at this time there were two areas of melanoma , believed to have arisen separately , found .
One reached to a depth of l.23 mm and the other had a thickness of 2.2 mm .
These two cancers are believed to have formed from the spread of the 1996 lesion by way of the veins located in McCain ’s left temple area ; a process known as “ satellite metastasis ” .
4
The finding of “ negative ” lymph nodes during McCain ’s surgery of 2000 suggests the disease was in early stages , 8 years ago .
Spread of cancer to the lymph nodes is an independent process that simply indicates that the disease is in the later stages of development .
Invasive melanoma spreads very early by way of the veins , not by the lymph nodes , to the rest of the body .
It is important to understand that the finding of negative lymph nodes does not mean that the cancer has not spread .
5
In fact , the presence of the two satellite metastases treated in 2000 confirms that spread had already occurred through his veins more than 12 years ago , and is evidence that melanoma cancer cells are almost certainly present in other parts of the Senator ’s body today .
A roughly circular mass of skin and flesh , 6 centimeters in diameter , was removed from the left side of the McCain 's face , along with the underlying parotid salivary gland .
This aggressive operation seems to have controlled the “ local disease . ”
A recent study of a large numbers of patients ( 17,600 ) with melanoma has validated the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system .
6
This staging system predicts a 64 % chance of a patient with stage IIA melanoma surviving for 10 years .
7
For someone in McCain ’s age group the prognosis drops to 56 %.6 McCain is already 8 years into these 10 - year figures , which does not mean that he has beaten the odds .
5
Rather , because this is an on - growing systemic disease , unaffected by the extent of local facial surgery performed on the Senator in 2000 , risk of death from his original melanoma will continue every year , long past the 10 - year benchmarks provided above .
6,7 McCain has had 3 other superficial melanomas — on his left shoulder , left arm , and left nasal sidewall .
His approach to these potentially deadly skin cancers has been avoidance of sunlight exposure .
This effort will be of little avail because melanomas are not due to photo - damage .8- 10
Rather , this serious cancer , like so many others , is due , at least in part , to his unhealthy diet .
11 - 13
This same junk - food diet promotes the growth of cancer cells already present in his body and will likely shorten the Senator ’s life .
Here is one more reason I would strongly encourage McCain to change to the McDougall diet .
If during his presidency melanoma were to be found to have spread to his liver , brain , lungs , and / or bones , then chemotherapy treatments would undoubtedly be recommended .
However , these toxic chemicals would cause him to become disabled , unable to perform his duties , for the few short months he would survive .
14 You Must Be Kidding Yourself If You Are in Doubt
While it is impossible to predict with certainty any person 's future health , time of death , or degree of disability , the evidence at hand clearly says John McCain is in relatively poor health and Barack Obama is in excellent health .
All politics aside , no one could conclude otherwise .
To McCain ’s credit he appears to be holding up well during this grueling campaign , but his current appearances do not negate the medical facts .
Additionally , although it is impossible to accurately merge all the figures that predict mortality — 38 % ( actuarial figures ) , 27 % ( cardiac risk ) , and 44 % ( melanoma mortality ) — it would not be unreasonable to guess that McCain ’s chances of dying within the two terms of Presidential office far exceed a coin toss .
Add to this the risk of him becoming disabled to the point of non-performance , then who among well - informed voters would bet their stock portfolio or their subprime - mortgaged home that , if elected , McCain will still be our President come 2017 ?
Would you , or the company you work for , hire an employee with McCain ’s medical problems ?
How about someone with Obama ’s health history ?
Of course , there are many other important issues that will determine the vote you will cast come November 4 , 2008 , but the health of our candidates is of paramount importance and should be weighed appropriately .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Another penny came off the national average price of gasoline Saturday , the 30th straight daily decline , bringing the total drop in the period to more than 35 cents a gallon .
The price of regular unleaded gasoline at the pump fell to $ 3.761 a gallon , according to the Daily Fuel Gauge Report from motorist advocacy group AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
The average is based on credit card swipes at 100,000 service stations .
Prices have fallen 8.6 % since hitting a record high of $ 4.114 a gallon on July 16 , mirroring a decline in crude futures .
However , gas prices were still just over $ 1 , or 36.3 % , higher than a year ago .
State prices : Gasoline exceeded $ 4 a galllon in five states , all in the West , according to the survey .
Alaska had the highest prices at $ 4.557 a gallon , but that was down more than a nickel from the previous day .
Hawaii is second at $ 4.445 , followed by California at $ 4.062 , Utah at $ 4.052 and Idaho at $ 4.023 ..
Missouri had the cheapest gas , with prices falling a half - cent to $ 3.52 a gallon .
Prices in South Carolina were the second lowest at $ 3.54 , followed by Oklahoma at $ 3.545 , Tennessee at $ 3.57 and Arkansas at $ 3.582 .
Ethanol :
The price of E85 , an 85 % blend of corn - derived ethanol available to some vehicles , fell to $ 3.044 a gallon on average from $ 3.048 , AAA reported .
Ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline but has a lower energy content and burns less efficiently in flex fuel vehicles .
According to AAA 's estimates , a vehicle that burns E85 would pay $ 4.006 a gallon to get the same mileage as gas .
Diesel :
The average price for diesel fuel , which is used in most trucks and commercial vehicles , fell more than 2 cents to $ 4.421 a gallon from $ 4.445 the day before , according to AAA .
The price of diesel has risen more than 51 % over the past 12 months .
Because of its use in transporting goods , high priced diesel can help drive up the prices of products and services .
Drivers in Hawaii , the state with the most expensive diesel , paid an average of $ 5.35 a gallon for diesel .
Diesel was cheapest in Missouri , where prices fell to an average of $ 4.146 .
Having More Fun Than You Since 2008
Sci-Fi writers seem to enjoy coining Laws : adages bearing their own names that live on past their appearances in Sci -Fi stories .
Here are five of my favorites , plus one bonus law ( actually a Principle ) from the world of cartoons .
1. Hanlon's Razor ( aka Hanlon 's Law )
" Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity . "
Ascribed to various authors , including Robert Heinlein .
( Or perhaps it was Napoleon , or another candidate . )
This law 's name is also a take - off on Occam 's Razor .
2. Sturgeon's Law
" Ninety percent of everything is crap . "
This adage came after a less successful " first law " by Sturgeon , " Nothing is always absolutely so . "
Read more on this bit of wisdom .
3. O'Toole 's Corollary of Finagle 's Law
Finagle 's Law is a variant of Murphy 's Law : Anything that can go wrong , will -- at the worst possible moment .
It was popularized by John W. Campbell , Jr. , editor of Astounding Science Fiction and Analog , as well as Larry Niven .
But the much wackier O'Toole 's Corollary of Finagle 's Law is :
" The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum . "
See also : the second law of thermodynamics .
4. Clarke's Three Laws
Arthur C. Clarke postulated three laws over his illustrious career .
The third is by far the most famous :
First law :
When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible , he is almost certainly right .
When he states that something is impossible , he is very probably wrong .
When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible , he is almost certainly right .
When he states that something is impossible , he is very probably wrong .
Second law :
The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible .
The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible .
Third law :
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
5. Asimov's Laws of Robotics
Forming the basis for Isaac Asimov 's fictional universe , these laws for robotic behavior have been the source of much Sci - Fi drama ( I , Robot anyone ? ) :
First law : A robot may not harm a human being , or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
A robot may not harm a human being , or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
Second law : A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
Third law : A robot must protect its own existence , as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
There 's also a Zeroth Law .
6 . The Dilbert Principle
Although Scott Adams is n't a Sci-Fi writer , his Dilbert Principle is worthy of an honorable mention : the most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage : management ..
( See also : the Peter principle . )
If that 's not enough for you , check out Wikipedia 's list of eponymous laws .
( I 'm particularly fond of Hofstadter 's Law . )
The bulb makers face a tough problem .
Their businesses were built on customers who regularly replaced light bulbs .
How do you make a profit when new lighting may commonly last 50 to 100 times as long as a standard bulb ?
Compact fluorescents , which use less than one - third the power and last up to 10 times as long as standard bulbs , have replaced incandescent bulbs in many homes and offices .
In some types of commercial buildings , L.E.D.’s are rapidly replacing older products .
The industry seems convinced that new lower - cost L.E.D. bulbs , with their improved efficiency , will eventually become the chief substitutes for incandescent bulbs in homes .
Image The Empire State Building may soon use computer - controlled L.E.D.s.
Credit ... Michael Nagle for The New York Times
L.E.D.’s , including new bulb types and applications , dominated the exhibits at Lightfair , the lighting industry ’s annual trade event held in May in Las Vegas .
Traditional tungsten bulbs were largely absent .
L.E.D.’s were shown for street and parking lot lighting , under - counter lighting , residential bulb replacements and office lighting .
They are being used in commercial refrigerators , as substitutes for fluorescents and for illuminating the outside of buildings , allowing for easy color changes .
Television production studios are installing L.E.D. ’s to save money and eliminate the need for climbing in the rafters to change bulbs or filters .
The problem , though , is the price .
A standard 60 - watt incandescent usually costs less than $ 1 .
An equivalent compact fluorescent is about $ 2 .
But in Europe this September , Philips , the Dutch company dealing in consumer electronics , health care machines and lighting , is to introduce the Ledino , its first L.E.D. replacement for a standard incandescent .
Priced at $ 107 a bulb , it is unlikely to have more than a few takers .
“ L.E.D. performance is there , but the price is not , ” said Kevin Dowling , a Philips Lighting vice president and past chairman of the Next Generation Lighting Industry Alliance , an industry group that works with the Department of Energy .
“ Even at $ 10 to $ 15 , consumers wo n’t buy L.E.D. bulbs , ” Mr. Dowling said .
The L.E.D. , a type of semiconductor , generates light when an electric current is passed through positive and negative materials .
Energy is given off in the form of heat and light .
Different colors and greater efficiency are created by altering the composition of the material .
Typically , a compact fluorescent bulb uses about 20 percent of the energy needed for a standard bulb to create the same amount of light .
Today ’s L.E.D. ’s use about 15 percent .
Next - generation bulbs still in the labs do even better .
Aside from the Iraqi people , nobody knows what the U.S. military is doing in Iraq better than the soldiers themselves .
A new book gives readers vivid and detailed accounts of the devastation the U.S. occupation has brought to Iraq , in the soldiers ’ own words .
Winter Soldier Iraq and Afghanistan : Eyewitness Accounts of the Occupation , published by Haymarket Books Tuesday , is a gut - wrenching , historic chronicle of what the U.S. military has done to Iraq , and its own soldiers .
Authored by Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) and journalist Aaron Glantz , the book is a reader for hearings that took place in Silver Spring , Md. , between Mar. 13 - 16 , 2008 , at the National Labor College .
" I remember one woman walking by , " said Jason Washburn , a corporal in the U.S. Marines who served three tours in Iraq .
" She was carrying a huge bag , and she looked like she was heading toward us , so we lit her up with the Mark 19 , which is an automatic grenade launcher , and when the dust settled , we realized that the bag was full of groceries .
She had been trying to bring us food , and we blew her to pieces . "
Washburn testified on a panel that discussed the rules of engagement in Iraq , and how lax they were , even to the point of being virtually nonexistent .
" During the course of my three tours , the rules of engagement changed a lot , " Washburn ’s testimony continues .
" The higher the threat the more viciously we were permitted and expected to respond . "
His emotionally charged testimony , like all of those in the book that covered panels addressing dehumanization , civilian testimony , sexism in the military , veterans ’ health care , and the breakdown of the military , raised issues that were repeated again and again by other veterans .
" Something else we were encouraged to do , almost with a wink and nudge , was to carry ‘ drop weapons , ’ or by my third tour , ‘ drop shovels . ’
We would carry these weapons or shovels with us because if we accidentally shot a civilian , we could just toss the weapon on the body , and make them look like an insurgent , " Washburn said .
Four days of searing testimony , witnessed by this writer , is consolidated into the book , which makes for a difficult read .
One page after another is filled with devastating stories from the soldiers about what is being done in Iraq .
Everything from the taking of " trophy " photos of the dead to the torture and slaughter of civilians is included .
" We ’re trying to build a historical record of what continues to happen in this war and what the war is really about , " Glantz told IPS .
Hart Viges , a member of the 82nd Airborne Division of the Army who served one year in Iraq , tells of taking orders over the radio .
" One time they said to fire on all taxicabs because the enemy was using them for transportation .
One of the snipers replied back , ‘ Excuse me ?
Did I hear that right ?
Fire on all taxicabs ? ’
The lieutenant colonel responded , ‘ You heard me , trooper , fire on all taxicabs . ’
After that , the town lit up , with all the units firing on cars .
This was my first experience with war , and that kind of set the tone for the rest of the deployment . "
Vincent Emanuele , a Marine rifleman who spent a year in the al - Qaim area of Iraq near the Syrian border , told of emptying magazines of bullets into the city without identifying targets , running over corpses with Humvees , and stopping to take " trophy " photos of bodies .
" An act that took place quite often in Iraq was taking pot shots at cars that drove by , " he said .
" This was not an isolated incident , and it took place for most of our eight - month deployment . "
Kelly Dougherty , the executive director of IVAW , blames the behavior of soldiers in Iraq on the policies of the U.S. government .
" The abuses committed in the occupations , far from being the result of a ‘ few bad apples ’ misbehaving , are the result of our government ’s Middle East policy , which is crafted in the highest spheres of U.S. power , " she said .
Knowing this , however , does little to soften the emotional and moral devastation of the accounts .
" You see an individual with a white flag , and he does anything but approach you slowly and obey commands , assume it ’s a trick and kill him , " Michael Leduc , a corporal in the Marines who was part of the U.S. attack of Fallujah in November 2004 , said were the orders from his battalion JAG officer he received before entering the city .
This is an important book for the public of the United States , in particular , because the Winter Soldier testimonies were not covered by any of the larger media outlets , aside from the Washington Post , which ran a single piece on the event and buried it in the Metro section .
The New York Times , CNN , and network news channels ABC , NBC , and CBS ignored it completely .
This is particularly important in light of the fact that , as former Marine Jon Turner stated , " Anytime we did have embedded reporters with us , our actions changed drastically .
We never acted the same .
We were always on key with everything , did everything by the book . "
" To me it ’s about giving a picture of what war is like , " Glantz added , " because here in the U.S. we have this very sanitized version of what war is .
But war is when we have a large group of armed people killing large numbers of other people .
And that is the picture that people will get from reading veterans testimony the true face of war . "
Dehumanization of the soldiers themselves is covered in the book , as it includes testimony of sexism , racism , and the plight of veterans upon their return home as they struggle to obtain care from the Veterans Administration .
There is much testimony on the dehumanization of the Iraqi people as well .
Brian Casler , a corporal in the Marines , spoke to some of this that he witnessed during the invasion of Iraq .
" But on these convoys , I saw Marines defecate into MRE bags or urinate in bottles and throw them at children on the side of the road , " he stated .
Numerous accounts from soldiers include the prevalence of degrading terms for Iraqis , such as " hajis , " " towel - heads , " and " sand -n*ggers . "
Scott Ewing , who served in Iraq from 2005 - 2006 , admitted on one panel that units intentionally gave candy to Iraqi children for reasons other than " winning hearts and minds . "
" There was also another motive , " Ewing said .
" If the kids were around our vehicles , the bad guys would n’t attack .
We used the kids as human shields . "
Glantz admits that it would be difficult for the average U.S. citizen to read the book , and he believes it is important to keep in mind while doing so what it took for the veterans to give this historic testimony .
" They could have been heroes , but what they are doing here is even more heroic  which is telling the truth , " Glantz told IPS .
" They did n’t have to come forward .
They chose to come forward . "

By Farooq Sulehria
September 17 , 2008 -- Washington 's next war is already on the go .
It is as yet undeclared .
However , it is not unapproved .
``Classified orders '' , according to September 11 New York Times , were passed by President Bush last July .
And surprise of surprises !
The target is not ``axis of evil '' - fame Iran .
It is Washington 's close ally in the ``war on terror ' ' , Pakistan .
At the time of writing , news is pouring in from the Waziristan ( tribal areas ) region of Pakistan of yet another US attack that has left another five ``Taliban '' dead .
Only a week ago , 20 ``Taliban '' were killed in another US attack .
Between August 13 and September 12 , at least 79 ``Taliban '' have been killed in nine US attacks on Pakistan 's tribal areas .
Since January 29 ( the year 's first attack claimed 12 lives ) , more than 150 people have been killed .
Besides the rising death toll , a large - scale displacement is taking place across tribal areas .
From Bajour district alone , more than 30,000 people have migrated to the relative safety of the neighbouring districts of the North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) .
True , the large - scale displacement also owes much to the Shia - Sunni conflict that has flared up in the tribal areas , which has claimed more than 1500 lives in Kurrum Agency alone in last year .
The massive military operation launched against Taliban by the Pakistan army under US pressure , continuing since 2003 , has driven people out of their homes .
The Taliban 's successful attempt to capture and turn Pakistan 's tribal areas into ``Talibanistan '' has , no doubt , also inflicted misery ( beheadings , amputations , displacement , harsh dress codes ) on the residents of tribal areas , which has also led to displacement .
However , it was the US invasion of Afghanistan that has reduced the tribal areas to a battlefield for multipronged war , with Shias fighting Sunnis , the Taliban pitched against the Pakistan military and US missiles and air drones pounding Pakistan .
Sunni-Shia conflict
The Shia -Sunni conflict began plaguing Pakistan in 1980s .
The recent Shia -Sunni clashes in the tribal areas partly reflect the wider problem afflicting Pakistan .
However , the immediate cause is the Talibanisation - at - gunpoint of the tribal areas .
Staunchly anti-Shia , the Taliban when at the helm of Kabul in the late 1990s brought Afghanistan to the brink of war with Iran owing to its anti-Shia crusades .
Reportedly , 5000 Shias were massacred by the Taliban when it was in power .
But attributing the Taliban ’s campaigns against the Kurrum Agency Shias to mere confessional fanaticism would be a half truth .
This well - planned campaign is part of the wider Taliban strategy .
The strategy is to Talibanise , politically and administratively , the tribal areas .
The writ of the Pakistan state over the tribal areas has effectively been replaced by Talibanised Sharia ( Islamic law ) .
Having defeated and expelled the state apparatus ( police , civil administration , courts ) , Taliban militias have established their own courts to dispense speedy justice .
They have established toll posts to levy road taxes on transport .
This is a major source of income .
Maliks ( tribal elders ) might pose a challenge to Taliban authority .
Hence , public beheadings of ``US spies '' eliminated some and silenced others .
Largely to subdue the local population and partly to win support of conservative elements , men were told to grow beards ( standard length = 5 centimetres ) .
Women were told to either stay home or hide themselves in blue burkas .
``Adulterers '' were duly stoned to death .
Whippings were dispensed for not fasting during the holy month of Ramadan .
Thieves had their hands amputated .
Having learned from their experience in Afghanistan , the Taliban do not shutdown girls ' schools lest one day ``infidels '' defeat them and re-open the schools .
They simply burn them .
The tally so far is 500 .
( A digression : the neo-cons in the US and their liberal cousins in Pakistan may invoke this information as a rationale to justify a future US invasion of tribal areas .
But this information is meant for those on the left that hails the Taliban 's mindless violence as ``anti- imperialism , resistance and liberation ' ' . )
The Shia tribes are alarmed at the Taliban occupation of the tribal areas .
The Shia massacre in Afghanistan is fresh in their minds .
They have decided to resist tooth and nail .
Iranian backing has also proved decisive .
Hence , despite losses , the Shia tribes have stood their ground .
The Shia resistance to the Taliban was not the only impediment the Taliban faced .
They have encountered acts of resistance non-stop .
A brave woman , refused to quit her job as school teacher and stay home .
Villagers formed militias and resisted , though unsuccessfully .
The local tribes at first were no match for the Taliban and al Qaeda cadre trained in the 1980s with CIA - provided manuals .
However , the Shia resistance proved inspiring .
It became an impetus for others .
The tribes have now formed their own militia and have begun liberating their villages from the Taliban .
` Assent ' from Pakistan
While tribes have been left on their own to defend themselves against the Taliban , the New York Times on September 11 quoted a senior US official as saying that the Pakistan government had ``privately assented to the general concept of limited ground assaults by [ US ] Special Operations forces against significant militant targets , but that it did not approve each mission ” .
The official did not say which members of the government gave the approval .
Though the present Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) government has denied such assertions , there is a general feeling in Pakistan that such an ``assent to the general concept of limited ground assaults '' exists .
During the rule of Pervez Musharraf , every time the US attacked [ inside Pakistan ] , the regime would claim responsibility instead .
Now every US attack is followed by a protest statement by the Pakistan government and every protest statement is followed by another US attack .
This whole mess might confuse many outside Pakistan as Pakistan has committed up to 90,000 troops to the tribal areas and has lost more than 1000 soldiers fighting the Taliban since 2003 .
Meanwhile , Bush administration keeps lashing out at Islamabad for not doing enough to flush al Qaeda out of the tribal areas .
The US accuse - and - attack policy in fact is nothing but a farcical repeat of history : unable to defeat the North Vietnamese army , Nixon dispatched troops to Combodia .
Tariq
Ali accurately points out : `` When in doubt , escalate the war is an old imperial motto' ' .
Islamabad ’s role , however , in the tribal areas is complicated .
The 27,200 square - kilometre tribal belt , officially known as the Federal Autonomous Tribal Area , or FATA , is home to 3.3 million Pashtun tribes .
The Pashtuns constitute the world 's largest tribal group .
Imperial Britain divided them with an artificial border , the Durand Line , which went on to become Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
When Pakistan was created in 1947 , the Pashtuns were split between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
How Washington created the Taliban
In the wake of the radical 1978 ``Saur revolution '' in Afghanistan , when the USA decided to give the Soviet Union its ``Vietnam '' , the tribal areas and parts of the NWFP bordering Afghanistan , were turned by the CIA into a safe heaven for the ``Mujahideen ' ' , the Taliban 's forerunners .
Society in the tribal areas suffered immensely as a result .
It was brutalised , criminalised and militarised as the weapons and drug trade became a major source of funding for the anti-Soviet ``jihad ' ' .
When the Soviet Union withdrew , Afghan leader Dr Najibullah was able to hold the Mujahideen out for another three years .
But in 1993 , he gave in .
The Mujahideen reduced Afghanistan to rubble in their attempt to capture Kabul .
The unending chaos was finally put to an end with imperial help .
Says Benazir Bhutto : ``Weapons were supplied to the Taliban by the USA and Britain with money from Saudi Arabia ...
Pakistan 's territory was used to train solely the Afghan refugees -– Pushtoons , who made up the backbone of Taliban movement . ''
Even if Benazir ’s statement is treated cautiously , tacit US approval for the Talibanised fighters take over has been documented in detail by a number of writers .
Taliban control of Kabul was the Pakistan military 's first success on an external front .
The Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's notorious military intelligence service , was the architect of the Taliban victory .
The Taliban - ISI duo were not merely tactical brothers .
Both also had an ideological affinity .
During the ``jihad '' against Soviets , the Pakistan military too was ``radicalised ' ' .
When after 9/11 , Washington told Pakistan GHQ ( military headquarters ) to give the Taliban up , it reluctantly but obediently followed the instructions .
A section of the military , however , refused to give up .
The then ISI chief told the Taliban to resist the US invasion .
He was duly removed by General Musharraf .
But support for the Taliban was not limited to the ISI chief .
It was / is widespread among the army ranks in general .
Serious attempts on Musharraf 's life were connived , if not planned , by military personnel .
Some of them were executed after summary trials by military courts .
Pakistan military divided over support for `Talibanistan '
The Taliban could not hold out for long as they had no social base left in Afghanistan .
Not a single person came to their defence .
The pro-Taliban elements in the Pakistan military establishment , however , were able to mobilise and dispatch thousands of lashkaris ( mercenaries ) from Pakistan to aid the Taliban in its defence of Kabul .
Ironically , many of the lashkaris ended up in Guantanamo Bay while the Taliban escaped to the safety of Pakistan 's tribal areas .
Here , assisted by their military masters , they regrouped .
The plan was to launch a proxy war as was the case in the 1980s , with the only difference being that the USA was on the other side this time .
The region was skilfully Talibanised over a period of time .
The GHQ under Musharraf 's leadership was indecisive .
It most likely gave assent to this proxy war initially .
However , a siege of The tribal areas began when Washington exerted pressure .
Hence , the situation has pitched sections of the Pakistan military ( following US dictates ) against other sections of Pakistan military ( patronising Taliban ) in the tribal areas .
This divide in the army was reflected most nakedly in the wake of the Red Mosque operation in June 2007 when a series of suicide attacks on military targets shook Pakistan .
Thus , the situation is indeed complex .
There are military hawks who have ``faith '' in driving the ``infidel ' ' out of Kabul and reTalibanising it .
They are miscalculating .
Capturing Kabul through a proxy war in 1997 against a ragtag freemasonry of Mujahideen defending Kabul was one thing .
Snatching it from NATO is a recipe for disaster .
Most likely , the Taliban not being able to march westward will spread eastward .
Already , districts neighbouring the tribal areas , particularly the scenic valleys of Swat , have become a venue for pitched battles between the Taliban and the Pakistan military .
Kohat , Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan have received warning shots .
However , neither succesful Talibanisation nor the presence of Taliban hide - outs should serve as an excuse for an imperialist invasion of Pakistan .
It will further plunge this region into chaos .
The stability of the region cannot be guaranteed until the US occupation of Afghanistan ( the mother of all instabilities ) is ended .
Talibanisation can be best fought against by the masses .
The US presence in the region will only delay the Taliban 's defeat .
Unfortunately , the signs coming out of Washington suggest otherwise .
On Fox News on July 6 , Bill Kristol recounted that in a 90 - minute , mostly off - the - record , meeting with a small group of journalists .
Kristol said that Bush ``conveyed the ... impression that he thought the next president 's biggest challenge would not be Iraq , which he thinks he 'll leave in pretty good shape , and would not be Afghanistan , which is manageable by itself ...
It 's Pakistan ...
[ We have ] a sort of friendly government that sort of cooperates and sort of does n't .
It 's really a complicated and difficult situation . ''

LAKE FOREST , California ( CNN ) --
Speaking to a group of evangelical Christians , Sen. Barack Obama said Saturday that his greatest moral failure -- and the country 's -- has been selfishness , but his opponent , Sen . John McCain , cited his failed first marriage .
Sen. Barack Obama takes questions from the Rev. Rick Warren on Saturday .
McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , added that the country 's greatest shortcoming has been a tendency to not devote itself " to causes greater than ourselves . "
" I think after 9/11 , my friends , we should have told Americans to join the Peace Corps , expand the military , serve a cause greater than your self - interest , " he said .
Obama told the Rev. Rick Warren that " we still do n't abide by that basic precept of Matthew : that whatever you do for the least of my brothers , you do for me .
" That basic principle applies to poverty .
It applies to racism and sexism ; it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class . "
The Saddleback Civil Forum on Presidency was the first time both candidates appeared on stage since they became the presumptive presidential nominees for their parties .
Watch the complete forum : Part 1 » , Part 2 » , Part 3 » , Part 4 »
The event was held at Saddleback Church , a mega- church in southern California .
The candidates were interviewed by Warren , pastor at the church and author of the best - selling book " The Purpose - Driven Life . "
Warren has said he wo n't endorse either candidate , preferring that his followers make up their own minds .
Miss it the first time ?
John McCain and Barack Obama in a forum hosted by Rick Warren .

" I have to tell you up front , both of these guys are my friends .
They both care deeply about America .
They are both patriots , " Warren said in his introduction .
" They have very different ideas on how America can be strengthened . "
Watch analysts break down the event »
McCain and Obama appeared briefly onstage together , shaking hands and posing with Warren between their one - hour interviews .
Obama acknowledged his drug and alcohol use as a teenager when asked about his personal failure .
" I was so obsessed with me and the reasons I might be dissatisfied , I could n't focus on other people , " he said .
Watch more of Obama 's comments »
McCain 's answer to the question on his own failings was succinct .
" My greatest moral failing , and I have been a very imperfect person , is the failure of my first marriage , " he said .
Watch more of McCain 's interview »
When asked what faith in Jesus means to him , McCain replied , " Means I 'm saved and forgiven .
Our faith encompasses not just America but the world . "
McCain got teary - eyed while discussing an experience with a guard during his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
The guard , McCain said , drew a cross in the sand while he was praying on Christmas Day .
" For a minute there , we were just two Christians worshipping together . "
Neither candidate shied away from a question about which current Supreme Court justice they would not have nominated .
Obama 's reply : Clarence Thomas .
" I do n't think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that .
I profoundly disagree with his interpretation " of the Constitution , he said .
McCain said he would have never nominated Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , David Souter and John Paul Stevens .
" This nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the Constitution and not legislating from the bench , " McCain added .
The Arizona senator said he was " proud " of President Bush for nominating conservative Justices Samuel Alito and John Roberts to the court .
McCain also touched on the conflict in Georgia , saying Russia 's behavior in sending troops into breakaway regions " is not acceptable in the 21st century . "
" They achieved a revolution .
...
Now the Russians are coming in there in an act of aggression .
...
We have to not only bring about cease - fire ; we have to have honor , " he said , adding that Russia must respect Georgia 's sovereignty .
Warren pressed Obama on two hot - button issues among social conservatives : abortion and same - sex marriage .
Obama said that although he 's pro-choice and supports Roe v. Wade , his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in America .
" On this particular issue , if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent , then I can't argue with you on that , " he said .
" What I can do is say , are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies ? "
Watch CNN Sr. Political Analyst Bill Schneider 's analysis of the forum »
He also touched on same - sex marriage .
When asked to define marriage , he told Warren , " It 's a union between a man and a woman . "
" For me as a Christian , it is a sacred union .
God 's in the mix , " he said .
Obama added that he does support same - sex civil unions , saying , " I can afford those civil rights to others even if I do n't have ... that view . "
McCain was also asked about his views on those issues .
He said he would be a pro-life president and would support legislation favoring anti-abortion policy positions .
Watch McCain discuss abortion »
In terms of same - sex marriage , he supports traditional marriage defined as a union between a man and a woman but would let states decide rather than have a federal mandate .
Obama was asked what he would say if he could say whatever he wanted and face no public repercussions .
He answered , " solving big problems are not going to be easy .
We are all going to think about how we using things [ energy - wise ] .
If we pretend like everything is free , we are betraying the tradition of America . "
The stakes are high for both candidates , who are actively courting so - called values voters and evangelicals , important voting blocs .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll taken July 27 - 29 showed that among white , born - again or evangelical voters , 67 percent are for McCain , with 24 percent for Obama .
Although it 's a strong showing for McCain , he 's lagging 11 percentage points behind President Bush in the 2004 election .
Exit polls show that Bush beat Sen. John Kerry 78 percent to 21 percent among these voters .
McCain , who was raised an Episcopalian and now identifies himself as Baptist , rarely discusses his faith .
" I 'm unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in God .
But I do not obviously try to impose my views on others , " McCain said in April .
Since then , the senator from Arizona has met with many of the evangelical leaders who did not support his candidacy during the primary season .
At a private meeting this summer , dozens of the movement 's most prominent figures voted to support his campaign .
Obama 's positions in favor of abortion rights and same - sex civil unions also have created tension among evangelical voters otherwise drawn to his candidacy .
But the Democrat , who is Christian , has made it a point to discuss his religion on the trail this year and launched an ambitious outreach effort targeting these voters , including private summits with pastors and a major campaign aimed at young evangelicals .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Tom Foreman , Ed Henry , Sasha Johnson and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .

@snitch29 : 10,000 movies is a pretty large amount of content , especially when Apple 's is stuck at around 1,000 .
The difference is that NetFlix is showing primarily older titles , where Apple is getting new releases from the studios that worship from the altar of Jobs .
That said , with announcements like this , the Roku player , and possibly PS3 support around the corner , you can bet the studios are giving this a second look .
If NetFlix can get a sizable audience for their streaming products , you can bet that the non-worshiping studios will become chummy with NetFlix in a hurry .
Personally , I think NetFlix has the edge in this battle , primarily because the non-worshiping studios are willing to do just about anything to keep Apple from taking over their market , even if it means handing the market to NetFlix .
50,000 expected to protest RNC David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

If you thought protests outside 2008 's Democratic National Convention were loud and proud , you ain't seen nothing yet .
So say organizers preparing for the 2008 Republican National Convention , set to take place in St. Paul , Minnesota .
Organizers estimate 50,000 protesters are getting ready to demonstrate outside the RNC , in the largest anti-war protest planned so far this year .
" We have word that people are coming on busses and carpools , people are flying in from all over the country , " said Katrina Plotz , an organizer for an RNC protest group .
" We are expecting the police to uphold our right to demonstrate , to speak out against the war . "
AP Correspondent Haven Daley said in a Wednesday news video that it may be difficult keeping the protests peaceful , attributing his ominous prediction to " anarchist groups " which were not named .
" We 're aware of the other tactics that the other groups are doing , so we 're trying to reschedule around those different activities , " said Code Pink activist Nancy Mancias .
St. Paul police have prepared an open - air prison , similar to those employed by the New York City police in 2004 , and the Denver police during the 2008 DNC .
The facility is capable of holding hundreds for an unknown amount of time .

The answer is : Hand Counted Paper Ballots .
Nothing less will be sufficient ; nothing more is needed .
Those who are against hand counted paper ballots are either ignorant or complicit with the election theft operation .

With so little news coverage on serious problems like the one you report on here getting in the way of the will of the voters being realized , I was shocked to learn about the frontpage story in USA Today where the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law claims its study shows that ballot design is the only problem we have .
Election fraud is all over , the GOP is caging votes , wiping voters off the voting rolls , and we see the privatization of the election process and yet this study says there is n't an instance where a computer has fouled - up a vote by itself .
What is this nonsense about ?
I look forward to getting some analysis on this study ( it sounds like a red herring to me ) .
In the meantime , thank you for covering the other problems that are n't so obvious .

This is a short video clip of Attorney Bill Risner deposing Bryan Crane 2/27/07 .
It ’s a must see clip of a very nervous , guilt ridden county election computer operator .
After watching this you can understand what guilt does and why Crane confessed to Zbgniew Osmolski .
Osmolski Affidavit , quotes Bryan Crane as saying that he was told to fix the election by his bosses , it is clear that County management has a potential motive to obstruct an investigation just as they have done .
A press report last week quoted Bryan Crane as saying he had to look up on a map where the Boondocks Bar was located .
However he got there , he was seen that evening by another available witness who knows Mr. Crane .
Mr. Osmolski related his conversation with Mr. Crane to four separate people at the bar that evening .
Confession is good for the soul .
Jim March and I are genuinely concerned for this guy .
Crane obviously knows a lot .
All this suggests he ’s a weak link in a criminal enterprise involving very powerful people … and that ’s not a healthy thing to be in anywhere .
Jim March and I are advocating that Bryan Crane get immunity in exchange for giving up the big bosses in Pima County running an election fraud scheme .
As Attorney Bill Risner says in the letter to the Attorney General Terry Goddard : .
“ The truthfulness of Mr. Crane ’s confession can readily be determined by examining the ballots .
As noted by Michael Shamos , the proof is in the ballots . ”

As is well known , Arizona Politics have been run since the time of Kemper Marley by the Liquor and gambling interests of the Lansky - Bronfman organized crime syndicate .
A little thing like the flipping of a vote should not surprise anyone .
The gang in charge is busy right now trying to figure out how they 're going to get their darling " War Hero " John McCain of Keating five fame , elected President of the whole Country , thus delivering the Nation into the hands of the Mob .
Of course , the Republican Party has been largely controlled by the Syndiicate since the time of Richard Nixon - remember Frank Fitzsimmons ?
But - I dunno - rule by the crime families might be preferable to rule by big oil .
In neither case do the people want what they 're likely to get , but honest politics became an oxymoron a generation ago .

Tedegger , I agree with you about " Arizona Politics have been run since the time of Kemper Marley by the Liquor and … ” however I would also add ‘ Land Fraud ’
See the IRE History | The Arizona Project , land fraud and organized crime made his murder a cowardly act ”
The 1976 , Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles , one of IRE 's founding members , was called to meeting in a downtown Phoenix hotel by a source promising him information about land fraud involving organized crime .
The source did n't show up .
Bolles left the hotel , got into his car parked outside and turned the key .
A powerful bomb ripped through the car , leaving Bolles mortally injured .
” Over the next 10 days , doctors amputated both Bolles ' legs and an arm , but could not save him ”
Nothing is fixed till we know why it broke .
This is a good read into recent history of organized crime in Arizona http://www.ire.org/history/arizona.html

Though iBeta saw instances of possible tampering , it decided they were simply the result of " human error . "
This points out something weird about election forensics in general .
In other fields , like accounting , when something does n't look right you do n't see the auditor speculating about motivation .
In other words , an auditor will just say something like " due to missing checks and balances , we decline to state any opinion on the accuracy of the results " --- and everyone knows what that means :
The people might have been cheating , but REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE OR WERE NOT , the breakdown in checks and balances alone means that the results cannot be trusted .
You also see auditors writing things like " funds collected were not deposited into the account .
Mr. [ name ] should repay the funds . "
Note that this sidesteps whether Mr. [ name ] stole the funds or it was " human error " --- auditors do n't care .
Sometimes you even see auditors writing things like this : " Due to the missing checks and balances and therefore , the high risk of fraud , we have disclaimed any opinion on the accuracy of the financial reports provided .
We have contacted the prosecuting attorney . "
In elections , time after time , we see these election consultants and state officials tripping over themselves in their haste to say there was no foul play , that it was " human error . "
Every embezzler tries to build in plausible deniability .
In a sane world , that does n't get them off the hook .
To follow up on one of my earlier questions , about Mr. Osmolski , as John Brakey clarified , Osmolski was indeed someone who had worked for the county , and had been involved in a prior whistleblowing action .
It would be interesting to find out more about that .
We tend to see the same faces on the periphery of various scandals .
The current one , about elections , would appear to connect to land developers and whoever they hold sway with at the county supervisor level .
How many of the sups are the same now as before when Osmolski blew the whistle ?
And was n't that a transportation issue , and this toasted election is a transportation bond issue ?
I have no doubt that Brakey and March are following the money trail on this .
If government investigators are ( inappropriately ) proclaiming " human error " instead of just reporting the facts , somehow I have more faith in Brakey & March getting to the bottom of this than the A.G. Sad state of affairs .

# 1 Patriot ,
You wrote
" The answer is : Hand Counted Paper Ballots .
Nothing less will be sufficient ; nothing more is needed ... "
Your first sentence addresses the future .
We have to address the present , and deal with crimes by investigating & prosecuting them , no matter how long it takes or who is in office .
Just as Obama adviser Cass Sunstein , at Friday 's netroots convention , said we should ignore all the Bushcrime ( good band name ? ) of the last 7 - 8 years , election officials want this Pima county situation swept under the rug with everything else .
No .
It 's a crime , goddammit .
Maybe it 's already too late , but until they close the borders and have goddamn microchips implanted in all our brains , we can't give up .

Debate is reaching a fever pitch over a new security feature in Firefox 3.0 that throws out a warning page to users when a Web site 's SSL certificate is expired or has not been issued by a trusted third party .
Critics say that Firefox 3.0 is putting undue fear and confusion into everyday Web surfers , makes it difficult to set exceptions for certain Web sites , and is forcing Web site operators to do business with specific vendors of SSL certificates or risk the appearance that their Web sites are broken .
Browsers require SSL certificates to initiate encrypted communications and to validate the authenticity of a site .
The Mozilla.com Web site , where Firefox 3.0 can be freely downloaded , defends the new feature , saying SSL certificates not issued by a validated certificate authority -- so - called self - signed certificates ( SSC ) -- do n't provide even basic validation ; and expired certificates should not be viewed as " harmless " because they open avenues for hackers .
Mozilla officials say the new feature helps curb electronic eavesdropping or so - called " man in the middle " attacks .
The certificate issue is cropping up on such major sites as the U.S. Army's , which uses certificates issued by the Department of Defense .
In the Army 's case , Firefox does not recognize the DOD as an authorized certificate provider .
Firefox , therefore , rejects the Army site 's certificate and defaults to a Web page showing a traffic - cop icon and proclaiming " secure connection failed " and that the site 's certificate can not be trusted .
The problem also has surfaced with expired SSL certificates on such sites as Google Checkout and LinkedIn .
The issue also could crop up on intranet sites that use SSCs and force IT administrators to configure exceptions within the browser or other workarounds .
Some are saying that Firefox 3.0 is out of line .
The Pingdom.com blog this week took Mozilla to task , saying the issue could affect tens of thousands of sites .
" People most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding SSL certificates are inexperienced users , and those are not very likely to understand the error message that Firefox 3 is displaying .
A large portion will simply be scared away , thinking that the Web site is broken , " according to the blog .
Developer Nat Tuck called the Firefox feature bad for the Web in a blog post he wrote July 31 : " Mozilla Firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ( SSL )
Web sites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital - certificate vendors .
This policy is bad for the Web . "
Tuck concedes that the SSCs provide no value for authenticating a Web site , but he says Firefox is ignoring the encryption capabilities of SSL certificates , which thwart snooping on Web traffic .
He even goes so far as to suggest perhaps open source advocates should create a derivative of the open source Firefox code that includes full SSL functions .
Mozilla.com officials says SSCs have been treated as " disconcerting " for some time by the open source browser and what changed in Firefox 3.0 is an attempt to make users understand the potential consequences of accepting such certificates .
The officials directed inquires on the certificate topic to a blog penned by Mozilla developer Jonathan Nightingale , who wrote that one reason for the changes is that man - in - the - middle attacks " used to be the stuff of scary security fiction , but now they are point - and - click . "
Some of these attacks were highlighted at the recent Black Hat conference .
Home cable and DSL routers , and Wi-Fi access points can be compromised easily by hackers , who can reconfigure the boxes and route traffic anywhere they want , Nightingale wrote .
" The only thing that will tell you whether the sites you are visiting are real is the existence of a trusted certificate , which only the legitimate site can have , " he added .
Nightingale wrote that SSCs are not evil , but the question is can they be trusted ?
" So we ask the user , " he wrote .
He also pointed out that users can create exceptions , in essence telling the browser to trust specific site certificates .
Nightingale did admit the SSL feature is n't above questioning .
" I do n't think the approach in Firefox 3 is perfect , I 'm not sure any of us do , " he wrote .
And he invited input and solicited help making browsing safer : " It sure would be nice if we did n't start from the assumption that changes are motivated by greed , malice , or stupidity . "
This story , " Debating the Firefox SSL Certificate " was originally published by Network World .

The tendency toward obesity is directly related to the brain system that is involved in food reward and addictive behaviors , according to a new study .
Researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine ( TUSM ) and colleagues have demonstrated a link between a predisposition to obesity and defective dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic system in rats .
Their report appears in the August 2008 issue of The FASEB Journal .
The mesolimbic system is a system of neurons in the brain that secretes dopamine , a neurotransmitter or chemical messenger , which mediates emotion and pleasure .
The release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the mesolimbic system is traditionally associated with euphoria and considered to be the major neurochemical signature of drug addiction .
“ Baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity - prone rats , compared with obesity - resistant rats .
Defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth , ” said Emmanuel Pothos , PhD , assistant professor in the department of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at TUSM and member of the neuroscience program faculty of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences .
“ Previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine , in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating , ” Pothos explains .
“ Also , chronic food deprivation resulting in decreased body weight leads to decreased dopamine levels .
Therefore , increased food intake may represent a compensatory attempt to restore baseline dopamine levels . ”
Pothos says , “ These findings have important implications in our understanding of the obesity epidemic .
The notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors . ”
He speculates that an attenuated dopamine signal may interfere with satiation , leading to overeating .
Pothos and colleagues conducted their research using obesity - prone and obesity - resistant rats .
Adult obesity - prone rats consumed more food and were 20 % heavier than obesity - resistant rats .
The researchers measured electrically - evoked dopamine release from nerve terminals .
“ We also measured regulators of dopamine synthesis and release in midbrain dopamine pathways , ” explains Brenda Geiger , first author and graduate student in the pharmacology and experimental therapeutics department at TUSM .
“ Our molecular analysis suggests that the central dopamine deficits are most likely caused by reduced expression of the genes encoding two proteins , one that is involved in dopamine synthesis , and another that is a transporter responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles from which it is later released upon stimulation . ”
“ Obesity has so far been approached mostly as a metabolic rather than as an addictive disorder ; and obesity research has primarily focused on brain systems that regulate body weight through the maintenance of energy balance .
The current study challenges this approach by focusing on brain pathways implicated in pleasure and reward .
These pathways could override energy balance and induce hyperphagia and obesity by altering the reward value of food , particularly palatable high - energy food , very early in life , ” says Pothos , who is the study ’s corresponding and senior author .
According to Gerald Weissmann , MD , editor - in - chief of The FASEB Journal , “ Now we know why so many people stay addicted to food : it fuels the mid-brain pleasure machinery .
We eat not only for nourishment , but also for pleasure .
This study provides the molecular link between eating and mental health . ”

----------------------------
Meta Pragma No Cache
The Meta Pragma No Cache tag is used to prevent visitors from seeing a cached version of a specific page .
The Meta Pragma No Cache tag forces the browser to pull information from the server each time the page is viewed .
Example of the Meta Pragma No Cache tag :
Recommendations for the Meta Pragma No Cache tag :
The Meta Pragma No Cache tag has no affect on search engines and is mainly implemented with the intent of helping users .
For example , if you have a site that changes on a daily basis , the Meta Pragma No Cache tag would ensure that the visitor sees the most recent version of the page .
However , since you are pulling information from the server each time a visitor views the page , the load time will be affected as well as incurring increased server activity .
Google has stated : " The http - equiv values pragma and expires are attempts at bypassing caches without having to set the HTTP headers correctly .
These are probably unnecessary uses ; any scenario where there is a legitimate reason to limit caching , the author is going to have enough control over the server to send the appropriate headers .
In addition , the meta tags can't be considered reliable ( e.g. proxies and transparent caches are n't going to honor them ) . "
In my opinion , it is better to set the HTTP headers correctly .
Note :
The above also applies to the Meta Expires Tag .

----------------------------
Meta Publisher

Some sites recommend using this tag .
However , these recommendations have no basis in fact as the governing body of HTML has no reference to it .
According to our testing , this tag has no merit .
Recommendations for Meta Rating tag :
It is recommended not to use the Meta Rating tag .
The fact that there is not a set form for the Meta Rating tag suggests you would be better off acquiring a rating from the International International Content Rating Association .

A judge has ordered JoAn Karkos of Lewiston , Maine to return two copies of It 's Perfectly Normal : Changing Bodies , Growing Up , Sex and Sexual Health , which she checked out the Lewiston and Auburn public libraries last year .
In September , Karkos sent letters to the libraries , including checks to pay for the cost of the books .
The letters said , in part , " I have been sufficiently horrified of the illustrations and sexually graphic , amoral , abnormal contents .
I will not be returning the books . "
The judge has ordered Karkos , who is being held in contempt of court , to return the books and pay a $ ( removed ) fine by Friday at 4 pm .
If she does n't comply , she 'll be arrested .
In 2007 , NPR reported on the incident , providing several links , including a link to a letter Karkos wrote to the Sun Journal .
Lewiston Woman Facing Jail Over Book
Motorists stuck on Mercer Street this summer have been treated to an odd overhead sight as they crawl under Aurora Avenue toward I - 5 .
Wielding banners and signs , a small band of protesters has appeared on certain evenings , waving at drivers below and encouraging them to honk if they hate Xenu .
On other nights , farther west in the Uptown neighborhood , the same merry pranksters have shown up outside an empty old office building declaring their opposition to thetans and federal tax exemptions .
Other times they march to Westlake or Seattle Center to hand out flyers .
Always they conceal their faces with bandannas and masks — often the smiling white plastic visage of Guy Fawkes from the Wachowski brothers ’ movie V for Vendetta ( which concerns a heroic rebel band fighting against a totalitarian state ) .
Xenu , you may recall , is the malign alien ruler who , in Church of Scientology doctrine ( codified in the 1950s ) , scattered the unhappy souls of extraterrestrials among us earthlings 75 million years ago , creating a host of mental problems that cannot be solved by modern psychiatry or pharmacology .
And now , following a notorious Tom Cruise video released earlier this year and a certain prior South Park episode , Scientology finds itself the target of a new generation of activists who have declared this coming Saturday , August 16 , to be their next worldwide Scientology protest day .
Hundreds are expected to participate in Seattle , where the publicity - shy church is undertaking a major expansion into new facilities in lower Queen Anne and downtown .
Their organization — many of them , actually , self - organized and leaderless on the Web — is called Anonymous .
Its Seattle members preferred to remain just that during recent meetings with the Weekly ; instead they go by their screen names .
During a recent meet - up in Redmond , a smart mob of Anonymous members gathered to spray - paint a wall by the local skate park ( with city permission ) .
The friendly , boisterous gang — median age about 20 — numbered around a dozen ; matching their unmasked faces to their screen avatars can make it difficult to assign quotes to exact parties .
Still , they feel passionate about their new cause , opposing the controversial church — which includes Dianetics , Narconon , and other arms — that charges its members thousands of dollars to be audited and made “ clear ” of alien particles .
Yet , strangely , none of these young activists are disgruntled former members of the church .
“ Not a whole lot of us are like , ‘ This affected me personally , ' ” says AnotherSP .
( SP in Scientology speak means Suppressive Personality , i.e. , an enemy of the religion and its tenets . )
Only one among the spray - painting party described a parent ’s prior involvement with Scientology .
According to AnotherSP , “ A lot of the ex-members are older .
The forums inherently attract younger members . ”
The “ forums ” include Web sites such as www.enturbulation.org ( at the national level ) and www.lulznw.com ( the Seattle chapter ) , which either launched or saw huge traffic spikes after the Cruise video went up on YouTube .
( “ We are the authorities in getting people off drugs , ” raves the actor on a cheap set with bad lighting , an ’ 80s guitar sample blaring in a soundtrack loop behind him .
“ We are the authorities on the mind .
We are the authorities on improving conditions .
Criminals , we can rehabilitate criminals . ” )
Attracting roughly equal attention was South Park ‘s 2005 “ Trapped in the Closet ” episode , which provided a cartoon thumbnail history of the religion and introduced Xenu to kids who were in diapers when Risky Business came out .
( Fun fact : South Park co-creator Trey Parker owns a condo here in Seattle . )
The Seattle version of Anonymous is “ only four months old , ” says an individual known as Anon , He Mussed , who at 30 is something of an elder spokesman for the group .
“ Kind of like the Battle in Seattle .
It ’s all self - initiative .
It just started with a few cities , like a Google group . ”
He claims that roughly 150 protesters participated in an April Anonymous event , which included a march to the Pike Place Market .
In a March event to commemorate the birthday of L. Ron Hubbard , the late sci- fi writer and Scientology founder , he guesses 250 people took part .
Come Saturday , when the group is planning another protest march , they ’re hoping for even higher numbers .
The group ’s hallmark , other than the masks , is a carnivalesque approach to protesting and pamphleting — no angry tirades or rock - throwing .
“ We ’re always on city property , ” says anonyk 23 .
“ We let the cops know .
Always adhere to the law — we follow that rule . ”
( The church disputes this . )
But why Scientology ?
Why not protest the Iraq War ?
The situation in Darfur ?
Or the Catholic church ?
Anon , He Mussed responds , “ We all have our own individual activist causes , but Anonymous is for this . ”
According to a local church - affiliated Web site , L. Ron Hubbard lived briefly in Seattle , attending Queen Anne High School , during the 1920s while following his father , a Navy man , from port to port .
Residing in Port Orchard during the late ’ 30s , he wrote a few of his early Scientology texts , some prompted by a supposedly near - death experience at a Bremerton dentist in 1938 .
Now members of his church may soon be able to look out on the same body of water that inspired Hubbard .
In 2005 , the Scientologists bought an old state - government building in lower Queen Anne for $ 3.7 million .
According to drawings and a description on the local Scientologists ’
Web site , the building eventually will be equipped with a rooftop deck “ looking out over Puget Sound where LRH used to live and write — a perfect place for pcs and students to go during session and course breaks , as well as for dissemination activities and events . ”
( A “ pc ” is a “ preclear , ” explains Seattle Scientology Reverend Ann Pearce , “ a spiritual being who is now on the road to becoming clear . ” )
But renovations , which would cost millions for any comparable project , have been slow in coming .
The city permits have been issued .
The five - story tower at Third Avenue West and West Harrison Street has seen weeds sprouting from the windowsills , some cracked windows , and graffiti tags outside .
It ’s partially ringed with construction fencing .
The 1955 building has been off the county tax rolls since it was sold ; in a controversial 1993 decision , the IRS granted Scientology tax - exempt status .
Members of the Seattle Anonymous chapter say the building is already in use .
They staged a protest there in June , the same night as a gathering — according to a church mailing — to meet “ the Commanding Officer of the entire Western United States . ”
( Maritime terminology runs strong in Scientology , which includes a branch called the Sea Org , whose officers wear naval attire . )
In Los Angeles , at its Celebrity Center , the church has n’t been shy about attracting recruits with star power — not only Cruise and John Travolta , but hipsters like Beck are among the fold .
Here in Seattle , however , there do n’t appear to be any high - profile politicians , public figures , or sports stars who ’ve been so identified .
So while the church raises money , it continues to rent space in a small , nondescript old complex alongside Aurora Avenue , just west of the new Lumen condo and QFC .
“ We ’ve been on Aurora for seven or eight years , ” says Reverend Pearce .
“ Our congregation wanted to own property and have a permanent location . ”
Is there a timetable for a move to the renovated building ?
“ There ’s no imminent departure at this point . ”
The church also paid $ 1.1 million last December for the basement of the Gilmore Building at Third and Pine , below a McDonald ’s , a Money Tree , and a low - income housing facility .
Pearce declined to discuss the property in detail , other than to say , “ We will be moving there as well .
Do n’t know when .
We ’re gonna be renovating it at some point , and the same with the location at Harrison [ Street ] . ”
Meanwhile , signs offer “ Free Stress Tests ” in the Gilmore entryway on Pine Street , which otherwise appears in a state of dusty disuse .
She describes the Anonymous protesters as “ a group of cyber - terrorists who ’ve been harassing us for six months .
This has been happening around the world .
On a local basis , they have attempted to infiltrate our church .
They ’ve trespassed , they ’ve graffitied our property , they routinely harass our parishioners and staff .
The police department is working with us on this . ”
However , Pearce would n’t give any particulars or police - complaint information , making her claims impossible to verify .
Again , Anonymous says it protests from the sidewalk , not on the premises .
Pearce would n’t confirm whether any church services are scheduled for this coming Saturday , when Anonymous plans its next protest .
What about extra security or other precautions ?
She responds , “ I ’m not circling any dates in my calendar with regards to Anonymous . ”

We warned you it was about to happen !
Even though you may have been clouded out of viewing this weekend ’s awesome alignment of Regulus , Mars and Saturn dancing with the Da Vinci Moon , our friendly photographers around the world were happy to share the view with us .
Unlike the many erroneous myths that often surround such occurrences , planetary alignments are nothing more than the visible clockwork mechanism of our natural skies .
While Saturn and Mars descend through the “ Sacred Hoop ” , we have to remember that such alignments are not rare – just natural .
Rumors and myths of calamities and catastrophe have abounded since the beginning or oral history when they occur , and it is amazing just how quickly these stories dissipate once the alignment has passed and nothing happened !
Without rehashing doomsday prophecies , we need to take a closer look at alignments for just what they are …
An awesome display of celestial mechanics .
Each and every planetary alignment holds an opportunity to expand awareness about astronomy .
It is a proven fact that the human eye follows the Gestalt Laws of Organization – the study of how people perceive visual components as organized patterns or wholes , instead of many different parts .
We develop a fixation on such patterns when we see them .
Ask yourself if your own eye is not drawn to this image of the alignment !
The parallax is so far and so slow , that we simply cannot attach anything more than a mystical sense of wonder at the visualization .
And that is not a bad thing …
It draws people to require an explanation for what they see .
Be a good astronomer and stop misinformation in its tracks .
When people you know ask about what they have seen in the sky , tell them !
Explain how the stars and planets work just like a clock , each following their gear and routine .
Alignments happen every hour … 1:05 and five seconds … 8:40 and 40 seconds .. and the sky is no different .
If our eyes were sensitive enough , just think of all the deep sky alignments that occur each month as the Moon and planets traverse the ecliptic plane !
How many stars hidden behind blue skies does our own Sun align with each and every second of the day ?
And stay tuned for the next awe inspiring event …

Watching financial markets these days is akin to rubbernecking at a multi vehicle car crash ; the initial rush of excitement and adrenaline gives way to sick sensations of horror and helplessness .
Here are five more signs that the credit crisis is far from over .
Feeling lucky , punk ?
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be " credibly and demonstrably privatised , '' Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president Jeffrey Lacker said this week .
Such a move would signal a capitulation on the part of the US government .
" If you have a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out , '' US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in July , when requesting the power to grant unlimited credit to the companies .
" If you have a bazooka in your pocket , and people know you have a bazooka , you may never have to take it out . ''
Fannie and Freddie 's share prices suggest Paulson 's attempt to bluff his way out of trouble has failed .
The Bank of England , Long - Term Capital Management and Bear Stearns have all learned a variant of John Maynard Keynes 's lesson - financial markets can keep pounding you in the head longer than you can stay solvent or irrational .
You know the credit crisis is n't over when the US government may have to turn its sponsorship of the mortgage companies into ownership .
More banks will go bust
" The worst is yet to come in the US , '' Kenneth Rogoff , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and Harvard University professor of economics , said this week .
" I do n't think simply having a couple of medium - sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job . ''
Rightly or wrongly , Lehman Brothers tops many people 's endangered lists .
Goldman
Sachs this week chopped its third - quarter earnings estimate for Lehman to a loss of $ US2.75 a share from a prior 68 - cent profit prediction .
JPMorgan Chase sees Lehman writing down an additional $ US4 billion ( $ 4.6 billion ) for the period , leading to a loss of $ US3.30 a share .
Lehman is trying to find a buyer for investment - management unit Neuberger Berman , three people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News .
You know the credit crisis is n't over when a bank that has seen its share price plummet 80 % this year starts selling the family silver to stay afloat .
Price insensitive
UBS is paying through the nose for its cash .
The Swiss bank this week sold 2 billion euros ( $ 3.4 billion ) of two - year floating - rate notes , offering investors 95 basis points more than three - month money - market rates .
At current rates , UBS is paying about 5.91 % for the first three months of money .
Back in November , UBS borrowed $ US1 billion for one year , paying just 6 basis points more than money - market rates .
In April 2007 , the bank sold 1.5 billion euros of five - year notes , paying a premium of just 4 basis points .
You know the credit crunch is n't over when UBS , which Moody 's rates just two levels below its top credit grade , with an assessment of Aa2 , regards two - year money at almost a full percentage point over money - market levels as worth grabbing .
Suckling on the central bank teat
When UK mortgage lender Northern Rock went bang , it said it was hobbled by not being able to borrow from the European Central Bank .
This week , Nationwide Building Society said it will open an office in Ireland to ``further diversify its geographical operations and funding opportunities . ''
In other words , the building society will rent a room in Dublin to qualify for ECB funds .
Picture that new Dublin office .
There 's a single employee , let 's call him Harry , persuaded to transfer across the Irish Sea by the promise of endless pints of Guinness .
Harry 's desk is bare , save for a red telephone with a single number programmed on speed dial that calls the ECB 's repurchase agreement desk .
A steaming pile of British mortgages sits in the corner , composting down nicely in preparation for being repackaged as asset - backed bonds and shipped to the ECB in exchange for crisp , freshly minted euros .
Harry knows that the ECB is currently lending banks with operations in a euro country about 476 billion euros a week .
You know the credit crisis is n't over when Harry joins the long , long line of funding officers dependent on central bank finance to keep their balls in the air .
' And the loser is ...'
General Motors is scrapping its sponsorship of the Academy Awards this year , said an unidentified GM spokeswoman cited in the Wall Street Journal .
Lehman analysts said yesterday that the automaker may need $ US7.3 billion of new capital to keep the factory lights on through 2009 .
You know the credit crisis is n't over when GM can't afford a measly $ US13.5 million to ferry Oscar to and from the red carpet .

Washington —
Two senior Jewish congressmen are distancing themselves from a resolution calling for tougher sanctions against Iran , arguing that the bill would send an unnecessarily bellicose message to Tehran .
Democratic Reps. Robert Wexler of Florida and Barney Frank of Massachusetts pulled their support — Wexler on July 9 , and Frank a week earlier — from a congressional resolution that called for increasing inspections on all sea and air traffic in and out of Iran , among other measures .
The bill has been targeted by a coalition of progressive groups that give an argument that the measure is pushing for a de facto blockade on Iran that may lead to war .
Jewish lawmakers and communal leaders have been treading a thin line on the issue of Iran ’s nuclear program , as they have been upfront in warning about Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Jewish groups and members of Congress , however , have gone out of their way to avoid being seen as promoting war or military action against Tehran .
“ It ’s a little trickier for the Jewish community , because there is a school of thought that believes the community bears disproportionate responsibility for the war in Iraq , ” said Mark Pelavin , associate director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism .
“ The fact that this claim is out there makes people be more measured this time around . ”
Israeli diplomats and policymakers have expressed a similar concern .
Over the past year they have repeatedly stressed that Iran is a threat to the entire Middle East , and that dealing with Tehran should be a task for the entire world and not just the Jewish state .
The nonbinding resolution , known as House Concurrent Resolution 362 , was introduced May 22 .
The clause that has drawn criticism from groups opposing military action against Iran calls for “ imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran . ”
The groups believe that the clause amounts to a call for imposing a military blockade against Iran .
Among those calling on lawmakers to turn down the proposed resolution is Americans for Peace Now , a dovish Jewish group that is pushing for a peaceful solution to the standoff with Iran .
In a July 8 letter to members of Congress , the group wrote that “ ambiguity in the text of the resolution has led some to see it as de facto approval for a land , air or sea blockade of Iran , any of which could be considered an act of war . ”
On July 9 , activists from the women ’s antiwar group Code Pink , which opposes the resolution , launched a symbolic blockade of the Washington houseboat of Rep. Gary Ackerman , a New York Democrat and one of the authors of the resolution .
Ackerman , who has faced mounting criticism for his support for the resolution , answered his critics in a hearing of the House Foreign Relations Committee that took place the same day as the blockade .
“ The whole idea that the resolution calls for a blockade can only be sustained by a determined refusal to read the resolution , or to accept the plain meaning of the words within it , ” Ackerman said .
The only way to find the term “ blockade ” in the resolution , he added , is “ by the amending power of imagination alone . ”
Ackerman ’s clarification , however , was not enough to prevent Frank and Wexler from withdrawing their support for the legislation .
In June , both had signed on to the resolution as co-sponsors .
“ I regret the fact that I did not read this resolution more carefully , ” Frank wrote July 5 to an activist from Peace Action , a grass - roots antiwar group that supports nuclear disarmament .
Frank , who chairs the House Financial Services Committee , promised to withdraw his support from the resolution as it currently stands .
Wexler voiced similar views in a Huffington Post article , pledging to “ lead an effort to make changes to this resolution before it comes to the foreign relations committee for a vote . ”
Wexler added he would condition his support for the resolution on changes being made to its language .
The resolution currently has 230 co-sponsors in the House , and this number ensures that it will be brought to a vote in the foreign relations committee .
A similar resolution has been circulating in the Senate , but that bill does not include the wording regarding restrictions on air and sea traffic into and out of Iran .
Both the House and Senate resolutions are among the top items on the agenda of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
The pro-Israel lobby is focusing its efforts on the elements of the resolution calling for the end of the sale of refined petroleum products to Iran , not on the part dealing with increased sea and air inspections .
The debate over the resolution , which has split Jewish lawmakers and activists , may be close to a solution , according to congressional sources .
A Democratic staff member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told the Forward that wording of the resolution is still open for change .
“ If it is not clear enough , it is the fault of the writer , not of the reader , ” the staffer said .
“ If it is not clear , we will clarify it . ”
The staff member did stress , however , that advocacy groups and members of Congress opposing the resolution “ did not do their homework . ”
Sometimes we just need to kick back and enjoy ourselves .
What follows is a list of 101 simple pleasures and enjoyable activities to explore without breaking the bank .
This list only skims the surface … the possibilities are endless .
Enjoy yourself .
These are the good old days you ’re going to miss in the years ahead .

HIGH BRIDGE , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
" The thought that I can reach out and permanently improve someone 's life for the better is addictive , " says Dave Schweidenback .
Dave Schweidenback saw transformative effects of bikes while in the Peace Corps in Ecuador from 1977 - 80 .
Several times a year , the 55 - year - old can be found prepping large shipments of used bicycles bound for a developing country .
For Schweidenback , gathering and breaking down these bikes is a labor of love -- one that is helping to keep the bikes out of landfills and give them new life .
" Used bicycles can transform the economic and social condition of families , " says Schweidenback .
" [ They ] give people access to jobs , health care and education that is too distant for walking . "
Since 1991 , Schweidenback 's nonprofit Pedals for Progress has collected and shipped more than 115,000 used bicycles to 32 developing countries worldwide , where they are sold at a low cost to local residents like Don Roberto Garcia .
" A used woman 's mountain bicycle changed my life , " says Garcia , 54 , a house cleaning supplies salesman in Nicaragua who works six days a week to support his six children and buy medicine for his wife , who suffers from cancer .
For 20 years , Garcia walked six to seven hours a day , hauling his merchandise in a wheelbarrow along a 6 mile route .
This earned him $ 2 - $ 3 a day .
" More than anything , I would always return home so tired from the walk , " Garcia recalls .
Little by little , Garcia saved his money and was able to buy a used bicycle six years ago from a Pedals for Progress partner agency in Jinotepe , Nicaragua .
" Because of a bicycle , I now earn about $ 4 a day , " says Garcia .
" I sell more and I do my rounds quicker .
I tell everyone to go buy a bicycle . "
Watch Garcia explain how a used bicycle has helped him in Nicaragua »
The seeds for Schweidenback 's Pedals for Progress were planted years ago while he was volunteering for the Peace Corps from 1977 - 80 in Ecuador , near the Amazon Basin .
" Besides the bus that comes through town and one guy that owned a pickup truck , everybody walked everywhere all the time , " he recalls .
" My landlord was the exception because he owned the only bike in a 500 - mile radius .
He was the most successful man in the region because he could access a job and get wherever he needed to go . "
Years later , Schweidenback noticed used bicycles at garage sales and in garbage cans throughout his New Jersey community .
" I remembered how [ the need ] in developing countries was so great , that I could n't stop thinking about it , " he says .
Knowing the bikes could be put to better use , Schweidenback asked members of his community to donate 12 used bicycles ; he planned to send them to Ecuador .
The community brought him 140 .
Within a year , Schweidenback had created Pedals for Progress and shipped roughly 500 bicycles to developing countries .
Today , Schweidenback organizes 140 used bike drives each year and , on average , collects 90 bicycles in three hours .
Donors are asked to pay a $ 10 fee per bike to help cover shipping costs and reduce the cost of the bicycle when it 's sold overseas .
Each bike is sold for about $ 15 .
Watch how Pedals for Progress bikes get from donors to people in developing countries »
" There 's a bike that 's unloved in every garage in this country .
Rather than put these old bikes in landfills for no reason , we can use them as economic stimulus to aid our neighbors , " Schweidenback says .
" This is the transfer of wealth between nations because these have great value overseas .
And they give people the ability to hold a job or a child the ability to go to school . "
Watch Schweidenback talk about his inspiration for Pedals for Progress »
Pedals for Progress bicycles have been sent to countries in Central America , Africa , Eastern Europe and the Caribbean .
For Schweidenback , knowing he 's making an impact keeps him going .
" You can change someone 's life with your bike . "
A good fake news story calls for fake hookers , and nobody knows that better than Lyndon Antcliff .
The internet marketer whipped up a phony story about a 13 year - old boy in Texas who used his father ’s credit card to go on a $ 30,000 spending spree , culminating with a game of Halo at a motel with a couple hookers .
( The kid convinced the hookers he was a midget traveling with the circus . )
The story was nothing short of genius , and it got picked up far and wide — it made it to the front page of Digg and into a segment on Fox News ( in which Jeanine Pirro made a passionate argument for the prostitutes ’ arrest ) .
It did n’t seem to matter that the story was made up .
" The thing is , I tried to make it as ridiculous as possible so it would be obvious that it would be fake , " says Antcliff , a writer by trade .
( Indeed , the story now has a disclaimer that it ’s a parody and " not to be taken seriously . " )
Antcliff , who wrote the piece on behalf of a client , estimates it garnered roughly 6,000 inbound links .
" It ’s been a lesson in the power of social media and the power of people suspending their disbelief .
[ Traditional news organizations ] are always banging about how inaccurate blogs are , but in this case , it was the opposite , " Antcliff says .
We did n’t get an official response from Google about how the search engine might treat fake content that ’s used as a marketing tool , but search quality guru Matt Cutts implied that the company frowns upon this sort of practice .
" My quick take is that Google ’s webmaster guidelines allow for cases such as this : ‘ Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here ( e.g. tricking users by registering misspellings of well - known websites ) , " Cutts wrote in a Sphinn forum .
" It ’s not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive technique is n’t included on this page , Google approves of it . ’
There ’s not much more deceptive or misleading than a fake story without any disclosure that the story is hoax . "
Things always seem to slow down as we approach this time of year , so I 'll post a OOPSLA 2007 video interview of Guy Steele on Programming Languages that I stumbled upon .
Covers a range of topics that are of interest to the current and future state of PLs .
Nothing too technically deep , but tidbits of interest scattered throughout the interview ( especially on DSLs ) .
( see also prior LtU discussion Guy Steele on Language Design ) .
( Maybe others have seen this before but I really like the interface that is provided for the video .
The list of questions are clickable links which move you to that place in the interview where the question was asked .
I hope this catches on for all technical video interviews . )
Some reaction around the web on the proposed bailout plan .
Yves Smith :
This is a financial coup d'etat , with the only limitation the $ 700 billion balance sheet figure .
The measure already gives the Treasury the authority not simply to buy dud mortgage paper but other assets as it deems fit .
There is no accountability beyond a report ( contents undefined ) to Congress three months into the program and semiannually thereafter .
The Treasury could via incompetence or venality grossly overpay for assets and advisory services , and fail to exclude consultants with conflicts of interest , and there would be no recourse .
Given the truly appalling track record of this Administration in its outsourcing , this is not an idle worry .
Paul Krugman :
... there ’s no quid pro quo here nothing that gives taxpayers a stake in the upside , nothing that ensures that the money is used to stabilize the system rather than reward the undeserving .
I hope I ’m wrong about this .
But let me say it again : Treasury needs to explain why this is supposed to work not try to panic Congress into giving it a blank check .
Otherwise , no deal .
Henry Blodget :
... the key question is what price the government will pay for those assets .
This will determine how much ( if any ) capital the banks need to raise to offset the losses and , thus , what their stocks are currently worth .
Felix Salmon :
American taxpayers will have new obligations : in order to buy those bonds , the government is going to have to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars .
That 's new debt , and government debt .
But there 's no government guarantee on anything .
And if you own a CDO or some other mortgage obligation , the government is definitively not going to step in and make sure you get paid in full .

Joe Biden takes the fight over " judgment " straight to McCain , arguing that time after time , on issues after issue , John McCain has been wrong and Barack Obama has been right .

The fact is , al - Qaida and the Taliban — the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 — have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks .
And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack ’s call for more troops .
Now , despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy , John McCain says Barack Obama is n’t ready to protect our national security .
Now , let me ask you : whose judgment should we trust ?
Should we trust John McCain ’s judgment when he said only three years ago , “ Afghanistan we do n’t read about it anymore because it ’s succeeded ?
Or should we trust Barack Obama , who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan ?
Full transcript below the fold :
BIDEN : Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you , John Kerry .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you .
Thank you , thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you .
I appreciate it .
Thank you very much .
You know , folks , my dad used to have an expression .
He ’d say , “ A father knows he ’s a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and know that they turned out better than he did . ”
I ’m a success ; I ’m a hell of a success .
Beau , I love you .
I ’m so proud of you .
I ’m so proud of the son you ’ve become ; I ’m so proud of the father you are .
And I ’m also so proud of my son , Hunter , and my daughter , Ashley .
And my wife , Jill , the only one who leaves me both breathless and speechless at the same time .
It ’s an honor to share the stage tonight with President Clinton , a man who I think brought this country so far along that I only pray we do it again .
And last night — and last night , it was moving to watch Hillary , one of our great leaders , a great leader of this party , a woman who has made history and will continue to make history …
… a colleague , my friend , Senator Hillary Clinton .
And I am truly honored — I am truly honored to live in a country with the bravest warriors in the world .
And I ’m honored to represent the first state , my state , the state of Delaware .
Since I ’ve never been called a man of few words , let me say this simply as I can : Yes .
Yes , I accept your nomination to run and serve with Barack Obama , the next president of the United States of America .
Let me make this pledge to you right here and now .
For every American who is trying to do the right thing , for all those people in government who are honoring the pledge to uphold the law and honor the Constitution , no longer will you hear the eight most - dreaded words in the English language , “ The vice president ’s office is on the phone . ”
Barack and I took very different journeys to this destination , but we share a common story .
Mine began in Scranton , Pennsylvania , and then Wilmington , Delaware .
My dad — my dad , who fell on hard times , always told me , though , “ Champ , when you get knocked down , get up .
Get up . ”
I was taught — I was taught that by my dad .
And , God , I wish my dad was here tonight .
But I thank God and I ’m grateful that my mom , Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden is here tonight .
Mom , I love you .
You know , my mom taught her children — all the children who flocked to our house — that you ’re defined by your sense of honor and you ’re redeemed by your loyalty .
She believes that bravery lives in every heart , and her expectation is that it will be summoned .
Failure — failure at some point in your life is inevitable , but giving up is unforgivable .
As a child — as a child , I stuttered , and she lovingly would look at me and tell me , “ Joey , it ’s because you ’re so bright you ca n’t get the thoughts out quickly enough . ”
When I was not as well - dressed as the other kids , she ’d look at me and say , “ Joey , oh , you ’re so handsome , honey , you ’re so handsome . ”
And when I got — when I got knocked down by guys bigger than me — and this is the God ’s truth — she sent me back out and said , “ Bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day . ”
And that ’s what I did .
You know — and after the accident , she told me , she said , “ Joey , God sends no cross that you cannot bear . ”
And when I triumphed , my mother was quick to remind me it was because of others .
My mother ’s creed is the American creed :
No one is better than you .
Everyone is your equal , and everyone is equal to you .
My parents taught us …
My parents taught us to live our faith and to treasure our families .
We learned the dignity of work , and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough .
That was America ’s promise .
And for those of us who grew up in middle - class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington , that was the American dream .
Ladies and gentlemen , but today , today that American dream feels like it ’s slowly slipping away .
I do n’t have to tell you that .
You feel it every single day in your own lives .
I ’ve never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up .
Almost every single night — almost every single night , I take the train home to Wilmington , Delaware , sometimes very late .
As I sit there in my seat and I look out that window , I see those flickering lights of the homes that pass by , I can almost hear the conversation they ’re having at their kitchen tables after they put their kids to bed .
Like millions of Americans , they ’re asking questions as — as ordinary as they are profound , questions they never , ever thought they ’d have to ask themselves .
Should Mom move in with us now that — now that Dad ’s gone ?
Fifty , sixty , seventy dollars just to fill up the gas tank , how in God ’s name , with winter coming , how are we going to heat the home ?
Another year , no raise .
Did you hear — did you hear they may be cutting our health care at the company ?
Now — now we owe more money on our home than our home is worth .
How in God ’s name are we going to send the kids to college ?
How are we going to retire , Joe ?
You know , folks , that ’s the America that George Bush has left us .
And that ’s the America we ’ll continue to get if George — excuse me , if John McCain is elected president of the United States of America .
Freudian slip .
Freudian slip .
And , folks , these are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck .
These are common stories among middle - class people who worked hard their whole life , played by the rules , on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays .
That promise is the promise of America .
It defines who we are as a people .
And now — and now it ’s in jeopardy .
I know it .
You know it .
But John McCain does n’t get it .
Barack Obama gets it .
Like many of us , Barack worked his way up .
His is a great American story .
You know , I believe the measure of a man is n’t just the road he ’s traveled ; it ’s the choices he ’s made along the way .
Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college .
With all his talent and promise , he could have written his ticket to Wall Street .
But that ’s not what he chose to do .
He chose to go to Chicago .
The South Side .
There he met men and women who had lost their jobs .
Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed .
Their dreams deferred .
Their dignity shattered .
Their self - esteem gone .
And he made their lives the work of his life .
That ’s what you do when you ’ve been raised by a single mom , who worked , went to school and raised two kids on her own .
That ’s how you come to believe , to the very core of your being , that work is more than a paycheck .
It ’s dignity .
It ’s respect .
It ’s about whether you can look your children in the eye and say : we ’re going to be OK .
Because Barack made that choice , 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois .
He fought to make that happen .
And because Barack made that choice , working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work .
He got it done .
And when he came to Washington , I watched him hit the ground running , leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation .
He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists .
And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve .
You can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him , debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure .
You learn about the strength of his mind , but even more importantly , you learn about the quality of his heart .
I watched how he touched people , how he inspired them , and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all :
We do n’t have to accept a situation we cannot bear .
We have the power to change it .
That ’s Barack Obama , and that ’s what he will do for this country .
He ’ll change it .
John McCain is my friend .
We ’ve known each other for three decades .
We ’ve traveled the world together .
It ’s a friendship that goes beyond politics .
And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me .
But I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country .
For example , John thinks that during the Bush years “ we ’ve made great progress economically . ”
I think it ’s been abysmal .
And in the Senate , John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time .
Give me a break .
When John McCain proposes $ 200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate America , $ 1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies , but no relief for 100 million American families , that ’s not change ; that ’s more of the same .
Even today , as oil companies post the biggest profits in history — a half trillion dollars in the last five years — he wants to give them another $ 4 billion in tax breaks .
But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy : solar , wind , biofuels .
That ’s not change ; that ’s more of the same .
Millions of jobs have left our shores , yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there .
That ’s not change ; that ’s more of the same .
He voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage .
For people who are struggling just to get to the next day , that ’s not change ; that ’s more of the same .
And when he says he will continue to spend $ 10 billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $ 80 billion , that ’s not change ; that ’s more of the same .
The choice in this election is clear .
These times require more than a good soldier ; they require a wise leader , a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need .
Barack Obama will deliver that change .
Barack Obama will reform our tax code .
He ’ll cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people who draw a paycheck .
That ’s the change we need .
Barack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority , creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil .
That ’s the change we need .
Barack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out - compete us tomorrow .
He ’ll invest in the next generation of teachers .
He ’ll make college more affordable .
That ’s the change we need .
Barack Obama will bring down health care costs by $ 2,500 for the typical family , and , at long last , deliver affordable , accessible health care for all Americans .
That ’s the change we need .
Barack Obama will put more cops on the streets , put the “ security ” back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women .
That ’s the change we need .
As we gather here tonight , our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history .
The Bush - McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out .
For the last seven years , this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century : the emergence of Russia , China and India as great powers ; the spread of lethal weapons ; the shortage of secure supplies of energy , food and water ; the challenge of climate change ; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the real central front against terrorism .
In recent days , we ’ve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia ’s challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia .
Barack Obama and I will end this neglect .
We will hold Russia accountable for its actions , and we ’ll help the people of Georgia rebuild .
I ’ve been on the ground in Georgia , Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan , and I can tell you in no uncertain terms : this administration ’s policy has been an abject failure .
America cannot afford four more years of this .
Now , despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy , John McCain says Barack Obama is n’t ready to protect our national security .
Now , let me ask you : whose judgment should we trust ?
Should we trust John McCain ’s judgment when he said only three years ago , “ Afghanistan we do n’t read about it anymore because it ’s succeeded ?
Or should we trust Barack Obama , who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan ?
The fact is , al - Qaida and the Taliban — the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 — have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks .
And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack ’s call for more troops .
John McCain was wrong .
Barack Obama was right .
Should we trust John McCain ’s judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked :
What is there to talk about ?
Or Barack Obama , who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change .
Now , after seven years of denial , even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran , because that ’s the best way to advance our security .
Again , John McCain was wrong .
Barack Obama was right .
Should we trust John McCain ’s judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq that we must stay indefinitely ?
Or should we listen to Barack Obama , who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home ?
Now , after six long years , the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home .
John McCain was wrong .
Barack Obama was right .
Again and again , on the most important national security issues of our time , John McCain was wrong , and Barack Obama was proven right .
Folks , remember when the world used to trust us ?
When they looked to us for leadership ?
With Barack Obama as our president , they ’ll look to us again , they ’ll trust us again , and we ’ll be able to lead again .
Jill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey .
When I look at their young children — and when I look at my grandchildren — I realize why I ’m here .
I ’m here for their future .
And I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington .
I am here for the cops and firefighters , the teachers and assembly line workers — the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures .
Our greatest presidents — from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy — they all challenged us to embrace change .
Now , it ’s our responsibility to meet that challenge .
Millions of Americans have been knocked down .
And this is the time as Americans , together , we get back up .
Our people are too good , our debt to our parents and grandparents too great , our obligation to our children is too sacred .
These are extraordinary times .
This is an extraordinary election .
The American people are ready .
I ’m ready .
Barack Obama is ready .
This is his time .
This is our time .
This is America ’s time .
May God bless America and protect our troops .
The Turkish crackpot creationist known as Harun Yahya ( Adnan Oktar ) has actually succeeded in getting a court order to block Turkey ’s access to the web site of British biologist Richard Dawkins .
Ankara -
Turkish internet users have been blocked via a court order from accessing the site of prominent British biologist Richard Dawkins after complaints from lawyers for Islamic creationist author Adnan Oktar , the website of Turkish television station NTV reported on Wednesday .
A court in Istanbul ordered that Turk Telekom block access to the site and since the weekend Turkish internet users seeking the site have been redirected to a page that says in Turkish ‘ access to this site has been suspended in accordance with a court decision ’ .
NTV reported that Oktar complained he and his creationist book ‘ Atlas of Creation ’ had been defamed by comments made by Dawkins on the site .
‘ I am at a loss to reconcile the expensive and glossy production values of this book with the breathtaking inanity of the content , ’ Dawkins , a distinguished advocate of the theory of evolution , wrote on his website in July referring to the Atlas of Creation .
" 105° tomorrow ?
We 'll be sending you out live , " the television producer informed me .
Like most TV Meteorologists , I loathed the heat wave live - remotes .
I would much rather work in a controlled environment , complete with air conditioning and a green Chroma - key screen .
And during extreme weather events , the studio lent itself to professionalism rather than playing on emotion .
" Let me guess , the bank in Walnut Creek ? " I said sarcastically .
I had been through this drill many times .
" Perfect location .
Plus , a lot of viewers with ratings meters out there . "
Walnut Creek is an upscale town 30 miles east of San Francisco .
It is sheltered from the cooling influences of the coast and the Bay by a modest mountain range .
As a result , in the summer that region can bake .
The bank not only referenced the name of the town , but had a thermometer that was several degrees off , thanks to the heat absorbing black asphalt on the adjacent multi-lane street and the pavement of the nearby parking lot .
The producer knew 105° would easily read 110° .
On air , I always quickly explained the reason for the soaring temperature reading for our audience , but it was not enough .
The misleading visual message was absolutely clear : 110° in Walnut Creek - another sign of climate doom !
No doubt about it , the climate was under assault .
It had to be global warming .
No , it 's global whining .
Even without the bogus bank thermometer , a heat wave - or even a hot year - does not indicate global warming .
More important , such weather does not point to any warming created by mankind 's utilization of fossil fuels .
But telling that to the stooges on Capital Hill who are debating energy policies like Cap and Trade is like trying to tell the TV producer not to mislead the audience by sending the weatherguy to the bank thermometer in Walnut Creek .
The world 's most thorough historical temperature record is found amongst the 1,221 official , government - sanctioned weather monitoring stations that have been recognized as a part of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) .
Most of the stations within this network have records that date back to the 1800s .
The beauty of this system is that in so many cases the environs where the thermometer is housed has changed little over the decades , providing critical data to determine major long - term trends .
In some instances thermometers within the Network have been encroached upon by urban sprawl and their readings notably have trended upward .
However , for the locations that have remained relatively stable , the temperature record hardly reeks of global warming .
A perfect illustration is found when comparing the USHCN temperature records from Central Park in New York City to those taken a mere 55 miles away at West Point .
Readings in Central Park have been regularly measured since 1835 when the city 's population had just surpassed 200,000 .
Today , surrounded by a metropolis of eight million people filled with some of the world 's tallest buildings , a massive underground subway system , an extensive sewer system , power generation facilities , and millions of cars , buses , and taxis , the Central Park temperatures have been greatly altered by urbanization .
And , as one might expect , the Central Park historical temperature plot illustrates an incredible warming increase of nearly 4 °F .
The West Point readings have also been meticulously maintained since 1835 , but the environment surrounding the thermometer shelter has experienced significantly less manmade interference then the one in Central Park .
The West Point readings illustrate a significantly lower warming increase of only about 0.6 °F over the same 170 - year period .
This is remarkable given that the year 1835 is considered to be the last gasp of the Little Ice Age -- a significant period of global cooling that stretched back several hundred years .
Cries of out of control global warming become more dubious when one looks at the hottest decade in modern history , the 1930s .
The summer of 1930 marked the beginning of the longest drought of the 20th Century .
From June 1 to August 3 , Washington , D.C. experienced twenty - one days of high temperatures of at least 100° .
During that record - shattering heat wave , there were maximum temperatures set on nine different days that remain unbroken more than three - quarters - of - a- century later .
In 1934 , bone dry regions stretched from New York , across the Great Plains , and into the Southwest .
A " dust bowl " covered about 50 million acres in the south - central plains during the winter of 1935 - 1936 .
In some areas , the drought never broke until 1938 .
According to the National Climatic Data Center , 1936 experienced the hottest overall summer on record in the continental United States .
In fact , out of 50 states , 22 recorded their all - time high temperature during the 1930s , including :
110 º Millsboro , Delaware , July 21 , 1930
100 º Pahala , Hawaii , April 27 , 1931
109 º Monticello , Florida , June 29 , 1931
118 º Keokuk , Iowa , July 20 , 1934
111 º Phoenixsville , Pennsylvania , July 10 , 1936
120 º Seymour , Texas , August 12 , 1936
121 º Steele , North Dakota , July 6 , 1936
117 º Medicine Lake , Montana , July 5 , 1937 .
One might make the argument that the incredible rise in temperatures in the 1930s coincided with the first notable increase in CO 2 , thus , the gas can be linked to global warming -- but not honestly .
While levels of carbon dioxide continued to increase during the following three decades , temperatures actually decreased .
According to NASA , the average temperature on the planet between 1940 and 1970 dropped .6 °F .
By the mid-Seventies the media was abuzz with notions of the next Ice Age .
In its June 24 , 1974 edition , Time magazine warned ,
" Climatological Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive , for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age "
But those warning of global cooling soon became disappointed , as from 1970 to 1998 there was a slight increase in temperature ( .34 °F ) , noted in both USGCN record and verified by satellite observations ( which only became available in the Seventies ) .
Since 1998 there has been no additional warming and indeed , a global dip in temperature began in 2007 and has continued into this year .
All this said , when examining the data from the most trusted sites within the Historical Network beginning in 1930 to present , there has actually been a net - decrease in temperature .
This decrease is noted in all quarters of the continental United States .
Thus , the biggest chunk of global warming that has supposedly coincided with the Industrial Revolution and the increase in evil carbon dioxide , mostly occurred after the Little Ice Age and prior to 1940 .
And Congress needs to understand this : carbon dioxide is not our foe .
It is a fertilizer that is essential for life on planet earth ; it is no more a poison or pollutant than oxygen or water .
CO 2 is also the byproduct of progress .
The cars that allow us to drive to important places like work , worship , our kids ' sporting events , the beach or the mountains , run on a very efficient portable form of energy known as gasoline , derived from petroleum .
Our homes are heated , cooled , and lighted more often than not from natural gas .
Companies that make the products essential to our lives also rely on these two forms of energy to create and deliver their wares .
The carbon dioxide produced from these forms of energy is identical to the gas that is gently being emitted from your lungs as you read right now .
You are not expelling pollution : you are contributing to our planet 's carbon cycle .
And the earth has a variety of built in mechanisms to recycle your CO 2 .
Carbon dioxide accounts for only slightly more than 3/10000ths of our planet 's atmosphere .
And what percentage of the miniscule amount of gas is produced by the activities of man , including the utilization of fossil fuels ?
According to a thorough analysis by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center , a research wing of the U.S. Department of Energy , only 3.207 % -- well within historical norms .
And how much has CO 2 increased in the atmosphere over the past 150 years ?
Approximately 35 % .
In his must - read eco-thriller , State of Fear , Michael Crichton creates a brilliant visual to assist us in wrapping our minds around the components of Earth 's atmosphere .
On page 387 , he likens the atmosphere to a football field .
The goal line to the 78 yard - line contains nothing but nitrogen .
Oxygen fills the next 21 yards to the 99 yard - line .
The final yard , except for four inches , is argon , a wonderfully mysterious inert gas useful for putting out electronic fires .
Three of the remaining four inches is crammed with a variety of minor , but essential , gases like neon , helium , hydrogen and methane .
And the last inch ?
Carbon dioxide .
One inch out of a hundred - yard field !
At this point I like to add , if you were in the stands looking down on the action , you would need binoculars to see the width of that line .
And the most important point - how much of that last inch is contributed by man-made activities ?
Envision a line about as thin as a dime standing on edge .
Are you still worried about the dangers of CO 2 ?
Me , neither .
And historically , CO 2 has been significantly higher than today .
In data primarily gathered from ice cores , we see carbon dioxide levels were 500 times higher during the Cretaceous period , some 160 million years ago .
Many theorize that the dinosaurs were able to grow to such sizes because of the indescribable abundance of carbon fed foliage and overall atmospheric conditions present during that era .
Certainly the SUV could not be blamed for those high levels of CO 2 .
Dinosaur flatulence , perhaps ?
Despite the cries of Congress , the Earth does not have a fever and carbon dioxide is no more dangerous than the breath of life .
During the fall elections we need to cap the rhetoric from some of these political whiners by trading them in for people who know a good thermometer when they see it .
Back to you in the studio ...
My NSA Polygraphs
I am writing in a moment of despair .
I am 22 years old , fresh out of school , working for a NSA contractor in MD .
I recently took 2 successive NSA polygraphs which , when the paperwork goes through , will end my career and reason for living .
In college I interned at DoD and got a Secret level clearance .
Upon graduating finding a job was quite challenging .
My only leg up proved to be my existing security clearance .
I never wanted to work for the NSA but my current job was the only offer I received which didnt require going to Iraq .
When I went in for my polygraph I did not research it , obeying the advice of my coworkers .
The Polygrapher was very nice and the environment professional .
While I was nervous I answered all the questions honestly and confessed to all my minor indiscretions .
I was then called back for another interview a week later .
This was completely different .
My second polygraph in no way resembled the first .
While professional , she convinced me I was already a sure bet and that we just had to get through this process .
 The NSA is not interested in people with no history of indiscretion ,  I was told .
 There is a war on and we need smart people that have been around the block . 
Over the course of several hours of talking about every little thing I could think of , I became convinced if I did not come up with some sort of juicy story I would never get cleared .
I proceeded to tell the Polygrapher everything I had witnessed in my college sorority but in the first person .
I talked about hazing and minor drug use .
While the hazing did not impress her , she lit up when I mentioned drugs .
She wrote down everything meticulously and kept prying for more .
In total I confessed to smoking marijuana about 10 times and using ecstasy once .
By the end of the exam I was mortified .
I couldnt believe the story I had made up .
I was so eager to please this woman I would have told her I killed Kennedy if she asked .
The truth of the matter is I was always too worried about getting hair tested to join my sisters out on the balcony .
I am a coward .
I almost crashed my car driving home .
I couldnt believe what had happened .
I now go to work and feel like I am living a lie .
I dont know what is going to happen .
I am sure I will not get a TS clearance but I am convinced my secret will be revoked as well .
When that happens I will get fired and will never be able to get either a government job or a professional license to do anything .
I am not qualified to do anything else and will be out on the street .
My life is over .
I cant believe the manipulation I was put through and how in a matter of hours all my lifes efforts were turned to garbage .
Everything is over .
I dont know what to do .

The pace of global oil demand growth should increase next year as rising consumption in emerging markets outweighs declines in developed nations hard hit by the high fuel costs and mounting economic problems .
The barrel of crude which sold for $ 65 in 2007 might soon cost $ 200 .
With such astronomical increase coming on top of a credit crunch , economists are talking seriously about the prospect of world recession and , even the worse , stagflation – the lethal combination of inflation and economic stagnation last seen in the 1970 ’s and early 1980’s .
We are told it is all due to a world shortage cause by soaring demand for oil in China and India , and that we can expect record prices to continue for eight years .
But is this really the case ?
Nowhere in the world are people queuing at petrol pumps ; there are no power blackouts and no idle tankers are waiting in the Gulf for oil .
On the contrary , oil storage tanks across the world are full , super tankers are queuing at ports to unload and no major oil field is closed .
Across the world , 86 million barrels of oil are produced every day which at the moment is sufficient , not least because consumption in America – which burns a quarter of the world ’s supply every day – is actually declining .
Alarmists also say that the world ’s oil supplies have passed their ‘ peak ’ , that the world has consumed half of all its oil and that the remaining 1trillion barrels will be gone by 2025 .
Read
This is quite simply tosh .
BP ’s experts and others insist that at least 4trillion barrels of oil are ready to be extracted and there are certainly many more trillions to find , not least in the Arctic and across the Atlantic .
No one it seems is willing to proclaim - the truth : there is no oil shortage .
The fact is that oil is an artificially high price because of a combination of factors .
First there is the greed of the oil traders , bankers and speculators in the world ’s financial centres who are pocketing billions .
Then there is the oil - producing countries whose economies profit massively from artificially keeping the oil price high .
And next there are the scare stories – from hurricanes heading for oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , power failures in Iraq or an oil pipeline being blown up in Nigeria – that these two groups exploit together in an unholy alliance to push the prices up .
There is no question that speculators – employed by Wall Street ’s hedge funds , pension funds and banks , have used the scare stories to drive up prices .
Producers have learnt the lessons of history .
They know only two well that it was Britain ’s North Sea oil that destroyed OPEC ’s first cartel during the 1980’s ; and that , in 1998 , their economies were ruined when prices plunged to $ 8 a barrel after OPEC responded to the West ’s demand for increased production .
Admittedly , circumstances have changed since then .
For the first time , China and India are aggressively competing for oil from the areas which traditionally supplied the U.S. and Europe .
Meanwhile , oil consumption in the newly enriched oil - producing states themselves is soaring as their populations explode .
But it would be wrong of those in the West to despair .
Firstly , after inflation and the weak dollar are taken into account , oil is only marginally more expensive than during another oil crisis in the 1980’s .
Back then , the bubble eventually burst and prices collapsed .
Secondly , if countries quickly commissioned alternatives including nuclear power , renewable energy and environmentally acceptable coal - fired power stations , the oil producers would become terrified that their source of income was endangered .
Remember two things : all price bubbles burst , and there are still vast untapped oil fields which will supply the world ’s needs for centuries to come .
On this page you can view the current price of gold per ounce , gram or kilo .
Gold is usually quoted by the ounce in U.S. Dollars .
The gold price can , however , be quoted in any currency by the ounce , gram or kilo .
The price of gold is constantly on the move and can be affected by many different factors .
Is the Gold Price the Same as the Spot Price ?
When looking at gold prices , the figures quoted are typically going to be spot gold prices unless otherwise specified .
The spot gold price refers to the price of gold for delivery right now as opposed to some date in the future .
Spot gold prices are derived from exchange - traded futures contracts such as those that trade on the COMEX Exchange .
The nearest month contract with the most trading volume is used to determine the spot gold price .
Why do Investors Care About the Gold Price ?
As with any other type of investment , those looking to buy gold want to get the best deal possible , which means buying gold at the lowest price possible .
By watching gold prices , investors can look for trends in the gold market and also look for areas of support to buy at or areas of resistance to sell at .
Because gold pretty much trades around the clock , the gold price is always updating and can even be viewed in real time .
Why are Gold Prices Always Fluctuating ?
The price of gold is in a constant state of flux , and it can move due to numerous influences .
Some of the biggest contributors to fluctuations in the gold price include :
Central bank activity
Monetary policy
Interest rates
Currency market activity
Inflation / deflation
Geopolitics
Risk appetite or aversion
Jewelry demand
Investment demand
Currency markets can have a dramatic effect on the gold price .
Because gold is typically denominated in U.S. Dollars , a weaker dollar can potentially make gold relatively less expensive for foreign buyers while a stronger dollar can potentially make gold relatively more expensive for foreign buyers .
This relationship can often be seen in the gold price .
On days when the dollar index is sharply lower , gold may be moving higher .
On days when the dollar index is stronger , gold may be losing ground .
Interest rates are another major factor on gold prices .
Because gold pays no dividends and does not pay interest , the gold price may potentially remain subdued during periods of high or rising interest rates .
On the other hand , if rates are very low , gold may potentially benefit as it keeps the opportunity cost of holding gold to a minimum .
Of course , gold could also move higher even with high interest rates , and it could move lower even during periods of ultra - low rates .
Monetary policy can also affect the gold price .
If a government is actively engaged in quantitative easing or other stimulus programs , those programs may potentially weaken the country ’s currency , possibly making gold more attractive .
In addition , such QE programs also add to sovereign debt levels , potentially also making hard assets like gold more attractive .
Is the Live Gold Price Just for the U.S. ?
Gold is traded all over the globe , and is most often transacted in U.S. Dollars .
Gold can , however , also be transacted in any other currency after appropriate exchange rates have been accounted for .
That being said , the price of gold is theoretically the same all over the globe .
This makes sense given the fact that an ounce of gold is the same whether it is bought in the U.S. or Asia .
The price of gold is available around the clock , and trading essentially never ceases .
While investors in the U.S. are sound asleep , for example , gold trading in Asian markets may be robust .
The market is very transparent , and live gold prices allow investors to stay on top of any significant shifts in price .
The current gold price can be readily found in newspapers and online .
Although prices per ounce in dollars are typically used , you can also easily access the gold price in alternative currencies and alternative weights .
Smaller investors , for example , may be more interested in the price of gold per gram than ounces or kilos .
Larger investors who intend to buy in bulk will likely be more interested in the gold price per ounce or kilo .
Whatever the case may be , live gold prices have never been more readily accessible , giving investors the information they need to make buying and selling decisions .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new report published on Friday , 5 September , provides the most comprehensive evidence available to confirm that the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) 's switch - on , due on Wednesday next week , poses no threat to mankind .
Nature 's own cosmic rays regularly produce more powerful particle collisions than those planned within the LHC , which will enable nature 's laws to be studied in controlled experiments .
The LHC Safety Assessment Group have reviewed and updated a study first completed in 2003 , which dispels fears of universe - gobbling black holes and of other possibly dangerous new forms of matter , and confirms that the switch - on will be completely safe .
The report , ' Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions ' , published in IOP Publishing 's Journal of Physics G : Nuclear and Particle Physics , proves that if particle collisions at the LHC had the power to destroy the Earth , we would never have been given the chance to exist , because regular interactions with more energetic cosmic rays would already have destroyed the Earth or other astronomical bodies .
The Safety Assessment Group writes , " Nature has already conducted the equivalent of about a hundred thousand LHC experimental programmes on Earth – and the planet still exists . "
The Safety Assessment Group compares the rates of cosmic rays that bombard Earth , other planets in our solar system , the Sun and all the other stars in our universe itself to show that hypothetical black holes or strangelets , that have raised fears in some , will in fact pose no threat .
The report also concludes that , since cosmic - ray collisions are more energetic than those in the LHC , but are incapable of producing vacuum bubbles or dangerous magnetic monopoles , we should not fear their creation by the LHC .
LHC collisions will differ from cosmic - ray collisions in that any exotic particles created will have lower velocities , but the Safety Assessment Group shows that even fast - moving black holes produced by cosmic rays would have stopped inside the Earth or other astronomical bodies .
Their existence proves that any such black holes could not gobble matter at a risky rate .
As the Safety Assessment Group writes , " Each collision of a pair of protons in the LHC will release an amount of energy comparable to that of two colliding mosquitoes , so any black hole produced would be much smaller than those known to astrophysicists . "
They conclude that such microscopic black holes could not grow dangerously .
As for the equally hypothetical strangelets , the review uses recent experimental measurements at the Brookhaven National Laboratory 's Relativistic Heavy - Ion Collider , New York , to prove that they will not be produced during collisions in the LHC .

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department announced a massive program Friday to shore up the nation 's money - market mutual - fund sector , responding to concerns that the global financial crisis is starting to affect those historically safe assets .
In addition , the Federal Reserve is expanding its liquidity programs , which should help money funds meet redemption demand .
The initiative includes purchasing certain short - term debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Federal Home Loan Banks .

The leader of the military wing of an Islamist insurgent organisation in Somalia has been killed in an overnight air strike .
Aden Hashi Ayro , al - Shabab 's military commander , died when his home in the central town of Dusamareb was bombed .
Ten other people , including a senior militant , are also reported dead .
A US military spokesman told the BBC that it had attacked what he called a known al - Qaeda target in Somalia , but refused to give further details .
Al - Shabab , considered a terrorist group by the US , is the military wing of the Somali Sharia courts movement , the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) , until Ethiopian troops ousted them in 2006 .
The group has since regrouped and is in effect in control of large parts of central and southern Somalia .
' Scorched earth '
An al - Shabab spokesman , Mukhtar Robow Adumansur , told the BBC that Ayro was killed along with another militant commander in the attack .
Locals said it happened at about 0300 ( 0000 GMT ) .
Profile : Somalia 's Islamic ' lads ' Q&A : Somali conflict
" We heard a huge explosion and when we ran out of our house we saw balls of smoke and flames coming out of house , " Dusamareb resident Nur Geele told the BBC .
" The house was totally destroyed to the ground , also other houses nearby , " local elder Ahmed Mumin Jama said .
Dr Ahmed Mahdi at Dusamareb Hospital told the BBC's Somali Service that he was treating eight civilians , including women and children , for burns and shrapnel wounds .
One of the women has since died , bringing the death toll so far to 11 .
He said identifying the dead would prove difficult as the al - Shabab villa and surrounding mud houses and trees were now scorched earth .
Ayro received training in Afghanistan in the 1990s and was an instrumental military figure as the UIC took control of Mogadishu in the second half of 2006 , says the head of the BBC's Somali Service Yusuf Garaad .
The US says al - Shabab is part of the al - Qaeda network , although correspondents say it is impossible to accurately establish those links .
Al - Shabab leaders say it is a purely Somali movement and they deny any involvement with al - Qaeda .
' No longer safe ' Mr Robow warned that there would now be revenge attacks by the al - Shabab .
" This incident will cause a lot problems to US interests in the region and the governments who support the US , by that I mean its allies who are puppets , " he said , referring to Ethiopia which backs Somalia 's interim government .
" I am letting the citizens of the US and the allies know they are not going to be safe in this area . "
In its annual report on terrorism published on Wednesday , the US said al - Shabab militants in Somalia , along with al - Qaeda militants in east Africa , posed " the most serious threat to American and allied interests in the region " .
Al - Shabab has been at the forefront of a guerrilla insurgency against the government and its Ethiopian allies since early 2007 .
In recent weeks , they have briefly captured several towns in central and southern Somalia before withdrawing .
The US has launched several air strikes against suspected extremist targets in Somalia in recent months .
It has an anti-terror task force based in neighbouring Djibouti , and has accused Somali Islamists of harbouring those responsible for the 1998 attacks on its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The Islamists denied this .
Somalia has not had an effective national government since 1991 .

A staple of Hiroshima Revisionism has been the contention that the government of Japan was prepared to surrender during the summer of 1945 , with the sole proviso that its sacred emperor be retained .
President Harry S. Truman and those around him knew this through intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages , the story goes , but refused to extend such an assurance because they wanted the war to continue until atomic bombs became available .
The real purpose of using the bombs was not to defeat an already - defeated Japan , but to give the United States a club to use against the Soviet Union .
Thus Truman purposely slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Japanese , not to mention untold thousands of other Asians and Allied servicemen who would perish as the war needlessly ground on , primarily to gain diplomatic advantage .
One might think that compelling substantiation would be necessary to support such a monstrous charge , but the revisionists have been unable to provide a single example from Japanese sources .
What they have done instead amounts to a variation on the old shell game .
They state in their own prose that the Japanese were trying to surrender without citing any evidence and , to show that Truman was aware of their efforts , cite his diary entry of July 18 [ 1945 ] referring to a " telegram from Jap Emperor asking for peace . "
A las 14.26 del pasado 20 de agosto , en la torre de control de Barajas cundía el desconcierto : " Ha habido un accidente en la cabecera de la 33 izquierda [ en realidad la pista es la 36 ] .
Creemos que de aviación .
Hemos visto el fuego y el humo " .
Ese mensaje activó el plan de emergencia en el aeropuerto .
Dos minutos antes de la conversación grabada entre la torre de control y los servicios de coordinación del aeropuerto , un MD - 82 de Spanair se había estrellado .
El accidente se produjo apenas unos segundos después de levantar el vuelo en una vaguada situada junto a la pista .
EL PAÍS ha tenido acceso a la reconstrucción en vídeo y audio del fatal accidente que costó la vida a 154 de los pasajeros del vuelo JK5022 .

Tony Blair 's hopes of becoming Europe 's first president are running into mounting opposition across the EU , with Germany determined to stymie the former prime minister .
A " Stop Blair " website run by pro-Europeans has launched a petition against him ; a transnational , cross-party caucus in the European parliament is forming to campaign against a Blair presidency ; senior officials in Brussels are privately dismissive about the new post going to a Briton ; and senior diplomats in European capitals also doubt that Blair is the right person for the post being created under Europe 's new reform treaty .
" There was surprise in Berlin when Blair 's name came up so soon , " said a European ambassador .
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany admires Blair and has " great personal sympathy for Tony " , he added .
" But more generally the German political elite would be puzzled by the idea of Tony Blair .
His track record on EU matters is not so great .
There is unease about a Briton at the top in that job .
And then personally with Blair , there 's the Iraq thing . "
Sources close to Merkel confirmed her opposition .
" He made a lot of fine speeches about Europe but , essentially , stood on the sidelines when it came to concrete steps forward , " they said .
The Lisbon treaty now being ratified by EU member states creates a new post of president of the European council , representing and chairing summits of the leaders of the 27 member countries from the beginning of next year for a maximum five - year term .
The president 's role and powers are yet to be properly defined .
EU ambassadors are expected to meet next month to try to come up with a job description .
Praising Blair as " the most European of Englishmen " , President Nicolas Sarkozy of France first threw the Briton 's name into the ring last October .
Blair has chosen not to dispel the reports of his candidacy .
EU officials believe a Blair bandwagon is being rolled out and hope to halt it in its tracks .
" The feeling here about Blair is that he never stuck his neck out for Europe , " said a senior official in Brussels .
" All the political risk he took was transatlantic , always towards Washington , never for Europe .
His chances are dim .
Merkel is against . "
The opposition to Blair feeds on his commitment to the Iraq war , Britain 's high rates of Euroscepticism , the government 's half - hearted ambivalence towards the EU and Gordon Brown 's battles over the past six months to exclude the UK from several key elements of the Lisbon treaty by " defending Britain 's red lines " against the rest of Europe .
" This is a treaty that marks quite a serious drift by the UK away from the EU , " said a second senior EU official .
" It would certainly help a country to get the job if it decided to opt in , " said Hans - Gert Pöttering , the German European parliament head , implicitly criticising Britain 's " opt out " of common policy areas such as the euro single currency , the Schengen border - free zone of 24 European states , and other parts of the new treaty .
" Brand Blair " is generally seen as the former Labour party leader 's strongest suit - his worldwide name recognition , talent as orator , skilled political salesmanship and that he enjoys influential links in Washington .
One European prime minister told the Guardian this was why he would support Blair against candidates from small EU countries or less well - known politicians .
Leaders or former leaders from Austria , Denmark , Luxembourg , and Ireland are mooted in Brussels as potential contenders .
A formal Blair candidacy would gather formidable support among EU leaders - in eastern Europe , from Sarkozy and from Silvio Berlusconi if returned as Italian prime minister .
But Blair is opposed by the small Benelux states , is unlikely to be backed by the centre - left government in Spain , and , most importantly , does not have Berlin 's support .
Senior social democrats in Brussels said Jean - Claude Juncker , the Luxembourg premier , would be pressed to go public as a rival candidate if José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is re-elected Spanish prime minister next month , " to stop the Blair bandwagon rolling " .
Formally , the post of president is to be decided by a qualified majority vote of EU countries , meaning that Germany , the EU 's biggest and most powerful member , could be outvoted .
But this is broadly seen as inconceivable .
" You simply cannot impose a candidate against Germany 's wishes , " said the sources close to Merkel .
U.S. - led coalition forces killed 76 Afghan civilians , mostly women and children , in a Friday attack in western Afghanistan , said the country 's Interior Ministry .
" Seventy - six civilians , most of them women and children , were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in Herat province , " the Interior Ministry said in a statement .
Nineteen women , seven men and the rest children , all under 15 years of age , were killed , the statement said .
The civilians were killed when coalition forces bombarded the Shindand district in Herat Friday afternoon , the ministry claimed .
Coalition troops denied killing any civilians in the air strike .
Coalition forces confirmed they killed 30 militants in an air strike early Friday morning in the Shindand district , but denied initiating any air strikes later in the day .
" We stand by our account and our reports and what we know and I can't reconcile why [ the Interior Ministry ] would have a different figure , " U.S. military spokeswoman Lt. Col.
Rumi Nielson - Green said Friday .
The Friday morning air strikes were in response to militant ambushes of coalition troops in Herat , the U.S. military said in a statement .
The overnight attacks by U.S. forces claimed the lives of civilians , a local council member in Herat told Reuters news agency .
Reports of civilian deaths in the attack differ widely .
The U.S. Defence Ministry in Kabul said five civilians perished in the attack , while a senior police officer told Reuters that " more than 30 , " civilians lost their lives .
The issue of civilian casualties in air strikes in the conflict in Afghanistan has been a sensitive one .
NATO has admitted its air strikes have caused many civilian deaths .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly condemned civilian deaths and earlier this month said air strikes succeeded only in killing civilians , not subduing insurgents .
More than 3,400 people — mostly militants — have been killed in insurgency - related violence this year , according to figures from Western and Afghan officials .

I 'm sure you understand , Kellie A .
Love works in bizarre ways .
Least expected can do wonders , while the tried and tested tricks can end up in dud !
Here come some handy tips to tickle the love button ...
Reach into his pocket for the keys
Well , more than just the keys .
The lesson is : Never underestimate the power of an unexpected touch .
Just by stimulating your partner���s nerve endings when they ���re not prepared for it , you create a positive physical connection that leaves your lover wanting more .
Keep him out of the loop
Remember , the less you tell him , the more interested he���ll become in you .
So to hook him in , when you ���re chatting , give him the conclusion of the conversation first .
For instance , �� �I got the job , ��� and then stop and wait .
You ���ve gotten his attention , now let them draw out the details .
Make small changes for big results
The trick to activate desire is to depart from your everyday look .
Maybe take a break from your trousers routine and move around in an evening gown .
Compliment your lover the right way
There ���s a trick to buttering up your lover right .
Make the compliment obscure and exclusive and it will sound more genuine .
He may dismiss your flattery with a wave of the hand , but deep down , he ���ll be loving every second of it .
Give your lover a sensory flashback
Think about when you first fell for your partner .
What reminds you both of that time .
Figure it out and you ���ve found the secret to conjuring up that new - love rush .
Your lover will experience something that they associate with falling in love with you ; those intense , sensual memories will trigger a positive physical reaction and generate instant longing .
Check out competition
Love works in bizarre ways .
If you want to renew your partner���s passion for you , slyly capture the eye of someone attractive .
It adds a bit of jealousy and a lot of attention .
To stoke your lover���s interest , trail someone with your gaze or flash a flirty smile at one of his friends when you know you ���re being watched .
And it never hurts to make an extra bit of effort with your looks when you know you ���ll be in a situation where others will admire you .
Just the possibility of others eyeing you all night will definitely make them appreciate that they ���re lucky to have you .
Leaving aside the pollution and the politics , the opening ceremonies at the Beijing Olympics , from the more than 2000 drummers that started the show , to gymnastic gold medalist Li Ning soaring around the top of the stadium before lighting the torch , were nothing short of spectacular .
Simply unbelievable pagentry .
And throughout the coverage , the advertisements were positive and upbeat , and often playing on the theme of the Olympics , " One World , One Dream . "
And then , on a break during the Parade of Nations , there was John McCain introducing himself to a huge , non-political audience by running an attack ad on Barack Obama .
Proving once again that he is willing to do or say anything to win , McCain chose to inject politics into the Olympics with a negative ad .
Unfortunately for McCain , the unspoken and unintended message was :
Vote for the old mean nasty guy you thought you admired eight years ago .
I'm John McCain and I approved this message .
Let the games ... continue .

Scientists have found an inexpensive way to produce hydrogen from water , a discovery that could lead to a plentiful source of environmentally friendly fuel to power homes and cars .
The technique , which mimics the way photosynthesis works in plants , also provides a highly efficient way to store energy , potentially paving the way to making solar power more economically viable .
Hydrogen is a clean , energy - rich fuel that many experts believe could become important as nations attempt to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
The gas can be produced by splitting water but current techniques are expensive , use harsh chemicals and need carefully controlled environments in which to operate .
Daniel Nocera , a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has developed a catalyst made from cobalt and phosphorus that can split water at room temperature , a technique he describes in the journal Science .
" I 'm using cheap , Earth - abundant materials that you can mass - manufacture .
As long as you can charge the surface , you can create the catalyst and it does n't get any cheaper than that . "
He said the discovery could have major implications for the uptake of solar photovoltaic technology .
One of the reasons , he said , why solar panels have not penetrated the consumer market properly is that no one has found a way to store energy in a way that , when the Sun is not shining , people still have electricity .
" You can't think about an energy economy or a global energy system only when the sun is out . "
Batteries could do the job but they cannot store anywhere near as much energy per unit mass as chemical fuels .
Nocera 's technique would allow the storage of excess energy from sunlight during the daytime .
" You could imagine , during the day you have a photovoltaic cell , you take some of that electricity and use it in your house , then take the other part of that electricity for my catalyst , feed the catalyst water and you get hydrogen and oxygen . "
At night , the hydrogen and oxygen could be recombined in a fuel cell to produce an electrical current to power a home or recharge an electric car .
" So I 've made your house a gas station and a power station .
It 's all enabled because we can use light plus water to make a chemical fuel , which is hydrogen and oxygen . "
Converting an Olympic swimming pool of water into hydrogen and oxygen per second would create 43 terawatts of power .
" In the next 50 years , the world needs 16 terawatts .
By the end of the century , we 'll need around 30 , " said Nocera .
" There 's a heck of lot of energy stored in chemical bonds . "
For a home , Nocera said that it would be enough to split a few litres of water per day into hydrogen and oxygen .
The water would be reformed when the gases were put through the fuel cell .
There is much work to be done in converting Nocera 's idea into a commercial product .
At the moment , his catalyst can only accept small amounts of electrical current at once , meaning that it would be an inefficient way to quickly store large amounts of energy .
But Nocera is certain that engineers will iron out the issues and produce commercial - scale products within a decade .
James Barber , a leading researcher in artificial photosynthesis at Imperial College London , said Nocera 's work was a " giant leap " toward generating clean , carbon - free energy .
" This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind .
The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . "

The production of sassafras oil , which is used to make the recreational drug ecstasy , in southwest Cambodia , is destroying trees , the livelihoods of local inhabitants and wreaking untold ecological damage , according to David Bradfield , adviser to the Wildlife Sanctuaries Project of Fauna and Flora International ( FFI ) .
The sassafras oil comes from the Cardamom Mountain area , one of the last forest wildernesses in mainland southeast Asia , and where the FFI project is based .
" The illicit distilling of sassafras oil in these mountains is slowly but surely killing the forests and wildlife , " Bradfield told IRIN .
" The production of sassafras oil is a huge operation , which affects not only the area where the distilleries are actually located , but ripples outwards , leaving devastation and destruction in its wake . "
The livelihoods of 12,000 - 15,000 people who depend on hunting and gathering to survive in the wildlife sanctuary are at risk from the sassafras production operations .
Cambodian sassafras oil is highly sought after as it is of the highest quality - over 90 percent pure , according to the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) in Cambodia , Lars Pedersen .
" Massive amounts of sassafras oil are smuggled every year into Vietnam and Thailand from Cambodia , " he said .
What is sassafras oil ?
Sassafras oil is made from the roots of the rare Mreah Prew Phnom tree - also known as Cinnamomum parathenoxylon .
The roots are first chopped into small blocks of wood and shredded into a fibrous consistency .
This is then typically put into large metal vats and distilled over hot wood fires for at least five days in the oil distillation process .
" [ The Mreah Prew Phnom ] is a very rare tree that is now beginning to disappear because of the illegal distilleries in the Cardamom Mountains , " Bradfield said .

The wood used to make sassafras is extremely rare and becoming extinct
Environmental toll
" The production of sassafras oil over the last 10 years has severely depleted these trees and if the illicit production is n't stamped out soon , they could become extinct in the near future , " he warned .
The large vats also need substantial wood to maintain the fires , so other species of trees surrounding the distilling factory are being depleted .
Deep in the jungle , the factories are heavily guarded and the workers who distill the oil live on wildlife in the area ; many are involved in poaching for commercial gain .
Rare animals , including tigers , pangolins , peacocks , pythons and wild cats are consumed by the distillers or sold in illegal wildlife markets , according to FFI .
" Sassafras oil processing plants are usually located besides streams to provide water for boiling and cooling the distilled oil , " Bradfield said .
The oil leaks into the streams , wreaking yet more environmental damage .
" There are frequently dead fish and frogs floating in the streams near these distilleries , " Bradfield said .
The water from this area flows down into the rest of Cambodia through the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers .
" Water tests in the area need to be carried out as a matter of urgency , " he suggested .
So far no tests have been carried out on the affect this water has had on villagers living downstream from the distilleries .
" But it 's certainly killing the fauna and flora in the vicinity of the factories , " he said , having seen the damage himself .
Four years ago the Cambodian government made the production of sassafras oil illegal in an effort to protect the Mreah Prew Phnom tree .
Since then the authorities have tried to eliminate the illicit production in the Cardamom Mountains with the help of international organisations , including FFI , the UN Development Programme , Wildlife Alliance and Conservation International .
" Law enforcement is the key to suppressing the illegal trade in sassafras oil , " according to the officer in charge of UNODC in Cambodia , Lars Pedersen .
" It 's a very lucrative trade , " he added , " worth millions and millions of dollars . "
These rangers are the foot soldiers protecting the forests .
They operate in thick , leech - infested jungle , risking their lives every day for a paltry salary .
Policing the area
Some 50 rangers from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry are currently policing the area with the support of independent conservation groups and the UNDP .
" These rangers are the foot soldiers protecting the forests , " said FFI 's David Bradfield .
" They are the heroes of the protection effort ...
They operate in thick , leech - infested jungle , risking their lives every day for a paltry salary , " he said .
FFI has supported the operations of these rangers since 2003 .
They provide their uniforms , equipment and training .
They help build their ranger stations and continue to give technical advice .
The UNDP also supported the project between 2004 and 2006 .
The rangers face stiff challenges in putting an end to the illegal trade given the large profits smugglers can make , and the relatively small number of rangers assigned to the task .
Last November the Thai authorities seized more than 50 tonnes of sassafras oil near the Cambodian border on its way to China and the USA , according to Western anti-narcotics agents who declined to be identified .
They said the single seizure was reported to be worth US $ 500,000 , a significant amount of money in rural Cambodia .
Once in China and the USA , where it could be used to make the synthetic drug , it could have produced 7.5 million tablets worth around US $ 150 million , according to Western anti-narcotics agents .

Aboard the International Space Station , an Expedition 28 crew member captured views of intensifying Hurricane Irene from an altitude of 225 miles at 3:33 p.m. EDT on Aug. 22 , 2011 , as the tropical system passed to the north of Hispaniola .
Atmospheric researchers tend to agree that tropical cyclones of unusual ferocity are coming this century , but the strange fact is that there is no consensus to date on the five - point scale used to classify the power of these anticipated storms .
In what may sound like a page from the script of the rock - band spoof Spinal Tap with its reference to a beyond - loud electric guitar amplifier volume 11 , there is actually talk of adding a sixth level to the current Saffir - Simpson hurricane scale , on which category 5 intensity means sustained winds higher than 155 miles per hour ( 250 kilometers per hour ) for at least one minute , with no speed cap .
The lack of an upper limit on the scale results in all of the most intense tropical cyclones getting lumped together , despite their wide range of power .
Category 5 becomes less descriptive when it includes 2005 's Emily , which reached peak wind speeds of 257.5 kph ( 160 mph ) and six hours in category 5 ; the same year 's Katrina which held peak wind velocity of 280 kph ( 175 mph ) for 18 hours in the category ; and 1980 's Allen , churning with peak winds at 305 kph ( 190 mph ) maintained for 72 hours in the highest category .
And now the ferocity forecast for the century adds to this classification problem .
" The severe hurricanes might actually become worse .
We may have to invent a category 6 , " says David Enfield , a senior scientist at the University of Miami and former physical oceanographer at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
This new level would n't be an arbitrary relabeling .
Global satellite data from the past 40 years indicate that the net destructive potential of hurricanes has increased , and the strongest hurricanes are becoming more common — especially in the Atlantic .
This trend could be related to warmer seas or it could simply be history repeating itself .
Data gathered earlier than the 1970s , although unreliable , show cycles of quiet decades followed by active ones .
The quiet ' 60s , '70s and ' 80s ended in 1995 , the year that brought Felix and Opal , among others , and resulted in $ 13 billion in damages and more than 100 deaths in the U.S .
The pros and cons of categories : Five or six ?
The average difference between the current categories equals nearly 20 mph , so a category 6 label would likely be applied to hurricanes with sustained winds over ( 280 kph ) 175 mph .
The speed and destruction of hypothetical " category 6 " storms is speculative , despite the hurricanes with winds at that level .
After all , meteorologists and climate researchers may not even choose a category 5 storm from the record books if asked to identify the most powerful tropical cyclone in history , because the Saffir–Simpson scale fixates on maximum wind speed lasting for at least one minute and disregards the many other large - scale components that factor into a storm 's level of devastation .
The whole index should be thrown out the hurricane - proof window , some say .
" If I could do it , I would do away with categories , " says Bill Read , director of NOAA 's National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) .
" The whole indexing [ of hurricanes ] was done back in the '60s and ' 70s when we had no way to convey the variables of damage that the storm did .
We did n't measure it that carefully ; we did n't have the tools . "
Even nowadays , instruments to measure actual wind speed are often destroyed during extreme storms , so estimates have to be extrapolated from satellite images and other data .
Actual observations can also be suspect .
It took 14 years for the World Meteorological Organization to acknowledge that an anemometer in Australia recorded a world record wind speed of 407 kph ( 253 mph ) during Tropical Cyclone Olivia in 1996 .
Wind speed science has improved over the years .
Since the 1990s direct wind measurements from hurricane - hunter aircraft have replaced central pressure measurements , which were often a proxy for wind speeds .
Variables used by meteorologists and climatologists to assess damage can go beyond wind speeds to include duration over land and the extent of deadly storm surges .
Read sums it up this way : " Size matters : Katrina , Rita , Ike — all of them made landfall at a 2 or 3 level , but look at the damage they caused .
Obviously a category did not accurately describe the impact . "
A transition to " impact forecasting " began last year when NOAA 's National Hurricane Center simplified the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale and renamed it the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale .
This change involved stripping away the scale 's former central pressure , flooding and storm surge estimates .
These factors among others are now forecast separately .
In 2009 the National Weather Service began using new probability models that provide storm surge estimates ranging from 0.6 to 7.6 meters ( two to 25 feet ) .
What the future holds
History keeps us guessing about where and when the next big tropical cyclone will hit on the U.S. Atlantic or Gulf coasts .
As for the most powerful hurricane ever , experts are divided .
Some say 1998 's Gilbert . ; an official answer from a NOAA Web site lists three : 1969 's Camille , 1980 's Allen and 2005 's Wilma ( the World Meteorological Organization agrees with the latter ) .
William Gray , professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and the " grandfather " of annual hurricane season forecasting , picked the category 4 Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 .
NHC Director Read went with an unnamed Caribbean hurricane from 1780 .
The Atlantic hurricane season , which runs from June 1 to November 30 annually , is predicted to produce more and stronger storms than average this year , although active years have been the norm since 1995 .
That year the Atlantic entered a period of warm sea-surface temperatures of what is called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation , and such cycles typically last two to three decades .
" If the future is like the past , we should have another 10 to 15 years of this active period , " Gray says .
This oscillation means the Atlantic is expected to cool in the future , obscuring links among hurricane activity and global warming .
Perhaps counterintuitively , recent computer modeling studies predict fewer tropical cyclones if the ocean heats up further as a result of global warming .
But they also predict intensification of the ones that do form , albeit with limited confidence .
Frequency drops by 6 to 34 percent this century , according to 2010 review article in Nature Geoscience , whereas intensity rises 2 to 11 percent .
( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group . )
Today , water is a bigger concern than the wind when it comes to property destruction and loss of life .
Look for more emphasis on storm surges in future forecasts , because it is the main reason why evacuations become necessary .
Many planners suggest following Read 's prescription : " In the U.S. ' Run from the water , hide from the wind ' is pretty good , simple advice . "
As for the addition of a new category 6 , Read insists it is not needed .
" I 'd be totally opposed to that , even if they did get stronger , " he says .
" I 'll fight 'em tooth and nail under my regime .
We 'll keep what we have now , but I 'm going to focus more on the impacts . "

Many religious groups object to using embryos for medical research Japanese scientists say they have created human stem cells from tissue taken from the discarded wisdom teeth of a 10 - year - old girl .
The researchers say their work suggests that wisdom teeth could be a suitable alternative to human embryos as a source for therapeutic stem cells .
Research involving stem cells is seen as having the potential to treat many life - threatening diseases .
But some people do not believe it is morally right to use human embryos .
The researchers , based at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST ) , say it will be at least five years before their findings result in practical medical applications .
Dual benefit Stem cells have the ability to develop into other kinds of human cells , and experts believe they may eventually lead to treatments for some of the most intractable conditions , such as cancer and diabetes .
The AIST researchers said they had identified a form of stem cell in the wisdom teeth which had the capability to develop and be grown successfully into other forms of cell outside the body .
The cells they harvested continued to grow in the laboratory for just over a month , they added .
The leader of the team , Hajime Ogushi , said the research was significant in two ways .
" One is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway , " he told the AFP news agency .
" Also , we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer .
That means that it 's easy for us to stock this source of stem cells . "
In the US , dentists are starting to offer to store stem cells taken from wisdom teeth and from baby teeth , another potential source , for therapeutic purposes in the future .
Last year , a team of US and Japanese scientists announced they had managed to produce stem cells from skin .

Iraqi children run to welcome British Troops from 42 Commando as they go on patrol in the Southern Iraqi town of Umm Qasr , 22 miles south of Basra , Thursday March 27 , 2003 .
Childhood is the happiest , most carefree of times .
That is , unless your country has been torn apart by war .
The United Nations estimates that children in 50 countries are currently growing up in the midst of war or its ugly aftermath .
In the past decades , 2 million children have been killed and 6 million injured in war - torn places .
And 23 million children have been forced from their homes .
Most kids live through the brutality of war , but even those who do come out the other side with a whole new moral outlook .
Roberto Posada and Cecilia Wainryb of the University of Utah were concerned about the fact that " more and more of the world ’s children are being sucked into a bleak moral vacuum — a psychological space devoid of basic human rights and values , " and they wondered how those children would develop a sense of right and wrong given the bleak condition of their lives .
And so they decided to ask the kids .
Colombian children were appropriate subjects for Posada and Wainryb 's question because Colombia has been engaged in civil war for 50 years ; children in that country have been exposed to homicide , theft and physical violence on a daily basis .
They gathered 96 children and adolescents who had been displaced from their homes and were currently living in poverty , most of them without parents , and questioned them about the morality of stealing or harming someone .
Surprisingly , these very damaged kids all said that stealing and harming others was wrong , morally wrong , even if everybody did it .
Their ability to hold on to what is right and wrong speaks to the very depth of a moral character that is universal in all humans , no matter what happens .
And this makes sense — social animals such as humans must share some common rules to make a society function , and even in anarchy , those rules hold .
But the researchers also found that the children had a very different view of right and wrong within the context of revenge .
Most of the kids did n’t think it was so bad to steal or harm if the idea was to get back at someone .
That moral frame shift is not just discouraging , it also speaks to the roots of most human conflict .
Fights , terrorism and all - out conflict are often based in real or imagined scenarios where each side complains they have been ripped off or harmed .
And then comes the justification of revenge .
You take something of mine , I have the right to take something of yours .
You have harmed me or those I love , so I can righteously harm you and yours .
People may be naturally moral and instinctively know right from wrong , but set into the social context of tit - for - tat , all notions of good and bad go out the window .
Revenge is also so much part of our make - up that it , too , must have some deep moral value , albeit a twisted one , that works for human societies .
We project our own .
We hurt for them , we steal for them , we are together , no matter what , which probably helps our genes survive .
No one should be surprised if those Colombian kids grow up and continue in the violence of war .
They have , after all , been dragged into the complex network of revenge justice , a system that by its very nature is handed down from generation to generation .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A booking agent for a prostitution ring whose clients included former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer pleaded guilty on Monday to a conspiracy charge relating to prostitution .

Tanya Hollander , 36 , was one of four people charged with running the Emperors Club VIP , a high - priced prostitution ring broken up this year .
She pleaded guilty to a charge of violating the Travel Act , which bans crossing state lines to carry out illegal business such as prostitution .
The other three charged have all pleaded guilty and await sentencing .
During the hearing held in Manhattan federal court , Hollander admitted after she began working for the Emperors Club in June 2007 , “ it became apparent that those individuals and clients were engaging in prostitution offenses . ”
Her lawyer , Michael Farkas , told reporters outside court it was possible Hollander had booked Spitzer , who resigned as governor in March after it emerged he was a client of the Emperors Club .
“ Ms. Hollander was a minor player in this enterprise , ” Farkas told reporters outside the hearing .
“ It was unfortunate the former governor was involved . ”
Spitzer , who in his other former role as state attorney general championed anti-prostitution legislation and cracked down on financial crimes , has not been charged in the case and prosecutors refuse to say whether he will face charges .
Farkas said his client was not asked to cooperate with prosecutors in any possible criminal case against Spitzer .
If Spitzer is not charged , he said , he will ask the judge at her sentencing to consider she was treated more harshly than other possible co-conspirators such as Spitzer .
Hollander , a holistic health counselor , faces a likely six to 10 months in prison under the sentencing guidelines outlined in her plea agreement .
She will be sentenced November 25 .
Local media identified the Spitzer call girl as Ashley “ Kristen ” Dupre , who traveled to a Washington , D.C. , hotel to meet Spitzer .
She has not been charged in the case but could be a witness .

Barack Obama has launched an all - out effort to block a Republican billionaire ’s efforts to tie him to domestic and foreign terrorists in a wave of negative television ads .
Obama ’s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the “ American Issues Project , ” the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements .
The Obama campaign — and tens of thousands of supporters — also is pressuring television networks and affiliates to reject the ads .
The effort has met with some success : CNN and Fox News are not airing the attacks , and some local affiliates have refused as well .
Obama has also launched his own response ad , directly addressing Simmons ' attempt to link him to domestic terror .
The project is “ a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law , ” Obama general counsel Bob Bauer wrote to Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Keeney last week in a letter provided to Politico .
Bauer argued that by advocating Obama ’s defeat , the ad should be subject to the contribution limits of federal campaign law , not the anything - goes regime of issue advocacy .
Bauer ’s letter called on the Justice Department to open “ an investigation of the American Issues Project ; its officers and directors ; and its anonymous donors , whoever they may be . ”
“ This is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad .
It ’s the classic maneuver :
If you ca n’t win on the merits file a lawsuit , ” said a spokesman for the American Issues Project , Christian Pinkston , who said his group 's non-profit status allowed it to participate in elections as long as it does a majority of policy work , which it plans to do .

Tesla to build electric car plant in San Jose City offers firm 89 acres rent - free for its first decade
SAN CARLOS , CA - JUNE 30 : California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) and Tesla Motors Product Architect and Engineer Elon Musk look at a Tesla Roadster before a news conference June 30 , 2008 at Tesla Motors in San Carlos , California .
Governor Schwarzenegger announced that electric car company Tesla Motors will build a new manufacturing facility in California to manufacture its all - electric Tesla Roadster .
The $ 109,000 2009 Tesla Roadster zero emissions vehicle is capable of traveling nearly 250 miles on a single charge and is capable of going 0 - 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds .

Luxury electric carmaker Tesla Motors announced Wednesday that it will build a $ 250 million factory in San Jose , a major coup for a city working hard to attract both manufacturers and green businesses .
Tesla plans to build its new $ 60,000 sedan at the site , which also will house the company 's headquarters .
The Tesla campus - on Zanker Road , just north of state Highway 237 - will employ 1,000 people .
Tesla 's first car - a $ 109,000 roadster that hit the market this year - will still be built in England .
The company 's electric sedans should start rolling off the San Jose production line in late 2010 .
San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed spent months wooing Tesla , a San Carlos startup whose executives said in June that they wanted to build their factory in California .
The deal they struck with the city gives Tesla an 89 - acre parcel that the company can occupy rent - free for 10 years .
After that , the rent jumps to $ 1.5 million per year .
" The mayor 's vision of making San Jose the epicenter , if you will , of the green revolution aligns very well with us , " said Ze 'ev Drori , Tesla 's chief executive officer , adding that the Silicon Valley is a leader in electronics and electrical engineering .
" The heart and soul of the electric car is the electric drivetrain , and for that , we need the type of skills available here . "
Reed has made landing " green collar " jobs , in fields such as solar power or alternative fuels , one of San Jose 's biggest priorities .
Like Silicon Valley as a whole , the city has many jobs at the top of the economic spectrum - such as executives and engineers - and many in service industries at the bottom .
But it has few manufacturing jobs or others that pay middle - class wages .
" We 're weak in the middle , " Reed said .
" We think there 's an opportunity with clean tech to get some of those manufacturing jobs back . "
The city has set a goal of adding 25,000 green tech jobs in 15 years .
San Jose has n't landed such a large business facility , of any kind , in years .
" We can safely say it 's been a good decade or more , " said Paul Krutko , San Jose 's chief development officer .
The city estimates that the project will have a regional economic impact of $ 2 billion each year , a combination of tax revenue and spending by the people whom the Tesla campus will employ .
Although other companies have explored electric cars for years , Tesla has popularized the notion that such cars could be sexy .
Its low and sleek roadster prototype attracted so much attention that would - be customers - including San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger - started placing orders for the car months before it became available .
Tesla 's Model S sedan , which will be built in San Jose , will hold more people and sell for less than the roadster .
But it , too , will emphasize luxury .
The company has not unveiled its exact design .
The company 's executives originally considered building their factory in New Mexico .
But in June , Schwarzenegger helped persuade the company to locate in California , offering to finance the purchase of $ 100 million worth of manufacturing equipment .
The state will lease the equipment to Tesla , which then will have the option to buy the gear , without sales tax , at the end of the lease term .
Reed called the company two days after learning of the governor 's incentive package .
" We were n't on their list , " he said .
" They had n't even thought about San Jose . "
U.S. District Judge John Bates handed the Bush administration another loss in its war on the Constitution and Congressional oversight yesterday when he denied a stay of his previous order that Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten appear before the House Judiciary Committee in compliance with Congressional subpoenas .
The Judge made clear that he views the administration 's claims of absolute immunity from Congressional subpoenas as ridiculous and not even worthy of serious consideration , calling their arguments " weak . "
He said the Executive has " failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue " or that it has even raised a serious or substantial question that would warrant suspension of his previous order .
He further stated that the " absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law . "
Without any supporting judicial precedent whatsoever -- and , indeed , in the face of Supreme Court case law that effectively forecloses the basis for the assertion of absolute immunity here -- it is difficult to see how the Executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal , or even that a serious legal question is presented .
Bates ridiculed the government 's lawyers and their legal reasoning , saying :
The Executive ’s argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important .
But that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits .
Simply calling an issue important -- primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches -- does not transform the Executive ’s weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue .
He said Miers and Bolten remain fully capable of asserting executive privilege on a question - by - question basis , and that " there is no risk whatsoever that any confidential or privileged information will be disclosed during the course of [ their ] testimony . "
Furthermore , since they have been able to cite no case law that suggests that any individual is immune from compliance with Congressional subpoenas , and since " citizens have 'an unremitting obligation to respond to [ congressional ] subpoenas , to respect the dignity of the Congress and its committees and to testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation ' , " the Judge says the government 's case really does n't have any legs because the administration " likely has no appeal rights at this juncture to begin with . "
The government had argued that a stay should be granted since the next Congress could still continue its investigation after President Bush leaves office .
Judge Bates was n't buyin ' .
He wrote :
[ A ] s this Court previously explained , it would be speculative at this juncture to predict how the incoming Congress and the new President will choose to proceed in this matter .
What is near certain , however , is that granting a stay would deprive this Congress of the information it seeks .
That rather plainly constitutes harm for purposes of this analysis .
Administration lawyers tried to blame Congress for taking so long to bring legal action against them .
Again , the Judge slapped them down .
He said the Committee had tried to negotiate a solution with Bush at every step along the way , and that " the Executive can not now fault the Committee for taking the time necessary to do so . "
He describes the administration 's understanding of their responsibilities and required showings as " perplexing " and " confused . "
Judge Bates reasoned that the public interest in seeing the Committee complete its investigation before this Congress expires is " more concrete " and better served by denying a stay .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said he plans to promptly hold a hearing in which Miers and Bolten will testify under oath , and in which documents about the U.S. Attorney firings are to be produced .
Conyers said , " Today 's ruling clearly rejects the White House 's efforts to run out the clock on the Committee 's investigation of DOJ politicization this Congress . "
The ruling clearly rejects those efforts , but chances are , what we will see is two White House cronies sitting at a table and repeating claims of executive privilege to each and every question posed by a frustrated , impotent Congress .

I just can't fathom how any person could make his body do the things these trampolinists do , and as the boys and I watched I caught myself utterly awed , jaws agape .
When it was all over ( and a gentleman named Dong Dong took the bronze ) , I had to blurt out loud , " How can a person do that ? "
And Robert piped right back with , " Dad , what are you asking me for ?

When you write a blog that 's mostly about parenting , you have to resist the temptation to prattle on about all the precious things your kid says .
And that 's a shame , I think , because one of the best things about parenting young children is watching them catch on to even the most subtle , peripheral things you did n't even know you were imparting .
It 's hard to talk about it , though , because it 's too easy to make your conversational partner want to slam his head in the fridge .
If you feel the same way I do about this , now 's your chance to indulge in a guilty pleasure .
Let me know the funniest , most perspicacious thing your kid -- 0r your sister 's kid , or your neighbor 's kid , or your kid 's kid -- said .
It does n't matter whether it was 20 seconds or 20 years ago , because this stuff is eternal .
And to me , it 's truly entertaining .

On Sunday , two - thirds of the voters in Ecuador approved a new constitution that is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights .
It also provides for pensions for stay - at - home mothers and free education for all through college .
With over one - third of the nation living in poverty , the constitutional changes are expected to alleviate suffering with short and long - term solutions .
SFGate reports that the new Constitution also broadens President Rafael Correa 's powers , letting him run for two more consecutive terms , and allowing him to consolidate the ' citizen 's revolution . '
Correa is expected to swiftly overhaul the judiciary , the Central Bank and other key institutions , giving the U.S. - and European - trained economist greater liberty to fashion what he calls a ' new political model . '
Correa has not , however , nationalized telecommunications or electric utility companies .
According to a report by Cyril Mychalejko , the new constitution gives nature the " right to exist , persist , maintain and regenerate its vital cycles , structure , functions and its processes in evolution " and mandates that the government take " precaution and restriction measures in all the activities that can lead to the extinction of species , the destruction of the ecosystems or the permanent alteration of the natural cycles . "
Mychalejko continues :
Ecuador 's leadership on this issue just may have a global domino effect as the [ Community Environmental Legal ]
Defense Fund is now fielding calls from other countries such as Nepal , which is currently writing its first constitution .
This could begin to make neoliberal development models obsolete and have a tremendous impact on multinational corporations , especially those in the extractive industries , from entering new markets and conducting " business as usual " .
" I expect them to fight it , " said the Defense Fund 's [ Mari ] Margil .
" Their bread and butter is being able to treat countries and ecosystems like cheap hotels .
Multinational corporations are dependent on ravaging the planet in order to increase their bottom line . "
The class - action lawsuit in Ecuador against Chevron is a testament to Margil 's forecast .
Tens of thousands of Ecuadorians accuse the California - based company of dumping millions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon ( when it was formerly Texaco ) , and as a result causing massive environmental destruction and widespread health problems .
Chevron , which could be forced to pay as much as $ 16 billion , refuses to take responsibility and calls the action a " shakedown . "
" The ultimate issue here is Ecuador has mistreated a U.S. company , " a Chevron lobbyist who asked not to be identified told Newsweek in July .
" We can't let little countries screw around with big companies like this - companies that have made big investments around the world . "
Chevron is lobbying Congress to squeeze Ecuador on the issue by threatening to withhold the renewal of the Andean Trade Preference Act.
Chevron took similar measures in 2006 by lobbying for the exclusion of Ecuador from Andean Free Trade Agreement negotiations as retribution for the lawsuit -- something Democratic Presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - Ill ) and Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) criticized at the time in a letter to then U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman .
Jorge Daniel Taillant , President of the Center for Human Rights and Environment ( in Argentina ) , recently wrote that , " The crude reality of the Chevron lobbyist comment , brings home what few politicians or oil industry representatives want to admit , that our societies have been unsuccessful in properly balancing our need for oil and containing the negative impacts that this industry has on our natural and social environment . "
( Read more for an excellent discussion of what Mychalejko calls " populist greenwashing . " )
The successful lobbying efforts of the Pachamama Alliance prompted the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly to invite the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund to assist in developing and drafting provisions for the new constitution to put ecosystem rights directly into the Ecuadorian constitution , based on ordinances developed and adopted by U.S. municipalities .
" Ecuador is now the first country in the world to codify a new system of environmental protection based on rights , " stated Thomas Linzey , Executive Director of CELDF .
" With this vote , the people of Ecuador are leading the way for countries around the world to fundamentally change how we protect nature , " added Mari Margil , Associate Director .
CELDF , founded in 1995 , explains that most laws legalize environmental harms by regulating how much pollution or destruction of nature can occur .
Rather than preventing pollution and environmental destruction , these laws instead codify it .
" The destruction of the world 's rainforests is driven by a complex web of social and economic forces , many of these a logical result of modern society 's worldview -- a view that , although rich in technological insight , is often ignorant of the value of nature 's apparently free and limitless services .
It is a view guided by maximum short - term financial gain while disregarding the long - term costs of ecological degradation .
It is a worldview in which tropical forests can show up as a cash crop to be harvested rather than as an irreplaceable ecosystem to be protected . "
Ecuador sits on the western edge of South America , at the equator .
Darwin's famous Galapagos Islands , not pictured in the map below , lie 700 miles from the coastal town of Manta .
With her campaign now officially suspended , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is confronting still another challenge : whittling down what is believed to be the largest presidential campaign debt in history .
Besides the $ 11.4 million of her own money that Mrs. Clinton lent her campaign , she had about $ 9.5 million in unpaid bills to vendors at the end of April , according to her most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission .
It is unclear how much debt she will ultimately report , because the campaign is still adding up the figures for May , which it must file to the commission by June 20 .
But Mo Elleithee , a campaign spokesman , said , “ We do n’t expect the debt number to look significantly different than it did on our last report . ”
Other , far more affluent candidates have poured more of their own money into their presidential bids , like Mitt Romney , who spent more than $ 44 million in an unsuccessful run for the Republican nomination this year .
His money was technically classified by his campaign as a loan , but it was clear from the beginning that he was simply self - financing a large part of his campaign .

A MUM diagnosed cancer in a baby girl she has never met - by looking at a photograph e-mailed from America .
Madeleine Robb was at home in Stretford when an internet chatroom friend from Florida forwarded a picture of her daughter .
The 32 - year - old business analyst - who has no medical training - spotted an unusual white shadow on the eye of one - year - old Rowan Santos and went on to the web to find out more .
She found it could be a symptom of a form of eye cancer called Retinoblastoma and sent an e-mail to alert Rowan 's mother Megan , also 32 , at her home 4,300 miles away in Tampa .
Within hours , Mrs Santos had taken Rowan to a doctor , who found a large tumour in her left eye - and the youngster is now having chemotherapy .
Doctors say Madeleine 's alert may have saved Rowan 's life , although she will still lose an eye .
Madeleine , who also has a one - year - old daughter Lileth , met Rowan 's mother through a pregnancy website when they were both expecting their babies .
The girls were born on the same day in August 2007 and the families kept in touch , e-mailing photos of them growing up .
Mrs Santos , who lives with husband David in Tampa , said she had seen a slight change in Rowan 's eye colour , but the white shadow was only visible in a flash photo .
The cancer was not detected when Rowan had a routine check - up at nine months .
Mrs Santos said : " Grateful cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward Maddie .
" Do I consider Madeline our hero ?
Most certainly - if she had n't sent that e-mail , Rowan 's prognosis would n't be as good as it is .
" One more week and the tumour could have hit her optic nerve . "
Mrs Robb , who is married to Doug , said : " I did n't do anything special , but it shows how important it is to be aware of symptoms .
" Apparently , it shows up more on photos and new parents take pictures of their children all the time - they just have to know what to look for . "
Retinoblastoma symptoms include an odd - looking , white pupil or red and inflamed eye , worsened vision or a squint .
Early detection can allow for more localised treatment and avoid the need for surgery .
For many the " Cloud " in Cloud Computing signifies the notion of location independence ; that somewhere in the internet services are provided and that to access them you do not need any specific knowledge of where they are located .
Many applications have already been built using cloud services and they indeed achieve this location transparency ; their customers do not have to worry about where and how the application is being served .
However for developers to do their job properly the cloud cannot be fully transparent .
As much as we would like to make it easy and simple for everyone , building high - performance and highly reliable applications in the cloud requires that the developers have more control .
For example a reality is that failures can happen ; servers can crash and networks can become disconnected .
Even if these are only temporary glitches and are transient errors , the developer of applications in the cloud really wants to make sure his or her application can continue to serve customers even in the face of these rare glitches .
A similar issue is that of network latency ; as much as we would like to see the cloud to be transparent , the transport of network packets is still limited to the speed of light ( at best ) and customers of cloud applications may experience a different performance depending on where they are located in relation to where the applications are running .
We have seen that for many applications that works just fine , but there are developers who would like more control over how their customers are being served and for example would like to give all their customers low latency access , regardless of their location .
At Amazon we have been building applications on these cloud principles for several years now and we are very much aware of the tools that developers need to build applications that are required to meet very high standards with respect to scalability , reliability , performance and cost - effectiveness .
We are also listening very closely to the feedback AWS customers are giving us to make sure we expose the right tools for them to do their job .
We launched Amazon S3 in Europe to ensure that developers could build applications that could serve data out of a European storage cloud .
We launched Regions and Availability Zones ( combined with Elastic IPs ) for Amazon EC2 such that developers would have better control over where their applications would be running to ensure high - availability .
We are now ready to expand the cloud even further and bring the cloud storage to its customers ' doorstep .
Today we are announcing that we are expanding the cloud by adding a new service that will give developers and businesses the ability to serve data to their customers world - wide , using low - latency and high data transfer rates .
Using a global network of edge locations this new service can deliver popular data stored in Amazon S3 to customers around the globe through local access .
We have developed this content delivery service using the robust AWS principles we know work well for our customers :
Cost - effective : no commitments and no minimum usage requirements .
You only pay for what you use in a manner similar to the other Amazon Web Services .
Simple to use : one API call gets you going .
You store the data you want to distribute in an Amazon S3 bucket and you use this API call to register this bucket with the content distribution service .
The registration will provide you with a new domain name that you can use in url 's to access the data through this service with HTTP .
When your customer accesses your content through your new url the data it refers to will be delivered through a network of edge servers .
Works well with other services :
The service integrates seamlessly with Amazon S3 and the data / content served through the service can be accessed using the standard HTTP access techniques .
Reliable : Amazon S3 will give you durable storage of your data , and the network of edge locations on three continents used by the new service will deliver your content to your customers from the most appropriate location .
This is an important first step in expanding the cloud to give developers even more control over how their applications and their data are served by the cloud .
The service is currently in private beta but we expect to have the service widely available before the end of the year .
You can get a few more details and sign up to get notified when the service is becoming on this AWS page Also check Jeff Bar 's posting on the AWS weblog .

From the Apache Solr website :
Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search library , with XML / HTTP and JSON APIs , hit highlighting , faceted search , caching , replication , and a web administration interface .
It runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat .
Nice , a full text search engine easily accessible from anywhere .
Just HTTP , no special binding required .
I ’ve just hacked esolr , a simple , almost untested and featureless erlang client for Solr ;-) .
Well , there was n’t so many operations to implement really .
The basic and usefull ones are
Add / Update documents esolr:add/

Delete documents esolr : delete/
1
Search esolr : search /
2
Also , there are functions to perform commits to the index ( to make all changes made since the last commit available for searching ) and to optimize the index ( a time consuming operation , see Solr documentation ) .
Besides of issuing commits and optimize operations explicitly , the library also allows to perform that operations periodically at user - defined intervals .
In the case of commits , these can also be specified to automatically take place after each add or delete operation ( mainly usefull for development and not for production code ) .
Quick start :
Install Solr 1.2
Run it with the sample configuration provided ( / example $ java - jar start .

John McCain
" My friends , we have reached a crisis , the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War . "
Steve Benen :
" Since the fall of the Soviet Union , the U.S. has fought ( or is fighting ) two wars in Iraq , a war in Afghanistan , and two conflicts in the Balkans .
There have been multiple crises in Israel .
There was a burgeoning nuclear crisis with North Korea .
There is , and has been , a crisis in Darfur .
There have been multiple , shall we say , tense moments between Pakistan and India , nuclear powers both .
One could make the argument that the attacks of Sept. 11 were , themselves , a serious international crisis .
And yet , there ’s John McCain , describing a regional conflict between Russia and Georgia as the first “ serious crisis internationally ” since the end of the Cold War .
Do the other crises simply not count ?
Or does McCain not remember them ? "
Two days ago , when McCain said that " In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations , " I dismissed it as a lapse .
Since then , however , he 's said similar things : a couple of days ago , for instance , he wrote a WSJ editorial that began : " For anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past , the last week must have come as a startling wake - up call . "
Coming on the heels of those rather extraordinary statements , his claim that this is the first " serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War " makes me wonder : has something about the war in Georgia simply erased Iraq , Afghanistan , and 9/11 from his mind ?
What 's going on ?
I can think of a number of possibilities ( which are not mutually exclusive ) :
First , it could be that McCain has some sort of policy analog of Attention Deficit Disorder : he focusses on one thing , but when something else comes along , it distracts him and he forgets about the first thing entirely .
Second , it could be that McCain 's mind is stuck in the Cold War , and so for him the only crises that really rate are conflicts that involve the US and the Soviet Union Russia .
Third , it could be that McCain does not see anything we do as a crisis , an unprovoked invasion , etc .
When he says " In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations " , he believes it , and Iraq does n't register because , well , we invaded Iraq .
Likewise , nothing we have done could possibly count as " stark international aggression . "
And while Iraq and Afghanistan are challenges , they are not crises : problems people need to figure out how to respond to , lest everything go to hell in a handbasket .
Other people cause crises ; we simply do what has to be done .
It should go without saying that any of these traits would be a complete disaster in a President .
A President has to be able to hold a number of things in his head at once ; to pursue objectives with patience , over years ; to keep his various objectives in mind , and see how what he does in one area affects another that is of importance to him .
A President with Policy ADD would not be able to do any of these things , and that would be really bad .
A President whose mind was stuck in the Cold War , and who saw Russia as our great strategic rival , would be , well , wrong .
Russia is a declining country temporarily buoyed by oil and gas revenues .
It is not anything like as much of a challenge going forward as China , or the problem of dealing with failed states and underdevelopment .
We need a President who can see these challenges and respond to them ; not one whose mind is stuck decades in the past .
But the third might be the worst .
We badly need a President who will try to reconstitute our moral authority in the world , and to undo the damage of the last eight years .
To do that it is essential that that President be able to see the US as other countries see it , and understand how our actions appear to others .
A President who simply assumes , without even noticing that he 's doing so , that the rules that apply to others do not apply to us would not be able to do this .
This is serious .
I 'm not trying to score political points here .
One way or another , the next President will have to deal with our shattered reputation abroad and the challenges , predictable and unpredictable , that the next eight years throw at us .
We cannot afford to elect another President who really does n't get these things .
Anyone who thinks that the war with Georgia is the first serious international crisis since the end of the Cold War , or who can say , without apparent irony , that " In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations " , is just not up to the job .

UPDATE : Matt Y notes :
" It was just a little while ago that McCain was giving speeches about how “ the threat of radical Islamic terrorism ” is “ transcendent challenge of our time . ”
Now Russia seems to be the transcendent challenge .
Which is the problem with an approach to world affairs characterized by a near - constant hysteria about threat levels and a pathological inability to set priorities . "
Josh Marshall :
Federal agents raided a Culver City medical marijuana dispensary Thursday , tearing through furniture , cabinets , cash drawers and an outdoor garden in search of evidence .
Drug Enforcement Administration agents arrived about noon at Organica Collective in the 13400 block of Washington Boulevard , where they executed a vigorous search for money , records and pot as angry employees looked on .
No arrests were made .
“ Marijuana remains a controlled substance , and it is illegal under federal law to possess , dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form , ” said Sarah Pullen , a DEA spokeswoman .
Agents executed the federal search warrant on the same day that an appellate court in San Diego ruled that federal law does not preempt the state ’s law allowing the use of medical marijuana .

The ruling was hailed as a significant victory by supporters of California ’s medical marijuana law .
At the dispensary , agents left behind trash , piles of receipts , upturned couch cushions , bits of marijuana , an emptied automated teller machine and a safe that had been cut open and cleaned out .
Agents also uprooted marijuana plants in an outdoor garden .
Brian V. Birbiglia -- an employee and friend of the dispensary ’s owner , Jeff Joseph -- sat handcuffed next to DEA agents on a tattered couch outside the dispensary for more than four hours during the raid .

Next to the couch sat a box marked “ DEA evidence , ” about a dozen black trash bags and two Trader Joe ’s paper bags .
Some agents wore protective chest gear , black sunglasses and guns in leg holsters .
After the raid was over and he was released , Birbiglia was visibly enraged .
Birbiglia , 35 , said he is a disabled former Marine who has a prescription to smoke marijuana for a foot injury .
“ We follow the law ! ” he yelled , his face red and his eyes teary .
“ We might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown . ”
Birbiglia found a remaining bud of marijuana that agents had missed , and he popped it into a pipe to smoke .

“ They forgot this , and I ’m going to smoke it , ” he said .
Clyde Carey , 50 , of Marina del Rey was at the store Friday visiting a friend when agents burst in through the locked front door , he said .
“ We heard some noise outside , and then the door literally burst in , and the DEA came in in full combat gear , told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads , ” Carey said .
“ It was like , literally , an episode of ’ 24 , ’ when they bust in on a terrorist cell . ”

Joseph , the owner , said he was at the bank when an employee called to warn him of the raid .
Joseph said he had been speaking with his attorney but would not comment on the amount of marijuana lost .
“ It ’s going to be very expensive , ” he said , adding that he had “ paid my taxes , every quarter since last year ; I ’ve paid my taxes . ”

Times staff writer Jia-Rui Chong contributed to this report .
The need to go green , be carbon neutral , and / or promote energy efficiency has been on the lips of virtually every company in America over the past nine months , but lip service and action are two very different things .
New survey data suggests that corporate attitudes and implementation strategies are lagging significantly behind the barrage of eco-friendly press releases we 've seen over the last year .
CDW 's ITMonitor surveyed IT decision makers over the last year and recently reported the results ( PDF ) .
While an overwhelming 80 percent majority of companies ranked Green IT as either " Very Important " or " Somewhat Important , " the same group listed a number of factors and concerns that could slow the adoption of this technology .
CDW VP Mark Gambill , however , sees this type of slow adoption curve as normal .
" Even though IT decision makers clearly recognize the importance of Green IT solutions , such as virtualization and server consolidation , there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organization , " said Gambill .
" If going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable IT to an organization , then widespread adoption may take some time . "
At this point , Green IT concerns are being driven from the top of the business segment , rather than the bottom .
43 percent of small businesses ( 1- 99 employees ) have no plans to implement Green IT within the next two years , compared to 27 percent of mid-size businesses ( 100-999 employees ) , and just 11 percent of large businesses ( 1000 + employees ) .
The same trend appears within government structures , though the gap is not as severe .
47 percent of local governments have no plan to adopt green technology within the next two years , compared to 34 percent of state governments and 31 percent of the offices in the federal government .
The good news here is that a majority of all the organizations polled are moving in more eco-friendly directions , but a significant number of businesses and government agencies of all sizes have yet to shift on the topic .
IT decision makers listed a number of significant concerns when asked to consider the difficulty of moving to energy - efficient systems .
Cost was the chief concern at all corporation and government levels and was cited by 47 - 63 percent of the IT workers polled .
Disruption to current IT systems , maintenance complexity , perceived maintenance difficulties , and a lack of expertise were all cited as significant barriers by both business and government staff .
A lack of IT initiatives that truly have a positive impact on the environment was also cited .
Asked to name the benefits of Green IT , the majority of business ( 61 percent ) and government ( 67 percent ) workers listed a positive impact on the environment as the largest potential gain , followed by a positive reputation for the company , cost savings , greater operational efficiency , and easier maintenance .
Only 13 percent of companies and 7 percent of government structures responded that there was no benefit whatsoever in adopting eco-friendly IT policies , although there was one significant corporate outlier .
A whopping 30 percent of small businesses stated their belief that there was no benefit to increased energy efficiency , compared to just seven percent of medium and five percent of large companies .
Armed with these results , I trotted over to Dell and HP to see what emphasis these two players put on power efficiency .
Dell :
Dell is going after the green market fairly aggressively .
Dell.com has direct links to stories on the company 's
eco-initiatives , and the company 's new Studio Hybrid is directly marketed as a green PC .
Virtually all of the company 's " green " efforts
appear to be focused on either the consumer or the enterprise / large business market .
The default page for the " Large Business " segment
mentions Dell 's PowerEdge Energy Smart servers in one thumbnail ad , advertises the PowerEdge M 1000E as a more energy efficient solution
than comparable products from HP , and lists an entire set of products under the " Energy Optimized " heading on the left - hand side
of the page .
The " Small / Medium Business " server page , however , lists none of these by default .

The " Small / Medium Business " server page , however , lists none of these by default .
HP : HP does talk power efficiency , but not half so aggressively as its principle rival .
Click on " Large Enterprise Business , " and the subsequent page rotates a large banner ad , one
segment of which invites you to peruse the five ways " management tools root out inefficiencies . "
# 1 on that list is " Curb Power Use , " but
at this point we 're two clicks into HP 's site and you 've clicked on a banner ad .
This is n't what I 'd call prominent advertising ,
but it describes HP 's strategy in a nutshell .
Yes , power efficiency information and power - efficient systems are available , but the
concept of Green IT gets no special mention here .
Dell seems to have its finger a bit more firmly on the button when it comes to energy efficiency and how much emphasis companies are currently willing to place on it .
There 's a broad understanding that Green IT is a Very Good Thing , but the challenges that IT administrators list are very real concerns .
On the other hand , it 's fair , I think , to note that any overhaul of IT infrastructure risks disruption , unseen costs , negative impact on productivity , and may require additional expertise that 's not immediately available .
The best way to promote the use of energy efficient products in both the datacenter and on the floor is to make these practices both transparent and seamless .
I discussed the difficulty of adopting energy efficiency at the desktop level last week , but many of the concerns apply equally to corporate computers .
Learning to identify , manage , and maximize corporate energy efficiency without disrupting worker productivity is a profound challenge , but it 's the only way to convince companies with an eye on the bottom line that going green makes good business sense .
Hmmm , part of the big appeal and look of the first movie lightcycle sequence was the " massless " state of the cycle .
It was fast , did 90 degree turns , and dangerous as hell .
Now it just looks like some guys on motorbikes .
What happened to the deadly effect of running into the trail ?
Looks like the guy just gets flipped around a bit instead of being wiped out of existence .
As a Lebanese - Christian immigrant who spent her girlhood amid the bloody devastation of the Lebanese civil war , you have lately emerged as one of the most vehement critics of radical Islam in this country .
Are you concerned that your new book , “ They Must Be Stopped , ” will feed animosity toward Muslims ?
I do not think I am feeding animosity .
I am bringing an issue to light .
I disapprove of any religion that calls for the killing of other people .
If Christianity called for that , I would condemn it .
What about all the moderate Muslims who represent our hope for the future ?
Why do n’t you write about them ?
The moderate Muslims at this point are truly irrelevant .
I grew up in the Paris of the Middle East , and because we refused to read the writing on the wall , we lost our country to Hezbollah and the radicals who are now controlling it .
In your new book , you write about the Muslim presence in America and bemoan the rise of Islamic day schools and jihad summer camp .
Is there really such a thing ?
Yes .
Instead of taking lessons on swimming and gymnastics , the kids are listening to speakers give lectures titled “ Preparation for Death ” and “ The Life in the Grave . ”
You also lament the public foot baths that have been installed at the University of Michigan and elsewhere to accommodate Muslim students .
I lived in the Middle East for the first 24 years of my life .
Never once did I see any foot - washing basins in airports or public buildings .
So why are they pushing them down the throats of Americans ?

I 've already touched on this in previous posts , but the list of " thanks , but no thanks "
Republicans is growing :
At least 10 incumbent senators , plus several Senate candidates , have sent their regrets .
Only three incumbents in hotly contested races , including Kentucky 's Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader , will join the partygoers .
" It 's probably easier to say who is attending , " said Rebecca Fisher , spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
But the list is " a moving target , " she added .
" The party brand is in tatters , " said the aide . "
The president is highly unpopular .
There does n't seem to be much excitement around the candidate .
And there 's a real fear of being tagged with the Republican label and being seen with George Bush . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will bow out to stay in California and deal with a budget stalemate .
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana canceling because of Hurricane Gustav .
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas canceling because of Hurricane Gustav .
President Bush has now said he will not go , per CNN just now .
Same with Vice President Dick Cheney .
Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens is awaiting trial on seven federal charges stemming from a corruption scandal .
His staff says he wo n't attend because he is too busy campaigning for his eighth term .
Idaho Sen. Larry E. Craig also has reasons to avoid the Twin Cities .
Pat Roberts of Kansas enjoys a double - digit lead over a Democratic challenger in a state that has n't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932 .
But Roberts is " finishing his 105 - county tour " of the state and does n't want to stop , said spokeswoman Molly Haase .
Maine Sen. Susan Collins also will skip the St. Paul festivities to campaign at home , as will Oregon Sen. Gordon H. Smith , who is running for his third term .
Ditto for North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole , who is locked in an unexpectedly tight reelection race .
Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) , who is retiring after two terms , plans to visit Europe this week rather than St. Paul .
Hagel last week issued a statement of praise for Joe Biden , the Delaware senator who is now the Democratic nominee for vice president .
Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( R - Ind. ) also offered public support for Biden .
He is n't going to the GOP convention , according to his office .
Neither is Mike Johanns , a Republican running for Hagel 's seat .
Johanns is " taking no vote for granted " and will be knocking on doors in Nebraska , said spokeswoman Sarah Pompei .
Retiring Sen. Wayne Allard ( R - Colo. ) is skipping the convention .
So is the Republican who is campaigning to succeed him , Bob Schaffer .
McCain did n't help Schaffer , or his presidential election chances in Colorado , by indicating this month that he supports renegotiating a 1922 Colorado River compact to allocate more water to his home state of Arizona , as well as Nevada and California . "
Over my cold dead political carcass , " Schaffer told reporters .
But why ?
Who would turn down the biggest event of the election season ?
Wham !
A blow to the solar plexus !
Let 's see who's on the " sending regrets " list these days :
Per CNN : There is now talk of canceling the convention and reducing it to a two hour event to fulfill the requirements necessary for a nomination .
By Hilary White
WESTMINSTER , UK , August 15 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) - A priest of Westminster , the leading diocese of the Catholic Church of England and Wales , has written that promiscuity , whether homosexual or heterosexual , can lead to dire spiritual consequences , in addition to the dangers to physical health .
Promiscuity , as well as homosexuality and pornography , says 73 year - old Fr. Jeremy Davies , is a form of sexual perversion and can lead to demonic possession .
Offering what may be an explanation for the explosion of homosexuality in recent years , Fr. Davies said , " Among the causes of homosexuality is a contagious demonic factor . "
Fr. Davies continues : " Even heterosexual promiscuity is a perversion ; and intercourse , which belongs in the sanctuary of married love , can become a pathway not only for disease but also for evil spirits . "
" Some very unpleasant things must be mentioned because young people , especially , are vulnerable and we must do what we can to protect and warn them , " he told the Catholic Herald .
He also said that Satan is responsible for having blinded most secular humanists to the " dehumanising effects of contraception and abortion and IVF , of homosexual ‘ marriages ’ , of human cloning and the vivisection of human embryos in scientific research . "
Extreme secular humanism , " atheist scientism " , is comparable to " rational satanism " and these are leading Europe into a dangerous state of apostasy .
" Only by a genuine personal decision for Christ and the Church can someone separate himself from it . "
Fr. Davies ’ ( an Oxford graduate who is also a qualified physician ) comments come in conjunction with the publication of his new book , entitled , " Exorcism : Understanding Exorcism in Scripture and Practice " published earlier this year by the Catholic Truth Society ( CTS ) .
In the Catholic Church , exorcisms can only be performed by a priest who has the " express " permission of his bishop .
According to the Code of Canon Law , only experienced priests can be chosen who exhibit , " piety , knowledge , prudence , and integrity of life . "
Before the official rite of exorcism is used , the subject must also be examined thoroughly by doctors and psychiatrists to rule out any non-spiritual causes of his difficulties and physicians are often asked to assist during the course of an exorcism .
Fr. Davies also warns in his book against so - called New Age and occult practices , as well as trendy exercise and " spiritual healing " regimens derived from eastern religions .
" The thin end of the wedge ( soft drugs , yoga for relaxation , horoscopes just for fun and so on ) is more dangerous than the thick end because it is more deceptive - an evil spirit tries to make his entry as unobtrusively as possible . "
" Beware of any claim to mediate beneficial energies ( eg. reiki ) , any courses that promise the peace that Christ promises ( eg. enneagrams ) , any alternative therapy with its roots in eastern religion ( e.g. acupuncture ) . "
Needless to say , overtly occult activities such as séances and witchcraft are " direct invitations to the Devil which he readily accepts . "
Fr. Davies was appointed exorcist of the Westminster Archdiocese in 1986 after a four month training period in Rome .
In 1993 he co-founded , with Italy ’s Father Gabriele Amorth , the International Association of Exorcists which now has hundreds of members worldwide .
In 2000 , Fr. Davies told the Independent newspaper that incidents of demonic possession are rising dramatically along with the increase of New Age beliefs and practices , ignorance of the Bible and a growth in spiritual confusion .
" At the centre of this is man ’s ever - growing pride and attempted self - reliance .
Man trying to build a better world without God - another Tower of Babel , " he said .
In 2005 , the Vatican recently made headlines around the world by publicly announcing the launch of a course on exorcism for priests
The Church ’s writings on exorcism and demonic possession say that a person can be influenced or even possessed by demonic forces when they are " hardened " in serious sin and the Church specifies that these include people who are involved in heavy drug use , violence and sexual perversions .
It is also noted that the " heinous crime " of abortion exacerbates these .
Italian exorcist Fr. Gabriel Amorth writes that it is particularly difficult to liberate a victim who is guilty of abortion , and that this can take a " very long time " .
