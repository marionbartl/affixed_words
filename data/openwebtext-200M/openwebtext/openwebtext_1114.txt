Mr Johnson also insisted it was " wholly reasonable " for him to write newspaper columns on the side because he did them " very fast " .
The comments risk infuriating millions of Londoners struggling to make ends meet amid the economic downturn .
And they are unlikely to please David Cameron , who has ordered his shadow cabinet to give up extra work in the run-up to the general election to show their " commitment " .
Mr Johnson , who is paid nearly £ 140,000 for his day job , was quizzed over his lucrative contract with the Daily Telegraph during an interview for the BBC 's HARDTalk programme .
He responded : " It 's chicken feed . "
Pressed on whether voters would agree with that description , the mayor said he was being " frivolous " .
But he went on : " I happen to write extremely fast .
I do n't see why on a Sunday morning I should n't knock off an article , if someone wants to pay me for that article then that 's their lookout and of course I make a substantial donation to charity .
" Maybe that money should n't go to charity , maybe you 'd rather I did n't make those contributions to charity .
It seems to me to be a wholly reasonable thing to do . "
Mr Johnson said : " I think that frankly there 's absolutely no reason at all why I should not , on a Sunday morning before I do whatever else I need to do on a Sunday morning , should not knock off an article as a way of relaxation . "
Mr Johnson decided to continue with his columns for the Telegraph after being elected last year , but donates £ 50,000 from his annual fee to charities .

Asked whether Mr Cameron approved of his extra work , the mayor seemed oblivious to the instructions issued by his party leader .
" Well I 'm not a member of his shadow cabinet and I 'd like to see what the detail of that is , " he said .
Labour 's deputy leader on the London Assembly , John Biggs , said : " Londoners struggling through the recession will be astounded that their Mayor is so out of touch with reality .
" A quarter of a million pounds may be chicken - feed to him but the overwhelming majority of people in the capital can only dream of earnings like that .
" How can we have any faith in a Mayor who believes earning more than 10 times the majority of those whose interests he is supposed to represent amounts to nothing more than chicken - feed ? "
Bangladesh is the most crowded place on Earth and will become even more impossibly packed in the next 30 years .
Approximately 20 % of its land , it is feared , will be lost to the rising waters brought about by climate change .
Today 's 150 million Bangladeshis also have to face cyclones and arsenic - contaminated water .
About half of the population is illiterate and a third live on less than one US dollar a day .
While others make plans for overpopulation , global warming mitigation and sustainable development , in Bangladesh , it is time for action .
And the leadership is coming from within .
BBC presenter Paul Rose travelled to Bangladesh to meet Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus , the pioneer of micro-credit and visionary of hope for the world 's poor .
He also visited villages , field projects , and schools ; and talked to the country 's leading innovators to report on life at the " front line of sustainable development " .
DAY 5 : PROBLEM - SOLVING BANGLA STYLE
How many bankers do you know that have a fan club ?
As I left the hotel a group of young student interns on a micro- finance pilgrimage were a bit awestruck that I was about to meet the head of a bank .
" I see you are on your third bottle of water already , " laughed Professor Muhammad Yunus as he warmly greeted me .
Paul Rose and Muhammad Yunus
We had last met at the Royal Geographical Society in London and where I no doubt looked smarter than my rain and sweat - soaked self did now , having had only just made it in time for his 69th Birthday celebrations and the opening of the Yunus Centre .
Yunus invented micro-finance in 1976 after seeing how loan sharks were effectively running poor people 's lives .
By 1983 he had started Grameen Bank ; in 2006 he received the Nobel Peace Prize and started the path to one of his life 's dreams : the end of poverty .
With his innovative approach and leadership of the burgeoning micro-credit movement and with social business models running worldwide , he even talks seriously about a Poverty Museum .
Different ways
It was obvious that the opening of the Yunus Centre meant a lot to him .
He has received prestigious awards and accolades worldwide , but here he was on home turf , at his own bank , with his wife , about 40 of his close friends and business colleagues to open the new centre .
His opening speech was all in Bangla , which added to the friendly , almost intimate feeling .
People laughed and the whole atmosphere was relaxed and celebratory .
He did give a summary of the speech in English afterwards and continuing in English he said that his daughter had recently got married and would we like to see the slideshow ?
Of course we did .
We even sang " Happy Birthday " when the cake was produced afterwards .
Later , I sat next to him in a smaller meeting .
We all discussed microfinance , future capitalism and social business issues .
But I was left in no doubt that he is a serious man of action who loves the practical activities that are his mission to end poverty .
Even better , as he advises , one must " do it with joy " .
That to me is all anyone needs to know about Muhammad Yunus : he is a banker with a global fan club , shows family wedding pictures at official bank events , is fun to be around and has an unwavering drive to succeed .
This is an extremely busy part of the world
A few metres from the entrance of Grameen Bank headquarters , it 's back to the assault of senses that is Dhaka .
I have only been here a few days , but already I hardly notice people peeing and defecating in the open sewer just outside the bank .
There is so much traffic that the city should really be permanently grid- locked , but it all moves somehow and I am now convinced it must be the combined power of all the car horns .
There are about 600,000 rickshaws in Dhaka .
One of the young riders let me have a go and as a keen cyclist I thought it would be easy , but it felt like the worst bicycle I had ever ridden .
No gears , heavy , hard to steer .
I was happy to turn it back to him for the rest of his 10 - hour shift even though it was empty when I rode it and he can carry 500kg .
There are five million working children in Bangladesh .
But because of the level of poverty , there is no choice .
If they did n't work , they and their families would not survive .
Many of them work in legal textile factories and if they were forced out of those factories they would have to take work in dangerous unregulated factories , or be reduced to join the beggars that I am looking at right now .
But unlike beggars in many other cities , the Dhaka beggars are gentle and friendly .
It 's impossible not to give some money to children , or women with children and the terribly disabled man who chased me for 50 m along the road crawling and rolling sideways .
However , when I had had enough and did n't hand over money to the next set of beggars , they would still smile , shake my hand , ask me where I was from and wave goodbye .
' Super- adapters ' I have even started to believe the story about Bangaldeshis being some of the happiest people in the world .
At first glance , it makes no sense at all , but I can say that these people smile most of the time ; they are easy to be with and pass on a sense of happiness that seems totally at odds with their situation .
We change when we absolutely have to .
And here in Bangladesh where the forces that make change are so immediate and the options can be so limited , they have become masters of adaptation and innovation .
The pollution levels in Dhaka reached crisis levels .
So all vehicles are now running on LPG .
When you see all that traffic , it 's easy to brace yourself for foul exhaust gases , but the traffic jam air is remarkably clean .
Population growth was out of control in the 1980s and through education they have now brought the growth rate down to just 2 % .
A new government target for 2010 is a growth rate of just 1 % .
Bangladesh is at the front line of climate change and even though this country has added very little to the mechanisms that are causing global warming , they are the ones that have to deal with its effects right now .
Micro-credit and social business models invented here are being applied globally in developed and developing countries .
Those of us not living in a developing nation have an opportunity to learn from these friendly , hard - working super - adapters .
The examples of leadership and innovation they have set here at the front line are all that 's needed to galvanise us all in action towards sensible decisions about our out - of - control global population growth rate and our effects on the world 's climate and ecosystems .
And if we do it by applying the " Bangla Method " , we can do as Muhammad Yunus says and " do it with joy " .
DAY 4 : THE FUTURE WORLD LEADERS
A school that handles its 2,000 pupils on a two - shift system
" One of our poets said that the monsoon rain was like watching girls dancing , " said Nuha Pabony , one of my young hosts at the Rajshahi School .
I thought back to my journey here ; flat rice fields had stretched to the horizon , the view only broken by low mud irrigation walls and channels and a young boy pedalling a stationary bike .
Not the same smooth machine that you and me might use in the gym , but a bike connected to a water pump and it looked like hard work at 40C .
There is not only too much water in Bangladesh from rising sea levels , but there is also too little .
Bangladesh 's already stormy climate has become unpredictable and even stormier .
So the once reliable monsoon waters that filled this river and flowed easily across the rice fields through carefully maintained channels , have once again not arrived .
Four hours on the road and I saw one big diesel water pump , a lot of boys on bicycle pumps and some farmers scooping water in small pans from one level to the next to bring water up the three meters to the fields .
Model pupils
In the packed school office as I ate great fresh mango , cake , sweets and countless cups of sweet tea , Nuha and some of her fellow students were bursting to show me around their school .
At the same time the headmistress and her team were enthusiastically describing the way the school handles its 2,000 pupils on a two - shift system , the academic successes and the love they have for all of the pupils .
The pupils ' enthusiasm was evident at every turn I was taken aback by the response from Nehu : " We love our headmistress too and all of our teachers .
Some of us will be teenagers soon and will face some challenges , but we know that she will help us through any difficulties . "
At that , we were off at a good pace through the school .
First stop was a classroom full of models .
To help bring history , geology , geography and culture alive and also make it more memorable , the pupils make clay models .
In the corner was Mount Everest , the Himalaya and foothills complete with rivers showing the flora and fauna changes in the lowlands .
Next was an anthropological study .
Then came a volcano in which candles burned at the top .
Some models showed old and modern history , all of them were bright and looked like fun to make .
Another model showed the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 , and included prone figures half - painted red , representing the loss of three million Bangladeshis .
Science classes
We burst out briefly into the sun , then dashed into another room and a mathematics class .
" How is the lesson going ? " I asked .
" It is going very well , thank you ! " said 20 pupils in perfect English .
Out in the sun , into the Biology Lab and an excited group explained how they were measuring the CO2 uptake of plants ; others had preserved fish in jars .
I took a quick glance at the blackboard full of science diagrams and the beautiful pupil - made pictures on the walls and was off again .
This time it was upstairs and into the two computer labs .
They take their computers seriously here and I could n't help but think about how these talented , energetic and loved youngsters will bloom even more now that they have improved internet access .
Only one - sixth of the 6.5 billion of us have access to the internet and we will be realising huge talents as the developing nations get online .
" Big differences between those with an education and those without "
As I walked back across the courtyard and towards the three - metre - high perimeter wall , Nuha told me about the links the school has with a school in Swansea , UK .
There is a lot of excitement about a group of Swansea pupils coming to stay this autumn and clearly it 's a first class learning opportunity but it will also be great fun !
I had trouble leaving the school .
Not only because I wanted to stay and see more , but also because the second shift of the other thousand pupils were coming in through the just - opened solid - metal gates as I left .
Five sweaty hours on the road later I took a walk in the streets here in Dhaka and came across an area where the children sort rubbish on the street .
One little girl was blowing up a balloon and I went for the camera .
But I failed to take the picture when I realised she was blowing up a used condom .
Almost half of the population here is illiterate and there are some awfully big differences between those with an education and those without .
Days 2 & 3 : THE ARMADA IS HERE
Heads down and study hard on the school boat
" With these 54 boats , we support 90,000 families , " said Abul Hasanat Mohammed Rezwan .
" How many people are left to reach ? " was my obvious question .
" 20 million " .
I think he might just do it , too ; partly because Rezwan , a Bangladeshi architect - turned - boat - builder , has had such great success already , and partly because there is no other choice .
This is the " front line of climate change " and people have to adapt .
This is a connected age
The effect of sea level rise and more unstable weather patterns mean that 20 % of the country is going under water in the next 30 years .
One of the many striking things about being on the river is that it 's blindingly obvious that it 's happening now - the forecast water level rise is not just a theory .
I wanted the clatter of the engine to stop so I could soak up the peaceful river - bank life .
Women were beating clothes clean , men were meticulously washing cattle and while boys were leaping about and swimming , old men stood neck deep and watched us pass .
Rezwan continued : " These people can't travel for health care and education so the boats bring it to them . "
We pulled alongside a school boat and the noise of the engine was replaced by children chanting responses to a teacher .
The 30 children were in the middle of a class and totally focussed on their books , the teacher and blackboard .
It was easy to get caught up in the rhythm , smiles and enthusiasm of the class .
There is a sense of dedication from the teachers and a matching level of respect from the children .
Obviously proud , Rezwan pointed out the solar - powered computer system - the roof mounted panels feed a set of batteries and via an inverter they power the computers .
I checked the web connection and loaded the BBC News website in a few moments .
For every need Further up river , we came alongside a healthcare boat .
And this time , the engine noise was replaced by silence .
About 40 women were queuing down the steep muddy bank , some holding children , older women looking tiny and resilient , young boys hanging around .
We 'll have to live on the water in floating communities , including floating gardens and farms
Abul Hasanat Mohammed Rezwan
The only sound was of a softly spoken consultation onboard .
The doctor quickly invited me in and told me that this woman had high blood pressure and a lack of energy ; and as he prescribed the drugs , the patient moved to the prescription table , was issued the pills and her medical records updated .
Without any delay the next patient was onboard and with the doctor .
Free healthcare delivered to a remote village - I did n't need to understand any Bangla to see what it meant to these people .
Rezwan explained the boats are built locally , some have engines and others are towed .
All of them have solar power systems and his design without central supports and careful use of local materials ensures that the workspaces are maximised .
Sun power
This was especially clear at the next boat which was the two - storey library boat .
The lower deck had bookshelves along each side , a circular study table also designed by Rezwan and the computer system at the forward end .
The top deck was an airy study area and more stacked bookshelves .
I asked a teenaged reader what she thought of the library .
Rezwan translated : " I love to study here and take books home . "
Rezwan :
We 're bringing services to the people I then asked if she read for fun as well as school studies .
She laughed : " I enjoy the books for their knowledge ! "
Along with her friends she laughed even more with embarrassment when she mistakenly shook my offered hand as I left .
I totally forgot that in these remote and traditional communities men and women do not get that close in public .
I was on safer cultural ground on the next boat as it was the technical support boat and even I could n't make social gaffs with solar power , batteries and solar lights .
Rezwan 's non-profit organisation , Shidhulai , also provides these solar lights free of charge .
I was happy that the technician took only a quick break from his soldering to show me the charging system and solar units , as he had people waiting to swap their flat batteries for charged ones .
Women queue patiently for an appointment on a Bangladeshi health boat
It 's easy to see how essential this free service has become - these simple solar units are the only light source available .
As we motored further upriver to visit an education boat , Rezwan confidently outlined Shidhulai 's climate change adaptation plans : " We 'll have to live on the water in floating communities , including floating gardens and farms .
In the south , we had floating gardens 400 years ago , so it 's nothing new .
We 'll scale up the system and make it work . "
The video conferencing session onboard the education boat was linking an agricultural scientist here at the front of the boat with a distant farmer .
Projected onto the screen for the 40 farmers was both sides of the video call and a display of a pest 's life cycle and instructions on killing it without using commercial pesticides .
The two experts were sharing their knowledge and ensuring that the farmers got the information at the same time .
Soaking up the very positive and engaging feeling onboard I realised that if anyone can make floating farm communities work , then it was Rezwan combined with that clear determination of the Bangladeshis .
It just has to work .
20 million Bangladeshi climate refugees will be counting on it .
DAY ONE : SO MUCH WATER , BUT NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT STUFF " We must do everything we can to provide enough safe water for every Bangladeshi , " says a representative of the environmental services firm , Veolia .
" Climate change has meant that our monsoon is no longer reliable and we are desperately short of water . "
In the small village of Goalmari , about 100 local people gathered to celebrate the opening of the first arsenic water decontamination plant built by Veolia .
It is the result of another successful partnership between Grameen Bank and big business .
Professor Yunus set up Grameen Bank in the 1970s to provide financial services for the rural poor .
Heavy rain falling in Goalmari almost drowned the camera
On the stage , Muhammad Yunus , Grameen Bank officials and local dignitaries all agreed enthusiastically with the opening remarks .
But at the exact moment we all applauded , the heavens opened with the mother of all thunderstorms .
The noise of the heavy rain on the tarpaulins overhead made it almost impossible to hear the presentations .
When the fabric began to sag and leak there was a scramble to cover those on stage with umbrellas .
We all moved around to the dry spots , and young lads pushed up on the sags with long poles and drained the water to the sides .
Then the music started .
Girls danced on stage , everyone bopped to the music , while rain poured in through every seam .
There were no dry places now so we took photographs of our wet selves and had lovely laughing conversations with the villagers .
It did n't matter that I speak no Bangla or that their English was limited ; we were having a great time .
And the event was worthy of a celebration ; the Grameen and Veolia partnership means that these people will now have clean water to drink .
Throughout their lives so far , the only water that has been available to them was contaminated with arsenic .
Traditionally , people here have used rivers and ponds for drinking water .
But by the 1970s , the lack of sanitation and water - borne disease was killing an estimated 250,000 children each year .
The solution seemed simple : tube wells for every village .
Millions of wells were sunk and the unlimited cool water and reduction in the child death rate seemed evidence of success .
But no - one had checked to see if the ground water was safe ; in fact it contains large amounts of naturally - occurring arsenic .
It took over 20 years before testing of the well water over the border in West Bengal showed that it was contaminated , and that it was poisoning large numbers of people .
Early symptoms of arsenic poisoning include skin blisters and dark blotches .
This is followed by internal organ damage and arsenic - induced cancers .
Solving this crisis is a huge task .
It will take longer to test all of the tube wells than it took to drill them .
It will take longer still to set up decontamination plants .
And even longer than that to communicate the problem to the millions of people who remember the well water as something marvellous that saved them from the surface water diseases .
In the meantime , over 50 million people are still drinking water that is poisoning them .
So we really did have something to celebrate at Goalmari .
The innovative partnership of Grameen and Veolia started to save lives from the first batch of clean water .
The music stopped , the final messages of congratulations were sent from those on stage ; and the rain stopped immediately .
Surely a good omen for the success of this essential project .

Here are some notes about bootstrapping a Centos or Fedora chroot from Debian .
It should also work from Ubuntu with minor changes , but I have n’t checked .
The following should really be done in a chroot , since some commands will install files in your /etc or elsewhere , ignoring the -- installroot passed to yum .
The following instructions are for Centos , but replacing all occurences of centos with fedora should work .
apt - get install yum rpm python - m2crypto .
If at some point , you get error messages about rpmlib( BuiltinLuaScripts ) , you need to install a newer rpm package ( from Debian unstable , for example ) .
.
If at some point , you get error messages about , you need to install a newer rpm package ( from Debian unstable , for example ) .
mkdir -p /tmp/centos/var/lib/rpm
rpm -- root /tmp/centos -- initdb
Go to http://rpm.pbone.net or http://www.rpmfind.net, search for centos - release or fedora - release , and download the rpm for the version you want .
rpm -ivh -- force - debian -- nodeps -- root /tmp/centos centos-release*rpm ( that populates / tmp / centos / etc with information about the centos repositories )
( that populates / tmp / centos / etc with information about the centos repositories ) yum -- installroot / tmp / centos / install yum .
That fails because of missing GPG information in / etc / pki .
Do ln -s /tmp/centos/etc/pki
/etc/pki , then again yum -- installroot / tmp / centos / install yum .
.
That fails because of missing GPG information in / etc / pki .
Do , then again .
mount -t proc foo /tmp/ centos / proc
mount -t sysfs foo /tmp/ centos/sys
chroot /tmp/centos / bin/ bash -- login
If you get errors about different DB versions between Debian ’s RPM and CentOS ’ RPM , you can try , in the CentOS chroot :
cd / var / lib / rpm && rm * ( simplest way to avoid problems between db versions for Debian ’s RPM and centos ’ RPM )
( simplest way to avoid problems between db versions for Debian ’s RPM and centos ’ RPM ) rpm -- initdb
yum install yum ( again , to restore the rpm db )
( again , to restore the rpm db ) yum install vim-minimal less
That ’s all !
Update : Jaldhar Vyas pointed me to mach , and Paul Wise to mock .
Both packages are available in Debian , but use config files for each release shipped in the package .
Unfortunately , both packages are out of date , and do n’t include Fedora 9 or newer .
Also , mock does n’t support Centos .
Anyway , both packages could use a new maintainer .

Remember that incredible trailer for Katamari Forever that had us all goggling at our computers with it 's epic weirdness ?
Luckily , the game is looking good for its US release later this year and I got to spend some time with it today .
I came away with three new trailers to share with you , three of which are after the jump -- enjoy !
While I do n't have a ton of new info to share with you since Dyson 's preview of the game ( see link above ) , I can tell you that this is the prettiest we 've ever seen a Katamari game look .
The filters you can use allow you to play these gorgeous levels in any way you like .
Namco Bandai told me that Katamari Forever contains some of the best levels from each of the Katamari levels , so the game is like a best of collection with a makeover .
For some , that is going to be the last thing they want , but for a Katamari addict like me , Namco could offer me a cell phone Katamari with four minutes of gameplay of the King of Cosmos playing dress up and I 'd probably buy it .
Katamari Forever offers a lot more than that , so I 'll happily pick it up .
There was not a cloud in the sky over the Boston Common yesterday during the 20th annual Boston Freedom Rally , but there was plenty of smoke .
It was the first time the pro-marijuana rally organized by the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition had been held since the November election , when voters passed Proposition 2 .
The ballot initiative made possession of less than an ounce of marijuana a civil offense rather than a crime .
The changed law gave the large crowds in attendance yesterday a new reason to celebrate and one less reason to get arrested - an outcome that organizers said is a welcome change .
The event has caused controversy over the years because of many arrests and battles with the city over permit issues .
This year , as in the past , many people smoked marijuana openly as an act of civil disobedience .
“ After years of helplessly watching Boston Police bag harmless stoners , it will be a joy to see people enjoying themselves without the threat or fear of arrest , ’’ said Keith Saunders , president of the reform coalition , on the rally ’s website .
“ This is a victory party , ’’ said Bill Bones , a long - time board member for the coalition , also known as MassCann .
“ We got 65 percent to come out and vote for freedom .
Too many people make mistakes when they are young , and then get slapped with a criminal record .
Well they are not criminals , and we are celebrating this today . ’’
Gary Gossum , 50 , of Boston , said the new law was the major reason he attended the festival this year .
“ I have come to this event off and on , but had n’t been coming in the most recent years .
It was getting too hard , ’’ he said .
“ But now it is nice again , since marijuana is decriminalized . ’’
The more lenient policies , however , did not stop law enforcement officers from issuing 136 citations of $ 100 each for marijuana possession and making three arrests for possession with intent to distribute , according to Officer James Kenneally , spokesman for the Boston police .
He said the event was peaceful .
Even with the passage of Proposition 2 , which took effect Jan. 2 , it is still illegal to smoke marijuana in public .
But an arrest for possession of under an ounce of marijuana is punishable with a civil fine of $ 100 and not a criminal penalty .
Previously , simple possession was a misdemeanor that carried penalties of up to six months in jail , a fine of up to $ 500 and was listed as a criminal record .
Under Proposition 2 , violators under 18 must attend a drug - awareness program that includes 10 hours of community service within a year of the citation , or the fine increases to $ 1,000 .
Sean McGivney , 19 , of Hampton , N.H. , was one of those who received a citation for possession of marijuana at yesterday ’s rally .
“ We were sitting politely , minding our own business , making a point not to smoke when people were around .
That is when a guy came up and told us to ‘ hand it over , ’ ’’ McGivney said .
“ I am glad the laws are more lenient , but I do n’t think it ’s enough . ’’
Last year , six arrests were made for possession , many fewer than in previous years .
In 2006 , 53 were arrested on marijuana - related charges .
Some attended the rally to spread the word about other drug law issues , including a move to lessen penalties for students with campus drug offenses .

The used game market , for quite some time , has been a thorn in the side of developers and publishers .
There is a huge market for used games : GameStop derives 23 percent of its annual revenue from used game sales — an enormous $ 2 billion .
Not accounting other used game outlets like eBay , Amazon , Best Buy and Blockbuster , it is easy to see from GameStop alone that used games are big business .
But developers and publishers are not seeing a single dime from used game sales , and a number have spoken out against the practice .
“ The pre-owned market is a serious problem , because there is no benefit to developers or publishers , ” Eidos life president Ian Livingstone told the BBC in a recent interview .
“ A shop makes a bigger margin on a pre-owned title , and can sell them six or seven times , so there is no incentive for them to reorder and the content creator gets no slice of the action . ”
Indeed , profit margins are high for used game retailers .
GameStop reported second quarter earnings today , reporting nearly 46 percent margins on every used game sold , and even that is slightly down from their normal 48 to 50 percent .
It ’s no wonder why plenty of developers and publishers , from Livingstone to Epic ’s Mark Rein , have complained about the effect used games have on their respective businesses .
What are developers and publishers doing about it ?
Enter Electronic Arts .
Last week , EA announced one of the most ambitious attempts to curtail the used game business by offering “ The Stone Prisoner ” pack in all new copies of Dragon Age Origins .
The content offered is not insignificant .
BioWare , the developer of Dragon Age : Origins , has said that the download pack will include hours worth of additional gameplay , exclusive items , and its own unique story arch .
If players choose to buy it used and wish to receive this content , it will cost them $ 15 .
Factoring in buying the game used and then shelling out the additional $ 15 for The Stone Prisoner pack , it will likely cost them more than it if they were to buy the game new .
This is not the first time Electronic Arts , or even another game developer has used this strategy to curtail used game sales .
Epic Games , back in 2008 , packaged in a download card for five “ Flashback ” multiplayer maps for Gears of War 2 , which consisted of some favorite multiplayer maps from the original Gears of War .
Electronic Arts , for its part , have used Sims 3 and Madden NFL 10 as its testing grounds .
In Madden , for example , an unlock code in the manual grants you access to the online franchise mode .
This strategy has been controversial to some gamers .
They alleged , particularly in the case of Dragon Age : Origin , that EA simply was removing content from the game to curtail used game sales .
EA denied this was the case , instead framing it as a gift to their fans .
“ We ’re including The Stone Prisoner DLC as a reward to fans who purchase an original copy of the game , ” BioWare ’s Senior PR Manager Matt Atwood told EndSights .
“ We are doing this to show gamers the type of amazing downloadable content they can expect for Dragon Age : Origins . ”
Will the strategy work ?
Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter seems to think so .
“ Really smart , ” Pachter said of EA ’s used game pushback initative .
Pachter believes that despite complaints in some segments of the gaming community , it will prove successful .
“ The plan to monetize this content sounds like it will appeal to gamers , with little griping from new buyers , and irrelevant whining from used buyers , ” Pachter told me in an e-mail conversation .
GameStop would not comment on what it impact it believed this strategy could have on its business .
But with GameStop reporting a 19 percent rise in used game sales in their fiscal second quarter , the used game market continues to grow , and it ’ll likely take more than Electronic Arts to hamstring the booming used games industry .
I decided to have some fun with Perl 6 and wrote my first obfu .
So here it is , broken to 50 columns per line :
<(*+*)*(*+* +*/*)
**** ** * * *+*+*/* **** ** * * *+*-*/* **** ** * * *+* ****-* **** ** * * *-(*-*/ *) ** (*+*/*) **** ** * * *-* **** ** * * *-*+*/* **** ** * * *+* **** ** * * *-* * * ***((* - */*) ** * * *-*/*) * * **** ** * * *+*/* ****-*
***(*-*
/*)**(*+*/*)
* * ***((*-*/*)** * * *-*/*) * * **** ** * * *+*/* **** ** * * *+*+*/*-* * *>.split(<*** >) . map : {eval ( " (* ** *+*+*-*/*+$ _)(<* * *>) " ) . chr\ . print}
( Not syntax - hilighted as I usually do here because the syntax hilighter does this one oh so wrong , it would only enhance confusion ) .
It works on today 's Rakudo build , but I 'm not aware of any feature that I use which was n't available in the 2009 - 08 release .
Have fun figuring it out !
Update : Since it has caused a bit of confusion on #perl6 , it does not print the usual obfu text , but rather a minor variation .
Second update : Newer Rakudo versions implement a slightly updated specification regarding the Whatever - star , which requires some updates .
Here is an updated version which works on Rakudo 2012.03 to 2012.05 .
In the face of growing pressure for inclusive schooling in Ireland and outrage over the latest child abuse scandals involving Catholic orders , bishops in Ireland are defiantly seeking to maintain their grip on schooling in the country .
Ireland 's Catholic Church is involved in the running of hundreds of schools across the country .
Following a three - day meeting in Maynooth , the national seminary , which among other issues , focused mainly on the fallout from the Ryan Report into the widespread abuse of children in religious - run State institutions , the bishops issued a public statement .
The Catholic leaders insisted that children are now adequately protected from the risk of abuse in their schools and said it would be wrong to remove religious orders from the managing of schools .
Campaigners against abuse say the culture of secrecy , denial and partiality which enabled appalling and systematic abuse some years ago has still not been removed .
In Northern Ireland , the Catholic Church and some Protestant leaders are resisting the growth of inclusive ( non-denominational ) schooling , though others in the churches and the wider community want to see public education opened up for all , irrespective of religion .
Blue America PAC has instructed me to tell you to not place any of their advertising within the Glenn Beck program on Fox News Channel for their upcoming flight .
There is a national boycott of his advertisers ongoing .
as Mr. Beck has been promoting racism and violence on his program .
We do not want to appear to support his efforts in any way , shape or form .
Thank you for your attention to this matter .
Sincerely ,
Jacqueline Propps
Thank you for contacting Men ’s Wearhouse and bringing to our attention your concerns with the Glenn Beck program on Fox News .
While we support free speech and do not make advertising decisions based on our own personal ideologies , after reviewing his recent incendiary comments we have decided to remove our advertising from his program .
We hope that this decision will allow you to continue to patronize Men ’s Wearhouse .
I would encourage you to please share our decision with anyone else who may have expressed a similar concern .
We deeply appreciate your reaching out to us and sharing your comments and concerns about Sargento ads appearing during The Glenn Beck Show .
We sat down with the marketing department to talk about it and I learned that we buy time periods not specific programs .
But in any event , they 've made the decision to exclude that program from our future ad rotation .
Simply stated , Sargento ads wo n't be airing during that show .
Again , thanks for contacting us .
TVNewser has learned , and a CNN spokesperson confirms , that in his morning editorial meeting today , CNN / U.S. president Jon Klein asked his show producers to avoid booking talk radio hosts .
" Complex issues require world class reporting , " Klein is quoted as saying , adding that talk radio hosts too often add to the noise , and that what they say is " all too predictable . "
" The industry is up to the same dirty tricks this year , " Potter said at a Capitol news conference after meeting with House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y. ) , an avid supporter of the Democrats ' plans for a healthcare overhaul .
" When you hear someone complaining about traveling down a ' slippery slope to socialism , ' some insurance flack , like I used to be , wrote that , " Potter added .
Potter said during his 20 years in the insurance business , the industry would funnel money to large public firms who would create front groups and find friendly voices in conservative media .
In particular , he cited front groups created to fight " Patients ' Bill of Rights " legislation in the 1990s , as well as a campaign to discredit the Michael Moore film Sicko , which harshly criticized the industry .
Slaughter joined in the attack , saying " the notion that this is going to be something devilish comes from the people who would lose money on it . "
Dear Roger -
We did not specifically place our ad on the show .
We basically buy ads in bulk and then they are placed somewhat randomly .
However , we have now specifically asked that our ads do not appear during this show .
Thank you for your concern ,
Sincerely ,
Amanda
That irresistible line about the caveman , by the way , came from a reddit commenter .
He was probably feeling celebratory over the fact that GEICO pulled all its advertising from Glenn Beck 's hateful Fox TV show .
And GEICO is n't the only company to have decided that advertising on the show of a vicious hate monger inciting violence and racial hatred is a bad marketing idea .
Men 's Wearhouse and Sargento are the latest companies to ask Fox to stop running their ads on TV .
And today -- Blue America did the same .
Blue America is running a second wave of ads on Arkansas TV explaining Blanche Lincoln 's duplicitous role in the health care debate .
After looking at the logs of the first wave and noticing that some of our ads in Little Rock and Pine Bluff ran on Beck 's show , we instructed the cable networks to not run any more ads on his programs in the towns we are advertising in this week -- the towns where Lincoln is doing her health care forums .
Here 's the note the Blue America media buyer sent to the Arkansas cable networks :
As for Men 's Wearhouse , DailyKos published a letter yesterday from Matt Stringer , the vp of marketing / creative services :
And Media Matters published a similar note from Pat Lombardo from the Sargento Consumer Affairs Department :
As Color Of Change , the online civil rights group that initiated the boycott , points out , these defections come on the heels of pull outs by LexisNexis - owned Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble , Progressive Insurance and SC Johnson .
So what 's wrong with Travelocity ?
Why do they insist on still underwriting the hatred , bigotry and violence ?
As a reader pointed out on my travel blog this morning , " perhaps someone could clue Travelocity into the fact that racists are n't the biggest travelers ... " CNN has a similar type of problem with their own in house racist sociopath , Lou Dobbs and , according to MediaBistro.com the network is moving away from using Hate Talk Radio commentators on the air from now on , although they still refuse to fire Dobbs ( who also hosts a hate talk radio show ) .
Yesterday I spent over 4 hours at a town hall meeting hosted by Rep. Adam Schiff in Alhambra .
The disruptive clowns who had come to prevent a discussion were shouting slogans straight from the Astro - Turf outfits ' talking points and their world views were clearly formed by Hate Talk Radio and Fox " News . "
These people are hysterically opposed to immigrants ' babies getting health care and opposed to the government making it illegal for Insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions .
What they chant instead is " Tort Reform " and what they mutter is divisive and racist epithets most Americans thought went out of style with Lester Maddox , George Wallace and the cavemen .
The teabaggers like to take their thumbs out of their asses and jump up and down in front of the TV cameras claiming how real and genuine their grassroots protests are .
I talked to so many of them with long lists of legitimate grievances -- one woman was suing her insurance company and very angry man with strange eyes is suing the gold company Glenn Beck shills for on radio that he claims cheated him -- but their grievances had nothing to do with what they disdainfully call " ObamaCare . "
How did they get from there to here ?
It was n't via Pluto .
According to a former Insurance Industry executive , Wendell Potter of CIGNA , the insurance companies are indeed the unseen hand behind the curtain manipulating the righteous -- or self - righteous -- indignation of the angry crowds getting their matching orders from hate - mongers like Glenn Beck , Lou Dobbs , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , etc .
The same thing happened to Travelocity that happened to Blue America .
Like us , they just did a cable buy and wound up with some of their ads going to underwrite the hatred , racism and violence being incited by Glenn Beck .
And like Blue America , Travelocity has asked the cable systems to stop running their ads on the hate shows .
After all , how many racists like to travel anyway ?
Where would they go ?
From C&L Joining
Travelocity in announcing that they were no longer allowing their ads to run on Beck 's show are major advertisers like ConAgra ( Healthy Choice ) , Radio Shack , Roche and Sanofi - Aventis .
Beck has been apoplectic in his tweets over this -- as well as weeping on TV again .

Maemo 6 to get multitouch & gestures with Qt 4.6
If you needed another reason to look beyond Maemo 5 to its successor , Maemo 6 , set to be released in around twelve months time , then how about multitouch and gesture - based input ?
Nokia have confirmed that Qt 4.6 will be optimized for Maemo 6 but also see a port to the upcoming Symbian 4 , as well as bringing with it improvements to the WebKit browser and a reduction in the need for widgets .
“ The Qt WebKit Integration has been extended with an API to access and modify the contents ( DOM ) of Web pages being browsed , as well as performance improvements and a new JavaScriptCore based backend for QtScript ” Nokia
Meanwhile Qt 4.6 applications will also run faster and smoother , thanks to overall improvements to the code .
In addition to the Qt 4.6 port to Symbian it will also support Windows 7 and OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard .
At Nokia World last week , the company discussed its new approach to webapps and how it would bridge the divide between native software and web - based functionality .
The initial push is for navigation - based software , using new APIs for GPS functionality .

The Most Divisive Video Games of All Time
By Graeme Cole , 21 September 2020
There ’s an old saying in gaming : never trust a game critic !
But is there truth in the adage ?
Or is …

Based on its long - term orbit , Earth should be heading into an ice age .
But instead of continuing to cool — as it had been for at least the past 2,000 years — the Arctic has started to warm .
And the reason is humans ' impact on the composition of the atmosphere , new research suggests .
To look at this trend , geologist Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University and a consortium of colleagues reconstructed Arctic temperatures decade by decade over the past two millennia by pulling sediment cores from the bottoms of 14 Arctic lakes — backed up by records in tree rings and ice cores .
In warm summers , relatively more sediment is deposited thanks to more meltwater from the glaciers that create these lakes , and the abundance of algae in the sediment layers reveals the length of growing seasons .
So , these sediment cores provide a picture of the climate that goes back millennia .
The record they reveal is of a cooling pole .
As the Earth has moved slightly further away from the sun due to vagaries in its orbit — it 's roughly 600,000 miles further away now than in 1 C.E. — some parts of the Arctic received as much as 6 watts per meter squared less sunlight than in 1 C.E .
That , in turn , has led to a cooling rate of roughly 0.2 degrees Celsius per 1,000 years .
But at some point in the 20th century , that trend stopped and reversed .
" Orbitally driven summer insolation continued to decrease through the 20th century , implying that summer temperatures should have continued to cool , " the researchers wrote this week in the September 4 edition of Science .
" Instead , the shift to higher temperatures during the 20th century reversed the millennial scale cooling trend . "
In the past decade , summertime Arctic temperatures have been 1.4 degrees Celsius higher on average than would be expected and 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than in 1900 .
And the Arctic is merely the trendsetter — the northern - most latitudes are among the fastest - warming parts of the globe due to various feedbacks .
For example , melting Arctic sea ice exposes more ocean , which in turn absorbs more of the sunlight 's warmth and further increases warming .
A graph of the warming trend largely replicates the so - called " hockey stick , " a previous reconstruction that showed relatively stable temperatures suddenly spiking upward in recent history .
It also accurately reveals the impact of historical climate events like the Little Ice Age , which took place from the 17th to 19th centuries .
Without greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , a true ice age might have been expected as a 21,000 - year wobble in Earth 's tilt relative to the sun that shifts the intensity of sunlight .
That cooling trend would n't have reversed naturally for at least another 4,000 years .
Yet , despite this decline , Arctic temperatures have soared and the most likely culprit is the build - up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning , forest clearing and other human activity , Kaufmann and his colleagues wrote .
" The most recent 10 - year interval ( 1999 –2008 ) was the warmest of the past 200 decades , " they wrote .
" Temperatures were about 1.4 degrees C higher than the projected values based on the linear cooling trend and were even more anomalous than previously documented . "
Of course , summer temperatures when the warming portion of the wobble cycle peaked roughly 7,500 years ago were at least 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than 20th - century average temperatures .
Nonetheless , this current , countercyclical warming trend will likely continue — potentially exceeding that earlier warming — unless greenhouse gas levels begin to come back down .
In the meantime , polar denizens adapted for the cooler climate can blame humanity for a balmier Arctic .
I did n’t have time to do this post for the Public Sex question , but it fits better here anyway .
This is going back a few years now , to a time when I was seeing a very nice gentleman called Brian .
We were both divorced and unused to the dating game , but he was a lot of fun and a very proficient lover .
We saw each other for a few months but then decided that we should end it while we were still friends , as both of us were looking for something more permanent and agreed that we were never going to ‘ fall in love ’ with each other .
Anyway , back to the story .
There was an item either on ‘ In Touch ’ or ‘ The Food Programme ’ on Radio 4 about a restaurant that serves food in the dark .
It ’s staffed by blind and partially sighted waiters and sounded a bit different .
Brian suggested that it sounded like a bit of a laugh and I said it sounded like a good opportunity for a bit of a public fumble .
So , we booked a couple of places ( everyone sits at one long table on benches , to make things easier ) , packed the kids off to my parents for the night and , after a quickie to get us in the mood , we showered and got changed .
We ’d decided to be a bit daring and both go ‘ commando ’ , in case the chance for a bit of you - know - what presented itself .
Brian was wearing loose jeans with a button fly and I had a flowing , knee length summer dress which buttoned up the front .
Brian also put a Johnny in his pocket , just in case .
So , we arrived at ‘ Dans le Noir ’ and were shown into the bar by the sighted Maitre d’ for a drink .
The lighting was low to get us accustomed gradually to the dark .
There were couples and small groups sitting around and I noticed a fair few blind customers with their partners or families .
We both opted for the ‘ surprise menu ’ , where you rely on touch , taste and smell to discover what ’s on your plate .
The big moment arrived and were led down a dim corridor , each customer with their hand on the shoulder of the person in front .
It was a bit like finding your way to your seat in the cinema after the lights have gone down ; there were tiny lights along the corridor and you could just make out the person in front of you .
Then , we pushed through some black velvet curtains and we were in COMPLETE and UTTER darkness .
With some bashing of shins and kicking each other , we all stepped over the bench and sat down .
If you want to know what it was like , go into a dark - room , leave the light off and close the door .
Then put a hood over your head and a blindfold over that .
The dinner was probably the strangest I ’ve attended but possibly the most exciting too .
As soon as we were comfortable and had found our asparagus tips and mayonnaise , I undid a couple of the lowest buttons on my dress , then found Brian ’s right hand and guided it to my lap .
He reciprocated , undoing his fly , releasing the beast and guiding my left hand .
There then followed a conversation of such filthy double entendres as has ever been carried out in a public restaurant .
“ Wow , that asparagus is really firm . ”
“ Have you tried dipping it in the mayonnaise ? ” etc. etc.
Meanwhile
I was gently handling his rigid cock and his fingers were fiddling with my clit as I spread my legs wide apart on the bench .
The main course was some type of fish with new potatoes and green beans but I could hardly concentrate on finding it on my plate as I was nearing orgasm .
I had to try to keep my ragged breathing quiet as all sounds were magnified in the dark and my heartbeat sounded loud enough in my ears to be audible to the guy sitting on my right .
Brian kept sliding his fingers into me and I was pumping his cock for all I was worth .
We had to stop as they cleared the dishes and brought in the dessert - apricot tart with a scoop of delicious ice - cream .
I almost screamed as Brian recommenced with a spot of ice - cream on his fingers and as I stuffed apricot tart into my mouth I covered my orgasm with a groan of delight , commenting on the food .
Brian slipped the Johnny on and I finished him off as he downed a glass of wine .
“ God , I love sticky puddings with cream on the side . ” .
We were both completely sated by this time and I took the opportunity of the dark room to lick my plate clean before doing up my buttons again .
Brian carefully took the full Johnny off , tied it off and put it back in his pocket before wiping himself with the napkin and buttoning up .
“ OK folks , if you all stand and put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you , we will now leave the dining room .
” As we emerged into the dim corridor and then the gently lit bar we were more than a little surprised to see that the Maitre d’ , who had been leading us , was wearing night - vision goggles .
He gave the pair of us a huge grin as he took them off and said , “ I trust that was a uniquely enjoyable experience for you .
It certainly was for me .
” Oh boy .
Nice one K , you did it again . ( , Tue 28 Jul 2009 , 14:09 , 9 replies
So , Michael Vick is an Eagle .
Holy @#$ %!!!
My initial reaction is , I have no idea what Jeff Lurie , Joe Banner and Andy Reid are thinking .
You have a franchise quarterback that you just handed more money in order to make him feel secure and safe .
Now , you bring in a guy who just served two years in Leavenworth for purposely killing dogs for dough .
An athlete who some feel does n’t belong on the streets , let alone the NFL .
Why , why , do you make this move ?
I do n’t know .
Did they let Donovan McNabb in on the deal ?
Did he give them their blessing ?
Do they even care what he thinks ?
Again , I do n’t know .
This seems to say more about the development of Kevin Kolb than anything else .
Kolb , currently injured , has shown nothing in limited time .
Is Vick an upgrade ?
He was n’t a system quarterback before all his troubles .
He ’s been sitting in a jail cell for two years .
Yeah , you can use him in a “ Wildcat ” formation for a few plays a game , but that does n’t justify inking one of the most vilified athletes of the last 30 years .
And it also does n’t justify the public relations nightmare that ’s about to hit the city of Philadelphia .
I do n’t get it .
How does this improve what many consider a Super Bowl - ready team ?
In my opinion , it does n’t .
The 2009 season now becomes all about Michael Vick .
Forget the retooled offensive line ; forget the dynamic rookie class ; forget Joe Mays ; forget Sean McDermott .
The circus has arrived .
A circus named Michael Vick .
As another vilified Eagle once said , “ Get your popcorn ready ! ”

The Blitz was a name given in general to the bombing of Britain during the Second World War , and in particular to intensive individual bombing campaigns directed at different cities .
The Blitz started on the 7th September 1940 , and London was bombed that night , and every single following night for 57 days .
It continued in London and across the country and was initially intended to soften Britain up for an invasion .
Operation Sealion , the Nazi invasion plan , included softening the population up by bombing them to smithereens .
There had been some bombing of Britain during the First World War by Zeppelin raids .
In the inter War period , the authorities became increasingly aware that bombing could be extremely dangerous to a civilian population .
The destruction of Guernica , in Spain , by German aeroplanes revealed only too well the high costs which could be paid .
By the end of May 1941 , in London alone , 22,000 civilians had been killed in the Blitz and over a million houses destroyed or seriously damaged .
In the War as a whole from beginning to end , nearly 52,000 civilians died from bombing raids .
Then there came the “ Doodle Bugs ” V1 and V2 flying bombs and rockets .
Those killed a further 9,000 civilians , all in London and the south - east .
The original raids starting on the 7th September 1940 were mostly aimed at the industrial and port areas of London , on the river .
There were densely populated residential areas near the docks , and on the 7th and 8th September 1940 alone , over 400 Londoners were killed , and another 1,500 seriously injured .
Between mid September and mid November 100 to 200 bombers attacked London every single night apart from one .
London was n’t the only target , other cities attacked included Birmingham , Liverpool , Manchester , Sheffield , Nottingham , Southampton and Coventry .
By the end of November 1940 , the Luftwaffe had dropped 15,000 tonnes of high explosives and more than a million incendiary bombs .
From November 1940 until February 1941 , the principal targets were industrial and port cities , including Birmingham , Liverpool , London , Manchester and Sheffield .
The single most violent raid occurred on 29th December 1940 , when the centre of London was attacked mainly with incendiary devices .
It was known as the Second Great Fire of London , and caused the most destruction of any bombing raid during the War .
St Paul ’s Cathedral , designed by Sir Christopher Wren , was left as almost the only building standing in its area .
There was a particular dedication to St Paul ’s Cathedral by local volunteer fire watchers , and several climbed onto the roof of St Paul ’s during the bombing raid to douse burning material and push incendiary bombs off the roof .
Photographs showing St Paul ’s standing alone amid unbelievable destruction became a symbol of Britain ’s resistance .
Quarrel may be linked to drug find in Durant
DURANT — A bad breakup or a lovers ’ quarrel are the leading theories Bryant County officials have for finding nearly $ 500,000 worth of someone ’s property strewn about a Durant area street last week .
Just as surprising as the overall value was the property itself : 236 potted , high - grade marijuana plants .
" Strangest thing I ’ve ever seen , ” said Chuck Carroll , field supervisor for the District 19 Drug Task Force .
" That ( a domestic dispute ) is the first thing that came to our minds .
Someone wanted this marijuana to be found . ”
A caller reported " shrubs ” in the road about 1:30 a.m.
Tuesday and called back a short time later saying they appeared to be marijuana , Carroll said .
Some plants were standing upright and others toppled , in the middle of and next to the street .
Carroll and the deputies found about 156 in several groups , each about 100 yards apart .
They found 80 more about a mile away .
The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control estimates the plants ’ street value at $ 2,000 each .
" Crazy .
Someone ’s Christmas is going to be lean this year , ” Carroll said .
" These were indoor - grown , very good marijuana plants . ”
Investigators had not made any arrests as of late last week .
The plants were destroyed .
" We got a county commissioner to dig us a hole and furnish some diesel , and we burned it , ” Carroll said .
" A half - million dollars ’ worth of marijuana up in smoke . ”
Regular expressions are a language of their own .
When you learn a new programming language , they 're this little sub - language that makes no sense at first glance .
Many times you have to read another tutorial , article , or book just to understand the " simple " pattern described .
Today , we 'll review eight regular expressions that you should know for your next coding project .
Before we start , you might want to check out some of the regex apps on Envato Market , such as :
You can extract emails , proxies , IPs , phone numbers , addresses , HTML tags , URLs , links , dates , etc .
Just insert one or multiple regular expressions and sources URLs , and start the process .
Extract , scrape , parse , harvest .

Background Info on Regular Expressions
This is what Wikipedia has to say about them :
In computing , regular expressions provide a concise and flexible means for identifying strings of text of interest , such as particular characters , words , or patterns of characters .
Regular expressions ( abbreviated as regex or regexp , with plural forms regexes , regexps , or regexen ) are written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor , a program that either serves as a parser generator or examines text and identifies parts that match the provided specification .
Now , that does n't really tell me much about the actual patterns .
The regexes I 'll be going over today contains characters such as \w , \s , \1 , and many others that represent something totally different from what they look like .
If you 'd like to learn a little about regular expressions before you continue reading this article , I 'd suggest watching the Regular Expressions for Dummies screencast series .
The eight regular expressions we 'll be going over today will allow you to match a ( n ) : username , password , email , hex value ( like #fff or # 000 ) , slug , URL , IP address , and an HTML tag .
As the list goes down , the regular expressions get more and more confusing .
The pictures for each regex in the beginning are easy to follow , but the last four are more easily understood by reading the explanation .
The key thing to remember about regular expressions is that they are almost read forwards and backwards at the same time .
This sentence will make more sense when we talk about matching HTML tags .
Note :
The delimiters used in the regular expressions are forward slashes , " / " .
Each pattern begins and ends with a delimiter .
If a forward slash appears in a regex , we must escape it with a backslash : " \/ " .
1. Matching a Username
Pattern :
Description :
We begin by telling the parser to find the beginning of the string ( ^ ) , followed by any lowercase letter ( a - z ) , number ( 0 - 9 ) , an underscore , or a hyphen .
Next , { 3,16} makes sure that are at least 3 of those characters , but no more than 16 .
Finally , we want the end of the string ( $ ) .
String that matches :
my - us3r_n4m3
String that does n't match :
th1s1s-wayt00_l0ngt0 beausername ( too long )
2. Matching a Password
Pattern :
Description :
Matching a password is very similar to matching a username .
The only difference is that instead of 3 to 16 letters , numbers , underscores , or hyphens , we want 6 to 18 of them ( { 6,18} ) .
String that matches :
myp4ssw0rd
String that does n't match :
mypa$ $ w0rd ( contains a dollar sign )
3. Matching a Hex Value
Pattern :
Description :
We begin by telling the parser to find the beginning of the string ( ^ ) .
Next , a number sign is optional because it is followed a question mark .
The question mark tells the parser that the preceding character — in this case a number sign — is optional , but to be " greedy " and capture it if it 's there .
Next , inside the first group ( first group of parentheses ) , we can have two different situations .
The first is any lowercase letter between a and f or a number six times .
The vertical bar tells us that we can also have three lowercase letters between a and f or numbers instead .
Finally , we want the end of the string ( $ ) .
The reason that I put the six character before is that parser will capture a hex value like # ffffff .
If I had reversed it so that the three characters came first , the parser would only pick up #fff and not the other three f's .
String that matches :
#a3c113
String that does n't match :
# 4d82h4 ( contains the letter h )
4. Matching a Slug
Pattern :
Description :
You will be using this regex if you ever have to work with mod_rewrite and pretty URL's .
We begin by telling the parser to find the beginning of the string ( ^ ) , followed by one or more ( the plus sign ) letters , numbers , or hyphens .
Finally , we want the end of the string ( $ ) .
String that matches :
my - title - here
String that does n't match :
my_title_here ( contains underscores )
5. Matching an Email
Pattern :
Description :
We begin by telling the parser to find the beginning of the string ( ^ ) .
Inside the first group , we match one or more lowercase letters , numbers , underscores , dots , or hyphens .
I have escaped the dot because a non-escaped dot means any character .
Directly after that , there must be an at sign .
Next is the domain name which must be : one or more lowercase letters , numbers , underscores , dots , or hyphens .
Then another ( escaped ) dot , with the extension being two to six letters or dots .
I have 2 to 6 because of the country specific TLD's ( .ny.us or .co.uk ) .
Finally , we want the end of the string ( $ ) .
String that matches :
john@doe.com
String that does n't match :
john@doe.something ( TLD is too long )
6. Matching a URL
Pattern :
Description :
This regex is almost like taking the ending part of the above regex , slapping it between " http : / / " and some file structure at the end .
It sounds a lot simpler than it really is .
To start off , we search for the beginning of the line with the caret .
The first capturing group is all option .
It allows the URL to begin with " http : / / " , " https : // " , or neither of them .
I have a question mark after the s to allow URL's that have http or https .
In order to make this entire group optional , I just added a question mark to the end of it .
Next is the domain name : one or more numbers , letters , dots , or hypens followed by another dot then two to six letters or dots .
The following section is the optional files and directories .
Inside the group , we want to match any number of forward slashes , letters , numbers , underscores , spaces , dots , or hyphens .
Then we say that this group can be matched as many times as we want .
Pretty much this allows multiple directories to be matched along with a file at the end .
I have used the star instead of the question mark because the star says zero or more , not zero or one .
If a question mark was to be used there , only one file / directory would be able to be matched .
Then a trailing slash is matched , but it can be optional .
Finally we end with the end of the line .
String that matches :
https://net.tutsplus.com/about
String that does n't match :
http://google.com/some/file!.html ( contains an exclamation point )
7. Matching an IP Address
Pattern :
Description :
Now , I 'm not going to lie , I did n't write this regex ; I got it from here .
Now , that does n't mean that I can't rip it apart character for character .
The first capture group really is n't a captured group because
was placed inside which tells the parser to not capture this group ( more on this in the last regex ) .
We also want this non-captured group to be repeated three times — the {3 } at the end of the group .
This group contains another group , a subgroup , and a literal dot .
The parser looks for a match in the subgroup then a dot to move on .
The subgroup is also another non-capture group .
It 's just a bunch of character sets ( things inside brackets ) : the string " 25 " followed by a number between 0 and 5 ; or the string " 2 " and a number between 0 and 4 and any number ; or an optional zero or one followed by two numbers , with the second being optional .
After we match three of those , it 's onto the next non-capturing group .
This one wants : the string " 25 " followed by a number between 0 and 5 ; or the string " 2 " with a number between 0 and 4 and another number at the end ; or an optional zero or one followed by two numbers , with the second being optional .
We end this confusing regex with the end of the string .
String that matches :
73.60.124.136 ( no , that is not my IP address :P)
String that does n't match :
256.60.124.136 ( the first group must be " 25 " and a number between zero and five )
8. Matching an HTML Tag
Pattern :
Description :
One of the more useful regexes on the list .
It matches any HTML tag with the content inside .
As usually , we begin with the start of the line .
First comes the tag 's name .
It must be one or more letters long .
This is the first capture group , it comes in handy when we have to grab the closing tag .
The next thing are the tag 's attributes .
This is any character but a greater than sign ( > ) .
Since this is optional , but I want to match more than one character , the star is used .
The plus sign makes up the attribute and value , and the star says as many attributes as you want .
Next comes the third non-capture group .
Inside , it will contain either a greater than sign , some content , and a closing tag ; or some spaces , a forward slash , and a greater than sign .
The first option looks for a greater than sign followed by any number of characters , and the closing tag .
\ 1 is used which represents the content that was captured in the first capturing group .
In this case it was the tag 's name .
Now , if that could n't be matched we want to look for a self closing tag ( like an img , br , or hr tag ) .
This needs to have one or more spaces followed by " /> " .
The regex is ended with the end of the line .
String that matches :
Nettuts " > http://net.tutsplus.com/ "
>Nettuts +
String that does n't match :
<img src= " img.jpg " alt = " My image > " />
( attributes can't contain greater than signs )
Conclusion
I hope that you have grasped the ideas behind regular expressions a little bit better .
Hopefully you 'll be using these regexes in future projects !
Many times you wo n't need to decipher a regex character by character , but sometimes if you do this it helps you learn .
Just remember , do n't be afraid of regular expressions , they might not seem it , but they make your life a lot easier .
Just try and pull out a tag 's name from a string without regular expressions !

Report says regulations hurt state 's economy Small business
Regulations on small businesses in California have cost the state 's economy $ 492 billion and 3.8 million jobs , according to a report quietly released by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's office this week .
Republicans in the Legislature have pounced on the findings and on Thursday called the report the " smoking gun " that proves lawmakers are killing the state 's economy through burdensome government mandates .
But Democrats and at least one capital think tank are highly skeptical of the accuracy of the findings .
The 84 - page report does not specify which regulations were studied and relies on data collected largely by Forbes .
Citing the report , Republicans said the state should suspend implementation of Assembly Bill 32 , California 's greenhouse gas reduction plan championed by the governor , along with all other new regulations .
" We are protecting ourselves literally to death , " said Assemblyman Roger Niello , R- Fair Oaks ( Sacramento County ) , at a Capitol news conference held by Republicans to call for action , including legislative hearings and further study to determine costs , or benefits of specific regulations .
The report , authored by Sanjay B. Varshney , the dean of the business school at California State University Sacramento and Dennis H. Tootelian , a marketing professor at Sacramento State , totaled the " direct , indirect and induced " costs of regulation to calculate the $ 492 billion figure .
It found the cost of regulation was $ 134,122 per small business in 2007 and caused about one job loss per small business .
" This study provides the most comprehensive and complete analysis of the total regulatory burden in California , " the authors wrote in their findings .
They relied on data compiled by Forbes and used a complicated formula to calculate the primary and secondary costs of regulations .
They concede that " much more work will need to be done to determine the exact nature of potential remedies to the regulatory burden . "
But Democrats are skeptical of the findings .
" I look forward to reviewing the study , but Californians understand that there is a difference between unreasonable regulations and laws that protect kids from asthma , the elderly from abuse and workers from dangerous work conditions , " said state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , in a statement .
Jean Ross , executive director of the nonprofit California Budget Project that analyzes reams of state data , said she would hesitate to call the report research and said she suspected it supported a " predetermined agenda . "
" How they even get to the starting point for the calculation they do is a stretch , " Ross said .
Marty Keller , Schwarzenegger 's small - business advocate who was responsible for commissioning the report that was mandated by the Legislature , said he does n't question the accuracy of the findings and said policy experts and lawmakers should now take a closer look at " what works and what does n't work " with regulations .
Regardless of lawmakers ' next move , it is extremely unlikely that AB32 , which was not factored into the study , will be affected .
The Republican governor told a San Francisco audience Thursday , the third anniversary of his signing of the legislation , that calls for suspending the law are political posturing designed to score points on the campaign trail .
September 28 , 2009
The war against our minds has many dark levels , all of which attempt to hide truth which is not sanctioned by the police state , replacing it with a new fabricated " official version " of events .
The state / corporate controlled media informs us of what we are to think , while multiple forms of coercion , bribery and intimidation are used to reinforce the government�s ideas and convince people to accept them as their own .
Each political protest that attempts to open people�s eyes to the world of untruths which constantly inundates us , exposes the silent majority to more and more of the police state tactics that the ruling elite has gathered together , to use as it wages war against the American public by less than deadly means .
In addition to rubber bullets and flash grenades , the police state brought - out acoustic weapons to herd protestors at the recent G20 Summit in Pittsburgh : Electromagnetic weapons were used by the Honduran military on Pres.
Zelaya , who is holed - up in the Brazilian Embassy : Pain rays have been used in Iraq ( witnesses report that other more exotic lethal weapons were used there , some of which could allegedly melt human flesh , even large vehicles ) :
The weapons pictured above are just some of the known weapons at the tip of the iceberg of electromagnetic weaponry , ranging from the near - lethal , to those capable of causing mass death .
All of these weapons were developed by the military - industrial complex for crowd control .
This says nothing about the even more exotic weapons that have been kept hidden and the next class of electromagnetic weaponry , another level higher in magnitude , intended for use over broad areas , perhaps even hemispheric in reach .
The threat from such massive weaponry is so great that the EU has called for their regulation .
In October 2000 , Congressman Denis J. Kucinich introduced in the House of Representatives a bill , calling for a ban of space based weapons .
In this bill , the definition of a weapons system included : " any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on , or damaging or destroying , a person ( or the biological life , bodily health , mental health , or physical and economic well - being of a person ) � through the use of land - based , sea- based , or space - based systems using radiation , electromagnetic , psychotronic , sonic , laser , or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations for the purpose of information war , mood management , or mind control of such persons or populations " ( 15 ) .
On a personal and more probable level , since , hopefully , most of us won�t be directly attacked by the police state :
There is the standard taser , The long - range taser The multi- shot taser .
And the really long - range taser .
My point in all of these examples is to highlight just how much research has actually gone into giving both the military and law enforcement a whole new range of weaponry , to create an entirely new class of violent tactics to use in enforcing crowd control and to persuade resisters to concede to the demands of authority .
This has empowered government to openly wage war against its own population without violating international law or being charged with war crimes .
Non-lethal weaponry allows the state to physically attack Americans without crossing the line to gunplay , thus side - stepping the Second Amendment and the issue of armed self - defense .
Government warfare against the population is structured much like regular warfare , meaning that enforcement operations are preceded by a period of softening - up the target , using psychological warfare tactics , fighting an informational war .
The softening - up process has been underway in America since WWII .
Just like in real warfare , the first line of offense is to find or plant sympathetic voices in the local media to serve as the primary instrument for the waging of this form of information warfare , where false ideas are introduced and truth about real intentions is discredited .
The government - controlled media pretends that there is no information war , as they work tirelessly to condition the people to accept the non-lethal warfare directed against us .
Movies , TV shows , books and every conceivable method of mass - communication is used to downplay the criminal use of techniques designed for warfare against the civilian population .
The militarization of American police forces and their adaptation to the new low - level warfare techniques is spoon - fed to us , mixed - in with the usual themes of " terrorism " and other fear factors , hoping to intimidate any potential resistance movement before it even begins �stifling the idea itself .
That �s the entire mission of the war against the people , in a nutshell , to stifle all unacceptable ideas within the mind itself , before trouble arises from them .
This is a war against all free minds , against all free thought .
All thought must be of the government - approved variety .
The idea is to replace all unacceptable thinking , acceptable falsehoods must replace reality - based thoughts .
By common consent , the entire " civilized " world operates on the American version of events .
Countries that don�t accept the American version of events are ostracized .
Going against the flow , as determined by American interests , is a certain formula for losing valuable foreign aid and inviting heat of the more aggressive kind .
Individuals who refuse to accept the official version of events are branded as radicals and extremists .
Extremist nations and individuals find themselves facing the full wrath of the police state whenever they contradict the official line , asgiven each night by the controlled press .
The universal psyop goes much deeper than debilitating weapons and the informational war , extending into the populace on a deeply personal subterranean level .
The phenomenon called " mass - stalking " refers to psychological conditioning ( brainwashing ) aimed at specifically targeted individuals , even to entire families , using the time - tested methods .
The targets for this stalking are determined on the basis of intellectual testing and psychological profiling , which is conducted at all the elementary schools in the United States .
With the results obtained by these tests , the herding process of American children begins .
Much like the selective breeding process applied to animal husbandry , some of the human livestock will be separated for special care , while others will be separated from the herd and marked for disposal by the hired hands .
By comparing the results of these intelligence tests to standardized psychological tests , gifted individuals and those with psychological weaknesses are identified , in order to acquire test subjects for both reasons , to further development strategies or for more extensive manipulative techniques .
The results of this testing follow each of the test subjects throughout their juvenile and adult years .
The gifted are set on paths to develop their fullest potentials , while the others who are destined to be society�s outcasts , are set on pathways to lifetimes of pure hell .
The object of the mass - stalking is mass - experimentation in enforced behavior .
Using the most bizarre and effective methods devised by government scientists , unsuspecting individuals are involuntarily subjected to systematic torture , to either cause , or take advantage of split - personality disorders .
The purpose of this cruelty remains unclear �whether it is just another way to advance total state power , or simply a messy sadistic disposal system run by thugs who might otherwise work in slaughter houses , throwing live poultry against walls .
Beginning in their youth , these individual victims of these sadists are systematically subjected to the most disgusting forms of violent , sexual , chemical and electromagnetic torture , in order to destroy their young minds , by splitting and fragmenting them .
Many of these victims were abducted and tortured , others subjected to traumatic sexual and violent events , intended to force susceptible young minds into retreating within themselves , where they would split - off the personality associated with the unacceptable memory and submerge them and the memories associated with them .
The mass - stalking program grew out of the mkultra experiments and the mass - testing based experimentation previously done on American troops for WWII and Korea , intended to separate and develop potential leaders and those who were deemed to be " inadequate soldiers . "
This mass - conditioning program was the prototype for the nationwide program which was to follow .
The secret programs carried - out in hospitals , universities and military bases , which relied upon the crude electro - shock methods of deprogramming , were the forerunners for later , more sophisticated , electromagnetic based memory erasure and stimulation .
Wireless transmission made the entire populace potential subjects for these tests .
These scientific programs for establishing government control over maverick free thinkers are very effective at preempting and suppressing potential resistance .
For those who are not so easily swayed by all this impressive technology or the cruelty of the government�s trained technicians , we know that FEMA camps await to be filled by someone .
Diehard resisters face formidable technical obstacles to their efforts to wake - up the sleeping sheeple and reach - out to those who have just given - up .
The task before us is to find ways to get past the personal defensive psychological barriers that have been erected to even listening to another opinion that contradicts their own .
This has been the primary problem that we have faced in raising an effective resistance .
We have not really had a chance to convince an open - minded audience that they believed in multiple lies .
How do you persuade people that their own belief system is based on pure deception ?
How do you open people�s eyes and ears without first crossing pre-set boundaries of biases and preconceptions , inadvertently increasing their resistance to the truth ?
The United States of America is a nation that has been heavily indoctrinated for over sixty years with false ideas about American benevolence in the world .
To convince an " average Joe " that this , the core of all his other beliefs , is false , is a monumental task in itself .
Yet , this is the central problem we face today , beyond the electronic / propaganda fence that has been erected to contain us .
If we could break through this one barrier , then there might not be a need for street confrontations .
All else might just fall in place .
Resistance begins and ends within the mind .
The police state knows this .
When they say euphemistically , that it is a war for " hearts and minds , " this is what they mean �a battle to kill - off ideas of resistance .
The Master State is attempting to preempt future resistance by anticipating who will be in the resistance , so that their rebellious minds might be swept clean of such unacceptable thinking , before trouble comes from it .
Resistance to the idea of the all - powerful state is all that prevents the rising - up of the global dictatorship .
Many plans are afoot now to bring this new order about .
Full implementation of the plan will bring - about a massive planetary kill - off , where multiple animal and plant species will disappear , along with a billion or more human beings .
Silence in the face of such inhuman plans is a deadly surrender of apocalyptic proportions .

There are 500 galaxes in our universe .
There are one trillion universes .

We do n't yet know if such things as string landscapes exist .
Is there some way that this work will provide new testable predictions ?

Saswat Sarangi owes his career in physics to a twist of fate .
When he was a 13 year - old schoolboy in Orissa in eastern India , his uncle bought him a copy of Stephen Hawking ’sas a birthday present .
Unfortunately , the young Sarangi would have preferred a cricket bat , and the book remained unread for two years , until he found himself struggling to prepare for a physics test on electrons and their antiparticle counterparts , positrons .
His textbook was no help , so he started flipping through Hawking ’s book .
" I ’m sure I did n’t understand much , but the words were fascinating .
That ’s when I wanted to do physics , " says Sarangi , now a post- doc at Columbia University in New York .
Certainly , the workings of antiparticles no longer flummox him .
Quite the opposite , in fact , as Sarangi believes that " " and their interplay with regular universes could help tackle one of the prickliest problems in physics : why our universe is the way it is .
It ’s fashionable these days to talk of the multiverse , the near infinity of universes of which ours is just one .
For some , the multiverse is a godsend because it provides an explanation , of sorts , for why our universe has its peculiar properties .
Why is the energy density of the vacuum of space — the so - called cosmological constant — the size that it is ?
Why is the proton 1,836 times heavier than the electron ?
We do n’t have a physical theory that explains these particular values ; but in the context of a multiverse , we do n’t need one .
It is likely that our universe has the special properties it does — giving rise to galaxies , stars , planets , and humans — by accident .
Other universes could exist with different properties , but we would n’t have evolved in them and hence would n’t be around to argue about it .
This is theand it does n’t sit well with Sarangi .
" Some people have been trying to avoid this principle like a disease , " he says .
Sarangi finds the anthropic principle difficult to stomach because , in essence , it argues that there are some things about our universe that we cannot determine from first principles .
It ’s like admitting defeat , and Sarangi does n’t want to give in just yet . " ( Sarangi ) treats the anthropic principle as an admission of our ignorance today about our universe , not as a final resolution to the issue , " explains Henry Tye , Sarangi ’s colleague and former Ph.D. advisor at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York .
" He is not afraid to ask provocative questions .
" Sarangi came to Cornell after studying physics at the Indian Institute of Technology in West Bengal , just as another pair of physicists was stirring up string theory .
Joseph Polchinski and Raphael Bousso had discovered that string theory does n’t provide a unique " theory of everything " that can explain the properties of our universe , as hoped .
Instead , string - theory equations offer at least 10 solutions .
Each solution points to a different universe with different values for fundamental constants and even different laws of physics .
And nothing in string theory seems to favor one solution over another .
All are equally likely .
Leonard Susskind of Stanford University coined the phrase " Landscape of String Theory " to describe this theoretical wealth of possible universes .
" Everyone became excited about the landscape , " says Sarangi .
" People were fighting about whether it was there or not .
" For Sarangi , the important question is : Could a universe that starts off in some random place in the landscape , with random properties , somehow end up in a more stable region of the landscape , such as the one in which our universe resides ?
Our universe is obviously in some stable or pseudo - stable state because for the last 13 billion years , it has maintained the same basic parameters , such as the electron mass .
But , asks Sarangi , did our universe start off elsewhere in the landscape , with different properties and laws , but then finally end up where it did ?
The purpose behind this question is to show that — despite the landscape and the multiverse — string theory can still predict why we find ourselves in a universe like ours , without having to resort to the unsavory anthropic principle .
A universe could start off with random properties but end up looking like ours .
It helps to develop a mental picture of the landscape of string theory as a terrain of hills and valleys , where each valley represents a point of temporary stability .
( Because there are hundreds of different parameters in the theory that can change , the landscape is actually a hyper - dimensional terrain , with valleys representing the most energetically stable values for each parameter . )
"
The multiverse picture is simply that there are different universes separated from us in space and time , and these universes are sitting in different valleys , " says Sarangi .
A universe that arises randomly settles into the nearest valley .
But what are the odds that this universe could explore the landscape and find its way to a different stable region ?
The key to answering this is to look at conditions in the early universe , when the infant universe went through a period of exponential expansion , known as .
While string theory predicts that a landscape exists , inflation shows how such a landscape can be realized .
When and how inflation ends in a patch of spacetime dictates its properties and each patch is a universe in its own right .
This gives rise to the multiverse .
During the inflationary era , the universe is at its most dynamic ; if the universe is ever going to explore the multiverse , this is probably the time .
An inflating universe that sits in a valley will be separated by hills from other lower , more stable , valleys .
All it has to do to reach them is climb over that hill .
But how can it overcome this mountain ?
It ’s possible that the intrepid universe could use a quantum trick to get it to the other side of the hill .
In quantum systems , particles often " tunnel " through high - energy barriers that — according to classical physics — they should not be able to cross ( see diagram ) .
Could an inflating universe do the same ?
Sarangi thinks so .
Until now , it was thought that quantum tunneling during inflation was impossible since inflation lasts for a relatively short period and should be over long before the universe has had a chance to tunnel anywhere .
But last year , Sarangi and his colleagues found a special corner of the landscape where quantum tunneling happens so quickly that a universe has enough time to tunnel to another part of the landscape while it is still inflating .
Bizarrely , it helps if the hill is very large .
At first , as you increase the size of the hill , quantum tunneling is suppressed ; but then the rate of tunneling dramatically increases , says Sarangi .
" We were very excited by this .
This is the first example where you can get exponentially fast quantum tunneling , even though your hill has a large size .
" So what ’s behind this strange effect ?
Something similar is actually observed in the lab , when you fire an electron at an electromagnetic field that represents a " barrier . "
Initially the electron cannot get over this hill .
But as you increase the size of the barrier , things change .
At the top of the hill , there is enough energy for the vacuum to start spontaneously spawning pairs of electrons and positrons .
Usually , these electron - positron pairs immediately annihilate each other .
But occasionally , a positron will roll down the hill and annihilate the electron that ’s trying to cross the hill .
The positron ’s partner then rolls down the other side of the hill .
Effectively , an electron has tunneled through the extremely high barrier .
Something analogous but far more mind - boggling could be happening to a quantum universe in the multiverse .
Replace the electron with a universe , the positron with an anti-universe , and you get the picture .
Is n’t this a bit far - fetched ?
No , not at all , says string theorist Brian Greene of Columbia University , with whom Sarangi now works .
" It ’s a direct analogue of the case which is understood : the particle and anti-particle , " says Greene .
Sarangi and colleagues Gary Shiu of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and Benjamin Shlaer of the University of Colorado , Boulder , will be using their $ 50,000 grant from the Foundational Questions Institute to work out how likely it is for universes to explore the landscape via quantum tunneling .
Besides investigating cases where universe and anti-universe pairs help achieve tunneling ( known as ) they are also looking at , a phenomenon seen in the lab in which an electron can burrow through two adjacent hills that have identical properties .
It may be possible that universes can perform a similar feat .
And with the help of Greene ’s string - theory smarts , they plan to simulate tens of thousands of hills and valleys in the multi-dimensional landscape to see whether tunneling can actually take place .
Greene is confident that Sarangi has the chops to tackle this formidable problem .
" He ’s a very mild - mannered but vehement physicist , who really stays on an issue until he resolves it , " says Greene .
" It ’s a great combination .
" Of course , it ’s possible that the simulation will show that there simply is n’t enough quantum tunneling for a universe with random properties to make its way to our neck of the landscape .
But just maybe the team will find that there is enough exploration and that random universes should find themselves in stable corners , where they would take on properties like those of our universe .
" That would be very exciting , " says Sarangi .

Tehran , 4.30 local time , Enghelab Street
We gather up with my students on Saturdays for a private class .
We cook and eat together , then talk of philosophy .
This time there was no class .
We only tried to keep up our morale .
We were very determined but scared .
That is how I can describe the most people who came out to attend the demonstration today .
After the fierce speech at the Friday prayers , we knew that today we would be treated differently .
We felt so vulnerable , more than ever , but at the same time were aware of our power , which , no matter how influential it is collectively , would have done little to protect us today .
We could only take our bones and flesh to the streets and expose them to batons and bullets .
Two different feelings fight inside you without mixing with one another .
To live or to just be alive , that 's the question .
Then comes another student who would have her lunch with us , but is not coming to the demonstration .
She 's too scared and while pretending to be in control bursts into tears .
She says she hates to see people suffer .
We tell her we have suffered for years .
She says she does n't want people to die .
I tell her tens of thousands die each year on the roads in Iran , at least this time it would be for a good cause .
She says we are elites and can save ourselves for better times when we can be more useful .
We reply there is no difference between people in such a condition and one cannot be more useful than that .
But we have had enough of that .
We too have our own fears .
So we finish the lunch and sit to read poems of Mirzadeh Eshgi .
That 's what I suggest .
He was a revolutionary anarchist at the time of Constitutional Revolution 1906 - 11 , killed for his frankness of speech .
It fits our situation .
When I forwarded three poems of him , in red , to friends after Friday 's speech , many called to ask if I 'm taking care of myself .
Then I put a tag next to my name in Gmail : ' Do you scare us from chopped off heads ? '
Quotation from another poet whom I do n't know .
Poems play an important role here .
At first , I thought maybe it's too romantic to send poetry to others in such a situation , but then , said to myself , nothing influences Iranians like poetry .
And these days , everything is about influence and fear .
The poems we read are bitter , ironical and extremely laughable .
You write such poetry when sorrow is more than you can tolerate .
You burst into laughter .
Then we get going .
It 's a quarter to four .
But the following hour proves funnier than we expect .
In the bus , everybody goes to the same destination .
All streets to Enghlab are blocked .
Guards tell you where to go and where not to .
They show us a small street that leads to Enghlab .
I panic : why have they left it open ?
Do they want us to go in and surround us ?
Two demonstrations were held in Enghelab and Azadi in the past days , correspondingly meaning , revolution and freedom .
I tell my students , ' We 're recycling the names . '
Enghlab is busy , very busy , but no demonstration as such .
People show the V sign with their fingers but walk in silence .
In front of Tehran University , you see the students inside , clutching to the rails , as if behind bars .
They shout .
But you can't hear .
In front of the students on the sidewalk , on the other side of the bars , there are two rows of anti-riot police and a row of Basij militia holding posters insulting the demonstrators of the previous days .
One says , ' The trouble - makers pertain to MI6 ' .
An hour later , when the street is no longer so crowded , I go to the guy holding the poster and ask him , ' What is MI6 ? '
' Britain 's intelligent service ' , he replies .
' Is it different from Scotland Yard ? '
I ask .
' No , they 're the same thing . '
' Oh , I see . '
We have to keep the street crowded .
We walk up and down .
We 're a group of four .
We meet friends , but do n't join them .
We do n't want to change the mood by changing our companionship , we 're enjoying it .
Then comes the attraction of the day .
Two water - spraying machines .
They 're huge , the size of a bus but taller , with fenced windows and two water - guns on top of each .
We burst into laughter .
They do n't know how to use it .
They shoot second floor windows , anti-riot police and the people , if they do at all , and these including girls in tight manteaus .
It 's more Zurich than Tehran .
One machine is stuck .
They do n't know how to drive it .
It 's a hot day , the sun is intolerably shiny and it feels good to become wet .
Much of the time , the sprays are not very powerful .
It 's as if they 're watering the grass .
And it just does not fit the horror that it's in the air , the aggression with which the people are hit with batons .
A beautiful day .
It has been beautiful throughout the past week , you wonder whether nature is ironical .
They push the crowd back and forth , brush them from here to there but soon realize people are on all sides .
We hear bullets , but people do n't rush away .
They 're fake .
Nobody is shot .
Then in a couple of minutes , the crowd goes away , the anti-riot police leaves , and the students are gone .
We do n't understand why .
Deprived of communication , you never see the big picture .
Maybe they have attacked the university from behind .
We hear that there 's a huge crowd in Azadi Square .
We start to leave .
As we pass along the fences , a student , his face covered , smiles bitterly , ' They 'll storm the dormitory tonight . '
We have to keep on walking .
We have an aweful feeling .
There 's a demonstration somewhere which we could not attend .
That 's the only way to you better .
We wish we were in the middle of a crowd .
We have joked for hours now , but need to shout .
Something is pressing from within .
Then at Towhid Square the scene changes drastically .
The streets to Azadi are blocked .
But this time , people do n't change their path .
They fight for it .
There 's a shower of stones .
Tear gas .
Fire .
There is traffic jam and people are in the sidewalks .
The battle scene is huge .
We can not see the limits but it extends to nearby streets .
My student is keener to go forward than I am .
Her mother succeeded in persuading her to stay home for two days , but now has finally agreed to let her go out on the most dangerous day .
People are shouting , ' Down with the dictator ' .
Anti-riot police too throws back stones .
People do n't run away anymore .
I also grab a broken brick and throw .
I 'm amazed .
Never thought I 'd do it .
But I need practice : it was a very bad shot .
I grab another one , the size of a pomegranate and keep it with me , hiding it behind my back .
My feeling is a mixture of a university teacher and a hooligan .
If we want to go forward we need to pass through tear gas .
So we ask a car to give us a lift .
Then there is the attack .
They cannot tell enemy from people although they want to show everything is fine and they 're only chasing trouble - makers .
Out there is a woman who is beaten .
She 's horrified and hysteric but not as much as the anti-riot police officer facing him .
She shrieks , ' Where can I go ?
You tell me go down the street and you beat me .
Then you come up from the other side and beat me again .
Where can I go ? '
In sheer destitution , the officer hits his hamlet hard several times with his baton .
' Damn me !
Damn me !
What the hell do I know ! '
I ask myself , 'how much longer can these officers tolerate stress ?
How many among them would be willing to give their lives for somebody like Ahmadinejhad ? '
The driver tells us that he has not voted but comes out to the streets these days to beat up the Basijis .
At each crossing he is guided by officers to a direction different from what he wants and after a while we realize we are back to the first point .
We see officers mount people in a van used for carrying frozen meat .
Then a couple of minutes later , a new scene unfolds .
We get off .
Here 's a true battle ground .
And this time , it is vast .
Columns of smoke touch the sky .
You can hardly see the asphalt .
It 's covered with bricks and stones .
Here people have got the upper hand .
The street consists of three lanes , the middle one separated by opaque fences , under construction for metro .
The workers have climbed up the fence and show the V sign .
They start throwing stone and timber to the street to supply needed armament .
I tell myself , ' Look at the poor , the ones Ahmadinejhad always speaks of . '
But the president 's name is no longer in fashion .
This time the slogans target the leader , something unheard of in the past three decades .
It 's a beautiful sunset , with rays of light penetrating evening clouds .
We feel safe among people moving back and forth inline with the anti-riot police attacks .
Two Basijis ' motors are burning .
People have learnt how to do it fast .
They lie the motor on on its side , make a small fire , then spray it to a point where it becomes inextinguishable .
We climb up a pedestrian bridge and watch .
People shout from the bridge , ' Down with Khamenei ' and you think the aura is gone for good .
A Basiji is caught : he soon disappears under the crowd beating him .
As if in a roman coliseum , those on the bridge shout , ' Beat him up ! '
I shout with them before coming to my senses .
What is with me ?
He staggers away as a group of ten , kick and punch him all over .
At Gisha , there 's a similar scene .
Again the people have the whole crossing in their control and you can hear the uproar and horns .
Motors are burning in smoke .
But I 'm suddenly stunned .
I see a red object , which later proves to be a man , aged around 50 , his head covered with blood , crouching , people passing him by as if he was a garbage can .
Then comes a guy with a long stick who wants to bit up the already beaten Basiji .
People gather up and stop him .
He 's furious , ' Why should I not ?
They beat tiny girls !
They beat everyone !
Bastard !'
I shout at him , ' But we 're not beasts !
Not like them !'
Somebody takes the Basiji away as people curse him .
I think , ' But the bastard deserves it .
Imagine coming out of your house in the morning , just to beat up people you do n't even know . '
I do n't recognize myself and my feelings anymore .
You can get on any car to go back home .
People trust one another now .
The woman in the back seat sitting next to me says , ' It 's no longer about Mousavi or election results .
We have suffered for thirty years .
We did n't live a life . '
An old man next to her offers me fresh bread .
They tell jokes about the political figures and laugh out loud .
They feel victorious .
' I had waited thirty years for this .
Now I feel relieved . '
She writes down my phone number to send me original news .
' Send it to The Guardian ! ' , she says .
I will .
I promise .
Ed Colligan , who stepped down from Palm 's top position in June , has recounted some questionable business proposals on the part of Apple chief Steve Jobs .
Ed Colligan , who stepped down from Palm 's top position in June , has recounted some questionable business proposals on the part of Apple head , Steve Jobs .
According to Colligan , Jobs approached the former Palm CEO back in August 2007 - - shortly after the launch of the first iPhone -- asking him to enter into a deal wherein neither company would hire the other 's employees .
" We must do whatever we can to stop this , " Jobs reportedly told Colligan .
The proposal came on the heals of Palm 's hiring of former Apple exec , Jon Rubinstein .
" Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other 's employees , regardless of the individual 's desires , is not only wrong , it is likely illegal , " Colligan reportedly responded to Jobs .
Such communications may likely pique the interest of government officials charged with enforcing anti-trust laws , given the current investigation of the connection between Google and Apple .

It was an amazing feat of derring - do and would have been the ultimate break - out from the maximum security Colditz prison in the second world war .
The construction of the Colditz Cock , a glider with a 32 - ft wingspan in which prisoners of war dreamed of drifting out of their jail and off to freedom , defied belief .
More than 50 years ago , PoWs built a secret workshop in the attic of the 11th - century Saxony castle used by the Nazis to imprison what they considered to be the " bad boys " of the allied prisoners .
Every day for eight months , a team of builders worked quietly on the plane for short spells in order not to be caught by their guards .
The Boys Own bravado saw the daring plans for the plane being drafted on a small sheet of paper and led to its construction from the most unlikely of materials .
The prisoners pulled up floorboards , slipped out bed slats and made control wires from electrical wire found in unused areas of the prison .
Tools to build the Cock were fashioned from the handles of bed boards , the frames and iron bars from windows , blades were made from gramophone springs and needles were used to drill holes .
The skin of the aircraft was sewn together from the officers ' sleeping bags .
And a concrete - filled bathtub plunging five storeys and then crashing into the floor was to have provided a catapult needed for the launch .
The plane was completed but the escape officer decided lift - off should be delayed in case the SS ordered the massacre of the remaining prisoners in the castle .
The glider 's existence was only revealed after the allied victory in 1945 when the camp was peacefully turned over by its kommandant .
While they embraced their freedom , the prisoners wished that they had been able to see their dream glider in flight .
Yesterday , that flying dream was thwarted again .
Plans to fly a copy of the Colditz Cock were confounded , not by Nazis or cautious escape officers , but by the boring old weather .
The tools and the materials used to build the replica glider were not the same , but builders followed the original plans drawn up by a navy lieutenant , Tony Rolt .
Yesterday 's flight , to have been watched by the plane 's designer and some of its builders , was postponed because of winds of up to 30 knots .
The veterans had gathered at RAF Odiham in Hampshire to see if their brainchild could ever have flown , as part of the Channel 4 series Escape from Colditz .
One of those present was Bill Goldfinch whose idea it was to try to fly out of Colditz .
Mr Goldfinch , who now lives in Salisbury , Wiltshire , and was imprisoned for two and a half years , said : " It is a huge disappointment not to see the plane airborne after all these years , but we have been promised we will get another chance .
" Although it is a magnificent effort by those who built this plane , what cannot be recreated are the conditions in which we built the original and the need we had to finish it .
My one regret is that the original never flew .
If we had been in Colditz a bit longer then maybe she would 've got up . "
The new glider was built by Southdown Aero Services based in nearby Lasham , after being commissioned by the makers of the three part documentary which begins tonight .
Neil Fripp , who helped build the new plane , said : " It is very frustrating but the high wind will just not let us do it .
It could flip over on take - off and we do not want to take the risk . "
Flight Lieutenant Jack Best , 87 , who helped build the original glider , said : " I was perfectly certain that it would fly , and the meticulous job they have done in reconstructing it from the original plans is very impressive .
Obviously they had tools that we could only dream about at the time , and the standard of materials is far higher because we had to use what was available . "
Officer Skelley Ginn said : " We smuggled all kinds of bits and pieces to and from the workshop .
We used metal hinges and replaced them with bits of webbing .
We used lots of people to do different things so we would n't get caught . "
Between 1941 and 1945 , 1,500 allied prisoners were held in 700 rooms at Colditz , 176 attempted to escape and 31 succeeded .
Colditz castle has been immortalised as a sinister , impenetrable fortress where the " bad boys " of the British officer class plotted their escapes and carried out their extraordinary feats .
One of the highest - profile members of the British National party has been banned from sitting on his local council for a month and censured by the Greater London authority after giving false details about murders on a video blog .
Richard Barnbrook , who holds a seat on Barking and Dagenham council and is the BNP 's only London assembly member , brought his position , the GLA and his council into disrepute , a disciplinary hearing found yesterday .
Barnbrook was suspended from the council for a month and must apologise , but the GLA stopped short of a ban , instead warning him about his behaviour and demanding a written apology .
The complaint against Barnbrook was first lodged last September after he claimed in an interview , posted on YouTube and his own website , that a girl had been murdered in the borough within the past three weeks .
" We do n't know who 's done it .
Her girlfriend was attacked inside an educational institute , " Barnbrook said in the prerecorded interview , in which he sought to highlight failings in tackling knife crime .
He also said that , two weeks previously , " there was another attack by knives on the streets of Barking and Dagenham where two people were murdered " .
The Metropolitan police confirmed that there had been no murders or incidents resulting in critical injuries requiring intensive care in the period cited by Barnbrook , and said murders in the area were actually decreasing .
Valerie Rush , a Barking and Dagenham Labour cabinet member , accused Barnbrook of " openly and outrageously " lying to " whip up fears in the London community " .
" I firmly believe that he outrageously and knowingly lied on the video , " she told the hearing .
" I believe that he did that with the firm intention of whipping up fear on the streets of Barking and Dagenham and across London .
" We went , as a capital city , through about a year to 18 months of horrendous stories of young people losing their lives on the streets of London through knives , and I think councillor Barnbrook was trying , through his video , to whip up even more fear in the community . "
After the hearing , Barnbrook described the process as a waste of taxpayers ' money .
He said he would appeal against the findings , adding : " In that room there are quite a few academic , brilliant brains , I 'm sure , but I think it was a total waste of taxpayers ' money and resources to have this kangaroo court set up against me . "
He said he had made " unintentional inaccuracies " because he was dyslexic and was confused by loud background noise as the film was made .
The first murder took place in another area , he said , and the other two " killings " were attempted murders .
Barnbrook apologised for using incorrect information and said he would continue to highlight the issue of knife crime .
In a rare example of testicular fortitude , Barney Frank has " banished " Goldman 's Michael Pease from communicating with the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee .
According to Reuters , the Goldmanite , and former committee staffer , has been " asked " not to interfere with the Congressional panel for a period of 12 months .
According to Barney Frank aide Steven Adamske :
" Mr. Paese left our offices in September 2008 , and was not allowed to communicate with any committee members or staff for a period of one year due to normal ethics restrictions that apply to all House and Senate employees .
Out of an abundance of caution due to the nature of financial regulation reform , the chairman has extended Mr. Paese 's recusal for another year . "
For those curious just what the background of this one particular tentacle of Goldman 's nefarious plan for global domination is , Mr. Pease " was the committee 's deputy staff director before he quit to work for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association as a lobbyist .
Goldman hired him in April . "
And just in case there is any confusion where Washington 's allegiances usually lie , the Center for Responsive Politics disclosed that " since 1989 , [ Goldman 's ] employees , their family members and political action committees have donated $ 31.2 million to U.S. political candidates -- topping all other banks and financial firms . "
While one applauds Mr. Frank 's effort to at least provide the perception that Goldman is not manipulating the ongoing financial regulation reform effort , his anti-Wall Street ego would be better placated if Mr. Frank , as previously announced , focuses his efforts on Fed transparency initiatives .
Unfortunately , any actions that do not comport with his disclosed goal of ending the Fed 's covert ops , will be mostly perceived as hypocritical pandering to those that Barney is seemingly starting to finally oppose .

The two San Jose brothers who survived a Christmas Day 2007 tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo were arrested in San Mateo for misdemeanor violations after a traffic stop , the latest in a series of run-ins with the law , authorities said .
The brothers recently split what remained of a $ 900,000 settlement the zoo paid them in connection with the attack .
Their arrests come two weeks after the older sibling , Kulbir Dhaliwal , 25 , was booked on suspicion of felony cocaine possession after being stopped near San Jose State University .
The latest incident happened at 1:20 a.m. Wednesday when San Mateo police Officer Joseph Cassin stopped Dhaliwal for driving on a shoulder on - ramp to Highway 101 near Peninsula Avenue , said Steve Wagstaffe , San Mateo County 's chief deputy district attorney .
Dhaliwal 's passenger was his brother , Amritpal " Paul " Dhaliwal , 21 .
The officer smelled the odor of marijuana in the car and saw an open bottle of Grey Goose vodka inside , Wagstaffe said .
It was the same brand of vodka that San Francisco police found in Kulbir Dhaliwal 's car after the tiger attack , authorities said .
Kulbir Dhaliwal failed a series of field - sobriety tests and had a blood - alcohol level of 0.10 percent , authorities said .
The level that constitutes drunken driving is 0.08 percent .
When the officer asked Amritpal Dhaliwal for his identification , he lied and said he was Tarlok Dhaliwal , his 26 - year - old brother who had also been arrested in the incident near San Jose State , authorities said .
Kulbir Dhaliwal , meanwhile , " joined in the lie " and also said his passenger was Tarlok Dhaliwal , Wagstaffe said .
Cassin and Sgt. Dave Norris eventually obtained the proper identification and learned that Amritpal Dhaliwal was on parole and was trying to hide his identity , Wagstaffe said .
On Thursday , Amritpal Dhaliwal pleaded no contest to providing false identification , a misdemeanor , and was sentenced to 10 days in jail .
His sentence will run concurrently with any sentence he will receive for a parole violation .
Kulbir Dhaliwal was charged with misdemeanor drunken driving and released on his own recognizance .
On July 22 , Kulbir Dhaliwal was arrested on suspicion of possessing about 3 grams of cocaine after a car he was riding in was pulled over while heading the wrong way on a street next to the San Jose State campus , police said .
Kulbir Dhaliwal had to be held down for authorities to take a blood sample .
During the same car stop , his brother , Tarlok Dhaliwal , was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence .
At the time of the tiger attack , both Kulbir and Amritpal Dhaliwal were facing charges of public intoxication and resisting arrest stemming from a Sept. 7 , 2007 , scuffle with San Jose police , during which Kulbir Dhaliwal had to be put in restraints .
They were later convicted .
Amritpal Dhaliwal also has a series of other criminal convictions , including one for leading police on a 140 - mph chase through San Jose in April 2007 .
When writing web applications , or any application for that manner , any passwords should be stored securely .
As a rule of thumb , one should never store passwords as clear text in the database for the following reasons :
If the database ever gets leaked out , then all accounts are compromised until every single user resets his password .
Imagine that you ’re an MMORPG developer ; leaking out the database with clear text passwords allows the attacker to delete every player ’s characters .
Many people use the same password for multiple sites .
Imagine that the password stored in your database is also used for the user ’s online banking account .
Even if the database does not get leaked out , the password is still visible to the system administrator ; this can be a privacy breach .
There are several “ obvious ” alternatives , which are n’t quite secure enough :
Storing passwords as MD5 / SHA1 / $ FAVORITE_ALGORITHM
hashes
These days MD5 can be brute - force cracked with relatively little effort .
SHA1 , SHA2 and other algorithms are harder to brute - force , but the attacker can still crack these hashes by using rainbow tables : precomputed tables of hashes with which the attacker can look up the input for a hash with relative ease .
This rainbow table does not have to be very large : it just has to contain words from the dictionary , because many people use dictionary words as passwords .
Using plain hashes also makes it possible for an attacker to determine whether two users have the same password .
Encrypting the password
This is not a good idea because if the attacker was able to steal the database , then there ’s a possibility that he ’s able to steal the key file as well .
Plus , the system administrator is able to read everybody ’s passwords , unless he ’s restricted access to either the key file or the database .
The solution is to store passwords as salted hashes .
One calculates a salted hash as follows :
salted_hash = hashing_algorithm ( salt + cleartext_password )
Here , salt is a random string .
After calculating the salted hash , one should store the salted hash in the database , along with the ( cleartext ) salt .
It is not necessary to keep the salt secret or to obfuscate it .
When a user logs in , one can verify his password by re-computing the salted hash and comparing it with the salted hash in the database :
salted_hash = hashing_algorithm( salt_from_database + user_provided_password ) if ( salted_hash == salted_hash_from_database ) : user is logged in else : password incorrect
The usage of the salt forces the attacker to either brute - force the hash or to use a ridiculously large rainbow table .
In case of the latter , the sheer size of the required rainbow table can make it unpractical to generate .
The larger the salt , the more difficult it becomes for the cracker to use rainbow tables .
However , even with salting , one should still not use SHA1 , SHA2 , Whirlpool or most other hashing algorithms because these algorithms are designed to be fast .
Although brute forcing SHA2 and Whirlpool is hard , it ’s still possible given sufficient resources .
Instead , one should pick a hashing algorithm that ’s designed to be slow so that brute forcing becomes unfeasible .
Bcrypt is such a slow hashing algorithm .
A speed comparison on a MacBook Pro with 2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo :
SHA - 1 : 118600 hashes per second .
Bcrypt ( with cost = 10 ) : 7.7 hashes per second .
Theoretically it would take 4*10^35 years for a single MacBook Pro core to crack an SHA - 1 hash , assuming that the attacker does not harness any weaknesses in SHA - 1 .
To crack a bcrypt hash one would need 6*10^39 years , or 10000 more times .
Therefore , we recommend the use of bcrypt to store passwords securely .
There ’s even a nice Ruby implementation of this algorithm : bcrypt-ruby !
Up until recently , bcrypt-ruby was only available for MRI ( “ Matz Ruby Interpreter ” , the C implementation that most people use ) .
However , we ’ve made it compatible with JRuby !
The code can be found in our fork at Github .
The current version also has issues with Ruby 1.9 , which we ’ve fixed as well .
The author of bcrypt-ruby has already accepted our changes and will soon release a new version with JRuby and Ruby 1.9 support .

Michael Shields , the Liverpool football fan pardoned and released from prison today , has spoken of the " living hell " of his four years in custody .
In a statement read out on his behalf by James Jones , the Bishop of Liverpool , he said the last four years " have been the hardest four years of my life … they have been a living hell " .
Shields , who was convicted of attempted murder in Bulgaria in 2005 , has always maintained his innocence .
He walked free from prison today after being pardoned by the justice secretary , Jack Straw .
Flanked by his lawyers , politicians and the bishop , and wearing a Liverpool FC T - shirt , Shields looked on as Jones read the statement to the press .
In it , Shields told of the " battle " he now faces to " build an ordinary life " .
" I was just 18 when I was arrested .
I 'm now 22 and face having to rebuild my life which was shattered by the failure of two legal systems , one here in the UK and one in Bulgaria , " the statement said .
" Today is a happy day for me , but one of mixed emotions too .
I am a free man , yes , but it should not have come to this .
" I now face a hard battle to adjust to normality , to find a job , to resume friendships .
To build an ordinary life . "
Shields said he felt sympathy for Martin Georgiev , the man attacked in Bulgaria .
He said that , like him , Georgiev had been " denied justice " .
" I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Martin Georgiev , who was the innocent victim of an unprovoked attack , " he said .
" He and his family , like me and mine , have been denied justice for four long years . "
He said his priority was " to spend time with my loved ones , to slowly begin to plan for a future as an innocent man " .
Shields spoke only once during the press conference , when he briefly thanked his supporters .
" I would like to say a massive thank you to all those people out there – including Liverpool and Everton football fans – who have supported me and my family over the last four years by writing letters , by protesting , by marching , " he said .
" Your voices were heard .
Thanks to you , I knew I would never walk alone .
Thank you . "
Shields – said to be " ecstatic " when told of his impending release – smiled and gave a thumbs up to journalists as he was collected by his parents , Marie and Michael , from the Thorn Cross young offenders ' institution in Warrington , Cheshire , earlier today .
His release came after Straw said he had concluded " that Michael Shields is telling the truth when he says he is innocent " and had " recommended to her majesty the Queen that he should be granted a free pardon " .
Shields was jailed for 15 years after being found guilty of attacking Georgiev on 30 May 2005 .
The 22 - year - old had been in Bulgaria as he travelled home from Istanbul , where he had watched Liverpool win the 2005 Champions League .
In 2006 he was allowed to return to Britain to serve the remainder of his sentence , which was cut to 10 years on appeal .
In a statement , Straw said " important new evidence came to light " when he met Shields ' parents at Blackburn town hall on 28 August .
" At this meeting , following a series of questions which I put to the family , I was told for the first time about a visit by two members of the Shields family to the home of a man alleged to be responsible for the crime for which Michael Shields was jailed , " the statement said .
" I was told that , in the course of the visit , that man made an oral confession to the crime in front of several other people .
" This episode , I was told , happened on 22 July 2005 , a day after the start of Mr Shields ' trial in Bulgaria . "
Straw said further inquiries had been made since the August meeting , including by Merseyside police .
They led to more information being uncovered .
" I will not set out in this statement all the evidence that has come to light over the last two weeks , but suffice it to say that there is very good reason to believe I was being told the truth , " Straw said .
" This , in my view , profoundly changed the credibility of the various accounts of what actually happened in this case . "
Shields insisted he had been asleep in his hotel room at the time of the attack .
His solicitor , John Wheate , said : " His parents spoke to Jack Straw earlier this morning , and I have spoken to Michael myself .
" At first he could n't believe it after all these years and knockbacks .
But now he is absolutely ecstatic , and so are his family . "
Louise Ellman , the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside , who has been campaigning for Shields ' release since his conviction , said it was " a day for celebration " .
" I am overjoyed at Jack Straw 's decision , " she said .
" Michael has suffered a gross miscarriage of justice , incarcerated for four years for a crime he did not commit and to which another man has confessed . "
In December 2008 two high court judges ruled that it was within the justice secretary 's power to pardon Michael Shields – but Straw refused to do so in July .
Today Straw said the oral confession had not been contained in the initial bid to pardon Shields , and that the importance of certain information " had not been fully appreciated " .
" No reference to the events which took place on 22 July 2005 was contained in any of the formal written representations I received either before or after I made my provisional decision on 2 July , " the said .
" Mr Shields ' current solicitors have told us that they did not know about them , and their potential significance had not been fully appreciated by those who had been made aware of them . "
The apparent confession of another man in July 2005 was widely reported at the time , but the confession was ruled inadmissible at the trial in Bulgaria and was later retracted .

LAS VEGAS –
It 's one of the most hostile hacker environments in the country –- the DefCon hacker conference held every summer in Las Vegas .
But despite the fact that attendees know they should take precautions to protect their data , federal agents at the conference got a scare on Friday when they were told they might have been caught in the sights of an RFID reader .
The reader , connected to a web camera , sniffed data from RFID - enabled ID cards and other documents carried by attendees in pockets and backpacks as they passed a table where the equipment was stationed in full view .
It was part of a security - awareness project set up by a group of security researchers and consultants to highlight privacy issues around RFID .
When the reader caught an RFID chip in its sights – embedded in a company or government agency access card , for example – it grabbed data from the card , and the camera snapped the card holder 's picture .
But the device , which had a read range of 2 to 3 feet , caught only five people carrying RFID cards before Feds attending the conference got wind of the project and were concerned they might have been scanned .
Kevin Manson , a former senior instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Florida , was sitting on the " Meet the Fed " panel when a DefCon staffer known as " Priest , " who prefers not to be identified by his real name , entered the room and told panelists about the reader .
" I saw a few jaws drop when he said that , " Manson told Threat Level .
" There was a lot of surprise , " Priest says .
" It really was a ' holy shit , ' we did n't think about that [ moment ] . "
Law enforcement and intelligence agents attend DefCon each year to garner intelligence about the latest cyber vulnerabilities and the hackers who exploit them .
Some attend under their real name and affiliation , but many attend undercover .
Although corporate - and government - issued ID cards embedded with RFID chips do n't reveal a card holder 's name or company – the chip stores only a site number and unique ID number tied to a company or agency 's database where the card holder 's details are stored – it's not impossible to deduce the company or agency from the site number .
It 's possible the researchers might also have been able to identify a Fed through the photo snapped with the captured card data or through information stored on other RFID - embedded documents in his wallet .
For example , badges issued to attendees at the Black Hat conference that preceded DefCon in Las Vegas were embedded with RFID chips that contained the attendee 's name and affiliation .
Many of the same people attended both conferences , and some still had their Black Hat cards with them at DefCon .
But an attacker would n't need the name of a card holder to cause harm .
In the case of employee access cards , a chip that contained only the employee 's card number could still be cloned to allow someone to impersonate the employee and gain access to his company or government office without knowing the employee 's name .
Since employee access card numbers are generally sequential , Priest says an attacker could simply change a few digits on his cloned card to find the number of a random employee who might have higher access privileges in a facility .
" I can also make an educated guess as to what the administrator or ' root ' cards are , " Priest says .
" Usually the first card assigned out is the test card ; the test card usually has access to all the doors .
That 's a big threat , and that 's something [ that government agencies ] have actually got to address . " "
In some organizations , RFID cards are n't just for entering doors ; they 're also used to access computers .
And in the case of RFID - enabled credit cards , RFID researcher Chris Paget , who gave a talk at DefCon , says the chips contain all the information someone needs to clone the card and make fraudulent charges on it – the account number , expiration date , CVV2 security code and , in the case of some older cards , the card holder 's name .
The Meet - the - Fed panel , an annual event at DefCon , presented a target - rich environment for anyone who might have wanted to scan government RFID documents for nefarious purposes .
The 22 panelists included top cybercops and officials from the FBI , Secret Service , National Security Agency , Department of Homeland Security , Defense Department , Treasury Department and U. S. Postal Inspection .
And these were just the Feds who were n't undercover .
It 's not known if any Feds were caught by the reader .
The group that set it up never looked closely at the captured data before it was destroyed .
Priest told Threat Level that one person caught by the camera resembled a Fed he knew , but he could n't positively identify him .
" But it was enough for me to be concerned , " he said .
" There were people here who were not supposed to be identified for what they were doing ... I was [ concerned ] that people who did n't want to be photographed were photographed . "
Priest asked Adam Laurie , one of the researchers behind the project , to " please do the right thing , " and Laurie removed the SD card that stored the data and smashed it .
Laurie , who is known as " Major Malfunction " in the hacker community , then briefed some of the Feds on the capabilities of the RFID reader and what it collected .
The RFID project was a collaboration between Laurie and Zac Franken – co-directors of Aperture Labs in Great Britain and the ones who wrote the software for capturing the RFID data and supplied the hardware – and Aries Security , which conducts security - risk assessments and runs DefCon 's annual Wall of Sheep project with other volunteers .
Each year the Wall of Sheep volunteers sniff DefCon 's wireless network for unencrypted passwords and other data attendees send in the clear and project the IP addresses , login names and truncated versions of the passwords onto a conference wall to raise awareness about information security .
This year they planned to add data collected from the RFID reader and camera ( below ) – to raise awareness about a privacy threat that 's becoming increasingly prevalent as RFID chips are embedded into credit cards , employee access cards , state driver 's licenses , passports and other documents .
Brian Markus , CEO of Aries Security who is known in the hacker community as " Riverside , " said they planned to blur the camera images and superimpose a sheep 's head over faces to protect identities before putting them on the wall .
" We 're not here to gather the data and do bad things with it , " he said , noting that theirs likely was n't the only reader collecting data from chips .
" There are people walking around the entire conference , all over the place , with RFID readers [ in backpacks ] , " he says .
" For $ 30 to $ 50 , the common , average person can put [ a portable RFID - reading kit ] together ....
This is why we 're so adamant about making people aware this is very dangerous .
If you do n't protect yourself , you 're potentially exposing your entire [ company or agency ] to all sorts of risk . "
In this sense , any place can become a hostile hacker environment like DefCon , since an attacker with a portable reader in a backpack can scan cards at hotels , malls , restaurants and subways , too .
A more targeted attack could involve someone simply positioned outside a specific company or federal facility , scanning employees as they entered and left and cloning the cards .
Or someone could even wire a coil around a door frame to collect data as people pass through the door , which Paget demonstrated at DefCon .
" It takes a few milliseconds to read [ a chip ] and , depending on what equipment I 've got , doing the cloning can take a minute , " says Laurie .
" I could literally do it on the fly . "
Paget announced during his DefCon talk that his security consulting company , H4rdw4re , will be releasing a $ 50 kit at the end of August that will make reading 125 - kHz RFID chips – the kind embedded in employee access cards – trivial .
It will include open source software for reading , storing and re-transmitting card data and will also include a software tool to decode the RFID encryption used in car keys for Toyota , BMW and Lexus models .
This would allow an attacker to scan an unsuspecting car - owner 's key , decrypt the data and open the car .
He told Threat Level they 're aiming to achieve a reading range of 12 to 18 inches with the kit .
" I often ask people if they have an RFID card and half the people emphatically say no I do not , " says Paget .
" And then they pull out the cards to prove it and ... there has been an RFID in their wallet .
This stuff is being deployed without people knowing it . "
To help prevent surreptitious readers from siphoning RFID data , a company named DIFRWear was doing brisk business at DefCon selling leather Faraday - shielded wallets and passport holders ( pictured above right ) lined with material that prevents readers from sniffing RFID chips in proximity cards .

Creating beautiful , unique websites seems to get harder every day .
There are so many amazing website designs out there that coming up with something fresh and different is getting close to impossible .
And even if you ’re not looking for something entirely unique , creating beautiful designs that do n’t look dated is a constant challenge .
Below are twenty excellent techniques and design elements you can incorporate into your designs to create a beautiful , polished website .
Combine them or pick and choose which ones you want to use for each project you do .
And we ’ve also included plenty of examples to give you real - world examples of how designers are using them to create gorgeous website designs .
1. Vivid Colors
Using bright colors in your website designs can add a lot of visual interest .
They ’re best for sites that want to appeal to younger demographics or for more casual sites .
Using colors either in the similar hues or saturation makes for a more cohesive appearance and keeps things from looking too busy .
Make sure when using vivid color schemes that you allow sufficient contrast between elements without using too much ( such as red text on a green background ) .
This is especially important with text , as improper contrast can make things very difficult , if not impossible , to read .
AdaptD.com
Using colors similar in saturation and intensity keeps a vivid color scheme looking cohesive .
Joshua Goodwin
Using shades of a single bright color can work well also .
Noe Design
Even limiting your vivid color usage to just your header and headings can still make a big impact .
Design Slurp
Adding lighting effects to a vivid color scheme can make it pop even more .
Tracy Apps Design
Mixing vivid colors with more muted ones really makes the vivid colors stand out .
2. Gradients and Lighting Effects .
Gradients and lighting effects can be used for dramatic or subtle effects , or anything in between .
Mixed or used separately , they can add a bit of extra polish to your designs .
A subtle tone - on - tone gradient can make a great background , while gradients mixed with lighting effects are often used to create awesome header images .
If you ’re mixing gradients with lighting effects ( particularly multiple effects ) , be careful that your design does n’t end up too busy .
Limit either the colors used , the intensity of the lighting effects , or the overall number of effects for the best results .
Charlie Gentle
Combining gradients and lighting effects can have a big impact , even when the overall colors are muted .
Fred Maya
There ’s a huge variety of possible lighting effects you can use , like this one that combines angled lighting with fairy - dust - like spots .
Leihu.com
Another combination of a subtle gradient with light artifacts .
The Open Video Alliance
A simple gradient over the background instantly ramps this design up to the next level .
Squarespace
Another site with a subtle lighting effect in the header .
3. Transparency .
Transparent boxes work especially well over interesting backgrounds that are n’t too busy .
Whether it ’s a photo , a sketch , or just geometric and graphic elements , transparent layers can give your background a larger part in your site ’s design .
Chris Arbini
Transparency over a patterned background works very well .
Design Attik
Transparent boxes over a photo background work even better .
Envato
Including a 1 pixel opaque border around your transparent boxes adds an extra level of polish .
Lilly ’s Table
Transparency can make your text pop more while still allowing your background to take center stage .
Quinta da Bela Vista
Using transparent boxes in a similar color to the background really makes them stand out .
4. Grunge .
Grunge is a pretty broad category when it comes to website design .
Adding in subtle grunge elements to otherwise clean and polished sites can contribute a bit of an edge to the overall design .
You can also combine multiple elements of grunge design to create a site that ’s clearly grungy .
Some of the more common elements of a grunge design are dirty textures ; messy borders ( often that look like paint brush strokes or decay ) ’ torn paper ; staples , paper clips and similar elements ; muted colors ; water or other liquid stains ; grungy fonts ; and other decayed and destructed elements .
Using any or all of these ( carefully ) can add a new layer to your design .
Glocal Ventures
Adding a grungy border to the main content area adds an extra layer of polish to the Glocal Ventures site .
squareFACTOR
Grunge elements like messy brushes and splatters can be easy to incorporate in otherwise clean sites , as is done in this header .
Rob Goodlatte
Messy edges and dirty - looking backgrounds are two hallmarks of grungy design .
Paravel Design
Even something as simple as adding heading backgrounds made with a watercolor brush can give a site a bit of a grunge edge .
Adding a subtle dirty background further reinforces that look while still maintaining a professional image .
Von Dutch
Going all out with grunge elements can make a big impact and works well for a site going for an edgy image .
5. Hand -Drawn Designs .
Hand - drawn and sketched elements can make your site look a bit more casual and even fun .
Whether you use complete sketches or just doodled elements , using hand - drawn elements makes your site look a bit more artistic and can sometimes add a whimsical element .
It also evokes childhood and cartoons in many circumstances or , less frequently , fine art .
A simple way to get started with hand - drawn elements are to use hand - drawn Photoshop brushes , fonts , and icons .
For the most part , there ’s a wide variety of each available for use for free .
Richard Stelmach
Adding a simple sketch to your home page can make a big impact .
Happy Dangy Diggy
Hand - drawn elements can give your site a fun , laid - back look .
Luova
Headers are a perfect place to put a sketch or painting while still maintaining a professional site .
Idiotic Adventures
Sketches mixed with fonts that look hand - drawn work especially well .
Sawyer Hollenshead
Another great example of sketched typefaces and hand - drawn images .
6. Muted Colors .
Muted colors are a great way to create a subtle , inviting site .
Mixing in muted colors with one or two brighter or darker accent colors can be put to good use to make certain elements of your site stand out .
Muted colors do n’t need to be limited to grays or browns .
You can use any hue in the spectrum , just toned down or with a grayish - tinge .
CSS Addict
Mixing muted colors with a brighter or darker color makes them stand out more .
Cuisine Saine
Muted does n’t have to mean just grays and tans .
Mixing in subdued greens , reds , and other colors adds more interest .
I - Avion
Even a bright color ( like the chartreuse in this design ) can take on a more muted tone when it ’s paired with subdued colors in similar hues .
Ian James Cox
Pairing soft tans and creams with black accents makes for a very professional - looking site .
Joe Nyaggah
Decreasing the saturation of bright colors gives them a muted quality and makes them look a bit retro at the same time .
7. Watercolor Effects .
Creating a site with watercolor elements has become easier with the wide availability of watercolor Photoshop brushes and textures .
Using watercolor effects in headers , backgrounds , and other elements is an important design trend .
The beauty of watercolor elements is that they can easily be made to stand out or stay in the background depending on the colors you use and how transparent you make them .
Either way works , and what you choose to do should depend on whether you want your site designs to have a bold or subdued appearance .
Ali Felski
Watercolor elements do n’t necessarily have to be light or pastel .
Boompa
Mixing watercolor painting with line drawings adds extra visual interest .
Matt Dempsey
More abstract watercolor brushes make for a more relaxed look .
One Starry Night
Using watercolor brushes over what looks like a watercolor paper background works great , especially when paired with a casual script font .
Sunrise Design
A watercolor scene makes a great header .
8. Nature - Inspired Elements .
Nature - inspired elements are most popular on environmental and green industry websites , but they ’re starting to pop up all over the web .
Some of the most prevalent places are in designer portfolios and personal blogs .
These elements can be used in a multitude of ways .
Some use them as part of a background design .
Others incorporate them into headers or icons .
Some use them all over the place , wherever they ’ll fit .
Finding creative ways to incorporate nature - inspired elements can be a fantastic and fun design challenge .
Story Pixel
Nature - inspired elements do n’t necessarily have to be photo - realistic .
Theater Website Services
Shiny , glossy nature elements work well in a header .
Weberica
The vines and bird add an organic feel to the header of this site , especially when paired with the watercolor elements .
84 Colors
While it ’s not visible in this image , the leaves and other nature - inspired elements on this background move slightly , as if they ’re swaying in the breeze .
Juan Diego Velasco
A simple lawn background mixed with other man-made elements gives it a bit of a natural feel without going overboard .
9. Photo -Realistic Backgrounds .
Photo - realistic backgrounds in this case are not just photo backgrounds .
Most of these are built either out of multiple photographs or have elements added to photos that appear real but are actually digital or computer - generated .
One of the most popular photo - realistic background techniques in the past year or two is the creation of desk - top or table - top backgrounds .
These generally consist of a wooden surface with various papers , coffee , cups , and other elements overlaid on them .
It ’s a tough technique to pull off ( making sure shadows and light sources are all consistent , etc. ) but makes for an awesome effect when done well .
Outline 2 Design
The mixture of a photo - realistic background with other photo - realistic elements ( such as the image under the " order now " link ) add up to a very polished looking site .
Ernest Hemingway Collection
Making a photo - realistic collage that looks like a desk - or table - top is a popular trend .
Design Top 10
Photo - realistic backgrounds do n’t need to be complicated to make an impression .
Marmalade on Toast
A photo-realistic background does n’t need to consist of multiple elements .
Design 54
A simple collage of realistic images along a common theme is also a popular technique .
10 . Oversized Typography .
Using oversized type can lend importance to certain text elements .
Some sites even opt to use oversized typography for all their text .
And you do n’t necessarily need to make type humongous for it to have an increased impact ; making it one or two sized larger than you normally would can work wonders for how much weight it has within the overall design .
Toggle
Oversized typography does n’t necessarily have to be huge , just larger that what you ’d normally expect .
Citizen Wausau
Sometimes slightly - oversized type can have a bigger impact that giant type .
Protagonize
Another great example of type that ’s just a bit bigger than what we ’ve come to expect .
It really makes the type itself stand out .
Matt Lawrence
Limiting oversized type to the header of your site makes a big impact .
This is Aaron ’s Life
Oversized type all around is also an option .
11 . Decorative Typography .
Decorative fonts can work wonders for website designs .
Using JavaScript and other text replacement tools that replace the text with an image in the desired font make creating these effects relatively simple , too .
In most cases , you ’ll want to limit the number of fonts you want to use , or risk making the site way too busy .
But if typography is the primary graphic element within the site , you can use more diverse typefaces as long as you keep color and / or proportion similar .
JP33
Limiting decorative typography to just the header of an otherwise - simple site can make it stand out more .
Lord Likely
Using a decorative fonton multiple elements throughout your site lends a sense of consistency .
Cogitatur
Mixing multiple decorative fonts on a site can make an even bigger impact on the design .
Just keep in mind that fonts should have similar elements , scales , or other design elements for the best results .
Simone Maranzana
Mixing a script font with a serif font gives a very elegant feel to any website .
Designr.it
Another great example of decorative fonts mixed with a traditional serif font .
12 . Bold Backgrounds .
Using big , bold background images in your designs is another popular trend .
There are a number of ways to do this , including creating resizing images .
By using more complex or simpler designs , limited or vibrant color schemes , and other , similar design choices , you can change the impact a big background will have .
Bada Bing Design
A bold background that uses a limited color scheme does n’t overwhelm the page ’s content .
Piz’za-za
A photographic background of your business can make a huge impact on an otherwise - simple site .
Youandigraphics.com
Big backgrounds do n’t necessarily have to be complicated .
The mixture of a repeating photo texture with colorful fractals makes a big statement without being complex .
Gummi Sig
Mixing elements in your background can also make a big impact , as is done here with the mixture of grunge , watercolor , photo - realistic elements , and lighting effects .
Safety Goat
Geometric backgrounds can make a huge impact , especially when mixed with grunge elements .
13 . Retro and Vintage Elements .
Including retro , vintage , and antique elements in your designs can add a layer of fun or nostalgia to your websites , depending on how you use them .
In some cases , they can even add an extra layer of charm or class .
Surprisingly , the inclusion of retro elements in your design can make your site look new and fresh .
Vintage designs have yet to really saturate the web , so people are n’t as used to seeing them online .
Whether you opt to go back to the seventies , forties , or even earlier , these kinds of elements can be fun to add .
Ctrl+N
A collage of vintage elements makes a big statement .
Klassiker in Acryl
A vintage background paired with a retro font and color scheme creates a 60s feeling .
Radio — The New York Moon
This site pairs vintage radio elements with a newspaper look to achieve a 40s feeling .
Rose Fu
The pairing of antique - looking sconces with fancy border elements lends a Victorian look to Rose Fu .
Duirwaigh Studios
The mixture of vintage and antique elements lends a circus or even Vaudeville feeling to this site .
14 . Eye - Catching Headers .
Headers often contain important information you want to stand out to your site ’s visitors .
They can reinforce your company ’s image , provide vital information , highlight important features , and more .
Using a header that ’s eye - catching , through the use of color , images , and typography , makes it more likely visitors will take the time to look at what ’s up there .
Buen Retiro Vergara
A bold header closely tied to the content of a site works well for any business website .
Deqq
A header image that pairs multiple elements ( lighting , photos , vivid colors ) makes a big statement .
Ma.tt
Combining tons of different elements into a header has a really powerful impact and works great for a personal blog or a more casual site .
Crush +
Lovely
Eye - catching headers do n’t necessarily have to be bright and shiny .
A more subdued header with good contrast to the rest of the site can be equally impressive .
Drew Wilson
A header with rainbow colors and some subtle hand - drawn elements really draws the eye to the logo and title of Drew Wilson ’s site .
15 . Collage Elements .
Collage elements are some of the most versatile design options out there .
Used sparingly with clean edges , they can make a site look more polished and finished .
With rough edges or used copiously , they can add a more artsy look to your site .
And when they ’re somewhere in between , they add a real flourish to website designs .
BLK + MTN
Collage elements with a more digital look work really well for a more professional site .
Kiss Me I ’m Polish
Collage elements used sparingly can add that little extra something to your site ’s design that really puts it at the next level .
M Katek
Torn paper elements really sit on the line between collage and grunge .
Web Designer Wall
A mixture of hand - drawn elements , paper scraps , and other paper - themed elements add up to a very interesting and unique collage design .
Toucouleur
Mixing faux - paper elements with digital collage elements makes this header even more interesting .
16 . Textured Backgrounds .
Using backgrounds with a bit of texture can add that extra bit of presence to your site .
A textured design , whether dirty and grungy or made to look like cloth or anything in between can really add some punch to the look of your site .
There are literally thousands of textured and patterned backgrounds out there you can adapt to the design needs of your sites , or create your own for something truly unique .
Designers Couch
A subtle tone - on - tone background adds the feel of a textured , cloth - like background .
Jason Julien
A subtle dirty texture in the background adds a grunge element to Jason Julien ’s site .
Leigh Taylor
A subtle texture repeated in both the header and the background lends a sense of continuity between elements .
Zone Art CSS
A mixture of textured elements in the background add more visual interest .
DGS Creative
A simple texture similar to concrete or stone adds nice contrast to an otherwise shiny and clean site design .
17 . Tabbed Navigation .
Tabbed navigation has a big advantage over button - or text - based navigation .
Tabs evoke notebooks or binders , and people have a psychological expectation that clicking on a tab will take them to a new page or section ( as a tab delineates a new section within a physical binder or notebook ) .
This psychological connection makes it more likely people will click around on your site and visit different sections .
Tabs can be as simple or complex as you want them to be .
Some have rounded corners , some are vertical , some are barely tabs at all and are set apart by little more than a vertical border between them .
In any case , tabs really are the best navigation method for major sections of your site and can really increase your page views per visitor .
Prime Cut Design
Simple tone - on - tone tabs work well when the active tab is somehow highlighted .
It ’s especially interesting here , as the inactive tabs are grungy while the active tab is clean and glossy .
Momentum
Repeating design elements between different parts of the site add to the overall design continuity .
The stitching element repeated here is subtle but really adds that extra level of polish .
Salvemos al Arbol
Tabs used to show logical steps make a lot of sense when it comes to usability .
Chris Jennings
Tabs do n’t have to be horizontal .
Abel and Cole
Simple , outlined tabs work well within a simple site design .
18 . Black and White .
Black and white color schemes can make a huge design statement .
Using stark black and white is the most graphic , but combining shades of white , light gray and cream with blacks , dark grays , and dark browns can all have a significant graphic impact .
Experiment with different levels of contrast to come up with the appropriate level for your specific design project .
Carsonified
The mixture of a very dark gray with cream give a slightly retro look here .
Minimal
Using a lot of white makes a site feel lighter - weight and more streamlined than a mostly black design .
J Bradford Dillon
The pairing of a subtle off - white with a dark brownish - gray makes for a very classic and traditional design .
John Likens
Stark white and black make a bold graphic impact .
Paiko
Shades of gray can make a site look more inviting than sites with more contrast .
19 . Horizontal Scrolling .
Horizontal scrolling sites can be difficult to pull off and are often best reserved for sites with limited content .
But when combined with modal boxes and other content elements , they can make a huge impact on your visitors .
It ’s still something people are n’t used to seeing online , and can really stick in the minds of your users .
Dean Oakley
Making it very obvious how to navigate on a scrolling site adds to its usability .
Nebon Media
Horizontal designs work especially well for portfolio sites .
Gavin Castleton
An interesting take on the horizontal site , this site starts near the center and scrolls to both the left and right .
Lucuma
This site uses a combination of horizontal scrolling and modal boxes to display content .
Hasrimy
A consistent background across multiple screens in a horizontal scrolling site lends a sense of consistency .
20 . Cartoon Elements .
Cartoon elements add a level of fun to your site that few other elements can .
Whether you keep them relatively professional and polished in a corporate site or let them get a little looser , cartoon characters and other design elements keep your site looking fresher and younger .
One particularly cool technique is to use charicatures of well - known figures ( Einstein , Buddha , etc. ) .
Creative Magasine
Cartoon elements do n’t ’ necessarily have to be caricatures .
Digimurai
Using a cartoon character as a mascot or logo works really well .
Mochi Media
Monochromatic cartoon elements are the most versatile .
Spoof University
Using a cartoon character that fits with the theme of your site ( such as the professor on Spoof University ’s site ) adds a more laid - back and even humorous element .
Francesco Mugnai
Cartoon caricatures of commonly - known figures are popular .

Alabama is the most conservative state in the nation , according to a Gallup Poll .
The poll says that 49 percent of Alabamians polled identified themselves as conservative .
Alabama was followed by Mississippi , where 48 percent identified themselves as conservative , according to the poll released Aug. 14 .
Others on the top 10 conservative list are : Utah , Louisiana , and Oklahoma , all at 47 percent ; South Carolina , 46 percent ; North Dakota , 45 percent ; and South Dakota , Idaho , and Wyoming , all at 44 percent .
The District of Columbia , which had the fewest people identifying themselves as conservative , was ranked as the place where the most people identified themselves as liberal .
Massachusetts , Vermont , Oregon , Washington , New York , New Jersey , California , Hawaii , and Connecticut round out the top 10 liberal states in the poll .
The poll 's results were based on answers to a question asking whether people 's political views are very conservative , conservative , moderate , liberal , or very liberal , according to the poll .
The data comes from Gallup Daily tracking in the first half of 2009 , with more than 160,000 adults interviewed nationwide .
Chile ’s Salar de Atacama desert is a major source for the world ’s lithium , key ingredient in the batteries we use in our laptops , cell phones and other gadgets every day .
And , key ingredient in batteries for a growing selection of electric and electric hybrid cars .
As the demand for battery - powered devices increases , so does the demand for lithium and therefore the earthly resources that provide it .
Check out this video from CBS about the production and demand .
While all it takes is a glance out the window to see that our demand for gadgets is constantly growing , what is very important to note is this little snippit :
“ This fall , Mercedes will sell the first lithium powered plug - in car .
At least six more carmakers plan their own models . ”
Chile ’s Salar de Atacama desert
As we shift towards electric cars , specifically towards electric cars utilizing lithium batteries , the production of the substance - how , where , and under what conditions – will be something to keep an eye on , especially considering :
“ Energy analyst Ben Johnson said , “ it looks very similar to an OPEC - style cartel .
It ’s highly concentrated .
The various producers are very secretive about their expansion plans and about their pricing movements . ” ”
Thinking that lithium is the next oil is probably an overreaction right now .
Because lithium has n’t ever been used to the extent oil has , exploration for sources has n’t been conducted on the same level .
There could be numerous unknown sources for it that would mitigate a rush to monopolize the currently known sources .
Plus , the paranoia about producers being secretive about expansion plans…well , that ’s true for most businesses .
Also , as Mike points out , the parallel with oil is not perfect either ; a barrel of oil does n’t last long , but a lithium - ion battery can last many years and then be recycled .
Nonetheless , while we often pay particular attention to the use of minerals like cassiterite and coltan in the production of gadgets , as these are minerals also mined from conflict zones like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , it ’s clear we need to pay added attention to the sources of other materials like lithium that seem more benign , for now .

To make Wiggs :
You must take two pounds of flour , and a quarter of a pound of butter , as much sugar , a nutmeg grated , a little cloves and mace , and a quarter of an ounce of caroway seeds , cream and yeast as much as will make it up into a light paste , make them up , and set them by the fire to rise ’ till the oven be ready ; they will quickly be baked .
The Whole Duty of a Woman , 1737
Wiggs are soft , subtly spiced buns , made to an original recipe dating from 1737 .
The recipe that I used follows it closely , with only slight modifications .
Wiggs :
3 and 1/2 cups of white flour
Pinch each of nutmeg , ginger and ground cloves
1/4 cup of butter
1/4 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of dried yeast
1 cup of milk
1 egg
Mix the dried ingredients , flour , spices and sugar , in a bowl Rub in the butter Warm up the milk
Take a little of the warm milk and mix with the dried yeast Pour in the milk , yeast and the egg and mix to form a soft dough Let rise for one hour in a warm place – I used a slightly warm oven .
Form the dough into six balls , and let them rise for another 20 minutes .
Bake at 200 C for 20 minutes .
The end result is a soft , spicy and slightly fragrant bun that could have come straight from a kitchen in 18th Century England .
The latest anti-drug ad campaign
Today , the drug czar unveiled the latest ad campaign : MethResources.gov .
Certainly better than an alien stealing your girlfriend if you smoke pot , but I ca n’t help but believe that anti-drug advertising is counterproductive , and not just because it ’s been badly / laughably done in the past .
Consider cigarettes .
While public perception has changed considerably over the years regarding cigarettes , it seems to me that anti-cigarette advertising had very little to do with it .
For most of my friends , this ubiquitous ad actually made them crave a cigarette .
( Just as studies showed that the Media Campaign ads against marijuana tended to reinforce marijuana interest . )
The government should really get out of the propaganda business and focus on encouraging scientific inquiry .

Most unmarried couples who live together are n't trying to test their relationship .
They just want to spend more time together .
That finding , from a new national study of dating and cohabitation , seemingly contradicts the popular wisdom of cohabitation as a trial marriage .
It 's among early results from the study , scheduled to continue for years , and it gives researchers new insight into the burgeoning number of couples who cohabit .
Cohabitation has increased so rapidly that the data about it have n't kept pace with the growing numbers , researchers say .
The latest U.S. Census for 2008 reported 13.6 million unmarried , heterosexual couples living together .
Researchers say 50 % to 60 % of couples who marry today lived together first ; some note that 70 % of young adults will cohabit .
Most couples who live together either marry or break up within two years .
This first snapshot of the new federally funded study of 1,294 unmarried Americans ages 18 to 34 will be presented today at a convention of marriage and family experts in Orlando .
Those who study cohabitation say it will provide good documentation for years on how such relationships evolve and on the changing role of cohabitation .
" People who are engaged think of ( living together ) as the next step before they get married , but in many couples , it 's part of the dating relationship — pretty serious , but still well shy of the marriage part , " says researcher Scott Stanley , co-director of the Center for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver .
Almost half of cohabitors of both sexes in the study cite spending more time together as a reason they moved in together ; just 9 % of men and 5 % of women cited " to test the relationship before marriage . "
" National surveys show many young people believe cohabitation is a good way to test a relationship , " says co-researcher Galena Rhoades , also of the University of Denver .
" So it 's surprising that very few individuals identify ' testing the relationship ' as their primary reason . "
Other initial findings :
• Most couples did n't consciously decide to live together ; two - thirds of cohabitors said they either " slid into it " or " talked about it , but then it just sort of happened . "
Just one - third talked about it and made a decision to live together .
• The more religious are less likely to cohabit : 49 % of dating couples and 30 % of cohabitors surveyed agree that " my religious beliefs suggest that it is wrong for people to live together without being married . "
Participants complete questionnaires two to three times a year ; more than 100 questions are in each survey .
More than two - thirds are in a serious dating relationship ; 32 % live together .
Of those cohabiting , 66 % moved in before making plans to marry ; 23 % planned to marry but were n't engaged , and 11 % moved in when they got engaged .
Angela Trilli , 26 , and her fiancé , Nick Kapalski , 28 , have been dating three years and bought a house two years ago in Kendall Park , N.J. " He actually proposed the day we bought the house , " she says .
" We were both living at home , and we both wanted to move into together . "
Trilli , who works in marketing for a non-profit , and Kapalski , a technician for a heating and air - conditioning company , have n't set a date , but " we 'll get married eventually , " she says .
Sociologists Jay Teachman of Western Washington University in Bellingham and Daniel Lichter of Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y. , say the new study is promising because it asks detailed questions of young adults and can monitor relationship progression from dating to cohabitation .
Both sociologists study cohabitation ; neither is involved in the new research .
Another study , the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , illustrates the difficulties of studying cohabitation .
The 1,733 - question survey asked two questions related to cohabitation ; data are from 2001 - 02 .
Those findings are part of an analysis being released today by the non-profit Child Trends , which examined statistics on 11,998 young adults ages 20 - 24 .
It finds most young people view cohabitation positively and see living together as a temporary alternative to marriage .
Most say they hope to marry someday .
Other research by Stanley and Rhoades , along with the center 's co-director , Howard Markman , published this year reinforces previous findings about cohabitation and is similar to the new Denver study .
A survey of 1,050 people who were married less than 10 years published in the Journal of Family Psychology suggests cohabiting before engagement is associated with lower marital satisfaction .
A study of 120 cohabiting couples in the Journal of Family Issues also found unmarried partners cohabit to spend more time together , not to test the relationship .
It would be amusing to just have a contest asking people to guess what the vertical axis on this chart is supposed to represent .
The answer is , " reply rate to first - contact messages on an online dating site , as a function of words appearing in the message . "
In particular , the site OkCupid , which has a handy rundown of which words and phrases are most likely to garner a reply to an initial contact .
( Via FlowingData . )
The average response rate is 32 % , so you can see how using some specific word increases or decreases your chances of success .
Apparently mentioning " God " is a big turn - off , although calling Him by a proper name is slightly helpful .
But nothing works at turning a stranger 's head quite like bringing up His complete lack of existence .
Other useful hints : real words good , fake internet words bad .
Complimenting personality / intellect good , complimenting looks bad .
Being specific is good , especially if it involves physics , heavy metal , vegetarianism , or zombies .

Uploadify and Rails 2.3
A few weeks back we ( Steve and I ) added multiple asset upload to Harmony using Uploadify .
If you are thinking that sounds easy , you would be sorely mistaken .
Uploadify uses flash to send the files to Rails .
This is n’t a big deal except that we are using cookie sessions on Harmony and flash was n’t sending the session information with the files , so to Rails the files appeared as unauthenticated .
We found multiple articles online showing how to get this working , but none of them worked as promised .
At the time Harmony was running on Rails 2.2 .
Knowing that rack was probably the best way to solve our issue , we updated to 2.3 , which was pretty painless , and started hacking .
Be sure to check out a quick screencast of the finished product at some point as well .
Add Uploadify
First , we added the uploadify files and the following js to the assets / index view .
We actually set many more options , but these are the ones pertinent to this article .
Script is the url to post the files to .
fileDataName is the name of the file field you would like to use .
scriptData is any additional data you would like to post to the url .
<%- session_key_name = ActionController::Base.session_options [ : key ] -%> < script type =" text / javascript " >
$( '#upload_files ').fileUpload( { script : '/ admin/assets ' , fileDataName : ' asset [ file ] ' , scriptData : { '< %= session_key_name %>' : '< %= u cookies [ session_key_name ] %>' , ' authenticity_token ' : '< %= u form_authenticity_token if protect_against_forgery ? %>' } } ) ; </ script >
As you can see , it adds the session key and the cookie value along with the authenticity token as data that gets sent with the file .
We then use a piece of rack middleware to intercept the upload and properly set the Rails session cookie .
Add Some Middleware
We created an app / middleware directory and added it to the load path in environment.rb .
%w ( observers sweepers mailers middleware ) .each do |dir| config.load_paths << " #{RAILS_ROOT}/app/#{dir} "
end
Next , we dropped flash_session_cookie_middleware.rb in the app / middleware directory .
require ' rack/utils ' class FlashSessionCookieMiddleware def initialize ( app , session_key = ' _session_id ' ) @app = app @session_key = session_key end def call ( env ) if env [ ' HTTP_USER_AGENT '] =~ /^( Adobe|Shockwave ) Flash / params = :: Rack ::Utils.parse_query(env[' QUERY_STRING ' ] ) unless params[@session_key ].nil ?
env[' HTTP_COOKIE '] = " #{@session_key}=#{params[@session_key ]} " . freeze end end @app.call( env ) end end
And , finally , we added the following to our session_store.rb initializer .
ActionController :: Dispatcher.middleware.insert_before ( ActionController :: Session :: CookieStore , FlashSessionCookieMiddleware , ActionController :: Base.session_options [ : key ] )
This inserts our middleware before ActionController ’s CookieStore so that everything will just work as expected .
Assign the Content Type
The only other thing we needed to do was manually set the content type of the file .
We were using paperclip ( which is awesome ) to do uploads , so something like this did the trick :
@asset.file_content_type = MIME ::Types.type_for(@asset.original_filename).to_s
Be sure to add the mime type gem to your environment.rb file as well .
config.gem ' mime - types ' , : lib => ' mime / types '
But Why ?
So why did we go through all this trouble to allow multiple uploads at once ?
Taking a quick look at the finished product might help .
I did n’t record the entire screen in the video , as we have n’t actually released Harmony yet ( ooooh secrets ! ) , but I did capture enough that you can see the awesome uploads in action .
Hope this spares some other poor soul attempting the same thing some time .
Forecasts of climate change are about to go seriously out of kilter .
One of the world ’s top climate modellers said Thursday we could be about to enter one or even two decades during which temperatures cool .
“ People will say this is global warming disappearing , ” he told more than 1500 of the world ’s top climate scientists gathering in Geneva at the UN ’s World Climate Conference .
“ I am not one of the sceptics , ” insisted Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at Kiel University , Germany .
“ However , we have to ask the nasty questions ourselves or other people will do it . ”
Few climate scientists go as far as Latif , an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
But more and more agree that the short - term prognosis for climate change is much less certain than once thought .

Nature vs humans
This is bad timing .
The UN ’s World Meteorological Organization called the conference in order to draft a global plan for providing “ climate services ” to the world : that is , to deliver climate predictions useful to everyone from farmers worried about the next rainy season to doctors trying to predict malaria epidemics and builders of dams , roads and other infrastructure who need to assess the risk of floods and droughts 30 years hence .
But some of the climate scientists gathered in Geneva to discuss how this might be done admitted that , on such timescales , natural variability is at least as important as the long - term climate changes from global warming .
“ In many ways we know more about what will happen in the 2050s than next year , ” said Vicky Pope from the UK Met Office .
Cold Atlantic
Latif predicted that in the next few years a natural cooling trend would dominate over warming caused by humans .
The cooling would be down to cyclical changes to ocean currents and temperatures in the North Atlantic , a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) .
Breaking with climate - change orthodoxy , he said NAO cycles were probably responsible for some of the strong global warming seen in the past three decades .
“ But how much ?
The jury is still out , ” he told the conference .
The NAO is now moving into a colder phase .
Latif said NAO cycles also explained the recent recovery of the Sahel region of Africa from the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s .
James Murphy , head of climate prediction at the Met Office , agreed and linked the NAO to Indian monsoons , Atlantic hurricanes and sea ice in the Arctic .
“ The oceans are key to decadal natural variability , ” he said .
Another favourite climate nostrum was upturned when Pope warned that the dramatic Arctic ice loss in recent summers was partly a product of natural cycles rather than global warming .
Preliminary reports suggest there has been much less melting this year than in 2007 or 2008 .
In candid mood , climate scientists avoided blaming nature for their faltering predictions , however .
“ Model biases are also still a serious problem .
We have a long way to go to get them right .
They are hurting our forecasts , ” said Tim Stockdale of the European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts in Reading , UK .
The world may badly want reliable forecasts of future climate .
But such predictions are proving as elusive as the perfect weather forecast .

Seeing how every flavor of rolling paper already seems to exist ( I 've heard -- I do n't know anything about these things in case my mom is reading ) , it was only a matter of time bong rips before somebody put two and two together and then got the munchies and forgot what they were doing .
Then , sometime much later , somebody else created bacon flavored rolling papers .
Made by Juicy Jay's , the papers promise a sizzlin ' bacon taste and aroma .
Interesting .
Unfortunately , I only smoke REAL bacon ( I swear , mom ) and banana peels .

Honestly , I do n’t know how to even word this post .
My words are failing my thoughts as my fingers try and move in a fluid motion across the keyboard .
This is about music .
This is about sound .
This is about rock and roll .
This is about everything I love ,
everything that is music .
My headphones have been currently producing the sounds of ; Frightened Rabbit , The Twilight Sad , Glasvegas , The Dead Weather , Sun Kil Moon , Smog , M83 , TV on the Radio , Boards of Canada , Jonsi and Alex , Say Hi , Discovery and The Passion Pit all merging with my all time favorites Bowie , Lou Reed , The Velvets , The Dolls , The Smiths , T Rex , The Fall , Joy Division , The Smiths , The Clash , Mott the Hoople and a whole entourage of others .
I create a playlist every drudging half asleep morning of music from my vast and undiscovered library of music that no longer pushes the closet or shelf space but external HD space ( 3 of them now to be exact ) in order to awaken my soul by 12 O’clock .
Once again , a specific duo has absolutely blown my ears into absolute oblivion , to the point where I have to get up and dance singing and shaking to the music that they continue to create .
Not long ago I wrote a post about “ The Greatest Band you have never heard of ” and they still are !
This creative force in the shape of two individuals are no longer named “ Street Hassle ” , but now “ Touch Tongues ” .
Honestly , what the hell is going on in the music world when a force of nature like Touch Tongues is n’t in everyone ’s playlist , headphones , IPod or whatever you use to fill your ears with waves .
Last week they uploaded a new songs to their MySpace page that were recorded in a single weekend in a storage shed .
“ Instead of a garage band we ’re a mini- storage band ” Pierre Krause ( The wife ) told the Dallas Observer in an article last week .
I know “ The Dead Weather ” album is brilliant , amazing , I ca n’t stop listening to it myself .
But “ Touch Tounges ” is raw , is real , is rock and roll , is right here in Dallas .
This is what Art is all about .
Being an Artist myself , to lock yourself in a mini-storage shed and kick out songs , on your own , at the brilliance they have done .
This is what creating is all about , this is the life of artists , this is the life of stories , this is the life of a generation of middle fingers and change .
Pierre and I go way back , I consider her family .
I have always , for the number of years I have known her , called her the second coming of Patti Smith .

You can here bits of Patti in every breath of her vocals while husband Chris is banging out Johnny Thunders , Mark Bolan , Bernard Sumner and Lou Reed guitar riffs to her haunting , yet powerful vocals that even hint at a female Ian Curtis .
The new songs have a Joy Division feel in the sound , which always brings me that excited , yet sorrowful feeling .
Do yourself a damn favor , listen , and go see a show .
Bring a crew out , dress up , go to dance , go with the attitude of visiting the Manchester ’s Rafters Club on April 14th 1978 and witnessing Joy Division , or David Bowie performing Ziggy Stardust in 1972 .
If you go with an attitude of rock and roll history , “ Touch Tongues ” will be one of the best shows you have ever seen .

For 10 days in June , Kristen Murphy chose to live somewhere she and many others fear : a nursing home .
Ms. Murphy , who is in perfect health , had to learn the best way to navigate a wheelchair around her small room , endure the humiliation that comes with being helped in the bathroom , try to sleep through night checks and become attuned to the emotions of her fellow residents .
And Ms. Murphy , 38 , had to explain to friends , family and fellow patients why she was there .
Ms. Murphy , a medical student at the University of New England in Biddeford , Me. , who is interested in geriatric medicine , came to New York for a novel program that allowed her to experience life as a nursing home patient .
Students are given a “ diagnosis ” of an ailment and expected to live as someone with the condition does .
They keep a daily journal chronicling their experiences and , in most cases , debunking their preconceived notions .

IT NEVER pays to underestimate the bounciness of Asia 's emerging economies .
After the region 's financial crisis of 1997 - 98 , and again after the dotcom bust in 2001 , outsiders predicted a lengthy period on the floor — only for the tigers to spring back rapidly .
Earlier this year it was argued that such export - dependent economies could not revive until customers in the rich world did .
The West still looks weak , with many economies contracting in the second quarter , and even if America begins to grow in the second half of this year , consumer spending looks sickly .
Yet Asian economies , increasingly decoupled from Western shopping habits , are growing fast .
The four emerging Asian economies which have reported GDP figures for the second quarter ( China , Indonesia , South Korea and Singapore ) grew by an average annualised rate of more than 10 % ( see article ) .
Even richer and more sluggish Japan , which cannot match that figure , seems to be recovering faster than its Western peers .
But emerging Asia should grow by more than 5 % this year — at a time when the old G7 could contract by 3.5 % .
Western politicians should brace themselves for more talk of economic power drifting inexorably to the East .
How has Asia made such an astonishing rebound ?
Out of smoke and mirrors , say some Western sceptics .
They claim China 's bounceback is yet another fake .
The country 's numbers are certainly dodgy : the components of GDP do not add up , and the data are always published suspiciously early .
China 's economy probably slowed more sharply in late 2008 than the official numbers suggest .
But other indicators , which are less likely to be massaged , confirm that China 's economy is roaring back .
Industrial production rose 11 % in the year to July ; electricity output , which fell sharply last year , is growing again ; and car sales are 70 % higher than a year ago .
And surely the whole of Asia cannot be engaged in a statistical fraud .
South Korea 's GDP grew by an annualised 10 % in the second quarter .
Taiwan 's probably increased by even more : its industrial output jumped by an astonishing annualised rate of 89 % .
India was hit less hard by the global recession than many of its neighbours because it exports less , but its industrial production has also perked up , rising by a seasonally adjusted rate of 14 % in the second quarter .
Output in most of the smaller Asian economies is still lower than a year ago , because they suffered steep downturns late last year .
But at economic turning points , one should track quarterly changes .
Thrift in the boom , stimulus in the slump
Asia 's rebound has several causes .
First , manufacturing accounts for a big part of several local economies , and industries such as cars and electronics are highly cyclical : output drops sharply in a downturn and then spurts in the upturn .
Second , the region 's decline in exports in late 2008 was exacerbated by the freezing up of global trade finance , which is now flowing again .
Third , and most important , domestic spending has bounced back because the fiscal stimulus in the region was bigger and worked faster than in the West .
India aside , the Asians entered this downturn with far healthier government finances than rich countries , allowing them to spend more money .
Low private - sector debt made households and firms more likely to spend government handouts ; Asian banks were also in better shape than their Western counterparts and able to lend more .
Asia 's prudence during the past decade did not allow it to escape the global recession , but it made the region 's fiscal and monetary weapons more effective .
Western populists will no doubt once again try to blame their own sluggish performance on “ unfair ” Asia .
Ignore them .
Emerging Asia 's average growth rate of almost 8 % over the past two decades — three times the rate in the rich world — has brought huge benefits to the rest of the world .
Its rebound now is all the more useful when growth in the West is likely to be slow .
Asia cannot replace the American consumer : emerging Asia 's total consumption amounts to only two - fifths of America's .
But it is the growth in spending that really matters .
In dollar terms , the increase in emerging Asia 's consumer - spending this year will more than offset the drop in spending in America and the euro area .
This shift in spending from the West to the East will help rebalance the world economy .
Beijing , Bangkok and Bangalore : beware boastfulness
It is easy to boost an economy with lots of government spending .
But Asian policymakers now face two difficult problems .
Their immediate dilemma is how to sustain recovery without inflating credit and asset - price bubbles .
Local equity and property markets are starting to froth .
But policymakers ' reluctance to let their currencies rise faster against the dollar means that their monetary policy is , in effect , being set by America 's Federal Reserve , and is therefore too lax for these perkier economies .
The longer - term challenge is that once the impact of governments ' fiscal stimulus fades , growth will slow unless economic reforms are put in place to bolster private spending — something Japan , alas , never did ( see article ) .
Part of the solution to both problems — preventing bubbles and strengthening domestic spending — is to allow exchange rates to rise .
If Asian central banks stopped piling up reserves to hold down their currencies , this would help stem domestic liquidity .
Stronger currencies would also shift growth from exports to domestic demand and increase households ' real spending power — and help ward off protectionists in the West .
Hubris is the big worry .
With the gap in growth rates between emerging Asia and the developed world heading towards a record nine percentage points this year , Chinese leaders have taken to warning America about its lax monetary policy ( while Washington has stopped lecturing China about the undervalued yuan ) .
But it would be a big mistake if Asia 's recovery led its politicians to conclude that there was no need to change their exchange - rate policies or adopt structural reforms to boost consumption .
The tigers ' faster - than - expected rebound from their 1997 - 98 financial crisis encouraged complacency and delayed necessary reforms , which left them more vulnerable to the global downturns in 2001 and now .
Make sure this new rise is not followed by another fall .
The male of the species , the ' chav ' , is often to be found lurking in braying packs close to fast food outlets or late night stores .
It displays a distinctive livery with which it attempts to attract the female ( ' chavette ' ) - most commonly , the Burberry - effect baseball cap ( placed at a jaunty angle , sometimes partially covering the face - this is known in some cultures as ' snidey ' ) ; the ' sports ' clothing ( this is somewhat confusing as the chav is not renowned for its athletic abilities ) and countless items of ' bling ' ( Chav patois meaning jewellery or other adornments ) .
The origins of said ' bling ' are various as the chav typically possesses neither a means of employment or indeed any type of education .
Chavettes , meanwhile , tend to have hair in at least two colours , ill - fitting tops and white tracksuit tops ( usually Kappa ) .
Note their ornate ' love bites ' : tribal cicatrices around the neck , usually perpetrated by a near - toothless male known as Kev , Daz , Gaz , Baz , Tez or some other monosyllabic name .
Health and EducationChavs can often be seen smoking - an activity which causes them to spit and cough , but only in public places ( see above ) .
They imbibe alcohol , normally in the form of cheap lager / cider normally obtained illegally .
This often gives them the impression that they are ' hard ' and they will thus attempt to start fights with anyone / thing smaller than them .
However , upon retaliation of their prey they tend to run away .
Chavs are , believe it or not , to be found in education .
Again , they tend to subsist in packs and can be seen braying and howling in the classroom , challenging even the most reasonable of requests to shut the hell up and let other people learn things .
They tend to leave school before the age of sixteen , however , in order to pursue parenthood or a life of crime .
Transportation
The chavette is rarely seen driving a car .
Instead , she is to be found holding up various bus passengers as she attempts to manoeuvre her outsized three - wheeled buggy onto a local bus service .
She is usually en route to a supermarket or other place where she can swear at or smack her children publicly ( this is the only form of discipline , usually to an extreme , ever displayed by chavs or chavettes towards their children and so it is required by law that it takes place wherever others may be gathered ) .
The chav can be found spending seemingly endless resources of money adding bodykits and neon striplights to his car ( sometimes known as a ' chaviot ' ) : this is normally a pre-1990 Ford Escort with 1100 cc engine and XR3i stickers , a near - suicidal Vauxhall Nova ( with plastic split - screen effect , or the occasional BMW coated in Hammerite .
The real mystery about this is how the vehicle can move under the weight of the stereo system installed ( badly ) within .
A large sticker usually adorns the rear ( tinted ) windscreen of the vehicle , proclaiming the brand of stereo equipment supposedly fitted inside .
Loud , bassy music of indeterminate genre / origin will more often than not be emanating through the very loose tinted side windows .
Language
The typical Chav speaks a language which has yet to be named .
It claims to have its roots in English , although this is in some doubt .
Most Chav words are mercifully brief , and sentences tend to be punctuated with ' innit ' or some sort of expletive .
Only chavs can truly understand the language - the rest of us can only guess at the witty repartie and intellectual gems of conversation that may pass between them .
Bauxite mountains are part of a very delicate ecosystem .
The mining of bauxite and the process by which it is turned into aluminum is among the most toxic , environmentally devastating processes imaginable .
If Vedanta is allowed to go ahead with its plans for mining the Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa , in India 's east , for bauxite it will lead to the devastation of a whole ecosystem and the destruction of not just the Dongria Kondh tribal community , but eventually all those whose livelihoods depend on that ecosystem .
The battle lines are very clearly drawn .
On the one hand the Indian government with all its might , its judiciary and its police has aligned itself with the mining cartel of several corporations , led from the front by Vedanta .
On the other side are India 's poorest forest - dwelling people who stand to be displaced from their homes and lose their livelihoods and their way of life .
In some ways it 's an ancient battle and a familiar one , whose story has been played out over centuries in every continent across the world and has had a more or less similar outcome , ie the corporations always win .
This is commonly known as " progress " .
However , today , in the era of climate change , surely it 's time to realise that forests , river systems , mountain ranges and people who know how to live in ecologically sustainable ways , are worth more than all the bauxite in the world .
Vedanta ought to be stopped in its tracks .
Now .
Immediately .
Before any more damage is done .
John Ashcroft had asked the court to dismiss the case A former US attorney general can be sued by an American citizen held as a witness suspected of having information in a terrorism case , a court has ruled .
Abdullah al - Kidd accuses John Ashcroft , attorney general from 2001 to 2005 , of violating his constitutional rights in 2003 , when he was held for 16 days .
The court said detention of witnesses without charge after the 9/11 attacks was " repugnant to the constitution " .
The US Department of Justice said it was reviewing the court 's order .
A three - judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals also said the government 's policy was " a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history . "
Mr al - Kidd was detained in 2003 because the government thought he had information in a computer terrorism case against fellow University of Idaho student Sami Omar al - Hussayen .
Our hope is that we can now begin the process of uncovering the full contours of this illegal national policy
Lee Gelernt
American Civil Liberties Union
He was never charged with a crime , and Mr al - Hussayen was acquitted after a trial .
Mr al - Kidd filed the lawsuit against Mr Ashcroft and other officials in 2005 .
He said his detention was part of an illegal government policy to arrest and detain people - particularly Muslim men and those of Arab descent - as material witnesses if the government suspected them of a crime but had no evidence to charge them .
Mr Ashcroft had asked the judge to dismiss the matter , saying that he had absolute immunity in his position .
However , the judges said even qualified immunity does not allow the attorney general to carry out national security functions completely free from any personal liability concerns .
Mr al - Kidd 's attorney , Lee Gelernt , of the American Civil Liberties Union , said : " Our hope is that we can now begin the process of uncovering the full contours of this illegal national policy . "
The judges ' ruling said that Mr Ashcroft had said the use of the material witness statute and other tactics " form one part of the department 's concentrated strategy to prevent terrorist attacks by taking suspected terrorists off the street " .
But the judges also noted that Mr al - Kidd will have a significant burden to show that Mr Ashcroft was personally involved in an illegal policy .

John V. Santore at Media Matters makes a convincing case that what Glenn Beck is doing in attacking President Obama 's appointees as " communists " and " Marxists " is simply a new form of McCarthyism .
Now , what do we do about it ?
Step 1 : Expose both Beck and his enablers for what they are : liars , smear artists , and political charlatans .
James Rucker of Color of Change has a superb post up about the nuances of dealing with hatemongers like Beck :
In the wake of Van ’s resignation , some have wondered whether kicking the Beck hornet ’s nest makes sense .
I ’ve got two thoughts in response .
First , Beck and Fox trying to change the topic and counter - attacking with such force is probably a good indicator that we ’re getting to them ; if anything , now would be the time to go harder .
Second , I believe we have no choice .
Beck has promised to take his witch - hunt to others in the administration , and has set his sights on Cass Sunstein as his next target .
He has no plans to stop , and neither should we .
But it ’s not just “ czar ” - hunting that ’s at stake here .
The right wing media machine , of which Beck is now one of the leading members , is the single greatest force standing in the way of change .
They have already helped derail the conversation on health care , elevating accusations of Obama ’s alliance with the Third Reich to some semblance of credibility .
And they will do the same to the upcoming debates over clean energy , immigration , and every progressive policy priority .
We simply do n’t have the luxury of ignoring them .
We must challenge them head on , expose their distortions , take away their advertisers , and position their views where they belong : far outside the bounds of any rational political discourse .
Be sure to read the whole piece .
It 's been patently self - evident that Van Jones was just the appetizer for the sharks at Fox , whose ultimate goal is to take down Obama himself .
Beck has been boasting that he took down Jones by simply using Jones ' own words and repeating them .
Well , folks in glass houses ought to think carefully about the wisdom of throwing stones , if you know what I mean .
The catalog of Glenn Beck 's toxic discourse is long and nasty .
When it comes to giving advertisers something to think about , the well is deep and dark .
No doubt a lot of it is going to be bubbling back up into public view soon .
Because nothing brings down the liars and crooks like the light of day , shining brightly under the rocks whence they crawl .
At the start of the film Dustin Hoffman goes into a village pub and asks for American cigarettes and he 's give Rothmans , which are British .
It would be highly unlikely for a village pub to sell American cigarettes .

From Shaved Back Jersey Numbers to Bathingsuit Top Chest Hair
Hairy body art sounds scary , and for some people , this type of chest and back hair grooming truly is frightening .
The hairy body art featured in this gallery features people who have treated their bodies as temporary and canvases and shaved or waxes their hair to create all sorts of different patterns and designs .
From chest hair initials to jersey number back hair , this hairy body art is a great , cheap way to express your quirky side , without the permanence of a tattoo .
The Explanatory Gap
It is hard to recognize ourselves – our subjective experiences , thoughts , emotions , and daily activities – in this neurological description of our brains .
Normally we have no conscious awareness of the cognitive modules and Rube Goldberg machines in our head .
Cognitive neuroscientists and philosophers of mind refer to this the " Explanatory Gap " .
Our physical descriptions of the way the brain works at the level of neurons , brain anatomy , and neurological processes bear no resemblance to our subjective experiences as people with brains having complex mental and emotional states .
Nor is there any neurological definition of consciousness .
We have no device that can measure presence or absence of consciousness .
This is also referred to as the " Hard Problem " in consciousness studies .
We can study brains and learn all kinds of interesting and practical things about brains , their functions and dysfunctions , but this does not get us near to understanding what subjective conscious experience is or how the brain creates it .
We know that a diseased or damaged brain may lose function or consciousness , ultimately resulting in death , but we do not know what consciousness per se is at the level of the " neural code " .
Some are optimistic that we are closing this Explanatory Gap , that we will soon come to understand the " neural code " and be able to translate the " machine language " of the brain into the " software applications " of human consciousness .
Indeed , a lot of progress has been made in understanding how the brain functions .
Scientists have probed , prodded , tested , measured , dissected , and scanned lots and lots of brains , both human and animal .
Scientists have also developed a remarkable pharmacology of new drugs to treat depression , schizophrenia , and other disorders .
Progress in the neurosciences raises lots of other interesting philosophical questions , which necessarily overlap with religious and theological concerns .
First , there is the question of reductionism and how far it can go ?
If we can reduce certain mental phenomena , say mystical experiences of enlightenment , to neurological processes , does that mean that we have adequately explained the experience and can dismiss it ?
What happens if we invent ways to stimulate these peak experiences at will ?
If the brain is a deterministic system , then how can we talk about free will , moral responsibility , and creative choice ?
If personality is intrinsically linked to brain chemistry should we reject the dualism between brain and mind , body and soul ?
In treating mental illness should we " waste time " with talk therapy or simply treat these illnesses with medications ?
Do the cognitive neurosciences import assumed values and perspectives that are more ideological than empirical ?
And what of bioethical issues that arise in the context of neuromedicine ?
This is just a short list and we are going to revisit some of these questions below and in the discussion to follow .
The Hard Question remains : what is consciousness ?
Can we fill in the Explanatory Gap between the neurosciences and subjective experience ?
And what in particular is the nature of religious experience from the perspective of the neurosciences ?
Science does not need to solve all of these philosophical problems .
That , I would argue , is not the job of science , but rather the task of scientifically informed philosophers and theologians .
Science can and does continue to plod along in its methodical manner .
The neurosciences move ahead by formulating small questions and then constructing experiments to try to answer them .
The neurological basis of religious and spiritual experiences is certainly an interesting question and it has recently been the subject of a lot of fascinating research in laboratories and debate in the academe and in the media .
There are a number of ways to tackle the question :
Disease and injury based studies Surgical studies Functional Imaging studies Psychotropics drugs studies Developmental studies
1 ) Disease and Injury Based Studies
As already mentioned , many insights about the brain are derived from the study of brain disease and injury .
For instance , there may be a link between mental illness and religiosity , for instance in the case of schizophrenia , in which psychotic episodes often have religious content .
Indeed , for many decades the psychiatric community classified all religious content as delusional or neurotic in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSMMD ) ( Larson 1993 ) .
That is happily no longer the case .
The psychiatric community has slowly come around to recognizing that religious manifestations among patients may be a sign of strength , a resource in healing , and not necessarily pathological ( Hufford 2005 ) .
There is a lot of interest in the role of the frontal lobes in religious experience .
Traumatic injuries to the frontal lobes have a profound effect on a person ’s personality , impulse control , and complex thought processes .
The seat of cognition , however , does not work alone .
It is part of a complex network , left , right , inside out , and all around .
V.S. Ramachandran , a neuroscientist at UC San Diego , has focused on Left Temporal Lobe epilepsy , which is frequently associated with religious visions during seizures and a preoccupation with religious issues between seizure episodes .
Ramachandran speculates that Saint Paul , Mohammad , and other prophets and sages were afflicted with Left Temporal Lobe epilepsy ( Ramachandran 1998 ) .
Ramachandran notes that " God may be the ultimate confabulation of the Left Hemisphere of the brain " ( Ramachandran 2006 ) .
There are other mental defects that manifest themselves in otherwise mentally healthy individuals .
For instance , with Charles Bonnet Syndrome , people have complex visual hallucinations of people , animals , or objects not actually present .
With Capgras ’s Syndrome , otherwise mentally healthy individuals have delusions that people around them have been replaced by imposters .
Another , much more common mental disorder is known as Sleep Paralysis or Agoraphobia .
Probably many of you have had the experience of waking up at night with an inability to move and the strong sense of someone else in the room with you .
This is not a pleasant experience .
The presence - in - the - room is typically perceived to be a demon of some sort and the experience is generally terrifying .
This is such a common experience that it has many names , folk stories , and mythological explanations in diverse cultures around the world .
Neuroscientists now have an etiology for sleep paralysis , but one could easily imagine how this experience or others would help give rise to religious beliefs in demons , ghosts , or the devil ( Hufford 1982 ) .
There is one other neurological disorder that is worth mentioning .
Synesthesia is a condition that might be thought of as metaphoric thought on steroids .
It typically involves things like hearing sounds and seeing colors , reading numbers and seeing colors , seeing colors and hearing sounds .
Perhaps one in a thousand humans have some form on synesthesia in varying degrees .
It is not necessarily unpleasant .
Indeed , far from being a disorder , it can be seen as a mental strength .
As we would expect , many creative artists have synesthesia .
Synesthesia may be linked to a much more common mental functions that all of us employ everyday , the ability to make and use metaphors , of which religion is an important subset .
A metaphor is the combination of two unlike things to create a new meaning .
Shakespeare writes that " time is a beggar " and now we have a new insight into time .
You may have noticed that I have used several metaphors from the computer sciences to illuminate the neurosciences – neural " code " , neural " machine language " , mental " software " , neural " networks " , etc. Science also uses metaphors .
In some sense , all human language is derived from metaphors ( Ricoeur 1976 ) .
Religion can be thought of as something like the metaphoric confabulations of synesthesia , seeing nature and hearing the voice of God or the Buddha - nature in all things ( Ramachandran 1998 ) .
2. Surgical Studies
Surgical studies are much more limited , because doctors cannot ethically open up someone ’s brain and start poking around , say like fixing a car or a computer .
The occasion to do surgery on live humans is typically to remove a brain tumor and these are risky operations .
Because the brain has no sensory nerves and cannot feel pain , brain surgery is typically done on conscious humans , which means you can ask them questions during the surgery .
In the 1950s , Wilder Penfield , a Canadian neurosurgeon , electrically stimulated different regions of patients ’ brains during surgery and asked patients to describe any sensations .
Stimulation of the right temporal lobe caused patients to hear voices and see apparitions .
Around the same time , Robert Heath of Tulane University induced intense pleasure in psychiatric patients with electrodes implanted in the septum , a minute region just above the hypothalamus .
He also induced multiple orgasms in a female patient by injecting the neurotransmitter acetylcholine directly into her septal region .
These kinds of studies would not be allowed today by the Internal Review Boards at medical schools , and rightly so , but they were certainly illuminating and suggestive .
Certainly , every neuroscience course and textbook today still presents the work of Penfield and Heath .
Based in part on these kinds of studies , Julian Jaynes proposed a unique theory of religion in his 1976 book , The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind .
Jaynes speculated that there were structural changes in the human brain some 10,000 years ago .
He suggested that the bundle of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain , the corpus callosum , may not have been as developed as it is today .
In our ancestors ’ brains , the left hemisphere , acting as the primary seat of language and identity , would misattribute signals originating from the right hemisphere to an external source , and thus imagined ghosts or gods ( Jaynes 1976 ) .
Brain surgery research continues on nonhuman animals , but alas lab rats , dogs , and monkeys cannot report to us on their subjective experience .
Nevertheless , we learn a lot about how the brain functions , which is then correlated with human brain function .
We are also embarking upon a new era of electrical implant machines to help patients with Parkinson or other brain disorders , as well as brain implants to help quadriplegics to control computers with their thoughts alone .
All of this will have implications for our understanding of religious and spiritual phenomena , some of which may have been best prefigured in science fiction novels .
3. Functional Imaging Studies
New non-invasive technologies now allows us to look inside the brains of humans without adverse risks to the patient .
Improvements in these technologies allow us measure actual brain functions while performing limited tasks or experiences and compare these states to some base - line image .
These are referred to as functional brain imaging studies .
The earliest form of such techniques was involved using electroencephalographs of brain waves , as well as measures of autonomic activities such as heart rate and blood pressure changes , for instance , as used in early meditation studies .
You are probably familiar with the term " bio- feedback device , " which were popular in the 1970s .
This approach , however , has been compared to trying to understand human speech by listening to the sound of a sport stadium .
The new technology is much more powerful , but not without its limitations .
There are three new techniques for functional brain imaging and each has different strengths and weaknesses .
PET scans , or positron emission tomography , uses a radioactive tracer injected into blood stream of the subject to measure oxygen flow , glucose consumption , blood utilization , or neurotransmitters in different regions of the brain .
This then indicates which areas of the brain are most active in any given experience or activity .
The injection provides a freeze frame at a particular moment and then is followed by the actual scan of the brain .
The problem with PET scan is that the tracers are only present for a few minutes , so the patient needs to be already in the scanning device before the injection occurs .
Hospital scanning devices are not particularly conducive to having profound mystical experiences .
Another category of imaging technology is fMRI , which stands for functional magnetic resonance imaging .
The advantage of fMRI is that it does not involve injecting radioactive tracers into the blood stream of the patient .
The disadvantage is that it involves placing the patient inside a claustrophobia - inducing machine that makes loud banging noises , only slight more tolerable than listening to a jackhammer .
Again , this is not an atmosphere particularly conducive to contemplative practice or religious devotion .
The functional imaging technology most suited to the kind of research proposed is SPECT scan , which stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography .
This involves using a longer lasting radioactive tracer .
Typical research design has the patients outfitted with an IV and a button so they can self inject the tracer at what they subjectively consider to be the peak experience in meditation or prayer .
This can be done in a comfortable room in the hospital near the SPECT scan machine and can involve the use of ritual objects , incense , chanting , prayer , etc .
After the peak experience and the tracer ’s " snapshot " record of brain activity at the time of injection , the subject can then be put into the scanning machine to measure brain metabolism from the tracer " snapshot " some minutes earlier .
Andrew Newberg and his deceased colleague Eugene D’Aquili pioneered this research with religious subjects .
Their first study involved eight American Buddhist trained in the Tibetan meditation and three Franciscan nuns .
They observed increased neural activity in the prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe .
The latter is connected with the ability to navigate the physical self in an external world .
They hypothesized that the decreased activity in posterior superior parietal lobe was linked to the experience of non-duality described by the subjects .
They call this experience " Absolute Unitary Being " ( Newberg 1999 ; Newberg 2000 ) .
They maintain that " mystical experience is biologically , observably , and scientifically ‘ real ’ rather than ‘ wishful thinking ’ ( Newberg 2001 ) and go on to speculate :
[ We ] saw evidence of a neurological process that has evolved to allow humans to transcend material existence and acknowledge and connect with a deeper , more spiritual part of ourselves perceived of as an absolute , universal reality that connects us to all others ( Newberg 2001 )
4. Pharmaceutical Interventions
Psychotropic or psychedelic drugs have long been part of human religious practices in diverse parts of the world .
The authors of the Hindu Vedas received inspiration from the drug soma , which is thought to be derived from psychedelic mushrooms , psilocybin or fly agaric , perhaps in combination with cannabis or other substances .
The ancient Greek Eleusinian Mysteries also involved the use of some kind of psychedelic drug .
Tribal shamans from Africa , Asia , and the Americas use psychotropic drugs as part of their rituals .
The Native American Church in the United States won a Supreme Count case to ensure their right to use peyote in their religious observances .
The urge for intoxication is not limited to humans .
Chimpanzees , elephants , parrots , and other species ingest fermented fruit and other intoxicants .
UCLA psychopharmacologist Ronald Siegel speculates that the desire for intoxication is " the fourth drive " after hunger , thirst , and sex ( Siegel 1989 ) .
The suggestion in this line of research is that perhaps religion is founded on this desire to get high .
Ergot , a fungus that contaminates rye , wheat , and barley , also has psychotropic properties and is probably used intentionally as part of the Eleusinian Mysteries .
It has also caused many accidental poisonings in human history .
Ergot epidemics were known as St. Anthony ’s Fire in the Middle Ages and may be linked to incidents of mass hysteria and hallucinations .
The synthesis of LSD in 1942 by the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman was based on an Ergot derivative .
In addition to LSD , modern science has synthesized a great number of new psychotropic and psychedelic compounds .
Some prefer to use the term Entheogens , meaning " God-inducing " , to describe this class of chemicals , because of their ability to induce intense mystical experiences .
The most common and quite potent drugs are :
Mescaline –– 3,4,5- trimethoxyphenethylamine ,
LSD -- lysergic acid diethylamide ,
DMT - 5 - methoxy - dimethyltryptamine , and
MDMA ( 3,4- methylenedioxy - N-methylamphetamine ) , commonly known as Ecstasy
All of these chemicals bare some resemblance to endogenous neurochemicals in the brain like dopabite , norepinehrine , sorotoni , and opiates .
DMT , a powerful psychedelic drug can also be produced naturally in the human brain .
The ritual use of these drugs and others in religious ceremonies is quite extensive .
In the 1950s and 1960s , these drugs had been used to treat more than forty thousand patients for a variety of illnesses and over one thousand papers describing these treatments had been published in peer review journals .
But then came the excesses of Timothy Lear and the hippies and the drugs became controlled substance , their use illegal in most countries ( Horgan 2003 ) .
It is not clear what we learn about religion and spirituality by using and studying these drugs .
Are they a shortcut to enlightenment or simply a drug - induced experience with no greater significance ?
Are other kinds of religious rituals and practice simply a different method for inducing these kinds of experiences that basically harness the brain ’s capacity to hallucinate ?
It is worth noting that we do discover some " form constants " in these drug - induced experiences , for instance , the recurrence of mandala - like geometric patterns in hallucinations ( Horgan 2003 ) .
Psychopharmacology is powerful stuff , so we should not be too dismissive .
A lot of drugs provide powerful relief for clinical depression , schizophrenia , and other ailments .
Drug companies continue research and invent / discover new compounds .
The implications of new spiritual drugs are intriguing and disconcerting .
One thought experiment proposed by my colleague Jeremy Sherman involved an imagined compound , Darnitol , that would disrupt the somatic nervous system , such that if you did not pay attention to your breathing and consciously will your breathing , you would soon die .
This imagined drug would have no side effects and would only last for a few hours .
No longer would a person need to spend years learning meditation techniques in a monastery .
A few hours with Darnitol and you would achieve instant satori ( or die ) ( Sherman 1999 ) .
Maybe mysticism , enlightenment , whatever you want to call it , is just a neurochemical state that can be induced by rigorous training in a meditative tradition or a simple pill taken on a Sunday afternoon .
5. Brain Development
It is important to remember that brains grow and evolve throughout life , but especially in childhood .
In the second year of life , the brain of a human baby is only about fifty percent developed .
The maximum size of a brain is reached in adolescence around the age of sixteen .
Different parts of the brain mature at different stages .
There are periods of high dendrite and synapse formation and other periods of pruning in which the number of neurons and synaptic connections are reduced .
Some neuronal connections are enhanced through the formation of lipid sheaths around the axions that speed and strengthen neural transmissions .
This process is known as myelination , the conversion of gray matter neurons into white matter neurons .
Myelinated neural connections play a much more important role in mental processes , than un-myelinated neural connections .
Humans have a universal dispositions to learn language , music , and religion , but the specific language , genre of music , and religious tradition is a matter of the geography and culture of birth .
Note that all religions also use music and language , so these connections may be more than incidental to the development of brains and religions .
It may be that adolescence is a particularly important time for the transmission of religion , that there is a neurological disposition and evolved expectation that cultures utilize .
This can be seen in the prevalence of rites of initiation .
Seventy percent of the cultures studied by anthropologists have some formal adolescent initiation practice .
Some are for males only .
Some are for females only .
Some are for both .
These rites of passage generally involve separation from family and community , seclusion , physical hardship , psychological stress , deprivation of food or water or sleep , sometimes also torture and body mutilation .
These initiation rites precede marriage , reproduction , and adult responsibilities and rights within the social group ( Alcorta 2006 ) .
It may be that those cultures that do not have a formal adolescent initiation ceremony do so at great risk to their wellbeing and survival .
Adolescents have a way of initiating themselves in the manner of Lord of the Flies or the Ragging rituals at Sri Lankan universities in the absence of a formal adult initiation ritual .
I think of the contrast between Thai Buddhism and Sri Lankan Buddhism .
In Thailand , it is the expectation and a matter of aristocratic honor that all pre-adolescent males spend a few years living and schooling inside the monastery , before returning to society .
There is no similar practice in the Sri Lankan Sangha , but conceivably it would be a useful practice to institute here .
Problems and Issues
There are a number of problems inherent in these neuroscientific studies of religious and spiritual phenomena .
First and foremost , religion is a complex neurocognitive experiences that include rituals , social groups , and a variety of other dimensions that are not easily replicated in a laboratory setting or isolated in individual human minds .
Nor is it clear that all religious experiences are neurologically comparable .
Talmudic studies , involving reading , analysis of text , and lively debate , may not be the least bit comparable to a Pentecostal experience of speaking in tongues .
The contemplative practices of a Sri Lankan Buddhist may not be comparable to Hindu Bhakti devotions .
Practicing Hatha yoga asanas in India may not be the same as Catholic self - flagellations at Good Friday observances in the Philippines .
Listening to Bach cantatas at a Protestant Church in Berlin may not be the same as listening to Gamelan music played at a village temple in Bali .
None of these phenomena are easily replicated in a laboratory .
Science necessarily tries to simplify in order to pursue manageable research .
Most of the neuroimaging studies focus on some kind of meditative or contemplative practice , simply because it would be hard to study anything else in a hospital radiology department .
A fuller taxonomy of religious experience needs to be developed , detailed , and correlated with different brain states .
Note that the list below are not necessarily discrete experiences and can be combined in any number of ways in actual religious persons :
Interpretative experiences : understanding some event on circumstance to be religiously significant , as in serendipity , synchronicity , good or bad fortune ; Quasi - sensory experiences : auditory or visual experiences of the divine ; Revelatory experiences : receiving some insight about ultimate reality ; Regenerative experiences : a healing or catharsis in which problems or anxiety dissipate ; Ethical - moral experiences : grasped by moral obligation to act in the face of suffering or injustice ; Aesthetic experiences : an intense spiritual experience of beauty in nature or art , music or ritual ; Intellectual experiences : an intense engagement in learning and problem - solving that takes on a spiritual dimension , for instance , in the moment of discovery or comprehension ; Ecstatic experiences : as in energetic devotional prayer , particularly in group context ; Numinous experiences : an encounter with Spirit that is Wholly - Other , being in the presence of God ; Oneness experiences : loss of distinction between self and world , non-dual sense of unity with God and the Universe .
Another problem in the neuroscientific study of religious and spiritual phenomena is the tendency to draw ontological conclusions from these studies , typically to either validate or disprove some religious doctrine .
This is philosophically bogus ; one cannot prove or disprove the existence of God by studying someone ’s brain .
A neurological correlation does not equal causation or ultimate explanation .
So what if Mohammad or Saint Paul had temporal lobe epilepsy .
If God wants to use that mechanism to transmit His revelation , than so be it .
Every thought we have , including scientific thoughts , also have measurable brain states .
We can study the brain of a physicist while working on equations with a SPECT scan .
We would learn lots of interesting things about the brain of a physicist , maybe generalizable to all physicists , perhaps also to all equations , but we would learn nothing about whether the physics was true .
Lets use a playful analogy and imagine what the neurosciences of sports might look like .
There are a lot of different sports and we cannot study them all , so we are going to simplify by only looking at cricket ( this being Sri Lanka ) .
Still cricket turns out to be really complicated , so we are going to need to simplify some more .
We are not going to pay attention to the business of cricket , to the rules of the game , to the social practices and enculturation of cricket as a sport among the youth , to the fanatical fans here , or to the complicate numerology of the sport .
It is just too much , so what we are going to focus on is the neurological correlates of cricket .
But whose cricket brain are we going to study , that of one of the boys from the Sunday pickup game in my village , or perhaps better , that of professional player of cricket on the national team ?
We assume that a neuroscientific study of a cricket exemplar will be more revealing , so we select Sanath Jayasuriya of the Sri Lankan National Team to be our subject for a neuro - imaging study of cricket , assuming that this is generalizable in some way to all cricket players , indeed to all sports .
Before the big match we outfit Sanath Jayasuriya with a remote control IV , so that we can inject him with radioactive tracers in the midst of batting one of his cut short shots during a big game .
He swings the bat and hits a big one , but unfortunately now we have to stop the game , in order to whisk Jayasuriya away to the laboratory , and put him into the SPECT scan .
Do n’t worry the game can resume in a half an hour , because we will have finished the scan and can begin our analysis comparing his base - state brain with his cricket - state brain .
No doubt , we would learn something interesting about Jayasuriya ’s brain , but we would be nowhere near understanding the phenomenon of cricket .
We would not know whether Jayasuriya ’s brain was the same as other cricket players ’ brains or for that matter the brains of other athletes playing other sports , say tennis , golf , or baseball .
It might be that brain scans of the fans watching the match would reveal the same neurological correlates , given the phenomenon of mirror neurons , but we would need to test this .
From a strictly neuro - reductionist point of view , we would not really know whether cricket was " real " or merely a " subjective " experience .
It seems like the object of cricket is more concrete and objective than the objects of religion , but is that really so .
You can take the neuroscientist to a cricket stadium and tell her behold , here is cricket .
As an outsider , she probably has not acquired an appreciation of the game and will not understand the complicated rules .
The object of cricket is to have fun , you might explain .
Our neuroscientist would then have to ask " what is fun " ?
Similarly I could also take the neuroscientist to the monastery , the temple , the church , the synagogue , or the mosque , and say behold here is religion .
But she would still ask what is the object of all this activity .
God , enlightenment , what ’s that ?
There is no " objective " reason , in either case , to divert so much time and energy , passion and skill , into either activity , cricket or religion .
So the neuroscientist postulates that maybe it has something to do with the brain states of cricket players and fans or the brain states of the religious believers , as the case may be ?
Let ’s push this reductio absurdum one step farther .
What is the objective reality of the brains of a neuroscientist while they do neuroscience ?
The British geneticist J.B.S. Haldane ( 1892 - 1964 ) came to the same conclusion in thinking about the brains of scientists in general :
It seems to me immensely unlikely that mind is a mere by - product of matter .
For if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain , I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true .
They may be sound chemically , but that does not make them sound logically .
And hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms .
In order to escape from this necessity of sawing away the branch on which I am sitting , so to speak , I am compelled to believe that mind is not wholly conditioned by matter ( Haldane [ 1927 ] 1932 ) .
As Buddhist philosopher Alan Wallace points out in his book The Taboo of Subjectivity , we still do not understand the mind :
Despite centuries of modern philosophical and scientific research into the nature of the mind , at present there is no technology that can detect the presence or absence of any kind of consciousness , for scientists do not even know what exactly is to be measured .
Strictly speaking , at present there is no scientific evidence even for the existence of consciousness !
All the direct evidence we have consists of nonscientific , first - person accounts of being conscious ( Wallace 2000 ) .
First - person accounts of anything do not count as adequate evidence in a court of law or in the sciences .
These need to be correlated and corroborated by other evidence .
The " I " can not be trusted .
Science leaves us with something like the Buddhist doctrine of anatman or no-self , but of course that is a subtle and paradoxical doctrine in Buddhism .
We have sawn off the branch on which we sit .
Perhaps we need to rethink science , and with it the neurosciences , from the bottom - up .
The Emergence of Mind
The problem is that science lacks an adequate metaphysics for incorporating both mind and matter .
Today , an informed metaphysics and philosophy of science needs to go beyond reductionism and materialism .
We cannot really talk about science anymore without discussing emergent properties of phenomena and different levels of organization .
The human brain is only one example of emergence in nature , but an extraordinary one to be sure .
A single neuron may be beautiful to the discerning eye of a neuroscientist , but it is pretty stupid all by itself .
The concept of emergence says simply that the whole is more than the sum of its parts .
We can learn a lot of interesting things about a brain cell by studying its parts and its chemistry .
A quick perusal of the typically heavy undergraduate textbook on neurosciences should be adequate to demonstrate just how much we have learned in the last century through this kind of reductionist approach .
That being said , the neuron itself could not be predicted or adequately described solely on basis of its constituent components .
Nor can a brain be adequately understood by listing its parts .
The human brain is an emergent phenomenon , both in its ontogeny – developmental biology -- and its phylogeny – evolutionary biology .
Mind is also an emergent phenomenon .
Mind cannot exist without a functional brain , but you could never predict consciousness on the basis of an exhaustive reductionistic description of the brain .
Nor does mind - brain really do anything by itself .
An isolated mind - brain would be a terrible waste .
To reach its potential , a mind - brain requires an entire body , vocal chords , oppositional thumbs , tools , languages , families , societies , cultures , and nature .
It is not just " soft " concepts like mind - from - brain that burst the reductionist dream of a mechanistic account of complex phenomena .
There are ample examples of emergent properties throughout the sciences .
From the surface tension of water in a glass to superfluidity and superconductivity in a physicist ’s lab , the behavior of huge numbers of particles cannot be deduced from the properties of a single atom or molecule .
In accepting the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1998 , Robert Laughlin notes :
The world is full of things for which one 's understanding , i.e. one 's ability to predict what will happen in an experiment , is degraded by taking the system apart , including most delightfully the standard model of elementary particles itself .
I myself have come to suspect most of the important outstanding problems in physics are emergent in nature , including particularly quantum gravity ( Laughlin 1998 ) .
A Musical Interlude
Let ’s imagine a scientific study of music , in this case of classical choral music .
Our case study will be Johann Sebastian Bach .
We will examine in scientific detail one of Bach ’s Cantatas , BWV 99 – " Was Gott tut , das ist wohlgetan " .
Our first approach will be to carefully examine the paper on which this cantata was written .
We will study the chemical composition of the paper and the ink in which the score was written .
We can also study the semiotic development of the notation system used and the music theory behind it .
This is all relevant to the subject matter , but it is not likely we will discover much of interest about Bach , his Cantata , or our experience of listening to it .
Another approach will be to study the physics of acoustics and the instrumentation .
This Cantata calls for string and wind instruments and of course a choir .
This is going to lead us into some interesting directions , including question about how the human ear and vocal chords function , but we are still not going to learn much about Bach or this Cantata .
Another approach will be neurological .
We will place you under a fMRI or PET Scan to try to ascertain through neuro - imaging analyses the effect of listening to this Cantata on your brain .
Technically , we are also going to have to do a lot of comparative work here to other sound perception and music perception studies , in order to isolate what is unique , if anything at all , to listening to this particular Cantata , as opposed to other sounds , musical pieces , and genres of music .
No doubt we might learn lots of interesting things , at least about your brain , because it is not clear yet that another subject , say a Chinese or Indonesian person unfamiliar with the genre or even the tonal structure , would have the same neurological experience when listening to this Bach cantata .
Another approach would be to employ a mathematical analysis of the music itself .
With Bach , in particular , there is clearly not only a musical genius composing , but also a mathematical genius .
So this might lead to some interesting insights , including now computer programs that can generate " original " scores in Bach ’s style .
We could also take a historical approach , considering Bach ’s life and time , the musical influences , his biography , his musical and perhaps mathematical genius .
This may be more instructive than studying the chemical properties of the paper on which the Cantata was written or the physics and physiology of acoustics .
Here the level of analysis better fits the topic , not that the physics and physiology are wrong or uninteresting in themselves .
A scientific study of the cantata would surely also reflect on the philosophical , religious and theological significance of this Cantata , compare it to the other 200 cantatas that Bach wrote for the liturgical calendar and wonder about Bach ’s own religious beliefs .
What does it mean to assert " Was Gott tut , das ist wohlgetan " – " what God does is done well " .
How does the music reinforce the message ?
What influence does Bach ’s music and theology have on us today .
How do we feel when we listen to this song or perform it ?
Our scientific analysis of a single song by Bach can be posed on many different levels , lead us in many different directions , including into interpretative humanistic disciplines not normally thought of as scientific .
Furthermore , none of these directions and levels of analysis necessarily conflict with each other .
The only problems arise when we insist on a single , valid level of analysis to the exclusion of others .
For instance , a neuroscientist might insist that brain science is the only valid level of understanding the phenomena of Bach ’s music .
In this discussion of a new science of music , we see many intriguing parallels and problems common to the proposed new sciences of religion .
The Emergence of Transcendence
We need to employ the concepts of emergence in science in order to go further in this inquiry .
There is ontological emergence in nature and with it different levels of reality and different practices appropriate at each level .
Emergence should place philosophical limits on the claims of social scientists to reductionistically explain away religion ( or for that matter any other complex human or natural phenomena ) .
A scientist might find correlations , say , between the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism ( to reference Max Weber ) , but this does not mean causation .
A scientist might also establish a functional outcome , say Orthodox Jewish marriage practices leading to maximal human fertility and reproduction , but this does not exhaust the meaning of what it means to be an Orthodox Jew , which might best be understood on a completely different level of analysis .
A scientist might establish that activity in the right temporal lobes correspond to the experience of the presence of God , but this does not mean that they have located or explained the reality of God .
A robust understanding of emergence , and with it different levels of analysis and interpretation , opens up a possibility space within the mind and soul of the scientific enterprise for religious notions of transcendence , the God - by - whatever - Name mystery .
Contemporary science is actually more suggestive of some notion of transcendence than it is of atheistic materialism , whatever that means .
There is a cultural lag in absorbing these insights on both sides of the religion - science divide .
Caveat emptor – buyer beware .
Just because nature turns out to be super , fantastically super , does not mean that it is supernatural .
And while much of science is also fantastically strange , this does not mean that every supernatural belief and practice humans have or have had is therefore true .
Just because quantum mechanics is weird does not mean that every weird idea that people come up with is true , even if it is dressed up with the patina of quantum mechanics .
Just because there is ontological emergence of novelty in the evolution of the universe does not mean every novel notion that people invent is true .
In the name of religion and spirituality people also make the same mistake of reducing all phenomena to a single analytic framework .
The concept of emergence creates a possibility space for a lot of strange beliefs and practices – the i-Ching , the Bible - code , Reike , the Book of Revelations , astrology – but it does not mean that any of this stuff is , in fact , true .
Indeed , it can be patently false if interpreted at certain levels , as Young Earth Creationists do when promoting an alternative natural history of the planet based on uninformed Biblical literalism and no serious understanding of science .
The Bible is not true ; it is profound .
Dangers and Opportunities
There is a lot of exciting research still to be done and some brilliant people devoting themselves to this research .
There are enormous benefits to be realized on the road ahead .
For instance , all traditions recognize that there is religious deviance , they just do n’t agree on how to classify it .
Neuroscientific research may give us better tools for distinguishing between pathological religious persons and normal , healthy religious persons .
This discussion today has also already prompted a number of observations about possible reforms that would strengthen Sri Lankan Buddhism .
I note also that many of the Western neuroscientists who are inspired to study religious experiences in the brain are themselves practicing Buddhists .
There is an appreciation among neuroscientists that Buddhists in particular have been conducting consciousness research for over 2500 years and that Buddhism has something to teach the scientists on this account .
There are also some dangers that we should recognize .
The neurosciences can be used ideologically to denigrate religion , as was the case in the psychiatric community in the early years of the profession .
More worrisome is that the neurosciences may provide insights that might make religious euphoria easily obtained or religious brain - washing easily manipulated .
This danger applies not just to drugs , but any full proof technique that can guarantee religious ecstasy or obedience .
The notion than someone might take a pill and achieve eternal bliss without any side effects might well spell the end of our species ’ evolution and quite possibly our extinction .
It is not clear what we would do if everyone were happy and euphoric all the time , one with the Universe , what Newberg called Absolute Unitary Being .
What would motivate us to struggle and be creative ?
( Horgan 2003 )
Sometimes getting what we want is really bad .
I take comfort , and of course some pain , in a faith that we will never really understand the human mind - brain , certainly not in a way that we can mechanistically control or easily transform to some desired end .
The mind - brain is just too complicated with too many feedback loops to expect certain results ( Grassie 2007 ) .
The mind - brain is an example of a complex distributed system , extremely powerful and creative , but because of its complexity , not something that can be understood and controlled .
In the end , we will be saved from ourselves by our complexity , which does not mean that people wo n’t be trying to discover or invent the fountain of youth and the key to eternal happiness ( Lanier 1999 ) .
I note that Buddhism claims to be such a foolproof technique , but after over 2500 years , samsara continues .
We have not all achieved nibanna and are unlikely to do so .
It is perhaps the questing after rather than the actual achievement of enlightenment that is most wholesome and transformative aspect of religion .
In that quest , there is no reason not to invite science , including the neurosciences , along for the ride .
We have a lot to learn from each other .
In closing , it is worth recalling the words of William James ( 1842-1910 ) :
Let empiricism once become associated with religion , as hitherto , through some strange misunderstanding , it has been associated with irreligion , and I believe that a new era of religion as well as philosophy will be ready to begin ...
I fully believe that such an empiricism is a more natural ally than dialectics ever were , or can be , of the religious life .
( 1909/1977 , 142 )
Empirical research on religious and spiritual phenomena is not only healthy for each of our traditions separately , it will also help us better understand each other in an increasingly globalized religious world .
James writes that a science of religion " can offer mediation between different believers , and help to bring about consensus of opinion " ( 1902/1985 , 456 ) .
Instead of religion being something that divides us , more and better religion can be something that unites us , here on the Kandy - Peradeniya Road and throughout the world .
The neurosciences of religion certainly help us along that road .

Lost is a timeless story of good vs evil , personal choice vs. slavery , and freedom vs. fate .
As we were told in the beginning by John Locke , ‘ two sides , one light , one dark ’ .
The Light Side , as you can probably guess , is the side of Good , Freedom , & personal choice .
On the Light Side we have Jacob .
Jacob is the personification of good .
His character is based on an archetype that has popped up in every culture and religion since the beginning of time ( see Divine Comedy , Paradise Lost , New Testament , Star Wars , and so on ) .
He is compassionate .
He is omniscient .
He is optimistic .
He invites you to his Island .
He lives on the beach , having nothing to hide .
He believes in and practices personal freedom .
He believes in evolution , growth , change , and free will .
But Jacob wants YOU to WANT to change .
He will give you ‘ little pushes ’ along the way , like the Apollo Candy Bar stuck in the snack machine , and help you get to the point where YOU are ready to change .
He does not lie to you or trick you into making the right choice for the wrong reason .
He does not give orders , he ASKS .
He asks Sawyer if he wants a pen .
He asks Sayid for directions .
He asks Jack if the extra candy bar is his .
He asks Kate if she ’ll steal again .
He tells Hurley he has a choice .
He ‘ offers ’ Sun & Jin his blessing .
Even when faced with certain death , Jacob tells
Ben that he has a choice , that he is not a slave , no matter what Fake Locke has told him .
This is a man who does not compromise his principles .
They are bedrock .
We can analyze what has happened and know if he ’s involved based on the method and the motive ( more of that later ) .
Most importantly though , Jacob wants wholesale change .
He wants mankind to change .
He is looking for a macro-event .
This evolutionary completion is the ‘ only ends once ’ scenario that Jacob speaks of on the beach .
Everything else is just progress , mankind inching closer to mass enlightenment .
But there is opposition .
Thus we have the Dark Side .
Nemesis is the personification of evil .
His character is based on the timeless archetype of the mischievous trickster .
He is not omniscient , rather , he relies on the tools and techniques of man .
He believes mankind will not change .
He is pessimistic .
He is fatalistic .
He believes the same cycle will repeat , repeat , repeat , repeat .... no change whatsoever .
He thinks men will continue to crumble in the face of great challenges , due to ambition , greed , guilt , vengeance , and weakness .
But he is not passive like Jacob .
Nemesis gets involved .
Nemesis tests you .
Nemesis tempts you .
He learns your weakness and exploits it .
Should he present you with a test you ’ve failed in the past , and you demonstrate a capacity for change , you are a threat to him .
He does not want change to happen .
This is his argument with Jacob .
Nemesis ’ only code is that he has no code .
He will lie , cheat , steal , kill , and mass - murder .
He will haunt you with your dead relatives .
He will exploit you emotionally and psychologically .
He finds your weakness and applies pressure .
If you ’re strong , you must be eliminated ... Nemesis can’t have agents of change running around , helping man progress .
Nemesis applies this same technique to groups of people .
If Nemesis should encounter your group , he will find the weakness .
He will test everyone in it , kill the strong , and promote the weak .
Infiltrate , divide , conquer , exterminate , assimilate the remaining weak people into a group and hand them orders to follow .
Nemesis has one goal in mind : change must not happen .
Thus , we now know the methods of the opposing sides .
The Light Side hopes that you ’ll make the right decision on your own and gives you the space to do so .
The Dark Side will not see around and hope you screw up , The Dark Side makes SURE you have every opportunity to fail .
He stacks the deck .
He baits you .
He tricks you .
He CHEATS .
He will do whatever he can to avoid the ‘ only ends once ’ mass - evolution of man scenario that Jacob assures him is unavoidable .
The duality of this conflict is represented in every layer of the show and has been embedded from the start .
As the following will demonstrate , the writers have not been winging it ... we can all exhale .
Change vs Fate has been there from day one .
Charlie the drug addict writes ‘ fate ’ on his knuckles
The Dharma Initiative ’s stated goal is to change one number in The Valenzetti Equation , an equation that supposedly predicts the end of the world .
They attempt a multi- pronged attack in various scientific fields , each of which seeks change in said field .
In Room 23 , where Karl was being held , they try to change your mind .
They recondition Polar Bears to live in the tropic .
They experiment with time - travel .
They experiment with The Hawthorne effect , hoping that observation will change the outcome .
It ’s also important to note , that while there was a lot of building about this scary interrogator in the jungle , they do not torture .
They just set you free a little bit and you do the talking .
They also vote and confer with each other about major decisions .
They do not have a dictatorship , they are peaceful ... it ’s practically a hippie resort .
They are science , they are progress , they are change , and they are aligned with The Light Side .
They are agents of change .
Thus , for Nemesis , they are a threat .
The Others hate change and choice and personal freedom .
They believe in fate and following orders without asking questions .
Just ask Ms. Hawking , former leader of The Others , and she ’ll tell you that everyone is doomed , that the cycle is perpetual .
She believes in this so much that she does n’t attempt to avoid shooting her own son( Faraday in 1977 ) even though she ’s well aware that her actions will directly lead to it eventually happening .
She wants Desmond to press the button ... again , and again , and again , and again .
The Others do not like change and similarly , they do not like visitors .
One of their primary objectives is to ‘ protect the Island ’ by keeping people away and keeping people from leaving .
They want to slow progress down to a halt .
They want to stop change dead in it ’s tracks .
The Others are the weaklings of every group who has come to the Island , hand - selected for their inability to question orders and their lack of fortitude .
There is no room for personal choice with The Others , you follow the rules , you obey your superior officer , because as Bonnie states in Through The Looking Glass ‘ the minute I start questioning orders , this whole thing , everything that we 're doing here , falls apart . ’
The Others put Nemesis ’ methods into practice .
They wear beards and trick you .
They lie cheat and steal .
They have Ethan infiltrate you .
They kidnap your child and use him as leverage .
They figure out your weakness , like Jack ’s feelings for Kate , and they apply pressure .
They manipulate you .
The methods of Benjamin Linus are the methods of Nemesis .
The Others are , and always have been , aligned with The Dark Side .
Ahh but I can hear your thoughts already ... if they follow Jacob , how are they on The Dark Side ?
Simple .
They ’re not following Jacob and they never were following him .
Jacob has nothing to do with The Others .
Jacob does not give orders , Jacob let ’s you choose .
You can even choose the wrong path if you want , but it ’s your choice .
So why is it so many of The Others think they ’re following Jacob ?
To answer that , I first have to tell you a story about a literal and figurative ‘ loophole ’
In 1954 , John Locke walks up to Richard Alpert and informs him that he ’s from the future , that Jacob sent him , and that he is Richard ’s leader .
Richard ’s eyes light up at the mention of Jacob .
This is the birth of the loophole .
For the first time in the history of the conflict , Nemesis is now able to level the playing field ( for the moment , humor me and pretend that Nemesis knows everything that Richard Alpert knows ) .
He has been fighting a losing battle , going to war with a combatant who knows the future and thus ca n’t be blind - sided or plotted against .
How do you win when your opponent knows everything that will happen ?
Thanks to time - travel , Nemesis now has the same abilities , albeit they are limited .
He now can look into the future .
He knows when John Locke will be born .
This is his first , but not last , fruit from the tree of knowledge .
Daniel Faraday time - jumps to 1977 and hands his mother , Eloise Hawking , a journal detailing all of the events of the next 30 years ( This is a rather cheap plot device , how does the journal not reset and become empty ?
It ’s just like the compass and we have no choice but to accept it as rational ) .
It details every single aspect of The Dharma Initiative , a foe that The Others dismantle at the seams .
Nemesis , like Jacob in his battle with Nemesis , is now one step ahead of The Dharma Initiative .
In turn , Nemesis can now prove to his people , his army of weaklings , that he has communication with a divine source .
He tells them that in 2004 a man named John Locke will crash onto the Island .
He has the flight manifest from Faraday ’s journal .
He knows everyone on board .
He expands his operations .
He follows all of the survivors of Oceanic 815 from birth to 2004 .
He knows their weaknesses .
He knows how to tempt them .
He knows how to test them .
He knows how to manipulate them .
Nemesis has found a way to be omniscient , and he uses this phony power to control The Others .
They never meet Jacob , they never see Jacob , but they trust that Jacob is real and they ’ve learned that Jacob knows everything .
Jacob is not to be questioned .
As Mikhail says ‘ the man who brought us here is a great , wise man ’ .
But it is n’t Jacob .
This is why Ben does not heal .
This is why Jaocb says ‘ what about you ? ’ to Ben .
Ben was never working for Jacob .
Jacob does n’t give orders , Nemesis does .
So how does Nemesis get his orders out to his weak - minded followers ?
Well we ’ve learned that Ben Linus has never met ‘ Jacob ’ , but rather , receives lists ( now you know where the lists come from ... phony - omniscience and intel gathering ) and orders supposedly passed down from Jacob to Richard Alpert .
Thus we know that Nemesis has infiltrated the very top of The Others ’ power structure .
This leaves us with two options .
Either Richard Alpert , like the rest of The Others , has been deceived , or he is a willing participant .
I have bad news everyone , we ’ve been duped , it ’s the second option .
Richard Alpert is not only working for Nemesis .... Richard Alpert IS Nemesis .
One of your first thoughts ( other than ‘ what the @# & $ ’ ) is that we ’ve seen Nemesis , imitating John Locke , having a conversation with Richard Alpert .
How can one Nemesis be two people simultaneously ?
In order for me to prove Richard Alpert is Nemesis , I must first prove that Nemesis is more than one person .
I call them Team Nemesis .
Dante ’s ‘ Nemesis ’ in ‘ The Divine Comedy ’ is a 3 - headed monster , representing the ‘ inverted Christian Trinity ’ , who cannot create life and thus imitates life .
It is a trickster .
It lies and cheats .
Notice this quote from Mikhail to John Locke in Enter 77 .
Mikhail : Ha !
Do n't waste your time .
For ten years I have tried to defeat that game .
But it was programmed by three grand masters .
And it cheats ’.
Three grand masters who cheat .
That , my friends , is Team Nemesis , aka The Dark Side , aka the bad guys .
Rousseau ’s team arrives and is baited into entering the Smoke Monster ’s hole .
Rousseau does not enter .
Later , supposedly due to a sickness which makes them ‘ not themselves ’ , Rousseau is forced to kill all three of them .
One of them is the father of the baby growing in her womb .
He tries to kill her .
He tells her the Smoke Monster is not a threat and is merely ‘ a highly sophisticated security system ’ for the Island .
Three people simultaneously ‘ not themselves ’ after meeting the Smoke Monster .
The sickness ?
There is none .
They are not the same 3 people .
They are being imitated , simultaneously .
Rousseau knew it was n’t the father of her child , she could detect a difference ... much like John Locke seemed very ‘ un - Locke - like ’ to all of us during this past season .
Nemesis is not one man , Nemesis is Team Nemesis .
This is why Radzinsky named the Smoke Monster as Cerberus .
Here ’s a picture of Cerberus : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RomanCerberus.JPG
So now we know that Nemesis can be more than one person , thus Richard Alpert is a candidate for review .
There is significant evidence that Alpert is in fact , part of Team Nemesis .
For starters , Richard Alpert is ‘ as old as the island itself ’ .
Well we know for a fact that only two other characters in Lost can make that claim , them being Jacob & Nemesis .
We know they were around when The Black Rock arrived and it ’s safe to assume they were around for many years before that .
Also , like Jaocb , Richard Alpert does not age .
Alpert explains ‘ I 'm this way because of Jacob . ’
We assume of course that Jacob somehow blessed Alpert the gift of eternal life .
Yet Alpert does not communicate with Jacob .
Alpert get ’s blindsided by a Fake Locke .
Alpert gives orders and runs an organization that stand in stark contrast to Jacob ’s principles .
How is it that Alpert got the gift of eternal life and spends every day of it undermining the very man who supposedly gave him this gift ????
He does n’t .
The reason Richard Alpert does n’t age is because he is a Nemesis .
He is imitating a person long since dead .
Notice in LaFleur that Richard Alpert storms into the Dharma barracks and leaves with a dead body ( Paul , Amy ’s husband ) .
We ’re told that this is to convince his people that there were losses on both sides .
This is not the case .
Richard Alpert needed Paul ’s body .
Nemesis needed Pauls ’ identity .
Nemesis needed to apply pressure to a weak link in the Dharma chain .
Sure , there remains the slight possibility that Alpert was just following orders , but combined with the fact he does n’t age , I think it ’s more than likely he is in fact one third of the 3 headed beast , Dante ’s ‘ Inverted Christian Trinity ’ ... this phrase will prove to be very important , remember it .
Team Nemesis will stop at nothing to make you crack .
If they can access your dead father ’s body , they will imitate him and lure you into the jungle and over a cliff .
If they can access your dead brother , they will lure you into the jungle for you to be slammed against a tree .
They use living relatives as well .
Juliet ’s sister ’s health is used to leverage her .
Walt is used to control Michael .
Aaron .
They never stop attacking and they know where to strike .
For Dharma , the two weak links are Amy and Young Ben Linus .
Team Nemesis knows this , for who has ventured out into the dark territory ?
Ben literally tells Richard Alpert that he wants out , that he hates everyone ... he is a scared defenseless angry little boy and Team Nemesis pounces on him ruthlessly .
The appropriate pressure is applied .
And how is this done ?
Using Ben ’s dead mother , Emily .
I have no idea how Team Nemesis got access to her body in order to imitate it , but this is what happened .
This is why Ben says his mother , who died during childbirth , taught him how to read .
He was not kidding .
His mother has been whispering in his ear and shaping his mind .
But it was n’t her , it was Team Nemesis .
Team Nemesis is calling the shots .
Team Nemesis ordered the Purge .
Team Nemesis and Ben ’s dead mother convinced him to kill his father .
It was practice .
Years later , Ben would be asked to kill his father yet again , when Fake Locke and Team Nemesis order him to execute Jacob .
The cycle repeats .
Twice , a dead relative gets Ben Linus to kill his father .
Twice , a purge is ordered afterward to clean up the mess .
Repeat , repeat , repeat , repeat .
This is a sign of Team Nemesis .
They perpetuate the cycle .
They use the same technique again and again .
They have perfected their craft .
So where did the body for Richard Alpert come from ?
Here ’s another pattern .
Yemi is a dead body from an Island - bound vessel .
Christian is a dead body from an Island - bound vessel .
Locke is a dead body from an Island - Bound vessel .
This is the protocol that Hawking knows to follow ( Protocol , as in something to be repeated without change ... it ’s amazing how these themes are embedded into the show ) .
There have been hints that Richard is somehow connected to The Black Rock .
I believe that the original Richard Alpert was a dead body on an island - bound vessel , The Black Rock , and his body was used to torment and manipulate it ’s inhabitants .
Anyways , back to Team Nemesis .
Perhaps you disagree but at this point I ’m rather convinced that Nemesis is a 3 - headed foe and that Richard Alpert is one of the three prongs .
But what is this Nemesis ?
Well for starters , it ’s The Smoke Monster .
We can connect the Smoke Monster directly to Nemesis in many ways .
For starters , on the wall in The Smoke Monster ’s chamber , we have an image of the god Anubis battling The Smoke Monster :
http://www.forareasonblog.com/2009/04/11/anubis-and-the-smoke-monster-hieroglyphics/
Here we have our 2 sides yet again , Light & Dark .
Notice the outstretched hand of Anubis , a peaceful offering .
Notice the horns of the smoke monster , the devil , the inverted trinity , on the left , the side of the evil .
This is a picture of Jacob and The Smoke Monster .
They literally drew us a picture of the two sides .
However , let ’s be thorough .
There are more ways to connect Nemesis to The Smoke Monster .
For starters , Nemesis , imitating Locke , knows where The Smoke Monster is when Ben can’t find it .
He leads Ben into it ’s inner chamber .
The Smoke Monster appears .
A dead relative chokes Ben into following orders .
Clearly The Smoke Monster is on Team Nemesis .
An imitated Yemi( ‘ you speak to me as if I am your brother ) leads Mr. Eko to the Smoke Monster , who then gets smashed into pieces .
An imitated Christian leads Jack into the jungle ( guess who lives there , sneaking around amongst the trees ) away from the beach ( guess who lives there , out in the open with nothing to hide ) .
An imitated Emily Linus leads Ben out from the safety of the Dharma barracks , into the dark territory , beyond the sonar fence , where he meets the now very suspect Richard Alpert .
A backwards speaking Walt , while under the control of The Others ( Dark Side ) , leads Shannon into the jungle , where she meets her demise .
Repeat repeat repeat , over and over .
The more the cycle continues , the slower Jacob ’s ‘ progress ’ advances .
Progress , however , has it ’s down side .
Just when you ’ve turned that corner , there ’s a catch .
When you change , you die .
Notice the theme :
- Eko comes to peace with his past , builds a church , lives nobly .
He dies .
- Boone has a vision and gets over Shannon .
He dies .
- Shannon opens up her heart to Sayid and watches Vincent , becoming unselfish .
She dies .
- Roger Linus promises to celebrate Ben ’s birthday next year , wants quality time .
He dies .
- Charlie kicks his drug habit .
He dies .
- Ana Lucia puts the gun down , unwilling to kill again .
She dies .
- Michael takes responsibility for his actions .
He dies .
- Faraday reconsiders his stance on fate and changing the past .
He dies .
- Libby gets over the death of her husband and finds love again .
She dies .
- Charlotte is finally home to stay , no more searching and digging .
She dies .
- Nikki & Paulo ( who gives a shit !) overcome greed , he hid the diamonds to keep her .
They die .
- John Locke ..... hold that thought for later .
Thus we have a clear golden rule of Lost , and it ’s a very big deal .
When you confront your ‘ issue ’ and actually CHANGE , you die .
Why is this important ?
Because Jacob is telling us that mankind will change .
What happens if mankind changes ?
You guessed it .
Mankind goes bye - bye .
‘ It only ends once ’ .
This is why Hawking and The Others are always saying that they are ‘ saving the world ’ , as it stated in the ad that both Mikhail & Kelvin responded to ( In case you ’re wondering , Radsinsky is a part of the Dark Side .
He gives orders .
He kills people .
He presses the button ) .
That is why some of the people are willing to follow orders .
The progress we are progressing towards is extinction .
So our conflict has taken an interesting turn .
The Others , those mass - murdering lying - cheating - stealing manipulative bastards , and Team Nemesis , that 3 - headed monster from hell who will mimic your dead mother until you ’re bleeding from every orifice , are actually fighting against the end of the world .
This is a timeless story that has been told many times throughout the history of man .
Plato , Dante , the Qur’an .
Evil loses and the world ends .
That is why we ’ve been following the journey of our beloved Losties .
As they make wholesale changes , they will be the agents of change that bring about the ‘ only ends once ’ scenario that Jacob accurately predicted .
This means they will all face their own issues , overcome them , change , and die .
It ’s going to be a very painful final season for all of us .
And it ’s going to end with a white flash as the world with evil in it comes to an end and the side of the Light wins .
Damon Lindelof : ‘ I promise you the series will not end with a black screen ’ .
No Damon , it wo n’t , but thanks for doing what you ’ve always done , and rubbed our faces in it .
It ’s going to end with a WHITE screen .
So now we can predict within reason what will be happening to our beloved Losties .
They will face their issues and die .
But what are their issues ?
Jacob has told us .
Jacob is guiding them towards this outcome .
He gives ‘ little pushes ’ , passively helping them out , strengthening them for their big test , years in advance .
Remember it has to be their choice to change and overcome their issues .
We can learn what our Losties issues are by evaluating what aspect of them Jacob was trying to help them change .
It ’s pretty obvious when you watch the scenes .
Sun & Jin have too often put their marriage on the back burner .
Jin works a nightmarish job and never sees Sun .
Sun stays on the helicopter without Jin on it .
Jin tells Locke to convince
Sun that he ’s dead .
What ‘ blessing ’ does Jacob ‘ offer ’ ?
Never take your marriage for granted .
He is strengthening their commitment muscles for a later decathlon of the soul .
He is helping them change .
By the way , Sun & Jin , symbolically , will demonstrate their commitment to each other in the ultimate way .
They will choose to change together and then they will die together .
Sun & Jin are Adam & Eve( Adam & Eve were discovered during House Of The Rising Sun , the first Jin & Sun-centric episode .
Watch it and you ’ll agree that they are Adam & Eve ) .
Hurley has always considered himself cursed .
He has willed himself into a state of paranoia .
Jacob visits him to tell him that he has a personal choice ( of course ) to come back to the Island or not .
But he also suggests that Hurley is n’t cursed , that perhaps he ’s blessed .
There is no greater way for Hurley to change , to demonstrate that he considers himself blessed , to prove that he is ok with his life ... than for Hurley to broadcast the numbers .
He will choose to change and he will broadcast the numbers and he will die .
Sawyer ’s entire life has been dedicated to finding the man who killed his parents and enacting revenge .
Yes , he did pull the trigger in Australia .
Yes , he did kill Cooper on the Island .
This is the cycle , the repetition , that needs to be broken .
Jacob comforts Sawyer .
He tells him he ’s sorry about his parents dying .
He offers him a pen .
He ’s trying to help Sawyer let it out and get over it .
This scene is the perfect example of the opposing philosophies of Lost .
Notice what Sawyer ’s Uncle Doug says to Sawyer after Jacob leaves : ‘ You gotta move on , boy .
They 're gone , and there ain't nothing you can do to change that .
What 's done is done . ’
What ’s done is done .
Fate .
You ca n’t change .
This is the opposing force to change perfectly captured .
The writers have been doing this from the first episode , re-watch the series , it ’s EVERYWHERE .
Minus production errors , drunk actors & network issues , they ’ve done an incredible job .
They knew what they were doing from the start and they have stuck to the rules .
You can exhale now :)
Kate has always taken things .
She takes lunchboxes , she takes lives , she takes babies .
What does Jacob ask her ( and as always , he asks ) ?
He asks her to stop stealing .
He uses honey instead of vinegar .
Instead of punishment he offers salvation .
He has planted a seed , and it will sprout roots next season .
Kate will choose to change , Kate will return something to it ’s rightful owner ( Aaron to Claire ) , and Kate will die .
In fact , Claire will kill her .
More on that later .
And now , Jack .
Our supposed hero .
Poor Jack , beaten down by his father Christian over the years .
Jacob tells
Jack that the Apollo Bar stuck in the vending machine just ‘ needed a little push ’ .
Jacob was trying to teach Jack that Christian was just giving him little pushes .
Jack ’s issue is forgiving his father .
Jack will choose to change and will forgive Christian .
And he will die .
Here ’s the problem : Claire and Christian are both dead .
Who will Kate be giving Aaron to ?
Who will Jack be hugging ?
First , let ’s prove Claire is dead .
By now we know how Smokie operates .
One of his favorite tricks is using your dead relatives .
And what is Claire ’s issue ?
What defines Claire ?
I went to Lostpedia just to read about her .
It says she is frequently tested with motherhood .
That sounds about right does n’t it ?
Twice , she almost loses Aaron , once to adoption , and once to Ethan .
She protects him , keeps him by her side .
She was warned not to let him be ‘ raised by an Other ’ .
So who is on the very short list of people she would give Aaron to , who also happens to be on the Island ?
Christian Shephard , Aaron ’s Grandfather , now being imitated as part of Team Nemesis .
This is why Aaron was left on the floor of the jungle .
Claire changed , she gave up Aaron , and she died .
This is why she is just palling around with Christian in the cabin , not worried about Aaron at all , having a tea party and laughing at John Locke for thinking he was being ‘ chosen ’ by Jacob .
She did n’t die in the barracks explosion , she was killed in the jungle .
She chose to change and her story came full circle .
Claire Littleton is dead .
And now Jack .
Typing this right now , fully understanding his character and his journey , it breaks my heart .
The writers have really screwed us on this one .
I ca n’t say it ’s not brilliant though .
Before I tell you who kills Jack , first I must explain why Jack must die .
Earlier I referenced Dante ’s 3 - headed monster .
The 3 headed monster represents the ‘ inverted Christian Trinity ’ .
I read this in a neat little book called Good & Evil In Myth & Legend .
Check it out , it covers most of Lost in the first 20 pages .
Anyways , think about that phrase .
Inverted Christian Trinity .
Inverted Christian .
Three of them .
Three inversions .
Right now we ’ve established two of Christian ’s family are being imitated by Team Nemesis .
Two Inverted Christians .
Claire & Christian .
Jack is the third .
He will be killed .
He will be imitated .
The Smoke Monster , aka Cerberus , aka The Three Headed Monster , aka Team Nemesis , aka The Dark Side ... during Season 6 ... will be Jack , Claire & Christian ( were the cigarettes in his hotel room a clue that he ’s Smokie or what ?
Let alone him setting off the smoke detector ) .
Jack .
His tattoos read ‘ he who walks among us but is not one of us ’ .
Those damn writers , they knew it all along .
He is going to be imitated .
He will be the face of evil in Season 6 .
Jack will embrace Christian , forgiving him , choosing to change .
But it ’s the inverted Christian .
It ’s part of Team Nemesis .
He will probably hug his father only to get a knife in the gut .
Buy your tissues NOW .
This is the creative device that the writers will be using in Season 6 .
We will not know who to trust .
Kate will be handing Aaron ( how does he get back ?
No clue ) back to an inverted Claire aka Team Nemesis .
She will choose to change and she will die .
Kate has no idea that there ’s a clone - monster running around imitating people .
Bet your ass it happens .
But here ’s how Team Nemesis dies .
Early in the season we are going to be shown a scene from later in the story .
In it , John Locke will be killing Jack Shephard .
We will all assume that John Locke is the evil inverted imitated Nemesis version of John Locke , and that Jack Shephard is the good ol ’ doctor .
But since we now know that Jack has to die , to complete the Inverted Christian Trinity , it is n’t Jack .
And Locke is back to being Locke .
He will be resurrected for the third time ( fell from building , literally rose up after 815 crashed ) .
This has been his destiny .
Resurrected Locke will kill Nemesis Jack .
Locke will have changed and become something .
Do n’t tell him what he can’t do , he just killed the FUCKING DEVIL !
And so we have our two sides , Light vs Dark , Jacob vs Nemesis / Smokie / Cerberus , Dharma vs The Others , Freedom vs Slavery , Change vs Fate , Asking vs Ordering , White Pillars of Smoke in every Locke dream vs. Black Pillars of Smoke , The Beach vs The Dark Territory , Visions / Dreams vs Dead Relatives , Candy Bars vs. Mass - Murder , Omniscience vs. Time - Loopholes , Locke vs Jack , Faith vs Science .
I think it ’s an utter work of genius .
Just think about it .
Christian said ‘ TheRed Sox would never win the World Series ’ .
He ’s a fatalist .
He ’s an Other .
The Red Sox break the curse , progress , change .
Every episode is embedded with the conflict .
They ’ve extended the argument to every aspect of humanity .
Can you time - travel and change the past ?
Can you overcome your drug addiction ?
Can you open up your heart ?
Can you stop torturing people ?
Yes , you can .
You can change .
Everyone can change .
We can change together and start a new world .
Unfortunately , in order for that to happen , the old one has to die .
And then it all starts over again .
Versteckte Kameras im Wald Peter Muehlbauer
Jäger statten ihre Reviere möglicherweise datenschutzwidrig mit Überwachungsvorrichtungen aus
So genannte " Wildkameras " sollten Tiere aufnehmen .
In der Praxis finden sich auf den Aufnahmen freilich auch Menschen .
Diese Erfahrung machte ein Jäger , der an einer Lockfutterstelle im Gemeindewald der hessischen Ortschaft Niedernhausen heimlich abgelichtet wurde .
Ans Licht kam dieser Vorfall , weil ein anderer Jäger , der die Kamera angebracht hatte , die Fotos hergezeigt haben und dabei über den Aufgenommenen hergezogen sein soll .
Als dem dieses zu Ohren kam , beauftragte er den Rechtsanwalt Franz Josef Jung , der trotz seiner Tätigkeit als Bundesverteidigungsminister Zeit fand , vom Anbringer der Kamera nicht nur die Herausgabe der Aufnahmen , sondern auch die der verwendeten Speichermedien zu verlangen .
Nachdem der Fall so eine politische Dimension erhalten hatte , befassten sich unter anderem die Obere Jagdbehörde beim Regierungspräsidium Kassel und das für Datenschutz zuständige Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt mit ihm .
Während die Oberen Jagdbehörde in ihrem Gutachten davon ausging , dass die Wildkameras mit solchen auf privaten Grundstücken vergleichbar seien und lediglich Hinweisschilder empfahl , kam die Datenschutzstelle zum Schluss , dass eine private Kamerabeobachtung im öffentlicher Raum Wald " grundsätzlich unzulässig " sei .
Einer Geld - oder Freiheitsstrafe könne der Anbringer einer Kamera deshalb nur dann entgehen , wenn diese mit sehr niedriger Auflösung arbeite , so dass darauf keine Personen identifiziert , sondern höchstens zwischen verschiedenen Tierarten unterschieden werden könne .
Weil der Datenschutzstelle auffiel , dass es sich offenbar nicht um einen Einzelfall handelt , will sie nun auch mit Behörden in anderen Bundesländern über ein weiteres Vorgehen in der Waldüberwachungsfrage beraten .
Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft : Lobbyisten auf Sendung
Die Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft kommt in der ARD häufig zu Wort.
Der Sender verheimlicht die Nähe der Talkgäste zur neoliberalen Lobbygruppe .
Die Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) ist bekannt für ihre intransparente PR - Arbeit .
Legendär wurde die neoliberale Organisation spätestens 2002 , als bekannt wurde , dass sie für 58.670 Euro Dialoge in der ARD - Serie " Marienhof " gekauft hatte .
Vehement wirbt die 2000 gegründete Lobbyinitiative seitdem für Privatisierung , Steuersenkungen und weniger Sozialstaat .
Ein wichtiger Bestandteil ihres PR - Instrumentariums sind die " INSM - Botschafter " .
Unter ihnen finden sich prominente Namen wie Roland Berger oder Arend Oetker .
Das ARD - Magazin " plusminus " berichtete 2005 , dass gleich drei INSM - Botschafter in einer Folge der ARD - Sendung " Sabine Christiansen " anwesend waren .
Eine Tradition , die offenbar auch in der Nachfolgesendung " Anne Will " gepflegt wird .
Zuletzt war im Juni der INSM - Berater Bernd Raffelhüschen zu Gast .
Im März lud man den Berater Oswald Metzger ( CDU ) und den Botschafter Arnulf Baring ein , im Dezember den INSM - Gründer Martin Kannegiesser .
Am 2 . November fanden sich unter den fünf Gästen mit Arend Oetker und Fördervereinsmitglied Silvana Koch - Mehrin ( FDP ) zwei weitere INSM - Vertreter .
Im gleichen Monat kamen auch die Botschafter Dominique Döttling und Michael Hüther .
Pikant daran : Anne Will moderierte den " Kongress 2002 " der INSM und führte unter anderem ein Interview mit dem damaligen BDI - Präsidenten Michael Rogowski .
Auf die Frage , welches Honorar sie hierfür erhielt , erklärte Nina Tesenfitz von der Will Media GmbH : " Anne Will gibt generell keine Auskunft über ihre Einnahmen . "
Ein Problem in der gehäuften Präsenz von INSM - Vertretern sieht man bei " Anne Will " nicht : " Unsere Gäste werden aufgrund ihrer Funktionen , Mandate und Positionen ausgewählt , nicht aufgrund ihres Verhältnisses zur INSM . "
Bernd Raffelhüschen ist in der ARD auch sonst ein gefragter Gesprächspartner : Am 14 .
Juli wurde Raffelhüschen , der im Aufsichtsrat der ERGO - Versicherungsgruppe AG sitzt und dessen Institut gelegentlich mit der Victoria - Versicherung zusammenarbeitet , von Bayern 2 als " Rentenexperte " interviewt .
Einen
Tag später führte der SWR ein Interview mit ihm zur Rentengarantie .
Darin sprach er - gemäß der Sprachregelung der INSM - von " Reformen " .
Am 12 .
Juli zitierten auch " Tagesschau " und " Tagesthemen " Raffelhüschen als " Experten " in einem Beitrag zur Rentengarantie .
Nie wurde auf Raffelhüschens INSM - Nähe hingewiesen - obwohl die INSM auf dem Gebiet der Rente besonders aktiv ist und Raffelhüschen kürzlich in ihrem Auftrag ein Gutachten zur Rentenformel erstellt hat .
" Bei Wissenschaftlern ist es in unseren Beiträgen unüblich , Beratungs - , Gutachter - oder sonstige Tätigkeiten des Hochschullehrers zu nennen " , so Kai Gniffke , Chefredakteur von " ARD - aktuell " .
Ähnlich äußert sich der SWR - Sprecher Wolfgang Utz : " Nicht alle Nebenbeschäftigungen , Titel , Forschungsschwerpunkte eines Professors können in einer Anmoderation genannt werden " .
Und sollten irgendwann sowieso alle ARD - Experten und - Gäste von der INSM kommen , würde sich ein solcher Hinweis dann ja auch erübrigen .
---------------------
Richtigstellung des NDR vom 24.7.09 :
Der Artikel von Marvin Oppong zu Auftritten von INSM - Vertretern im Programm vom 23.7 .
enthält neben zahlreichen Weglassungen einen ärgerlichen Fehler : die falsche Jahreszahl im ersten Absatz .
Nicht 2002 , sondern erst 2005 wurde bekannt , dass die INSM Geld an die Produktionsfirma gezahlt hatte , um auf Dialoge im " Marienhof " Einfluss nehmen zu können .
Als Anne Will beim " Kongress 2002 " der INSM moderierte , hat sie von Schleichwerbung im " Marienhof " nichts gewusst .
Zur Sendung am 21 .
Juni 2009 , in der Raffelhüschen dabei war , stand in der Gästeinformation u. a. folgender Satz ( nachzulesen auf der Website von " Anne Will " ) : " Raffelhüschen ist außerdem Berater der arbeitgebernahen Lobbyorganisation INSM und sitzt in mehreren Aufsichtsräten , unter anderem bei der ERGO - Versicherungsgruppe . "
Weitere Gäste waren übrigens Ursula Engelen - Käfer ( DGB ) , Ralf Stegner ( SPD ) , Jens Spahn ( CDU ) und die Rentnerin Lisette Milde .
Gleich der erste Einspielfilm ( " Sommermärchen für die Rentner " ) zitierte eine Studie von Raffelhüschen unter Hinweis darauf , dass er diese im Auftrag der INSM erstellt hat .
Der letzte Einspielfilm ( " Die Rentenexperten " ) setzte sich mit der Tatsache auseinander , dass Herr Raffelhüschen u.a. ein Aufsichtsratsmandat beim Versicherungskonzern ERGO hat , und stellt die Frage nach seiner Unabhängigkeit als Wissenschaftler .
'' If only they would see how fantastic Pete is and how experienced he is but they refuse to see past the fact that his plane did crash land .
They do n't want to know the reasons behind it .
An associate of murdered Sydney man Michael McGurk has told the ABC that the property developer said he was going to blackmail the Sultan of Brunei .
British businessman Mark Burby went to the UK authorities when he heard Mr McGurk had been shot in front of his young son outside his home on Sydney 's lower north shore .
Lawyers for the two men had been in touch recently about a lawsuit they were both involved in , to do with senior members of the royal family in Brunei .
" My lawyer just sends a very brief email ; ' how you getting on , have you made the application ? ' " he said .
" Within four hours , five hours we get an email back , very chilling email , one line long saying ' Michael McGurk is murdered yesterday .
Single gunshot to the head .
Professional undertaking '.
" Even now I can feel goose bumps and a shiver down my spine when I hear that . "
The two businessmen first met three years ago .
Mr Burby contacted Mr McGurk when he read in the media that the Sydneysider was suing the Sultan of Brunei for not paying for a rare , miniature Koran .
Mr Burby had also sued members of the royal family for reneging on a business deal and he wanted to see if the two lawsuits had any similarities .
At a meeting in the Channel Islands in 2006 , Mr Burby claims the two men exchanged information about an ongoing private matter involving one of the Sultan 's relatives .
" There 's no short way around it , he was using that information , or was going to use that information , to blackmail the Sultan and this other senior member to say ' you will pay that Koran bill , you will resolve that Koran dispute or I 'm going to put all this out ' , " Mr Burby said .
" The words he uses is ' I 'll have it on the six o'clock news mate ' . "
Fearing for his life
There is no suggestion that any member of the royal family in Brunei is involved in Mr McGurk 's death .
Mr Burby concedes the murder may be totally unrelated to him , but nevertheless he has feared for his life since hearing about it .
" Probably wandered around for a few hours , told my wife .
I did n't tell her straight away , I thought how do I tell her this ? " he said .
" I spoke to my lawyer , he was just about to go away on holiday and we found out this around lunch time our time , and within two or three hours it was we need to speak to the authorities about this . "
He went to the local police near his home on the island of Jersey .
" Luckily the girl at the counter knew me , so you know it was n't some nutter walking in off the street , " he said .
" She got someone to speak to me .
They sort of looked at me as if to say ' are you mad ? '
" I showed them a few emails and documents and within 20 minutes thankfully , and to their credit , they took the situation very seriously and sent down some Special Branch people to see me , literally did n't want me to go home .
" They said just ' stay here ' . "
Mr Burby is now under police protection .
" I am very grateful for their response and how they 've handled it and the way they 're dealing with it at the moment and my wife feels a degree of comfort in the support they 've given us , " he said .
He has offered to assist police in New South Wales .
As well as the homicide investigation into Mr McGurk 's death , the Independent Commission Against Corruption is looking into claims of bribery involving the New South Wales Labor Party .
There will also be a parliamentary inquiry into planning decisions linked to the murdered businessman .
Mr McGurk will be farewelled at a funeral at the Sacred Heart Church in Mosman this morning .
These figures in The Economist are pretty depressing :
Opinions on whether the use of torture should be prohibited appear to vary widely around the world .
According to opinion polls conducted early in 2008 respondents in western European democracies such as Britain and Spain were most hostile to the idea of even some degree of use of torture , whereas residents in big but poorer countries such as Nigeria , Turkey and India seemed most willing to tolerate the idea ( perhaps in these three cases because of violent domestic threats to political stability ) .
Surprisingly , democracies are not necessarily more hostile to the practice than non-democracies .
According to the polls , Americans are more willing to tolerate the use of torture than are Chinese .
So much for the meritocracy myth on Wall Street .
According to a study released by the Institute for Policy Studiesthis week , the top five executives at the 20 banks receiving the largest amount of federal bailout dollars took home an average of almost $ 13.8 million in personal compensation last year – or 37 % more than the average leader of an S&P 500 company .
This most recent revelation underscores that rewards on Wall Street are completely disconnected from job performance .
How private businesses choose to compensate their leaders should be an internal matter – except for the fact that during the same year these corporate leaders were raking in these profits , taxpayers backstopped their firms from total collapse .
In a true free market system , the market rewards good decisions and punishes bad ones .
In the system under which we live , banks and even large hedge funds know that the Federal Reserve or the Treasury Department will negotiate bailouts because of the systemic risk posed by collapse .
It is incomprehensible that this kind of behavior does not outrage the so - called free marketers in Congress .
Yet the Republican minority appears to be so ideologically myopic that its members keep going back to talking points that have little to do with reality .
Several months ago , Rep. Tom Price ( R - Georgia ) exhibited this stunted groupthinkwhen he lambasted a bill to give shareholders greater say over executive compensation as cutting “ at the very core of our free market system . ”
What free market system is he talking about ?
Bank executives who gamble with shareholder funds , pay themselves outrageous bonuses even as their shareholders are all but wiped out , and know that taxpayers will eventually backstop their folly because they are deemed too big to fail do not operate in a real free market system .
Does anyone for one minute imagine that Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase operate in an environment that would allow them to fall now that both banks have become even more crucial to the financial industry with their respective acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns ?
The lesson of the past year is that taxpayers will continue to act as a backstop to preserve the integrity of the same free market system that currently exists only in the imagination of certain politicians .
Remember , this phenomenon was undertaken initially by President Bush and implemented by his Republican treasury secretary ( who previously served as chairman of Goldman Sachs ) and his Federal Reserve chairman ( who previously served as the chairman of Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers ) .
These are hardly the wild - eye liberals whom politicians on the right love to accuse of eradicating capitalism .
On CNBC.com now : Best American CEOs of All Time
If politicians like Rep . Price and others sincerely want a free market system , the first thing they need to do is agree that the current system , which allows a few large banks to play an outsized role , cannot continue to operate as it has .
Banks too big to fail cannot provide immediate rewards to the same leaders who take reckless gambles in order to make a quick buck – knowing that their gambles are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States .
In order to achieve a true meritocracy , a regulator needs to step in to oversee financial entities whose sheer size allows them to take risks at government expense .
Once a private entity knows it cannot rely on taxpayer backing because it poses no systemic risk to the taxpayers , it can fully engage in any kind of lawful behavior its executives and shareholders deem appropriate .
Supporters of greater regulation do not want government inserting itself into the daily workings of private business .
They want to end behavior that pays off the overcompensated gamblers at the top while leaving taxpayers on the hook for their mistakes .
If ideologues on the right truly wanted reality to match their free market rhetoric , they would permit regulation that would no longer necessitate taxpayer backstops .
Until then , they can call the system under which we have lived for a very long time whatever they want – but to call it a free market meritocracy would be a misnomer .

The human brain can adapt to changing demands even in adulthood , but MIT neuroscientists have now found evidence of it changing with unsuspected speed .
Their findings suggest that the brain has a network of silent connections that underlie its plasticity .
The brain 's tendency to call upon these connections could help explain the curious phenomenon of " referred sensations , " in which a person with an amputated arm " feels " sensations in the missing limb when he or she is touched on the face .
Scientists believe this happens because the part of the brain that normally receives input from the arm begins " referring " to signals coming from a nearby brain region that receives information from the face .
" We found these referred sensations in the visual cortex , too , " said senior author Nancy Kanwisher of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , referring to the findings of a paper being published in the July 15 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .
" When we temporarily deprived part of the visual cortex from receiving input , subjects reported seeing squares distorted as rectangles .
We were surprised to find these referred visual sensations happening as fast as we could measure , within two seconds . "
Many scientists think that this kind of reorganized response to sensory information reflects a rewiring in the brain , or a growth of new connections .
" But these distortions happened too quickly to result from structural changes in the cortex , " Kanwisher explained .
" So we think the connections were already there but were silent , and that the brain is constantly recalibrating the connections through short - term plasticity mechanisms . "
First author Daniel Dilks , a postdoctoral researcher in Kanwisher 's lab , first found the square - to - rectangle distortion in a patient who suffered a stroke that deprived a portion of his visual cortex from receiving input .
The stroke created a blind region in his field of vision .
When a square object was placed outside this blind region , the patient perceived it as a rectangle stretching into the blind area - a result of the deprived neurons now responding to a neighboring part of the visual field .
" But the patient 's cortex had been deprived of visual information for a long time , so we did not know how quickly the adult visual cortex could change following deprivation , " Dilks said .
" To find out , we took advantage of the natural blind spot in each eye , using a simple perceptual test in healthy volunteers with normal vision . "
Blind spots occur because the retina has no photoreceptors where the optic nerve exits the eye , so the visual cortex receives no stimulation from that point .
We do not perceive our blind spots because the left eye sees what is in the right eye 's blind area , and vice versa .
Even when one eye is closed , we are not normally aware of a gap in our visual field .
It takes a perceptual test to reveal the blind spot , which involves covering one eye and moving an object towards the blind spot until it " disappears " from view .
[ Click here to find your own blind spot ] .
Dilks and colleagues used this test to see how soon after the cortex is deprived of information that volunteers begin to perceive shape distortions .
They presented different - sized rectangles just outside the subjects ' blind spot and asked subjects to judge the height and width at different time points after one eye was patched .
The volunteers perceived the rectangles elongating just two seconds after their eye was covered - much quicker than expected .
When the eye patch was removed , the distortions vanished just as fast as they had appeared .
" So the visual cortex changes its response almost immediately to sensory deprivation and to new input , " Kanwisher explained .
" Our study shows the stunning ability of the brain to adapt to moment - to - moment changes in experience even in adulthood . "
Chris Baker ( NIH ) and Yicong Liu ( MIT undergraduate student ) contributed to this study , which was supported by the NIH and NIMH .

I got an interesting email today .
Ostensibly from Prof. Jochem Koos ( a good Dutch name ) from Elsevier , the email gives editorial and review policies for its journals .
After stating that referees must be of the highest quality , the letter then asks potential editors and reviewers to fill out a form to certify their credentials and be added to their list .
The bad part is that it costs $ 100 to be added to the list .
The good part is that referees are to be paid $ 30 per page reviewed . $ 30 !
I just finished a 50 page monster for an Elsevier journal .
I could get $ 1500 ?!
Wow !
Does that go for revisions too ?
I could get that paper in an endless series of revisions at $ 1500 per round .
“ There is a comma misplaced on page 26 .
I will need to see a revision before I recommend publication . ”
Ka-ching !
And if I am running a bit short on cash a few reviews of the form “ Interesting paper but I would like to see it … 13 pages longer ” should be just the thing for making the mortgage payment .
Of course , it is all a ruse .
Elsevier does not pay $ 30 / page for refereeing ( at least , not in operations research ) and you do n’t have to pay $ 100 to get on an approved list to referee .
It is surprising that a group that overwhelmingly has PhDs can be a target for such a scam .
On the other hand , considering some of the people I have met in my professional life , perhaps it is not that surprising .
Bottom line : do n’t send off $ 100 to just anyone with a gmail address .
Elsevier has some more information on these sorts of emails .
The ISP has taken an unusual approach to copyright policing Internet service provider ( ISP ) Karoo , based in Hull , has changed its policy of suspending the service of users suspected of copyright violations .
The about face was made following a BBC story outlining the firm 's practice .
Karoo issued a statement on Friday , saying that it has been " exceeding the expectations of copyright owners " .
The firm will now adopt a " three strikes " rule , in which suspected file - sharers will receive three written warnings before action is taken .
" We have always taken a firm line on the alleged abuse of our internet connections , " said Nick Thompson , director of consumer and publishing services , in the statement .
" However , we continually review our policies and procedures to reflect own customers ' changing needs and evolving use of the internet .
" It is evident that we have been exceeding the expectations of copyright owners , the media and internet users .
So , we have changed our policy to move in more line with the industry standard approach . "
' Totally unfair ' Karoo - the only ISP in the area , which has no BT lines - long held a policy of suspending service of suspected file - sharers .
In order to get their service restored , customers had to sign a document promising not to repeat the offence .
The firm 's approach is more aligned with many other ISPs ' approaches to suspected file sharers , mirroring the " three strikes " rule that the music industry itself has called for .
It 's an improvement that they 've done that - rather than just zero chance for any negotiation
Andrea Robinson
Karoo customer Andrea Robinson , a Karoo customer from Willerby , told the BBC that a day after her service was cut off , she received a letter from the firm claiming that she had been using the peer - to - peer file - sharing service BitTorrent to download the film Terminator Salvation .
On calling Karoo , she was told to visit the company 's offices to resolve the issue .
" They gave me a form to sign to get reconnected , " she told the BBC .
" The form basically said ' if I admit my guilt you 'll reconnect me ' .
So I did n't sign it and walked out . "
Jim Killock , executive director of the digital rights activists The Open Rights Group , told the BBC that it is " totally unfair " to disconnect people without notice .
" In fact , disconnection is something that should only even possibly be considered as a result of court action , " he said .
While she said that her service had still not been restored , Mrs Robinson called Karoo 's policy change " a step in the right direction " .
" I 'm still a bit upset about it , but it 's an improvement that they 've done that - rather than just zero chance for any negotiation or to put your case across , " she told BBC News .

One of the largest ever international surveys of authors and reviewers has reiterated concerns over integrity , demand and quality control in peer review and highlighted the system ’s inability to effectively detect plagiarism .
The Peer Review Survey 2009 , conducted by UK organisation Sense About Science , collated responses from over 4000 reviewers and authors worldwide and explored the motivations behind reviewing and their opinions of the system .
Some researchers worry that the integrity of peer review is under threat from high demand and low quality control .
Although the peer review community is growing rapidly with the global research community , over half of the participants in the survey were based in North America or Western Europe , suggesting their persisting influence over developing countries .
The survey found that respondents were divided over potential incentives for taking part in peer review .
Over half felt payment in kind ( e.g. journal subscription , waiver of their own publishing costs ) would make them more likely to review , 41 per cent said cash payment would be their preferred reward ( though this drops to 2.5 per cent if the author has to cover the cost ) , while 39 per cent favoured published acknowledgement in return for their services .
A further finding was that although reviewers see detecting plagiarism as a noble aim , it is not practical within the current peer review framework .
Alice Tuff , development manager at Sense About Science , said : ’ The vast majority of authors and reviewers think peer review should detect plagiarism ( 81 per cent ) but only a minority ( 38 per cent ) think it is capable .
The academic time involved in detecting plagiarism through peer review would cause the system to grind to a halt . ’
Publishing house Elsevier , which helped fund the research , is now developing electronic plagiarism tools in partnership with journal editors to address this matter .
’ The survey has raised many issues for publishers , ’ says Tuff .
’ In general , reviewers feel that peer review is a good system but many aspects could be improved , for example providing better guidance and training . ’
The majority of researchers who completed the survey felt that formal training for peer reviewers should be introduced .
While there are undeniable gripes about the peer review system in its current form , no viable alternatives have yet presented themselves that could drastically improve the way research papers are reviewed and published - a fact echoed by the reviewers who took part in the survey .
Many of the findings from the survey can also be applied to grant peer review .
Training , for example , is one of the many areas for improvement identified by the Engineering and physical sciences research council ’s Peer Review Survey published in February 2009 , and it is likely to be addressed in its ongoing review of peer review .
The full findings of the Sense about Science Peer Review Survey are due to be published in November 2009 and will identify trends in specific scientific communities .

Every once in a while , the news has some special report about a hippie driving around the country in a retrofitted VW bus that runs on fast food grease .
But there is a dark side .
Grease theft is a problem .
News OK 6 : ULSA , OK -- Tulsa Police arrested a suspect overnight for stealing grease .
At about 4 a.m.
Wednesday , police received a tip that a man was taking grease from the KFC restaurant at 21st and Garnett .
By the time officers arrived on scene , the suspect had left , but police say he was spotted a short time later behind a business at 71st and Garnett and was arrested .
Police Cpl. Bruce Burton says grease theft is a big problem locally .
We wondered what this is all about .
Turns out NYT wrote about it last year when oil prices were peakigng :
Outside Seattle , cooking oil rustling has become such a problem that the owners of the Olympia Pizza and Pasta Restaurant in Arlington , Washington , are considering using a surveillance camera to keep watch on its 50 - gallon grease barrel .
Nick Damianidis , an owner , said the barrel had been hit seven or eight times since last summer by siphoners who strike in the night .
" Fryer grease has become gold , " Damianidis said .
" And just over a year ago , I had to pay someone to take it away . "
Much to the surprise of Damianidis and many other people , processed fryer oil , which is called yellow grease , is actually not trash .
The grease is traded on the booming commodities market .
Its value has increased in recent months to historic highs , driven by the even higher prices of gas and ethanol , making it an ever more popular form of biodiesel to fuel cars and trucks .
Hurra , der ( Pseudo - )
Aufschwung ist da !

Man nehme : Statistische Tricks , eine fantasievolle Bilanzführung , schuldenfinanzierte Konjunkturprogramme und Billionen zur Generierung einer erneuten Spekulationsblase - und schon ist die Weltwirtschaftskrise scheinbar überwunden
Rechtzeitig vor der Bundestagswahl schreiben Deutschlands Meinungsmacher den „ Exportweltmeister “ aus der Rezession .
Spiegel - Online sieht Deutschland bereits aus der Rezession wanken , das Handelsblatt bejubelt ein Wirtschaftswachstum von 0,3 % im zweiten Quartal 2009 und die Financial Times Deutschland diskutiert bereits darüber , wie „ wir “ die Krise besiegten .
Auch in den Vereinigten Staaten sieht die amerikanische Notenbank Fed ein Ende der Rezession , da dort die Industrieproduktion im Juli um 0,5 % gegenüber dem Vormonat anstieg .
Für das dritte Quartal dieses Jahres wird sogar ein Wachstum von drei bis vier Prozent erwartet .
Die FTD sieht die amerikanische Industrie sogar vor einem spektakulären Comeback , nachdem diese aggressiv Arbeitsplätze abgebaut und nun ihre Produktivität im Schnitt um über fünf % gegenüber dem ersten Quartal 2007 erhöht habe .
Auf die Idee , dass es gerade die rasant steigende Produktivität der Industrie war ( Explosionsartige Ausweitung der Finanzmärkte in der Clinton - Ära ) , die letztendlich zur Ausbildung des finanzmarktgetriebenen - und Spekulationsblasen generierenden - Kapitalismus in den letzte Jahrzehnten beitrug , kommen Finanzjournalisten selbstverständlich nicht .
Selbst amerikanische Wirtschaftsmedien warnen derzeit vor den Auswirkungen eines „ jobless growth “ , eines Wirtschaftswachstums ohne Arbeitsplatzwachstum , das nur kurzfristig aufrecht erhalten werden kann :
However , other recent reports are warning of a jobless recovery , which could result in lackluster growth in the coming quarters , especially with some 70 percent of the U.S. economy dependent on consumer spending .
Wenn überhaupt , so findet man erst auf den hinteren Zeitungsspalten Hinweise darauf , dass der Arbeitsplatzabbau noch weiter voranschreiten werde , oder dass Konjunkturrisiken noch fortbestehen .
Keine einzige meinungsbildende deutsche Zeitung titelte beispielsweise , dass im selben Zeitraum , in dem eine Konjunkturerholung von 0,3 % gegenüber dem Vorquartal bejubelt wurde , Deutschlands BIP ebenfalls um 7,1 % fiel – zum Vorjahreszeitraum wohlgemerkt .
Kein einziger deutscher Meinungsmacher hielt es für angebracht , seinen Lesern mitzuteilen , dass dies der stärkste Konjunktureinbruch in der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte ist , der jemals im Jahresvergleich statistisch erfasst wurde .
Inzwischen bleibt es engagierten Internetblocks wie beispielsweise dem wirtschaftquerschuss vorbehalten , darauf hinzuweisen , dass bei dieser „ mehr als nur unkritischen Sichtweise “ der Massenmedien ein „ sehr schwaches Quartal bewusst in ein Rezessionsende umgedeutet “ werde .
Das muntere Raten geht weiter
„ Schönreden , schönfärben “ , kreative Buchführung und versagende Ratingagenturen hätten maßgeblich zur Verschärfung der Krise beigetragen , konstatiert der wirtschaftquerschuss .
Haben wenigstens die letztgenannten ihre Lektion aus der Krise gelernt ?
Wie die Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( FAZ ) am 28 .
Juli meldete , nimmt sich die Ratingagentur Standard & Poor 's ( S&P ) „ mehr Zeit “ für die erneute Überprüfung ihres Bewertungsverfahrens , nachdem sie massiver Kritik aus der Finanzbranche ausgesetzt war .
Die neuen Regeln waren den Emittenten der Wertpapiere einfach zu streng !
Es drohten „ Massen - Abstufungen “ von Wertpapieren , die auch Schwergewichten wie der Europäischen Zentralbank „ nicht willkommen “ seien , wenn diese ihre Bestwertung von AAA verlieren sollen , berichtete die FAZ .
Nochmal im Klartext : Die Ratingagenturen werden nun kritisiert , weil ihre neuen Bewertungskriterien zu streng sind !
Wie die auf Druck der Finanzbranche erneut überarbeiteten Bewertungsregeln aussehen werden , wird vielleicht anhand einer Episode aus dem vergangenen Juli ersichtlich .
Nachdem S&P etliche Kreditverbriefungen für Gewerbeimmobilien ( CMBS ) auf die Note BBB - herabstufte , musste die Ratingagentur am 24 .
Juli nach massiver Kritik zurückrudern und diesen wiederum die Bestnote AAA vergeben .
Anleger , die die von S&P herabgestuften CMBS zuvor gekauft hätten , seien „ auf unfaire Art bestraft “ worden , zitierte die FAZ einen Citigroup - Banker .
Der CMBS - Markt hätte sich jüngst etwas erholt , weil Papiere mit hoher Bonität von Investoren im Rahmen eines staatlichen Kreditprogramms gekauft worden seien , so die FAZ weiter .
Dieser Aufschwung sei nun in Gefahr .
Inzwischen ist auch klar , dass auch das grundsätzliche Geschäftsmodell der Agenturen unangetastet bleibt .
Die Emittenten der Wertpapiere werden die Agenturen weiterhin für die Bewertung bezahlen .
Gerade dieser Interessenkonflikt , in denen die Ratingagenturen geraten , wurde für die massenweise Überbewertung von Schrottpapieren während der Spekulationsblase auf dem Immobilienmarkt verantwortlich gemacht !
Um den - vom Steuerzahler subventionierten - Handel mit all den toxischen „ Wertpapieren “ nicht zu gefährden , dürfen diese natürlich nicht entsprechend ihres Werts als Finanzmüll bewerten werden .
Das Auftauchen der „ eingefrorenen “ Finanzmärkte kann nur vermittels systematischen Selbstbetrugs gelingen .
The new HTC Touch2 will be available straight with the latest version of the Microsoft OS .
The smartphone is quite compact and stylish , but packs enough functionality to cater for everyday needs .
Much like the Touch Diamond2 , the HTC Touch2 has a touch - sensitive zoom bar to help with zooming in and out .
There 's also TouchFLO 3D to cover up the underlying OS and customize the user experience .
The HTC Touch2 has a 2.8 - inch display of only QVGA resolution .
The Qualcomm MSM7225A platform ticks with a speed of 528MHz and there 's 256MB of RAM .
There 's Wi -Fi on board , as well as a GPS receiver .
The 3 megapixel camera has fixed focus only , but the HSDPA support goes as high as 7.2 Mbps .
There 's also Bluetooth 2.1 with A2 DP support .
Windows Mobile 6.5 comes with the latest version of Internet Explorer , which has Flash Lite support , which allows it to playback YouTube videos even straight from the desktop version of the website .
Besides the user experience boost , the new version of Windows Mobile will offer two new potentially powerful services - the MyPhone and the Windows Marketplace .
MyPhone will offer free web synchronization of photos , music , contacts and messages , while the Marketplace speaks for itself introducing a huge application catalog straight to the mobile .
The HTC Touch2 will be available starting with 6 October ( the release date of Windows Mobile 6.5 ) but broad availability in Europe and Asia will be reached in early Q4 2009 .
Pricing is still unknown .

That irresistible line about the caveman , by the way , came from a reddit commenter .
He was probably feeling celebratory over the fact that GEICO pulled all its advertising from Glenn Beck 's hateful Fox TV show .
And GEICO is n't the only company to have decided that advertising on the show of a vicious hate monger inciting violence and racial hatred is a bad marketing idea .
Men 's Wearhouse and Sargento are the latest companies to ask Fox to stop running their ads on TV .
And today -- Blue America did the same .
Blue America is running a second wave of ads on Arkansas TV explaining Blanche Lincoln 's duplicitous role in the health care debate .
After looking at the logs of the first wave and noticing that some of our ads in Little Rock and Pine Bluff ran on Beck 's show , we instructed the cable networks to not run any more ads on his programs in the towns we are advertising in this week -- the towns where Lincoln is doing her health care forums .
Here 's the note the Blue America media buyer sent to the Arkansas cable networks :
Blue America PAC has instructed me to tell you to not place any of their advertising within the Glenn Beck program on Fox News Channel for their upcoming flight .
There is a national boycott of his advertisers ongoing .
as Mr. Beck has been promoting racism and violence on his program .
We do not want to appear to support his efforts in any way , shape or form .
Thank you for your attention to this matter .
Sincerely , Jacqueline Propps
As for Men 's Wearhouse , DailyKos published a letter yesterday from Matt Stringer , the vp of marketing / creative services :
Thank you for contacting Men ’s Wearhouse and bringing to our attention your concerns with the Glenn Beck program on Fox News .
While we support free speech and do not make advertising decisions based on our own personal ideologies , after reviewing his recent incendiary comments we have decided to remove our advertising from his program .
We hope that this decision will allow you to continue to patronize Men ’s Wearhouse .
I would encourage you to please share our decision with anyone else who may have expressed a similar concern .
And Media Matters published a similar note from Pat Lombardo from the Sargento Consumer Affairs Department :
We deeply appreciate your reaching out to us and sharing your comments and concerns about Sargento ads appearing during The Glenn Beck Show .
We sat down with the marketing department to talk about it and I learned that we buy time periods not specific programs .
But in any event , they 've made the decision to exclude that program from our future ad rotation .
Simply stated , Sargento ads wo n't be airing during that show .
Again , thanks for contacting us .
As Color Of Change , the online civil rights group that initiated the boycott , points out , these defections come on the heels of pull outs by LexisNexis - owned Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble , Progressive Insurance and SC Johnson .
So what 's wrong with Travelocity ?
Why do they insist on still underwriting the hatred , bigotry and violence ?
As a reader pointed out on my travel blog this morning , " perhaps someone could clue Travelocity into the fact that racists are n't the biggest travelers ... "
CNN has a similar type of problem with their own in house racist sociopath , Lou Dobbs and , according to MediaBistro.com the network is moving away from using Hate Talk Radio commentators on the air from now on , although they still refuse to fire Dobbs ( who also hosts a hate talk radio show ) .
TVNewser has learned , and a CNN spokesperson confirms , that in his morning editorial meeting today , CNN / U.S. president Jon Klein asked his show producers to avoid booking talk radio hosts .
" Complex issues require world class reporting , " Klein is quoted as saying , adding that talk radio hosts too often add to the noise , and that what they say is " all too predictable . "
Yesterday I spent over 4 hours at a town hall meeting hosted by Rep. Adam Schiff in Alhambra .
The disruptive clowns who had come to prevent a discussion were shouting slogans straight from the Astro - Turf outfits ' talking points and their world views were clearly formed by Hate Talk Radio and Fox " News . "
These people are hysterically opposed to immigrants ' babies getting health care and opposed to the government making it illegal for Insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions .
What they chant instead is " Tort Reform " and what they mutter is divisive and racist epithets most Americans thought went out of style with Lester Maddox , George Wallace and the cavemen .
UPDATE : Bad News For Teabaggers -- You 're Being Played
The teabaggers like to take their thumbs out of their asses and jump up and down in front of the TV cameras claiming how real and genuine their grassroots protests are .
I talked to so many of them with long lists of legitimate grievances -- one woman was suing her insurance company and very angry man with strange eyes is suing the gold company Glenn Beck shills for on radio that he claims cheated him -- but their grievances had nothing to do with what they disdainfully call " ObamaCare . "
How did they get from there to here ?
It was n't via Pluto .
According to a former Insurance Industry executive , Wendell Potter of CIGNA , the insurance companies are indeed the unseen hand behind the curtain manipulating the righteous -- or self - righteous -- indignation of the angry crowds getting their matching orders from hate - mongers like Glenn Beck , Lou Dobbs , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , etc .
It occurred to me the other day that Model Driven Architecture ( MDA ) is a lot like waterfall processes .
For those of you who do n’t know , MDA is a kind - of different approach to writing software systems .
Basically the idea is to define a software system in a platform independent way ( e.g. using some kind of DSL for example ) and then once the system is fully defined your MDA tools will be able to generate a platform specific version of your system which you can then deploy and run ( yeah as simple as that : ) ) .
To simplify it even more , the MDA ideal is to be able to represent a system diagrammatically ( i.e. draw it ) and then press a button and get a fully operational version of the software system that you were after .
If you still need to know more there is Google or Wikipedia .
MDA has been around for a few years now , and when the idea first reared it ’s head it was ( like many others ) touted as a potential ‘ silver bullet ’ solution to building software quickly and efficiently .
The surprising thing is how many people have bought into this , I mean , there are companies out there who have built a business around MDA .
The reason I am surprised is that waterfall processes tried to do the same thing to process , as MDA tries to do to software implementation .
Any developer worth his salt knows exactly how ‘ well ’ waterfall processes work , so what made anyone believe that doing the same thing to actual implementation of the software system would be any more successful ?
How Are MDA and Waterfall Similar ?
Waterfall processes try to fully define all the steps needed to create a software system from a process perspective .
They attempt to create a perfect roadmap that will cover every contingency you ’re likely to encounter when building a software system .
The great delusion here is the fact that no - one can ever fully take into account every possible combination of domain , people , circumstances , organizational differences , etc. and did I mention people .
Of course it quickly became apparent that no process can create a perfect roadmap for all those reasons .
Although when I say quickly I mean it in cosmic terms a veritable blink of an eye – in human terms it was a few decades .
And it will take a few more before we put waterfall processes in the grave where they belong .
What MDA tries to do is to create an abstraction of the system you ’re trying to build .
It is either a visual abstraction or a DSL based one , either way it is still an abstraction , you then try to generate a system based on this abstraction .
Leaving aside any issues related to deploying what you generated , in order for your system to do what you need ; your abstraction would have had to be spot on .
So , in essence you ’re trying to create a perfect system metaphor .
I am not sure if that ’s an oxymoron , but I do know that I ’ve never been able to come up with a perfect metaphor for anything , and I do n’t know anyone who has .
But , that is exactly what we ’re striving towards when we do MDA , while the metaphor holds up , everything is fine , but a soon as it breaks down – as it must , what do we do ?
What DO We Do When The Metaphor Breaks Down ?
We do the only thing we can do , we go back to the tried and true .
We crack open an editor and try to fill in the gaps by hand .
But of course we can no longer use our DSL for this or our nice picture , we must work within the bounds of our platform .
And this of course is where the system gets orders of magnitude more complicated .
MDA tools generate the platform specific version of our system so we must find a way to hook - in our little ‘ abstractional patches ’ into the generation process .
And of course we need to make sure that it all still fits together as the system evolves .
Not to mention the fact that it is really difficult to visualize how our patches fit into the overall architecture ( since we are now trying to fit a little bit of reality into an abstraction and we ’re just not wired to do that easily ) .
And should I even bother to mention that we ’re no longer platform independent !
What you end up with is an environment where the further you go along the more you feel like everything is a little bit out of control .
In reality it may not actually be as bad as some systems that are developed in the normal way ( should I say ‘ traditional ’ – I better not :) ) .
But you ca n’t keep the two separate representations of parts of the system in your mind at the same time and that creates a very real sense that you ca n’t quite get a handle on what you ’re doing .
All this brings us back to me being really surprised that MDA got even the little bit of traction that it does have .
We had an almost perfect example of a situation where a similar solution just did n’t work ( waterfall processes ) , more , it was pretty much in the same domain .
But that ’s the thing , what we had was an abstraction , a metaphor if you prefer , it was a good one but it was n’t perfect and so many of us missed it and MDA was born – so I guess I should n’t really be surprised .
We ’re not incompetent though , we ’ve twigged on to the fact that waterfall is not the way to go and so it is going the way of the dinosaur ; MDA is going to go the same way – eventually .
It just that is takes us a cosmic eye - blink to get our act together .

Producer , More or Less , BBC Radio 4
How can you find out if something is untrue when you do not know what the truth is ?
That was the challenge that confronted the More or Less team when we tried to unpick a claim that appears in the infamous Muslim Demographics YouTube video that " in the Netherlands , 50 % of all newborns are Muslim . "
The video assumes Dutch Muslim women are extraordinarily fertile
If life was easy it would be possible to phone up the Dutch government 's official statistics office , Statistics Netherlands , and simply ask them what proportion of babies are born to Muslim families .
But life is not easy .
Like many European countries , the Netherlands does not routinely collect information about religious belief as part of its population statistics .
There is a tradition in Europe that religious belief is a matter of personal conscience and should not be mixed up with the detailed data that is used to track births , deaths and migration .
However , the Dutch statisticians do conduct surveys of religious belief independently of their wider population data .
And we know from their latest research that roughly five per cent of the population in the Netherlands is Muslim - around 850,000 people .
So five per cent of the population is responsible for 50 per cent of the babies ?
It sounds pretty implausible when you put it like that , but how implausible is it exactly ?
Can we put some numbers on it ?
Assumption
One approach is to assume that the statement is true and then find out what else would have to be true for the numbers to add up .
We know that the female population of the Netherlands in 2008 was 8,293,326 .
We can estimate the female Muslim population as 5 per cent of this - or 414,666 - leaving 7,878,660 non-Muslim women .
How do the fertility rates of Muslim and non-Muslim women compare ?
And we know that last year there were 184,634 children born in the Netherlands .
So if the Muslim Demographics video is right , 414,666 Muslim women gave birth to 92,317 babies - the same number as 7,878,660 non-Muslim women gave birth to .
That means roughly one in four Dutch Muslim women would have had a baby last year , compared with only one in 85 non-Muslim women .
Or to put it another way , the birth rate of Muslim women would need to have been about 19 times greater than their non-Muslim neighbours for the claim in the video to be true .
But hang on a minute .
Doing the sum this way makes one very big assumption : that the populations of Muslim and non-Muslim women in the Netherlands have the same age distribution .
And it is not unreasonable to think that a greater proportion of Muslim women may be of child - bearing age .
But what proportion exactly ?
This takes us right back to the problem we started with : we do not have demographic data broken down by religious belief .
Comparison
But we can estimate the proportion of Muslim women that are of child - bearing age by using the age distribution of Dutch citizens who originally came from Morocco and Turkey , the most common countries of origin for Dutch Muslims .
A group of young Turkish women waiting for the metro in Istanbul Looking at the numbers for 2008 , 61 per cent of women of Turkish origin were aged between 15 and 49 - the age group typically taken as child - bearing .
The figure for women of Moroccan origin was 57 per cent .
For women of Dutch origin , only 45 per cent were in this age group .
Using the higher of the two figures to estimate the child - bearing Muslim population , that gives us an estimated 252,946 fertile Muslim women and 3,545,397 fertile non-Muslim women in the Netherlands .
Now if we redo our earlier calculation using these figures , we can estimate that more than one in three Muslim women of child - bearing age would have given birth last year , but less than one in 38 non-Muslim women in the same age group .
That means , even when you adjust for age differences between the two populations , fertile Muslim women would still need to be giving birth at 14 times the rate of their fertile non-Muslim neighbours .
Total fertility rate
Let us put all this in context .
The figures imply a crude birth rate for Muslims in the Netherlands of 112.5 births per 1,000 people last year .
According to the United Nations , the country with the highest birth rate in the world is Niger with 54.1 births per 1000 , per year .
And the birth rates in Turkey and Morocco are 18.4 and 20.5 births per thousand , respectively .
According to the UN , Niger has the highest total fertility rate
We can also make a similar comparison using the age - adjusted estimates of the fertile populations by using a measure called the ' total fertility rate ' .
The total fertility rate ( TFR ) is the average number of children a group of women would have if they experienced the current fertility rates of women in different age groups throughout all of their child - bearing years .
In plain English , it represents the fertility rate of an imaginary woman who will have , in each period of her life , the typical fertility that women of each age - group have right now .
By multiplying our estimated population of all fertile Dutch women by the current total fertility rate for the Netherlands we can calculate a hypothetical next generation of 6,609,117 children .
By assigning half of this generation to each group , we can estimate the total fertility rate that fertile Muslim and non-Muslim populations would each need to have for the claim to be true .
The estimated TFR for Dutch Muslims would be 13.06 .
According to the UN , the country with the highest total fertility rate in the world is Niger with a TFR of 7.15 .
And the TFR in Turkey and Morocco is 2.13 and 2.38 respectively .
This would also imply an extremely low fertility rate for the non-Muslim population .
The estimated TFR for non-Muslims would need to be just 0.93 .
According to the UN , the country with the lowest total fertility rate in the world is Bosnia and Herzegovina with a TFR of 1.22 .
It is implausible that " in the Netherlands , 50 per cent of all newborns are Muslims " .
It would mean that the Muslim and non-Muslim populations have some of the most extreme fertility rates found anywhere in the world , at opposite ends of the spectrum , while living in the same country .

We have five , brand new , extremely long clips from .
They ’re good .
Really good .
The film stars Viggo Mortensen as a father in a post - apocalyptic future .
He ’s on a journey with his son through the barren , depopulated remains of what ’s left of the world .
The few remaining survivors are hungry , and not exactly friendly .
The clips are utterly depressing and emotionally draining … but do n’t miss a second .
looks brilliant .
My favorite moment in the more than ten minutes worth of footage below happens in the last clip , when Viggo and his son find food .
His son gives thanks for Cheetohs , but mispronounces the name , mistakenly calling them “ Cheetahs ” .
It ’s a great little moment , one of many in the following footage .
Watch it all , and see if you can spot Robert Duvall .
In the words of one Congress Member :
" My concern is that we are applying pressure to the wrong party in this dispute , " said Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. ) .
" I think it would serve America ’s interest better if we were pressuring the Iranians to eliminate the potential of a nuclear threat from Iran , and less time pressuring our allies and the only democracy in the Middle East to stop the natural growth of their settlements . "
" When Congress gets back into session the administration is going to hear from many more members than just me , " she said .
The people who appear to be fiercely against " tough talk " with Israel , are n't republicans .
They appear to be democrats .
" There ’s a line between articulating U.S. policy and seeming to be pressuring a democracy on what are their domestic policies , and the president is tiptoeing right up to that line , " said Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) , who said he ’d heard complaints from constituents during the congressional recess .
" I would have liked to hear the president talk more about the Palestinian obligation to cut down on terrorism . "
" I do n’t think anybody wants to dictate to an ally what they have to do in their own national security interests , " said Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - N.Y. ) , who said he thinks there ’s " room for compromise . "
" I have to hear specifically from the administration exactly how they define their terms and is there room for defining the terms , " he said , referring to the terms " settlement " and " natural growth . "
That said , Obama is not backing down on this issue , even if the likelihood becomes apparent that he will be a one - term president .
" I do n't think we have to change strong support for Israel , " Obama said .
" We do have to retain a constant belief in the possibilities of negotiations that will lead to peace .
And that 's going to require , from my view , a two - state solution . "
" Part of being a good friend is being honest , " Obama said .
" And I think there have been times where we are not as honest as we should be about the fact that the current direction , the current trajectory , in the region is profoundly negative , not only for Israeli interests but also U.S. interests .
And that 's part of a new dialogue that I 'd like to see encouraged in the region . "
The pro-Israel lobby AIPAC last week got the signatures of 329 members of Congress , including key figures in both parties , on a letter calling on the administration to work " closely and privately " with Israel — in contrast to the current public pressure .
Though , it appears one of the only few backing up Obama on the issue of settlements , appears to be his former campaign partner , Robert Wexler of Florida .
Wexler , an early Obama ally and a staunch defender of his Middle East policy , said in his view , the settlement freeze should apply only to settlements outside Israel ’s security fence , or wall , and should exclude territory that appears likely to ultimately remain part of Israel .
" To expect Israel to have the same policy outside the security fence as inside the security fence is unrealistic ; it ’s counterproductive , " he said .
" I do n’t think [ the administration ’s ] public statements have been specific enough " to resolve the question of whether they were referring to all settlements or only settlements outside the barrier , Wexler said .
" I ’m comfortable with the whole package , " Wexler said , pointing to pressure on Iran and demands for " visible and concrete steps toward normalization " and improved security in the Palestinian territories , as well as demands for a settlement freeze .
" Bibi Netanyahu ca n’t be expected to perform his obligations if the broader Arab world is not willing to take serious steps toward normalizing relations with Israel , " he said .
I have to say , this type of behavior from Congress , while typical during previous administrations , is absolutely disgusting when an American President is attempting to reign in Netanyahu and the likudniks .
We must back up Obama on this , it is absolutely essential for peace and for Israel 's long term security .
In my last post , I introduced Bond ‘s own version of irb ’s completion .
What I did n’t emphasize is that it does n’t need irb .
To prove it , I ’ll show you a mini irb which has persistent readline history , error handling and Bond ’s autocompletion … in 7 lines .
Mini Irb
A good starting point for a basic irb comes from this github snippet :
loop do print '>> ' output = eval ( $ stdin .
gets ) print ' = > ' puts output .
inspect end
It ’s got the very basics of a repl : take a user ’s input , eval it and print the result .
Being as basic as it is , there ’s no autocompletion , persistent readline history , etc .
But who says that needs to be much larger to get those features ?:
1 %w{readline rubygems bond} .
each { | e | require e } 2 Bond .
start 3 history_file = File .
join ( ENV [ " HOME " ] , '.mini_irb_history ' ) 4 IO . readlines ( history_file ) . each { | e | Readline : :HISTORY << e . chomp } if File . exists ? ( history_file ) 5 while ( input = Readline .
readline ( '>> ' , true ) ) != ' exit ' 6 begin puts " => #{ eval ( input ) . inspect } " ; rescue Exception ; puts " Error : #{ $ ! } " end 7 end 8 File .
open ( history_file , ' w ' ) { | f | f . write Readline : :HISTORY . to_a . join ( "
" ) }
A line by line play :
Line 1 - 2 : Loads readline , bond and bond ’s improved version of irb - like completion .
Line 3 - 4 : Read in previous history from a history file .
Line 5 : Get the users input and start a loop that only ends with exit .
Line 6 : Evaluate the input and print an exception if it occurs .
Line 8 : Write all of the loaded history back to the history file .
If you ’re not familiar with readline , you may be wondering where is the autocompletion being handled ?
Well , all of readline ’s goodness is channeled through Readline .
readline .
Bond simply sets Readline .completion_proc and readline handles the rest .
If you ’d like to play with this , fork away !
Here ’s what mini-irb looks like :
bash > ruby mini-irb.rb #
Unlike irb , mini-irb correctly completes on chains of objects >> :some.to_s.split ( '' ) . a ) .all ? ) .any ? ) .assoc ) .at # Completes require 's arguments >> require ' a [ TAB ] >> require ' abbrev.rb ' => true # Completes files >> File.read '~ /[ TAB ] >> File.read '/ Users/bozo/.ir[ TAB ] >> File.read '/ Users/bozo/.irbrc ' #
Oh noz , wherz my irbz ? >>
IRB Error : ( eval ) : 1 : uninitialized constant IRB #
Try this one in irb >> raise Exception Error : Exception >> exit bash >
Mini script / console
Just for fun I figured I ’d see how much more code it ’d take to make a mini script / console for Rails .
I ’m sorry .
It took one more line :
[ ' readline ' , ' rubygems ' , ' bond ' , File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + '/../config/boot ' ]. each { | e | require e } Bond . start [ " #{ RAILS_ROOT } / config/ environment " , ' console_app ' , ' console_with_helpers ' ]. each { | e | require e } history_file = File .
join ( ENV [ " HOME " ] , '.myrb_history ' ) IO . readlines ( history_file ) . each { | e | Readline : :HISTORY << e . chomp } if File . exists ?
( history_file ) while ( input = Readline .
readline ( '>> ' , true ) ) != ' exit ' begin puts " => #{ eval ( input ) . inspect } " ; rescue Exception ; puts " Error : #{ $ ! } " end end File .
open ( history_file , ' w ' ) { | f | f . write Readline : :HISTORY . to_a . join ( "
" ) }
To be fair this is a stripped down version of script / console i.e. it does n’t offer the debugger or sandbox .
But those could be easily added .
If you want to improve on this , fork away !
If you want to see what this looks like , just give it a try . :)
Comparing Apples to Oranges
So how does mini-irb compare to irb ?
Well , it ’s like comparing apples to oranges .
Irb weighs in at 5000 + loc while mini-irb is 7 + 540 loc with Bond .
Irb sports a number of features which I ’ve documented extensively .
But I ’m finding less need for them every day .
The only feature I ’d keep is the ruby lexer to handle multiple lines of code .
But even then I ’d rather prototype multiple lines in an editor .
What are your two cents ?
What features from irb would you add to mini-irb ?
Sign the petition to Governor Schwarzenegger urging him to sign the legislation making May 22 “ Harvey Milk Day ” in the State of California .
Last year , Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill , saying that Milk was a figure of only local significance .
Harvey Milk was — and still is — an inspiration not only as one of the first openly gay men elected to office , but as a trail blazer who understood the value of working with allies , the importance of living our lives openly with authenticity and the power that our stories have to change hearts and minds .
Make sure the Governor knows how important Harvey is to all Californians .

Here 's how we make money
My friend David asked me about his recent car rental experience and whether I thought it helped him save money on his cross -country trip vs using his own ride .
Here are his comments :
“ I actually did rent a vehicle .
Whether my reasons for renting from Hertz vs. driving my own vehicle were economically substantiated or not , I could n’t tell you .
Maybe you , or one of your readers , can make a determination for me .
Here are the details of my “ excursion ” ( such a kidder , I know ) :
My alternative to renting was driving my ’00 Ford Excursion half way across the US .
Although still dependable with only 75 k miles on the V10 gas engine , it ’s still 9 years old .
The last thing I needed to be dealing with on my vacation was a blown transmission , a broken a / c system , or something else that would take time away from our week at the beach .
So , I ’d call that the “ cost of peace of mind , ” ( probably worth something ) .
I rented a 2009 Toyota Sienna with 10 k miles on it .
I payed $ 556 for an 11 day rental period .
Overall miles ; I put 2,571 miles on the rental car ; there is one oil change that I saved on 🙂
I do n’t know what the average cost per mile to drive my own vehicle before gas ( cost , depreciation , routine maintenance , repairs , etc. ) , but let ’s say it ’s $ 0.20 / mile .
That would mean it would have cost me $ 514 before I put any gas in it ( $ 0.20 / mi. x 2,571 miles = $ 514 ) .
Not an exact science , but I bet I ’m not too far off .
In my case , I think I saved some fuel costs too ; the Ford Excursion has never won any awards for fuel economy 🙂
Not sure if any of that is useful , but you are welcome to use any of it on your blog . ”
So what do you think ?
Did David save money ?
Is there ever a simple , cost - savings justification for renting vs driving your own car ?
I asked some friends on Twitter and here were their thoughts :
The “ Should I Rent ? ” Equation
Let ’s look at the main elements to what I ’ll call the “ should I rent ? ” equation .
The way I see it , it comes down to :
price of the rental [ VS ] ( difference in MPG + wear and tear )
Price of the Rental
David listed his price above as $ 556 for an 11 day rental period .
Not bad .
Although I see that car rental prices have actually gone up .
All you darn stay - cation - ers .
Difference in MPG
David ’s Excursion gets approximately 13/15 mpg ( 14 avg ) .
The Sienna he rented gets approximately 17/23 mpg ( 19 avg ) .
Therefore , on his trip of 2,571 miles , his gallons used were 135.3 .
Had he taken his own ride , it would have been 183.6 .
At $ 2.50 per gallon .
He spent $ 338.25 vs $ 459.00 for a savings of $ 120.75 .
Wear and Tear Costs
Okay , now the factor that ’s most difficult to calculate .
What kind of wear and tear would David ’s Excursion receive had he taken it ?
You ca n’t really use the IRS business mileage deduction , normally around .50 cents per mile because that includes gas ( already factored in ) and insurance ( a sunk cost for David ) .
So that leaves things like car tires , oil changes , and other maintenance , as well as general depreciation .
I ’d say David is pretty close with his .20 cents a mile estimate .
But let ’s back into that number :
Oil Changes – I ’ll give David the $ 25 for the one oil change .
– I ’ll give David the $ 25 for the one oil change .
Tires – I priced it out at Discount Tire , and a new set of 40 k tires for the Excursion would cost around $ 500 .
That ’s a per mile cost of 0.0125 .
Therefore , David ’s trip cost him $ 33 in tires .
– I priced it out at Discount Tire , and a new set of 40 k tires for the Excursion would cost around $ 500 .
That ’s a per mile cost of 0.0125 .
Therefore , David ’s trip cost him $ 33 in tires .
Depreciation –
To calculate this I went really conservative and went to Edmunds.com and did a True Market Value search .
I compared a ’00 Excursion with 75,000 miles ( current mileage ) vs one with 77,500 miles ( mileage had he taken it ) to see how the mileage would affect the resale value .
The difference in resale of the two vehicles was $ 44 .
Not as much as I would have thought .

The difference in resale of the two vehicles was $ 44 .
Not as much as I would have thought .
Repairs – I thought it was only fair to throw in some estimated repair costs from those miles .
The best way I knew to estimate this was to get a quote for an extended warranty to cover repairs .
The quote I requested was for this specific vehicle and covered 3 years or 50,000 ( I figure the Excursion will be just about done at that point ) .
The quote totaled $ 1,300 , or .026 per mile .
Using that rate , this trip would have cost David $ 67 in future repair costs .
That brings the total wear and tear cost to $ 169 .
That ’s closer to a .07 cent per mile cost vs David ’s .20 cent estimate .
Using our formula above here ’s how the total numbers look :
$ 556 [ VS ] $ 289.75 ( 120.75 + 169 )
Based on that formula , it looks like David , by renting , spent $ 266.25 more than it would have ultimately cost him by taking his Excursion .
What do you think ?
Was I too conservative on my costs ?
Did I leave anything out ?
Non-Monetary Factors
It would be remiss of me not to discuss some of the non-monetary factors involved here .
As David mentioned , he had a “ piece of mind ” taking a new car across country vs chancing it with his ’00 .
I agree that is worth something .
Other non-monetary reasons to rent :
A Better Fit – Certain rental cars may be a better fit for the type of trip your taking .
For instance , you would need to downsize to a smaller vehicle if you ’re going to be maneuvering in and around a tight city .
Extended Test Drive –
It might be a good idea to use a rental as an extended test drive .
There ’s a definite value in being able to check out a particular model over a week vs a 10 minute drive .
The Cool Factor –
It ’s just fun to rent a new car .
It adds to the experience of the trip .
And new cars often come with the bells and whistles we are n’t experiencing with our used cars .
Tips for Saving On Your Rental
Finally , here are a few tips to keep handy next time you decide to rent vs buy .
Shop Around – Visit all the big sites like Expedia and Orbitz .
But also go direct to the rental car websites .
And do n’t be afraid of the smaller rental car companies .
Rent on Tuesday or Wednesday –
This is the best time of the week to rent a car .
Business travelers are usually on the road Sunday night or Monday morning , while rentals for vacation peak Thursday through Saturday .
So take advantage of the slow time and rent your car midweek .
Apply Discounts –
Take advantage of any memberships you might have , look for deals through your insurance company , apply airline miles , and even ask your hotel concierge .
Stay Away from Airports – I did n’t realize this , but apparently car rental shops near the airport are more expensive .
So what are your thoughts ?
Would you ever consider renting a car to try and save money on your trip ?
Ana Portet has had an unusual commute to work .
At 7.30 am she popped down to Sants railway station in Barcelona .
Three hours later she was in a meeting with colleagues from her brewery firm , 315 miles away in Madrid .
" I 'll be back in Barcelona by half past five , " she said as her early afternoon bullet train flew back along the new high - speed tracks at up to 210 mph .
" It 's so quick , sometimes you are there before you have even noticed . "
Portet is one of hundreds of thousands of travellers who have migrated from the world 's busiest air shuttle , linking Madrid and Barcelona , to what is now Spain 's most popular train , the high - speed AVE .
The AVE , an intercom announcement has just told us , will leave us in the centre of Barcelona in two hours and 32 minutes .
With Madrid 's AVE station a short walk from the Prado museum , the journey is from one city centre to another .
What is more , the high - speed train does this in punctual , hassle - free and elegant style .
High - speed trains pulled by aerodynamic engines with noses shaped like a duck - billed platypus are grounding aircraft across Spain .
The year - old Barcelona - Madrid line has already taken 46 % of the traffic – stealing most of it from fuel - guzzling , carbon - emitting aircraft .
As the high - speed rail network spreads a web of tracks across Spain over the next decade , it threatens to relegate domestic air travel to a distant second place .
A high - speed network is not designed overnight .
Spain 's AVE story started in the 1980s , when the socialist prime minister Felipe González commissioned a line between Madrid and his home city of Seville .
The project was overshadowed by corruption scandals and greeted with a certain amount of scorn .
Why was sleepy Seville getting the line and not busy Barcelona ?
Some saw it as an expensive white elephant and a monument to González 's ego .
The line , however , was a spectacular success .
Remote Seville was suddenly two and a half hours from Madrid .
Spaniards , used to shabby , lumbering trains that crawled across the countryside following unpredictable timetables , discovered their trains could be stylish and run on time .
Previously the choice on the Madrid - Seville run was between a hot , tiring six - hour coach journey or an aircraft .
Seventeen years later , only one traveller out of 10 takes the plane to Seville .
The rest go by a train that is 99 % punctual .
The Seville line proved that high - speed trains could be part of the answer , albeit an expensive part , to some of Spain 's most enduring problems .
A country almost two and a half times the size of Britain , Spain is traversed by mountain ranges and wide rivers that act as barriers to communication .
Those barriers not only stopped many people getting to the biggest cities – with their universities and research hospitals , they also stopped Spaniards finding out about their own country .
EU funds were tapped to help railways and motorways bulldoze their way through these barriers .
Spain 's vast open spaces and fuss - free approach to planning meant , in theory , that a high - speed network could expand fast .
Governments of all colours were keen and regions competed to attract the lines .
Expanding the network , however , took much longer than expected .
The Barcelona - Madrid route was only the second major line to open – 16 years after Seville .
Financing , political squabbling over priority routes and the unexpected appearance of large holes under part of the Barcelona track kept pushing the inauguration date back .
Now it is as though the Barcelona AVE has always been there .
It has already improved the love life of 68 - year - old Wenceslao Gomez , who books ahead to get cheap fares as low as € 87 ( £ 73 ) return .
" My girlfriend lives in Barcelona and I live in Madrid , " he explained as a dramatic stretch of Spanish countryside rushed past .
" It 's a bit pricy , but I 'll never catch the plane again . "
Budget airlines offer cheaper prices but the regular air shuttle cannot compete , except on time .
For Balbinder Sandhu , a young British businessman who lives in Barcelona , the choice is clear .
" I used to catch the air shuttle with Iberia , " he said .
" But if I go to Madrid and back on the plane I am usually absolutely knackered .
Here we do n't have all the airport controls and you can turn up at the last minute . "
The prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , a socialist , is reaping the fruits of previous investment and giving the network its definitive push .
All over the country , work is going on building bridges , tunnels and laying high - speed track as a further € 108bn is poured into the network over the next 12 years .
By 2020 Spain will have Europe 's largest high - speed network , its 6,000 miles of track outgunning even France 's TGV system .
By then 90 % of the population will be within 30 miles of a station .
New lines have already been opened to Segovia , Valladolid and Malaga in the last 18 months .
New links will eventually connect France and Portugal .
Airlines have reacted by claiming the AVE receives unfair government support – and by cutting prices .
" Some airlines still have to learn that customer service is included in the price of a ticket , " said Josep Valls , a professor at the ESADE business school in Barcelona .
The high - speed train network also helps Spain control carbon emissions , with passengers on the Madrid - Barcelona line cutting their own emissions by 83 % on the trip .
Not all has been perfect in Spain 's high - speed world .
In the Basque country the violent separatist group Eta has hijacked an environmental campaign against the train .
Last year it shot Inazio Uria , a local contractor , because he had taken work on the line .
That , some say , was backhanded recognition of just how the train threatens to bring distant places such as the Basque country more tightly into Spain .
A young man I 'll call Alex recently graduated from Harvard .
As a history major , Alex wrote about a dozen papers a term .
He also ran a student organisation , for which he often worked more than 40 hours a week ; when he was n't working , he had classes .
Weeknights were devoted to all the schoolwork he could n't finish during the day , and weekend nights were spent drinking with friends and going to parties .
" Trite as it sounds , " he told me , it seemed important to " maybe appreciate my own youth " .
Since , in essence , this life was impossible , Alex began taking Adderall to make it possible .
Adderall , a stimulant composed of mixed amphetamine salts , is commonly prescribed for children and adults who have been given a diagnosis of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
But in recent years Adderall and Ritalin , another stimulant , have been adopted as cognitive enhancers : drugs that high - functioning , overcommitted people take to become higher - functioning and more overcommitted .
( Such use is " off label " , meaning that it does not have the approval of either the drug 's manufacturer or the FDA , America 's Food and Drug Administration . )
College campuses have become laboratories for experimentation with neuroenhancement , and Alex was an ingenious experimenter .
His brother had received a diagnosis of ADHD , and in his first year as an undergraduate Alex obtained an Adderall prescription for himself by describing to a doctor symptoms that he knew were typical of the disorder .
During his college years ,
Alex took 15 mg of Adderall most evenings , usually after dinner , guaranteeing that he would maintain intense focus while losing " any ability to sleep for approximately eight to 10 hours " .
In his second year , he persuaded the doctor to add a 30mg " extended - release " capsule to his daily regime .
Alex recalled one week during his junior year when he had four term papers due .
Minutes after waking on Monday , around 7.30 am , he swallowed some " immediate - release " Adderall .
The drug , along with a steady stream of caffeine , helped him to concentrate during classes and meetings , but he noticed some odd effects ; at a morning tutorial , he explained to me in an email , " I alternated between speaking too quickly and thoroughly on some subjects and feeling awkwardly quiet during other points of the discussion . "
Lunch was a blur : " It 's always hard to eat much when on Adderall . "
That afternoon he went to the library , where he spent " too much time researching a paper rather than actually writing it - a problem that is common to all intellectually curious students on stimulants " .
At eight he attended a two - hour meeting " with a group focused on student mental health issues " .
Alex then " took an extended - release Adderall " and worked productively on the paper all night .
At eight the next morning he attended a meeting of his student organisation ; he felt like " a zombie " and went back to his room .
He fell asleep until noon , waking " in time to polish my first paper and hand it in " .
I met Alex one evening last summer , at an appealingly scruffy bar in the New England city where he lives .
Skinny and bearded , and wearing faded hipster jeans , he looked like the lead singer in an indie band .
He was ingratiating and articulate , and smoked cigarettes with an ironic air of defiance .
Alex was happy enough to talk about his frequent use of Adderall at Harvard , but he did n't want to see his name in print ; he 's involved with an internet start - up and worried that potential investors might disapprove of his habit .
After we had ordered beers he said : " One of the most impressive features of being a student is how aware you are of a 24 - hour work cycle .
When you conceive of what you have to do for school , it 's not in terms of nine to five but in terms of what you can physically do in a week while still achieving a variety of goals - social , romantic , extracurricular , CV - building , academic . "
Alex was eager to dispel the notion that students who took Adderall were " academic automatons who are using it in order to be first in their class " .
In fact , he said , " it 's often people " - mainly guys - " who are looking in some way to compensate for activities that are detrimental to their performance " .
He explained , " At Harvard , at the most basic level , they aim to do better than they would have otherwise .
Everyone is aware that if you were up at 3 am writing this paper it is n't going to be as good as it could have been .
The fact that you were partying all weekend , or spent the last week being high , watching Lost - that 's going to take a toll . "
Alex 's sense of who uses stimulants for so - called " non-medical " purposes is borne out by two dozen or so scientific studies .
In 2005 a team led by Sean Esteban McCabe , a professor at the University of Michigan , reported that in the previous year 4.1 % of American undergraduates had taken prescription stimulants for off - label use - at one school the figure was 25 % , while a 2002 study at a small college found that more than 35 % of the students had used prescription stimulants non-medically in the previous year .
Drugs such as Adderall can cause nervousness , headaches , sleeplessness and decreased appetite , among other side - effects .
An FDA warning on Adderall 's label notes that " amphetamines have a high potential for abuse " and can lead to dependence .
( The label also mentions that adults using Adderall have reported serious cardiac problems , though the role of the drug in those cases is unknown . )
Yet college students tend to consider Adderall and Ritalin as benign , in part because they are likely to know peers who have taken the drugs since childhood for ADHD .
Indeed , McCabe reports , most students who use stimulants for cognitive enhancement obtain them from an acquaintance with a prescription .
Usually the pills are given away , but some students sell them .
According to McCabe 's research team , white male undergraduates at highly competitive schools are the most frequent student users of neuroenhancers .
Users are also more likely to belong to a fraternity or a sorority , and to have a grade point average ( GPA ) of 3.0 - ie satisfactory - or lower .
They are 10 times as likely to report that they have smoked marijuana in the past year and 20 times as likely to say that they have used cocaine .
In other words , they are decent students at schools where to be a great student you have to give up a lot more partying than they 're willing to give up .
The BoredAt websites - which allow college students to chat idly while they 're ostensibly studying - are filled with messages about Adderall .
Posts like these , from the BoredAtPenn site , are typical : " I have some Adderall - I 'm sitting by room 101.10 in a grey shirt and headphones " ; " I have Adderall for sale 20 mg for $ 15 " ; " I took Adderall at 8 pm , it 's 6:30 am and I 've barely blinked . "
On the Columbia site one poster complains that her friends take Adderall " like candy " , adding : " I do n't want to be at a disadvantage to everyone else .
Is it really that dangerous ?
My grades were n't that great this year and I could do with a bump . "
A Columbia student responds : " It 's probably not a good idea if you 're not prescribed " , but offers practical advice anyway : " Keep the dose normal and do n't grind them up or snort them . "
Occasional dissenters ( " I think there should be random drug testing at every exam " ) are drowned out by testimonials like this one , from the BoredAtHarvard site : " I do n't want to be a pusher or start people on something bad , but Adderall is amazing . "
Alex remains enthusiastic about Adderall , but he also has a slightly jaundiced critique of it .
" It only works as a cognitive enhancer insofar as you are dedicated to accomplishing the task at hand , " he said .
" The number of times I 've taken Adderall late at night and decided that , rather than starting my paper , hey , I 'll organise my entire music library !
I 've seen people obsessively cleaning their rooms on it . "
Alex thought that generally the drug helped him to bear down on his work , but it also tended to produce writing with a characteristic flaw .
" Often I 've looked back at papers I 've written on Adderall , and they 're verbose .
They 're labouring a point , trying to create this airtight argument .
I 'd produce two pages on something that could be said in a couple of sentences . "
Nevertheless , his Adderall - assisted papers usually earned him at least a B .
They got the job done .
As Alex put it : " Productivity is a good thing . "
Last April the scientific journal Nature published the results of an informal online poll asking whether readers attempted to sharpen " their focus , concentration , or memory " by taking drugs such as Ritalin and Provigil , a newer kind of stimulant , known generically as modafinil , which was developed to treat narcolepsy .
One in five respondents said they did .
A majority of the 1,400 readers who responded said that healthy adults should be permitted to take brain boosters for non-medical reasons , and 69 % said that mild side - effects were an acceptable risk .
Though a majority said that such drugs should not be made available to children who had no diagnosed medical condition , a third admitted that they would feel pressure to give " smart drugs " to their kids if they learned that other parents were doing so .
Such competitive anxieties are already being felt in the workplace .
Recently an advice column in Wired featured a question from a reader worried about " a rising star at the firm " who was " using unprescribed modafinil to work crazy hours .
Our boss has started getting on my case for not being as productive . "
And on internet forums such as ImmInst ( Immortality Institute ) , whose members share a nerdy passion for tweaking their cognitive function through drugs and supplements , people trade advice about dosages and " stacks " - improvised combinations - of neuroenhancers ( " Cut a tablet into fourths and took 25 mg every four hours , four times today , and had a great and productive day - with no side - effects " ) .
In one recent post a 52 - year - old - who was working full time , studying for an advanced degree at night and " married , etc " - wrote that after experimenting with modafinil he had settled on two daily doses of 100 mg each .
He believed that he was " performing a little better " , adding : " I also feel slightly more animated when in discussion . "
Not long ago I met Anjan Chatterjee , a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania , in his office at the labyrinthine Penn hospital complex .
Chatterjee 's main research interests are in subjects like the neurological basis of spatial understanding , but in the past few years , as he has heard more about students taking cognitive enhancers , he has begun writing about the ethical implications of such behaviour .
In 2004 he coined the term " cosmetic neurology " to describe the practice of using drugs developed for recognised medical conditions to strengthen ordinary cognition .
Chatterjee worries about cosmetic neurology , but he thinks that it will eventually become as acceptable as cosmetic surgery ; in fact with neuroenhancement it 's harder to argue that it 's frivolous .
As he notes in a 2007 paper : " Many sectors of society have winner - take - all conditions in which small advantages produce disproportionate rewards . "
At school and at work , the usefulness of being " smarter " , needing less sleep and learning more quickly is " abundantly clear " .
In the near future , he predicts , some neurologists will refashion themselves as " quality - of - life consultants " whose role will be " to provide information while abrogating final responsibility for these decisions to patients " .
The demand is certainly there : from an ageing population that wo n't put up with memory loss ; from overwrought parents bent on giving their children every possible edge ; from anxious employees in an efficiency - obsessed , BlackBerry - equipped office culture where work never really ends .
Chatterjee told me that many people who come to his clinic are cognitively preoccupied versions of what doctors call the " worried well " .
He had just seen a middle - aged woman , a successful Philadelphia lawyer , who mentioned having to struggle a bit to come up with certain names .
" Here 's an example of someone who by most measures is doing perfectly fine , " Chatterjee said .
" She 's not having any trouble at work .
But she notices she 's having some problems , and it 's very hard to know how much of that is just getting older . "
Of course , people in her position could strive to get regular exercise and plenty of intellectual stimulation , both of which have been shown to help maintain cognitive function .
But maybe they 're already doing so and want a bigger mental rev-up , or maybe they want something easier than sweaty workouts and Russian novels : they want a pill .
Recently I spoke on the phone with Barbara Sahakian , a clinical neuropsychologist at Cambridge University and the co-author of a 2007 article in Nature entitled " Professor 's Little Helper " .
Sahakian , who also consults for several pharmaceutical companies , and her co-author , Sharon Morein - Zamir , reported that a number of their colleagues were using prescription drugs like Adderall and Provigil .
Because the drugs are easy to buy online , they wrote , it would be difficult to stop their spread :
" The drive for self - enhancement of cognition is likely to be as strong if not stronger than in the realms of ' enhancement ' of beauty and sexual function . "
( In places like Cambridge , at least . )
When I spoke with Sahakian she had just flown from England to Scottsdale , Arizona , to attend a conference , and she was tired .
" We may be healthy and high - functioning , and think of ourselves that way , " she told me , " but it 's very rare that we are actually functioning at our optimal level .
Take me .
I 'm over here and I 've got jet lag and I 've got to give a talk tonight and perform well in what will be the middle of the night , UK time . "
She mentioned businessmen who have to fly back and forth across the Atlantic : " The difference between making a deal and not is huge , and they sometimes only have one meeting to try and do it . "
She added : " We are a society that so wants a quick fix that many people are happy to take drugs . "
For the moment , people looking for that particular quick fix have a limited choice of meds .
But given the amount of money and research hours being spent on developing drugs to treat cognitive decline , Provigil and Adderall are likely to be joined by a bigger pharmacopoeia .
Among the drugs in the pipeline are ampakines , which target a type of glutamate receptor in the brain ; it is hoped that they may stem the memory loss associated with diseases like Alzheimer's .
But ampakines may also give healthy people a palpable cognitive boost .
A 2007 study of 16 healthy elderly volunteers found that 500mg of one particular ampakine " unequivocally " improved short - term memory , though it appeared to detract from episodic memory - the recall of past events .
Another class of drugs , cholinesterase inhibitors , which are already being used with some success to treat Alzheimer 's patients , have also shown promise as neuroenhancers .
In one study the drug donepezil strengthened the performance of pilots on flight simulators ; in another , of 30 healthy young male volunteers , it improved verbal and visual episodic memory .
Several pharmaceutical companies are working on drugs that target nicotine receptors in the brain in the hope that they can replicate the cognitive uptick that smokers get from cigarettes .
Zack and Casey Lynch are a young couple who , in 2005 , launched NeuroInsights , a company that advises investors on developments in brain - science technology .
( Since then , they 've also founded a lobbying group , the Neurotechnology Industry Organization . )
Casey and Zack met as undergraduates at UCLA ; she went on to get a master 's in neuroscience and he became an executive at a software company .
Last summer I had coffee with them in San Francisco and they both spoke with casual certainty about the coming market for neuroenhancers .
Zack , whose book , The Neuro Revolution , was published in July , said : " We live in an information society .
What 's the next form of human society ?
The neuro - society . "
In coming years , he said , scientists will understand the brain better , and we 'll have improved neuroenhancers that some people will use therapeutically , others because they are " on the borderline of needing them therapeutically " and others purely " for competitive advantage " .
Zack explained that he did n't really like the term enhancement : " We 're not talking about superhuman intelligence .
No one 's saying we 're coming out with a pill that 's going to make you smarter than Einstein !
What we 're really talking about is enabling people . "
He sketched a bell curve on the back of a napkin .
" Almost every drug in development is something that will take someone who 's working at , like , 40 % or 50 % , and take them up to 80 , " he said .
New psychiatric drugs have a way of creating markets for themselves .
Disorders often become widely diagnosed after drugs come along that can alter a set of suboptimal behaviours .
In this way Ritalin and Adderall helped make ADHD a household name , and advertisements for antidepressants have helped define shyness as a malady .
If there 's a pill that can clear up the wavering focus of sleep - deprived youth or mitigate the tip - of - the - tongue experience of middle age , then those rather ordinary states may come to be seen as syndromes .
As Casey put it : " The drugs get better , and the markets become bigger . "
" Yes , " Zack said .
" We call it the lifestyle - improvement market . "
The Lynches said that Provigil was a classic example of a related phenomenon : mission creep .
In 1998 , Cephalon , the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it , received US government approval to market the drug but only for " excessive daytime sleepiness " due to narcolepsy ; by 2004 , Cephalon had obtained permission to expand the labelling so that it included sleep apnoea and " shift - work sleep disorder " .
Net sales of Provigil climbed from $ 196 m in 2002 to $ 988 m in 2008 .
Cephalon executives have repeatedly said that they do not condone off - label use of Provigil , but in 2002 the company was reprimanded by the FDA for distributing marketing materials that presented the drug as a remedy for tiredness , " decreased activity " and other supposed ailments .
And in 2008 Cephalon paid $ 425 m and pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge relating to its promotion of off - label uses for Provigil and two other drugs .
Later this year , Cephalon plans to introduce Nuvigil , a longer - lasting variant of Provigil .
Candace Steele , a spokesperson , said : " We 're exploring its possibilities to treat excessive sleepiness associated with schizophrenia , bipolar depression , traumatic injury and jet lag . "
Though she emphasised that Cephalon was not developing Nuvigil as a neuroenhancer , she noted : " As part of the preparation for some of these diseases , we 're looking to see if there 's improvement in cognition . "
Unlike many hypothetical scenarios that bioethicists worry about - human clones , " designer babies " - cognitive enhancement is already in full swing .
But how much do they actually help ?
Are they potentially harmful or addictive ?
Then there 's the question of what we mean by " smarter " .
Could enhancing one kind of thinking exact a toll on others ?
All these questions need proper scientific answers , but for now much of the discussion is taking place furtively , among the increasing number of people who are performing daily experiments on their own brains .
Paul Phillips was unusual for a professional poker player .
When he joined the circuit in the late 1990s he was already a millionaire : a twentysomething tech guy who helped found an internet portal called go2net and cashed in at the right moment .
He was cerebral and at times brusque .
On the international poker scene Phillips cultivated a geeky New Wave style .
He wore vintage shirts in wild geometric patterns ; his hair was dyed orange or silver one week , shaved off the next .
Most unusual of all , Phillips talked freely about taking prescription drugs - Adderall and , especially , Provigil - in order to play better cards .
He first took up the game in 1995 , when he was in college .
He recalled : " It was very mathematical , but you could also inject yourself into the game and manipulate the other guy with words " - more so than in a game like chess .
Phillips soon felt that he had mastered the strategic aspects of poker .
The key variable was execution .
At tournaments he needed to be able to stay focused for 14 hours at a stretch , often for several days , but he found it difficult to do so .
In 2003 , a doctor gave him a diagnosis of ADHD and he began taking Adderall .
Within six months , he had won $ 1.6 m at poker - far more than he'd won in the previous four years .
Adderall not only helped him concentrate , it also helped him resist the impulse to keep playing losing hands out of boredom .
In 2004 , Phillips asked his doctor to give him a prescription for Provigil , which he added to his Adderall regimen .
He took 200 - 300 mg of Provigil a day , which he felt helped him settle into an even more serene and objective state of mindfulness ; as he put it , he felt " less like a participant than an observer - and a very effective one " .
Though Phillips sees neuroenhancers as essentially steroids for the brain , they have n't yet been banned from poker competitions .
Last summer , I visited Phillips in the high desert resort town of Bend , Oregon , where he lives with his wife , Kathleen , and their two daughters , Ivy and Ruby .
Phillips , who is now 36 , took me for coffee at a cheery café called Thump .
Wearing shorts , flip - flops and a black T - shirt , he said : " Poker is about sitting in one place , watching your opponents for a long time , and making better observations about them than they make about you . "
With Provigil , he " could process all the information about what was going on at the table and do something about it " .
Though there is no question that Phillips became much more successful at poker after taking neuroenhancers , I asked him if his improvement could be explained by a placebo effect , or by coincidence .
He doubted it , but allowed that it could .
Still , he said , " there 's a sort of clarity I get with Provigil .
With Adderall , I 'd characterise the effect as correction - correction of an underlying condition .
Provigil feels like enhancement . "
And , whereas Adderall made him " jittery " , Provigil 's effects were " completely limited to my brain " .
He had " zero difficulty sleeping " .
On the other hand , Phillips said , Provigil 's effects " have attenuated over time .
The body is an amazing adjusting machine , and there 's no upside that I 've been able to see to just taking more . "
A few years ago Phillips tired of poker and started playing competitive Scrabble .
He was good , but not that good .
He was older than many of his rivals and he needed to undertake a lot of rote memorisation , which did n't come as easily as it once had .
" I stopped short of memorising the entire dictionary , and to be really good you have to get up to eight - and nine - letter words , " he told me .
" But I did learn every word up to five letters , plus maybe 10,000 seven - and eight - letter words . "
Provigil , he said , helped with the memorisation process but , " it 's not going to make you smarter .
It 's going to make you better able to use the tools you have for a sustained period . "
Similarly , a 74 - year - old who published a letter in Nature last year offered a charmingly specific description of his modafinil habit : " Previously I could work competently on the fracture - mechanics of high - silica stone ( while replicating ancient tool - flaking techniques ) for about an hour .
With modafinil I could continue for almost three hours . "
Cephalon has publicly downplayed the idea that the drug can be used as a smart pill .
In 2007 , the company 's founder and CEO , Frank Baldino Jr , told the trade journal Pharmaceutical Executive : " I think if you 're tired , Provigil will keep you awake .
If you 're not tired , it 's not going to do anything . "
But Baldino may have been overly modest .
In 2002 , researchers at Cambridge University gave 60 healthy young male volunteers a battery of standard cognitive tests .
One group received modafinil , the other a placebo .
The modafinil group performed better on several tasks , such as the " digit span " test , in which subjects are asked to repeat increasingly longer strings of numbers forwards , then backwards .
They also did better in recognising repeated visual patterns and at a spatial - planning challenge known as the Tower of London task .
( It 's not nearly as fun as it sounds . )
Writing in the journal Psychopharmacology , the study 's authors said the results suggested that " modafinil offers significant potential as a cognitive enhancer " .
Phillips told me that , much as he believes in neuroenhancers , he did not want to be " the poster boy for smart - in - a - pill " .
At one point , he said : " We really do n't know the possible implications for long - term use of these things . "
( He recently stopped taking Provigil every day , replacing it with another prescription stimulant . )
Nor does he think we need to be turning up the crank another notch on how hard we work .
" But , " he said , " the baseline competitive level is going to reorientate around what these drugs make possible , and you can choose to compete or not . "
Provigil may well confer a temporary advantage on healthy people , but this does n't mean that it 's ready to replace your morning espresso .
Anjan Chatterjee told me that there " just are n't enough studies of these drugs in normal people " .
One study , published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association , suggests that Provigil can be habit - forming .
A group led by Nora Volkow , the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , scanned the brains of 10 men after they had been given a placebo , and also after they had been given a dose of modafinil .
The modafinil appeared to lead to an increase in the brain chemical dopamine .
" Because drugs that increase dopamine have the potential for abuse , " Volkow 's report concluded , " these results suggest that risk for addiction in vulnerable persons merits heightened awareness . "
( Cephalon , in a response to the report , notes that Provigil 's label urges physicians to monitor patients closely , especially those with a history of drug abuse .
)
On the website Erowid , where people vividly and anonymously report their experiences with legal and illegal drugs , some modafinil users have described a dependency on the drug .
One man , who identified himself as a former biochemistry student , said that he had succeeded in kicking cocaine and opiate habits but could n't stop using modafinil .
Whenever he ran out of the drug , he said , " I start to freak out . "
After " four to five days " without it , " the head fog starts to come back " .
Eliminating foggy - headedness seems to be the goal of many users of neuroenhancers .
But can today 's drugs actually accomplish this ?
I recently posed this question to Chatterjee 's colleague Martha Farah , who is a psychologist at Penn and the director of its Center for Cognitive Neuroscience .
She is deeply fascinated by , and mildly critical of , neuroenhancers , but basically in favour - with the important caveat that we need to know much more about how these drugs work .
While Farah does not take neuroenhancers , she had just finished a paper in which she reviewed the evidence on prescription stimulants as neuroenhancers from 40 laboratory studies involving healthy subjects .
Most of the studies looked at one of three types of cognition : learning , working memory , and cognitive control .
A typical learning test asks subjects to memorise a list of paired words ; an hour , a few days , or a week later , they are presented with the first words in the pairs and asked to come up with the second .
Neuroenhancers did improve retention , especially where subjects had been asked to remember information for several days or longer .
Working memory has been likened to a mental scratch pad : you use it to keep relevant data in mind while you 're completing a task .
( Imagine a cross-examination , in which a lawyer has to keep track of the answers a witness has given and formulate new questions based on them . )
In one common test subjects are shown a series of items - usually letters or numbers - and then presented with challenges : was this number or letter in the series ?
Was this one ?
In the working - memory tests , subjects performed better on neuroenhancers , though several of the studies suggested that the effect depended on how good a subject 's working memory was to begin with : the better it was , the less benefit the drugs provided .
The third category was cognitive control - how effectively you can check yourself in circumstances where the most natural response is the wrong one .
A classic test is the Stroop Task , in which people are shown the name of a colour ( let 's say orange ) written in a different colour ( let 's say purple ) .
They 're asked to read the word ( which is easy , because our habitual response to a word is to read it ) or to name the ink colour ( which is harder , because our first impulse is to say " orange " ) .
These studies presented a more mixed picture , but overall they showed some benefit " for most normal healthy subjects " - especially for people who had inherently poorer cognitive control .
Farah told me : " These drugs will definitely help some technically normal people - that is , people who do n't meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD or any kind of cognitive impairment . "
But , she emphasised , " They will help people in the lower end of the ability range more than in the higher end . "
One explanation for this phenomenon might be that the more adept you are at a given task , the less room you have to improve .
Farah has a hunch that there may be another reason that existing drugs - so far , at least - do n't offer as much help to people with greater intellectual abilities .
Drugs like Ritalin and Adderall work in part by elevating the amount of dopamine in the brain .
Dopamine is something you want just enough of : too little , and you may not be as alert and motivated as you need to be ; too much , and you may feel overstimulated .
Neuroscientists have discovered that some people have a gene that leads the brain to break down dopamine faster , leaving less of it available ; such people are generally a little worse at certain cognitive tasks .
People with more available dopamine are generally somewhat better at the same tasks .
It makes sense , then , that people with naturally low dopamine would benefit more from an artificial boost .
Of course learning , working memory and cognitive control represent just a few aspects of thinking .
Farah concluded that studies looking at other kinds of cognition - verbal fluency , for instance - were too few and too contradictory to tell us much .
Both Chatterjee and Farah have wondered whether drugs that heighten users ' focus might dampen their creativity .
After all , some of our best ideas come to us not when we sit down at a desk but rather when we 're in the shower or walking the dog - letting our minds roam .
Jimi Hendrix reported that the inspiration for " Purple Haze " came to him in a dream ; the chemist Friedrich August Kekule claimed that he discovered the ring structure of benzene during a reverie in which he saw the image of a snake biting its tail .
Farah told me : " There is some evidence that suggests that individuals who are better able to focus on one thing and filter out distractions tend to be less creative .
" More and more of our young people are using these drugs to help them work .
They 've got their laptop , their iPhone , and their Adderall .
This rising generation of workers and leaders may have a subtly different style of thinking and working , because they 're using these drugs or because they learned to work using these drugs , so that even if you take the drugs away they 'll still have a certain approach .
I 'm a little concerned that we could be raising a generation of very focused accountants . "
Farah has also been considering the ethical complications resulting from the rise of smart drugs .
Do n't neuroenhancers confer yet another advantage on the kind of people who already can afford private tutors ?
Writing last year in the Cavalier Daily , the student newspaper of the University of Virginia , a columnist named Greg Crapanzano argued that neuroenhancers " create an unfair advantage for the users who are willing to break the law in order to gain an edge .
These students create work that is dependent on the use of a pill rather than their own work ethic . "
Of course , it 's hard to imagine a university administration that would require students to pee in a cup before entering an exam hall .
And even with the aid of a neuroenhancer , you still have to write the essay , conceive the screenplay or finish the grant proposal .
Moreover , if you can take credit for work you 've done on caffeine or nicotine , then you can take credit for work produced on Provigil .
Farah questions the idea that neuroenhancers will expand inequality .
Citing the " pretty clear trend across the studies that say neuroenhancers will be less helpful for people who score above average " , she said that cognitive - enhancing pills could actually become levellers if they are dispensed cheaply .
A 2007 discussion paper published by the British Medical Association ( BMA ) also makes this point : " Selective use of neuroenhancers among those with lower intellectual capacity , or those from deprived backgrounds who do not have the benefit of additional tuition , could enhance the educational opportunities for those groups . "
If the idea of giving a pill as a substitute for better teaching seems repellent - like substituting an IV drip of synthetic nutrition for actual food - it may be preferable to a scenario in which only wealthy kids receive a frequent mental boost .
Farah was one of several scholars who contributed to a recent article in Nature , " Towards Responsible Use of Cognitive Enhancing Drugs by the Healthy " .
The optimistic tone of the article suggested that some bioethicists are leaning towards endorsing neuroenhancement .
" Like all new technologies , cognitive enhancement can be used well or poorly , " the article declared .
" We should welcome new methods of improving our brain function .
In a world in which human workspans and lifespans are increasing , cognitive - enhancement tools - including the pharmacological - will be increasingly useful for improved quality of life and extended work productivity , as well as to stave off normal and pathological age - related cognitive declines .
Safe and effective cognitive enhancers will benefit both the individual and society . "
The BMA report offered a similarly upbeat observation : " Universal access to enhancing interventions would bring up the baseline level of cognitive ability , which is generally seen to be a good thing . "
And yet when enthusiasts share their vision of our neuroenhanced future it can sound dystopian .
Zack Lynch , of NeuroInsights , gave me a rationale for smart pills that I found particularly grim .
" If you 're a 55 - year - old in Boston , you have to compete with a 26 - year - old from Mumbai now , and those kinds of pressures are only going to grow , " he began .
Countries other than the US might tend to be a little looser with their regulations and offer approval of new cognitive enhancers first .
" And if you 're a company that 's got 47 offices worldwide , and all of a sudden your Singapore office is using cognitive enablers , and you 're saying to Congress : ' I 'm moving all my financial operations to Singapore and Taiwan , because it 's legal to use those there ' , you bet that Congress is going to say : ' Well , OK . '
It will be a moot question then .
It would be like saying : ' No , you ca n't use a cell phone .
It might increase productivity ! ' "
If we eventually decide that neuroenhancers work , and are basically safe , will we one day enforce their use ?
Lawmakers might compel certain workers - A&E doctors , air - traffic controllers - to take them .
( Indeed , the US Air Force already makes modafinil available to pilots embarking on long missions . )
For the rest of us , the pressure will be subtler - that queasy feeling I get when I remember that my younger colleague is taking Provigil to meet deadlines .
All this may be leading to a kind of society I 'm not sure I want to live in : a society where we 're even more overworked and driven by technology than we already are , and where we have to take drugs to keep up ; a society where we give children academic steroids along with their daily vitamins .
Paul McHugh , a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University , has written sceptically about cosmetic neurology .
In a 2004 essay he notes that at least once a year in his private practice he sees a young person - usually a boy - whose parents worry that his school performance could be better and want a medication that will assure it .
In most of these cases " the truth is that the son does not have the superior IQ of his parents " , though the boy may have other qualities that surpass those of his parents - he may be " handsome , charming , athletic , graceful " .
McHugh sees his job as trying to get the parents to " forget about adjusting him to their aims , with medication or anything else " .
When I spoke with him on the phone , McHugh expanded on this point : " Maybe it 's wrong - headed trying to fit people into the world , rather than trying to make the world a better place for people .
And if the idea is that the only college your child can go to is Harvard , well , maybe that 's the idea that needs righting . "
If Alex , the Harvard student , and Paul Phillips , the poker player , consider their use of neuroenhancers a private act , Nicholas Seltzer sees his habit as a pursuit that aligns him with a larger movement for improving humanity .
Seltzer 's job as a researcher at a defence - oriented thinktank in northern Virginia has not left him feeling as intellectually alive as he would like .
To compensate , he writes papers in his spare time on subjects like " human biological evolution and warfare " .
Seltzer , 30 , told me he worried that he " did n't have the mental energy , the endurance , the ... the sponginess that I seem to recall having when I was younger " .
This is not something you notice when you talk to Seltzer .
And though our memory is probably at its peak in our early 20s , few 30 - year - olds are aware of a deficit .
But Seltzer considers himself a transhumanist , in the mould of the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom and the futuristic writer and inventor Ray Kurzweil .
Transhumanists are interested in robots , cryogenics and living a really , really long time ; they consider biological limitations that the rest of us might accept , or even appreciate , as creaky obstacles to be aggressively surmounted .
On the ImmInst ( Immortality Institute ) forums , Seltzer and other members discuss life - extension strategies and the potential benefits of cognitive enhancers .
Some members , Seltzer among them , use a drug called piracetam , which was first marketed by a Belgian pharmaceutical company in 1972 and in recent years has become available in the US from retailers that sell supplements .
Although not approved for any use by the FDA , piracetam has been used experimentally on stroke patients - to little effect - and on patients with a rare neurological condition called progressive myoclonus epilepsy , for whom it proved helpful in alleviating muscle spasms .
Data on piracetam 's benefits for healthy people is virtually nonexistent , but many users believe that the drug increases blood flow to the brain .
Using neuroenhancers , Seltzer said , " is like customising yourself - customising your brain " .
For some people , he added , it was important to enhance their mood , so they took antidepressants ; but for people like him it was more important " to increase mental horsepower " .
He said : " It 's fundamentally a choice you 're making about how you want to experience consciousness . "
Whereas the 1990s had been about " the personalisation of technology " , this decade was about the personalisation of the brain - what some enthusiasts have begun to call " mind hacking " .
Of course the idea behind mind hacking is n't exactly new .
Sir Francis Bacon consumed everything from tobacco to saffron in the hope of goosing his brain .
Balzac reputedly fuelled 16 - hour bouts of writing with copious servings of coffee , which , he wrote , " chases away sleep and gives us the capacity to engage a little longer in the exercise of our intellects " .
Sartre dosed himself with speed in order to finish Critique of Dialectical Reason .
Seltzer and his interlocutors on the ImmInst forum are just the latest members of a seasoned cohort , even if they have more complex pharmaceuticals at their disposal .
I eventually met Seltzer in an underground food court not far from the Pentagon .
He 's slim , with a shaved head , and he spoke precisely , rarely stumbling over his words .
I asked him if he had any ethical worries about smart drugs .
After a pause , he said that he might have a concern if somebody popped a neuroenhancer before taking a licensing exam that certified him as , say , a brain surgeon , and then stopped using the drug .
Other than that he could n't see a problem .
He said that he was a firm believer in the idea that " we should have a fair degree of liberty to do with our bodies and our minds as we see fit , so long as it does n't impinge on the basic rights , liberty and safety of others " .
He argued : " Why would you want an upward limit on the intellectual capabilities of a human being ?
And , if you have a very nationalist viewpoint , why would n't you want our country to have the advantage over other countries , particularly in what some people call a knowledge - based economy ? "
He went on : " Think about the complexity of the intellectual tasks that people need to accomplish today .
Just trying to understand what Congress is doing is not a simple thing !
The complexity of understanding the gamut of scientific and technical and social issues is difficult .
If we had a tool that enabled more people to understand the world at a greater level of sophistication , how can we prejudice ourselves against the notion simply because we do n't like athletes to do it ?
To me it does n't seem like the same question .
And it deserves its own debate . "
Seltzer had never had a diagnosis of any kind of learning disorder .
But he added : " Though I would n't say I 'm dyslexic , sometimes when I type prose , after I look back and read it , I 've frequently left out words or interposed words , and sometimes I have difficulty concentrating . "
As a student Seltzer used both Adderall and piracetam .
Now , after a hiatus of several years , he has recently resumed taking neuroenhancers .
In addition to piracetam , he took a stack of supplements that he thought helped his brain to function : fish oils , five antioxidants , a product called ChocoMind and a number of others , all available at the health - food store .
He was thinking about adding modafinil , but had n't yet .
For breakfast every morning he concocted a slurry of oatmeal , berries , soy milk , pomegranate juice , flaxseed , almond meal , raw eggs and protein powder .
The goal behind the recipe was efficiency : to rely on " one goop you could eat or drink that would have everything you need nutritionally for your brain and body .
I wanted to be able to keep it down - that was it . "
( He told me this in the kitchen of his apartment ; he lives with a roommate , who walked in while we were talking , listened perplexedly for a moment , then put a frozen pizza in the oven . )
Seltzer 's decision to take piracetam was based on his own online reading , which included medical - journal abstracts .
He had n't consulted a doctor .
Since settling on a daily regime of supplements , he had sensed an improvement in his intellectual work and his ability to engage in stimulating conversation .
He continued : " I feel I 'm better able to articulate my thoughts .
I 'm sure you 've been in the zone - you 're having a really exciting debate with somebody , your brain feels alive .
I feel that more .
But I do n't want to say that it's this profound change . "
I asked him if piracetam made him feel smarter , or just more alert and confident - a little better equipped to marshal the resources he naturally had .
" Maybe , " he said .
" I 'm not sure what being smarter means , entirely .
It 's a difficult quality to measure .
It 's the Gestalt factor , all these qualities coming together - not only your ability to crunch some numbers , or remember some figures or a sequence of numbers , but also your ability to maintain a certain emotional state that is conducive to productive intellectual work .
I do feel I 'm more intelligent with the drugs , but I can't give you a number of IQ points . "
The effects of piracetam on healthy volunteers have been studied even less than those of Adderall or modafinil .
Most peer - reviewed studies focus on its effects on dementia or on people who have suffered a seizure or a concussion .
Many of the studies that look at other neurological effects were performed on rats and mice .
Piracetam 's mechanisms of action are not understood , though it may increase levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine .
In 2008 a committee of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the clinical trials of piracetam for dementia were methodologically flawed .
Another published review of the available studies of the drug concluded that the evidence " does not support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive impairment " , but suggested that further investigation might be warranted .
I asked Seltzer if he thought he should wait for scientific ratification of piracetam .
He laughed .
" I do n't want to , " he said .
" Because it 's working . "
It makes no sense to ban the use of neuroenhancers .
Too many people are already taking them , and the users tend to be educated and privileged people who proceed with just enough caution to avoid getting into trouble .
Besides , Anjan Chatterjee is right that there is an apt analogy with plastic surgery .
In a consumer society like ours , if people are properly informed about the risks and benefits of neuroenhancers , they can make their own choices about how to alter their minds , just as they can make their own decisions about shaping their bodies .
Still , even if you acknowledge that cosmetic neurology is here to stay , there is something dispiriting about the way the drugs are used - the kind of aspirations they open up , or do n't .
Jonathan Eisen , an evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Davis , is sceptical of what he mockingly calls " brain doping " .
During a recent conversation , he spoke about colleagues who take neuroenhancers in order to grind out grant proposals .
" It 's weird to me that people are taking these drugs to write grants , " he said .
" I mean , if you came up with some really interesting paper that was spurred by taking some really interesting drug - magic mushrooms or something - that would make more sense to me .
In the end you 're only as good as the ideas you 've come up with . "
But it 's not the mind - expanding 1960s any more .
Every era , it seems , has its own defining drug .
Neuroenhancers are perfectly suited to the anxiety of white - collar competition in a floundering economy .
And they have a synergistic relationship with our multiplying digital technologies : the more gadgets we own , the more distracted we become and the more we need help in order to focus .
The experience that neuroenhancement offers is not , for the most part , about opening the doors of perception , or about breaking the bonds of the self , or about experiencing a surge of genius .
It 's about squeezing out an extra few hours to finish those sales figures when you 'd really rather collapse into bed ; getting a B instead of a B - minus on the final exam in a lecture class where you spent half your time texting ; cramming for the GREs ( postgraduate entrance exams ) at night , because the information - industry job you got after college turned out to be deadening .
Neuroenhancers do n't offer freedom .
Rather , they facilitate a pinched , unromantic , grindingly efficient form of productivity .
Last winter , I spoke again with Alex , the Harvard graduate , and found that , after a break of several months , he had gone back to taking Adderall - a small dose every day .
He felt that he was learning to use the drug in a more " disciplined " manner .
Now , he said , it was less about staying up late to finish work he should have done earlier , and more " about staying focused on work , which makes me want to work longer hours " .
What employer would object to that ?

WORLD SCIENCE FESTIVAL - NOTES AND NEURONS IN SEARCH OF THE COMMON CHORUS
MCFERRIN : ( Vocalizing )
[ 00:00:05 ] MCFERRIN : ( Vocalizing )
[ 00:09:24 ] MCFERRIN : Okay .
I got to sing a blues tune .
I have to .
MCFERRIN : ( Singing )
JOHN SCHAEFER , RADIO HOST : Well , I ’m not sure what we can follow Bobby McFerrin with , but we ’ll come up with something .
The program , is Notes and Neurons .
And what just happened here ?
I mean Bobby McFerrin sat at center stage and performed a couple of pieces of music that none of us had ever heard before .
And yet you were picking up on these very clear cues and we ’re not just understanding what Bobby was doing , but actually becoming part of the process of making music .
How does something like that happened ?
How does our brain know how to process and decode the cues that Bobby is giving you ?
That ’s kind of what we ’re going to be talking about on the stage here tonight with a very distinguished panel that of course includes to my far left , the one and only Bobby McFerrin .
To his right is Lawrence Parsons , who ’s a neuroscientist at Sheffield University in the UK .
Daniel Levitin is a neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada and the author of two best selling books , The World in Six Songs , which comes out in paperback next month .
And This Is Your Brain on Music .
And Jamshed Bharucha to my immediate left is the provost at Tufts University neuroscientist and my guest just this afternoon on WNYC Sound Check .
So Dan .
Let me start with you .
How does something like this happened ?
Why does neuroscience concern itself with questions like this these days ?
[ 00:15:02 ] DANIEL LEVITIN , PSYCHOLOGIST :
It might not be obvious that neuroscience , which is the study of how neurons communicate with one another and how they assemble into circuits that govern the brain .
It might not be obvious why a neuroscientists would be interested in music , but the answer is that neuroscience is interested with human behavior in all of its aspects and all of its manifestations .
And one might argue that there are few things more human than music .
Music is a a very important part of our lives and it has been part of the daily lives of humans as far back as we know , as far back as as you can look in history , pre-history .
And neuroscience is just in the last 20 years , changed the tools necessary to really look at the living brain in action and ask some of the most interesting and thought - provoking questions about where music happens in the brain and how .
SCHAEFER : Jamshed , we like to say music is the universal language .
Is it truly universal or is it a series of dialects where you know , it might be difficult for a person from one culture to understand the quote on quote language of the music of another ?
JAMSHED BHARUCHA , COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENTIST :
It is often said that music is the universal language , particularly of the emotions and there ’s some truth to that , but it ’s not entirely true .
There are aspects of music clearly that are culturally very , very specific .
And that really people who have grown up in that culture or have been immersed in it can share .
SCHAEFER : Bobby , the blues is specific to a culture .
But what you started with tonight could have come from anywhere or nowhere .
I mean , are you sort of consciously going for something universal ?
BOBBY MCFERRIN , MUSICIAN : No , I ’m not really sure exactly what ’s going to happen in the very beginning .
It ’s the joy that I get from just simply watching things as they come out and develop is really what I like to begin with .
I ’d like to start some place that is unfamiliar to me and simply watch where it goes .
I ’m sure I ’m going to learn quite a bit of things , quite a few things tonight listening to you all talk , but I have a feeling that most everyone here , it ’s some place inside of them .
They have a sincere desire to participate , to become part of something which is a very strong need , I think in all of us to be part of some kind of a community , have some kind of a relationship , whether it ’s with another person or with music .
And so I find very , very easily regardless of what country or culture that I ’m in to give an invitation for people to sing and they readily jump on it .
They might be a little hesitant at first , because usually in performances , you know , the artist does not invite someone so- a room of strangers to just come in and play .
They might be a little hesitant , but I sincerely believe that everyone wants to and that ’s - that gives me tremendous joy .
SCHAEFER : Jamshed is that one of the universals , is that one of the things that you can , that we can agree is a universal ?
BHARUCHA : Oh absolutely .
One of the primordial functions , is to breed , foster social cohesion and really get people ’s brain states aligned so that they can form a larger community than themselves .
SCHAEFER : Larry , one of the things Bobby just said was , you know , somewhere inside them people want to be involved .
When we get involved in music , we often think that the part of our body that ’s getting involved is a little bit lower than the brain and it can be different body parts depending on the different types of music .
Can you explain to us - it ’s a family program and we ’re going to keep it that way .
Can you explain to us , you know , how it is that the brain is really what we ’re talking about when we talk about how we respond to music .
LAWRENCE PARSONS , NEUROSCIENTIST :
It does remind me bit of somebody who said that - maybe it was Woody Allen who said something about the sexiest organ in your body is your brain .
Well , the same is true as music actually .
And that ’s probably why neuroscientists are so interested in it , neuroscientists who are interested in the central nervous system , which is the brain .
And what we ’ll do , is just go through a few things that we ’ve learned about brain basis of music , music in it ’s all possible manifestations .
And when we say music as probably it ’s clear from what we just saw from Bobby , we made music and dance .
There ’s a physicality to it and also a participatory element too and the socialized element to it .
But just looking at a single person ’s brain in order to understand this , we can sort of summarize on this slide which has obviously at scientific tactical summary of the different regions of the brain that are involved in this .
[ 00:20:11 ] PARSONS :
And two basic things that are important to keep in mind .
One is that there is no single part of the brain that ’s sort of small and specialized for all the things that we call music .
And the second part of it is that all the , in a sense , almost every part of the brain as we know it , including the central as well as the peripheral nervous system or more tactically the Cortex , the subcortex , and the cerebellum .
All of those areas both left and right in each of us , gets involved in some way , in some element of some kinds of musical experiences .
So in a single phrase , music is a whole nervous system activity .
Even when you ’re listening in a most passive way , you ’re often what we say implicitly involved with your whole body in the musical experience .
But in particular when you ’re playing , even if you ’re not doing something of this sort of , you ’re doing something of the sort that those folks over there are going to do later or have been doing .
Then even then you get your whole body involved .
But your body is only organized by the activity of the cells in the brain , which Jamshed mentioned earlier .
So to briefly summarize , what we ’ll do is we ’ll walk through this a little bit and walk through the different stations which all interact quickly and dynamically over time , more or less in what we call parallel , that ’s all circulating in activating at the same time dynamically to create the things that we think of as music , dance , and all the emotional experiences and social experiences that go with it .
So what we have here is areas that the brain that are specialized for auditory , for physical body movement , for visual processing .
When you - visual is a part of the music experience .
Your own personalities , memories and associations you have with the sounds that you hear with the music , expectations you have , as you ’ve learned to understand the music that you ’re familiar with , you have a sense of where it ’s going , what would happen next .
And you ’re surprised often , you ’re intrigued , you ’re seduced .
And then a wide range of emotional experiences and manifestations related to music .
Music speaks a particular kind of emotional language that ’s different than other emotions .
You can have emotions when you meet the first love of your life , when you ’re hungry , and a wide range of kinds of emotions .
You can have music seems to tap partially into those kinds of emotional experiences , but then have other kinds of components .
Deep - primordial is a good word , deep social and primordial abstract kinds of emotions .
So to go through just brief , so there ’s a , this is a small section of immediate auditory regions and it goes all the way down here for a musical auditory structure in particular .
This is a set of areas here on the inside and the medial temporal and other areas that are representing the memories and associations and past general knowledge .
Here ’s another set of areas in that , in what we call the pre-frontal and inferior frontal region that are driving and maintaining these representations of expectancy .
What should happen next in a broad sense of planning ?
What do you think is going to happen ?
If you ’re performing you have to improvise or carry out a scripted piece of performance and these areas are involved in supporting that kind of knowledge and performance as well .
Then you have areas that are involved in organizing the movement .
If you ’re dancing , if you ’re playing the music , you ’re doing both .
There ’s a lot of sensory motor activity , so you move your body and you sense that it ’s moving and you change the way you ’re moving in order to connect with what you ’re sensing and what you intended to do .
All of these things happened there in these different brain areas .
And then I think the last is the sensory area as well , and visual representation .
And in this slide here represents sort of - we ’re looking at sort of the outside of the brain and this represents the what we call the medial surface .
If you took the middle part of the brain and looked at the medial surface .
And these represent , in particular several of the , basic brain areas that subserve emotion .
So these areas here , these areas here , and these area here , are different aspects of different kinds of emotion .
We ’ll talk a little bit later about the brain - how the brain differentiates emotional states , whereas we feel as we get closer to our , in house performance .
MCFERRIN : I have a question .
How do we experience music differently ?
Say for example , you got tickets for a concert , you know who you ’re going to go see , it begins at 8:00 .
You know , that ’s one kind of musical experience that most of us have had .
But what ’s the difference ?
Do we experience music differently say if you suddenly come upon it , you ’re walking in a park and all of a sudden you find a band playing ?
Do you experience physically the music differently ?
Because on one hand you know what you ’re going to get pretty much you have expectations about the performance .
Maybe you ’re even familiar with the music , but it ’s a different orchestra or there ’s a classical concert , different conductor , whatever .
Then for you to suddenly come upon music completely unexpected and it might be a music that you ’re unfamiliar with .
I mean , is there a difference in experience in music that way ?
Or do we take it in the same way as a process in the same way ?
[ 00:25:58 ] PARSONS :
Well , in terms of brain function it ’s all happening in the same way .
You ’re certainly influenced by the context and your expectations , but there ’s a lot of implicit unconsciousness , so if you hear a beat , even a non-musician will start tapping your foot .
And it ’s probably happening before it gets up here to where you ’re , you ’re analyzing the melody and the harmony and so on .
There ’s this .
Which might go back to things like walking and basic primordial functions .
SCHAEFER : Let me just , if I can just follow up on Bobby ’s question .
You talked about expectations and I ’m looking at that slide .
All the different parts of the brain that are at work when we ’re listening to music .
When you ’re talking about memories and associations , expectations , I think what Bobby is getting at is if you do n’t have time to erect those in your mind before the experience of the music has hit you , can you can , you know , does that change your experience of the music because your mind has n’t had the chance to erect those edifices ?
LEVITIN : I think the expectations happened at two time courses , right ?
So there ’s a long term expectation of having bought your tickets a month in advance and you ’re sort of mentally preparing yourself for the night of the concert .
You might listen to the music of the performer or composer ahead of time and you ’re sort of playing in your head what you think is going to happen and this is a sort of long term expectation .
And then at the moment of the concert , whether it ’s music you ’ve heard before or not , whether you ’re a musician or not .
Whether you know the difference between a C sharp and a G and a H or not .
Right ?
You ’ve got these short term expectations going .
PARSONS:H?
LEVITIN : You have this short term expectations that are sort of partly innate and partly acculturated .
You do n’t always know what ’s going to happen , but because there ’s typically a pulse , you know when the next event is going to be and your brain is trying to form predictions about the micro timing of are they going to play it a little early ?
Are they going to play it a little late ?
Or they may play around with the time instead of doing this or they do know .
All this kind of rhythmic play .
We ’ll talk about that , but I think the other thing that ’s interesting about Bobby ’s question is that it illustrates that there are really different kinds of people who come to music and life with very different mindsets .
There are people who approach life in a more open and experimental way .
They hear music wherever it is , and they ’re not surprised by it .
They hear it in the wind rustling through the trees .
They hear it in the birds singing , they come upon it in the park .
They were ready for it and there are other people who have to steel themselves up for the event .
Right ?
I mean it ’s in psychobabble we would call it a difference in openness to new experience or in readiness to accept something at the spur of the moment ,
MCFERRIN : I must say , I ’m sorry , I must say that when I saw Miles Davis ’s band for the first time in Los Angeles in 1971 or whenever it was , literally physically I felt different when I left .
LEVITIN : That was n’t just what was being smoked in the auditorium ?
MCFERRIN : No it was a small club in Los Angeles and I felt that physically , I was different because I hit even though I knew I was going to go see Miles on a particular day of the week and I was going to go see him .
I had no idea what he was going to play , what the group was , and I literally , literally left the club , a changed person .
I was never the same because I had never heard music like that .
I never experienced music like that .
I mean Miles walked out , they improvised for an hour and you know , played all kinds of stuff all over the place and I felt like my molecular structure literally had been transformed .
MCFERRIN : And I never experienced music like that ever again and I never played music that way .
I mean it made me question and reexamine everything that I ever did musically .
You know , after that .
LEVITIN : You may have had a big burst of dopamine production during .
And I think your physiology did change .
What neuroscientists think of as learning is new connections in the brain .
PARSONS : Well I ’ll say you know , as an artist , as a young artist , you were prepared for that kind of experience , the change because you obviously had a lot of - it hits you upside and drove you in a new direction .
[ 00:30:24 ] SCHAEFER : Yeah .
Well , if we ’re going to talk about , you know , the things that might be universal or the things that might be -Jamshed , on the show earlier today , you referred to yourself as a cultural relativists .
So I mean , I guess that implies there are some things that are not universal among music that will be specific to cultures and stuff .
I suppose if we ’re going to talk about these questions , we should at some point get to the basics and that is the way sound hits our ear .
Dan in one of your books , you provocatively answer the question , “ If a tree falls in the forest and no one ’s there to hear it , does it make a sound ” with a definitive no .
It does not make it .
Why ?
Why do you say that ?
LEVITIN : Well , I think that sound is a construction of the brain .
What you have in the physical world and what a physicist can measure are the vibrations of molecules and the intensity of that vibration .
But that ’s not sound the way we commonly think of it .
When we think of sound , we think of being able to distinguish a car horn from a bird song or the ocean waves from a cello .
And you know , that ’s sound and it requires a brain to interpret that I would say .
SCHAEFER : So it needs to be the action of those vibrations upon your eardrums .
LEVITIN : So I would say it ’s the end of a chain of events , of neural processing that delivers you this impression of .
SCHAEFER : All right , so there are lots of different types of sound waves .
And of course when we hear music , we ’re not hearing usually a single sound wave .
We ’re hearing combinations of them and if we ’re going to talk again about what ’s universal , maybe we should start with the basic building blocks , the simple octave , the so called perfect intervals , the fourth and the fifth .
And you know , between the musicians and Dan , your sax and Jamshed the violin and Bobby , the whole Bobby , we should be able to sort of demonstrate a little bit about - of what we ’re talking about .
So let ’s start with the octave .
LEVITIN : So pitch , rhythm and timbre are three of the fundamental building blocks of music that composers and performers use to create musical sound .
And pitch is just a fancy word for changes in the frequency of a sound .
Amber can play in a note here for us .
Now what she ’s done here to change the sound is she ’s pressed halfway along the string and it sounds higher .
We call that an octave .
And if you notice where your finger is , it ’s exactly half the length of the string .
And if she changes that ratio , in a particular direction in a particular way , she can make an interval that we call the fifth .
The fifth and the octave are two near cultural universals .
Virtually every music system that we know of , not only now , but going back to the Greeks and beyond the musical system .
So far as we know , have the Hebrews , the Hittites , Arabian music , Persian music , you know , back in the BC era , all had the octave and almost all of them had the fifth .
Another building block of our western music is the fourth .
Then we have another interval is the third .
Can you play a descending minor third ?
Now this descending minor third has some very interesting properties that Jamshed is going to talk about .
BHARUCHA : Well my colleague Meagan Curtis and I have done some research on whether the speech , the intervals within speech themselves can convey emotion in a way that ’s analogous to the way in which music conveys emotion .
When you listen to people speak , you do n’t really hear music , you do n’t hear the pitch in very clear ways , but it turns out that with technology today , we can analyze the voice and we can see musical intervals in them at times .
And so we had actresses say sentences , short sentences with different emotions , happiness , anger , sadness and pleasantness and analyze the musical intervals .
And it turns out that the descending minor third , as Amber played , is prevalent in sad speech .
So this is a descending minor third .
[ 00:35:14 ] BHARUCHA :
We had actresses say words like , “ OK . ”
So you ’ve heard a lot of , OK .
Now I ’m singing that of course , but spoken naturally and analyzed by a computer , you can see these intervals come out .
As opposed to angry speech , what we found is that there was a preponderance of ascending minor seconds or semi tones .
Ok .
Now the positive emotions of happiness and pleasantness did not produce any interval of pitch code at all .
So it ’s only the negative emotions .
And in terms of evolution , that makes some sense .
It ’s very important that you detect negative emotions because there are consequences .
You may not .
You may not have to detective positive emotions .
MCFERRIN : So what does this voice convey ?
In a world where scientists -
LEVITIN : Well I ’m glad you brought that up because one of the other components of all this is timbre .
And one can perform a note .
The same note with many different timbres and great performers on any instrument learn how to coax these different sounds and the timbre for those of you that are familiar with the definition of the term , the official definition is it ’s everything that you hear when the musician is not changing the pitch or the duration of the note .
That ’s the best that the physicists could come up with .
That ’s actually the official definition .
And what we mean is when a trumpet and a cello are playing the same note , it ’s what allows you to distinguish them .
Or even when somebody performs a note with different total color .
And I was thinking you might demonstrate for us some notes played with yes , but play the same pitch , same duration , but with different timbres .
MCFERRIN : You mean so like .
( Vocalizing )
As one .
( Vocalizing )
LEVITIN : And each is associated with a particular emotion .
MCFERRIN : Right .
LEVITIN : And there ’s this kind of signaling that composers and performers and audience members know as part of a common cultural vocabulary that if you do certain things , it ’s meant to convey certain emotions .
And these are largely but not entirely based on metaphors from animal cries and baby cries and natural sounds .
And Amber , I think can make two different timbres , on the same note , on the cello probably .
I do n’t mean to put you on the spot , but .
The final component that we were going to talk about just briefly is rhythm .
One can play the same notes with different rhythms .
That is different , temporal patterns .
And Amber ’s going to demonstrate that now .
SCHAEFER : So the dotted rhythm .
We ’ve been talking so far about intervals , pitch , timbre , we ’ve been talking at it mostly from a Western standpoint .
I mean , you know , the major and minor thirds , those are Western constructs .
I mean there are a pure mathematical thirds , but we do n’t use them in the west .
For that you ’d have to go to , to certain non-Western cultures .
In terms of - before we leave rhythm Jamshed , in the Indian classical tradition , rhythm seems to be built differently .
There ’s a kind of expanded sense of time in the way rhythm happens in Indian classical music .
BHARUCHA : Sure .
There are some significant cultural differences .
And in Indian classical music , the rhythmic cycles tend to be more extended and they can also be multiples of more complex numbers .
In western music , most of the rhythms or the meters are duple meters they ’re in groups of two or four or sometimes triple meters , which are in groups of three .
In Indian classical music , you might have groups of seven , you might have groups of thirteen , longer intervals .
And perhaps I can ask Naren to just illustrate first a simple rhythm and then a more complex meter .
( Instrumentation )
So that ’s based on two and multiples of two .
And then maybe a more complex meter .
( Instrumentation )
So that ’s just one cycle .
And then he repeats those cycles .
[ 00:40:44 ] SCHAEFER :
And within the cycle there are , you begin to vary the strokes and it very quickly becomes a very complex and impressive feat to play these instruments .
Let ’s talk a little bit about scale as well because scale forms are quite different .
If we could ask Parag , could you play the Indian sarod , but can you play a C major scale on that ?
Just a regular western …?
( Instrumentation )
Now , if we start on the same note what happens with … I mean let ’s choose a …
BHARUCHA : Well western music , both classical and popular music , the major and minor scales are by far the most prevalent .
But in many other cultures there are many , many other scales that are still in use .
And perhaps Parag , you could play a couple that are distinctly different from the major scale .
( Instrumentation ) Perhaps you could just play a short segment of music actually based on that scale .
( Instrumentation )
SCHAEFER : That scale is quite foreign .
That ’s a very dissimilar scale to the Western C major scale .
And yet , this goes back to what Larry was talking about almost as soon as we got started , the expectation .
How quickly the mind adjusts having heard the first part of the scale to kind of fill in the blanks .
And you ’ve done some , some work in , in both India and here in the states on this .
BHARUCHA : That ’s right .
So when you hear a fragment of music , the brain fills in a much larger representation that ’s based on cultural expectations .
And these expectations are implemented by the brain automatically and very , very fast .
And they ’re almost impossible to suppress .
So if you hear several notes that are part of a Indian scale , but not including the other notes that are typically present , the brain actually puts them in .
And what Meagan Curtis and I found is that people misremember notes that are supposed to be in a scale but not actually played , if it ’s from a familiar culture .
So let me play one scale .
This scale is called Bhairav and it ’s a scale found in Indian classical music .
Now that second note is distinctly non-Western .
And so what we found is that when you play a fragment of this scale , that does not include that note .
So for example .
To western listeners , their brains do not fill in this note .
And we wanted to see if there is evidence in fact that for Indian listeners , they do fill in this note .
And so we ’ve conducted another experiment , which is going on simultaneously in India and here in the United States .
And I ’m going to show you a couple of clips of the experiment actually being conducted .
The first clip is the experiment going on in Bangalore with a collaborator of ours Shantala Hegde .
And you will first see a singer playing just some music and then you ’ll see her being a subject in an experiment in which she hears a brief melody and then she ’s supposed to complete the melody .
And then in the simultaneous experiment that we ’re doing here at the United States , at Tufts , we have an American singer trying to complete those same melodies .
And what you will see is that the American singer ’s brain , you wo n’t see the brain , but you will see evidence that the brain is really leading her .
[ 00:45:10 ] BHARUCHA :
There are a couple of singers - to expect different notes and therefore to produce different notes .
But not including that second note that I played .
That ’s call it the Re flat that you do n’t have to know about the technical aspects of music .
But if you just remember that note is a Re flat because I ’ll be talking about it a little bit later .
One of the things you ’ll see in these clips is that while the American singers start off completing the melody in a very Western mode , towards the end of the experiment , they had a little bit of acculturation and you ’ll see one of the singers actually starting to insert that re flat , but that ’s very late in the process .
So if I could have the first video clip for us , please .
( Video )
HEGDE : I ’ll be taking you through an experiment and I will be playing few melodies from a music device here .
They ’re short melodies and I would want you to listen to each melody and complete it .
CURTIS : So in this experiment , you ’re going to hear a few notes on each trial , just the beginning of a melody .
And what I would like you to is to elaborate on that musical phrase just for a few notes and end on a note that you think is a good resting point for that phrase .
And so anytime you ’re ready , we can start the experiment .
CURTIS : This is the program that we use to analyze the data and what you ’re seeing here is a spectrogram and it also shows the fundamental frequency contour in blue .
In the analysis , we look at the pitch classes that were used in the original stimulus and we can compare the pitch classes used by the singer to determine whether they used the same pitch classes and oftentimes we find that they fill in pitches that were not contained in the original stimulus .
Even if the participant has heard a melody that contains notes from the Indian scale , they actually are very good at filling in Western pitches that are a little bit inconsistent with what you would hear in the Indian scale .
BHARUCHA : So for the most part , the Indian singers were quite automatically inserting that Re flat , whereas the American singers were not .
They were inserting a Re natural , which is a very Western , which is the tone you would expect in major or minor restaurants scale , except towards the end that one American singer started trying to sound non-Western and very quickly inserted that Re flat in .
And so it is possible in shorter periods of time , in an entire lifetime to develop some degree of acculturation .
[ 00:50:25 ] SCHAEFER :
Does that say something about that individual singer or can you generalize more about a certain versatility or plasticity of our brain in terms of responding to music we have n’t heard before ?
BHARUCHA : Well , let me show you an example of a model , a brain model , a computational model , which is very theoretical about how our brains brain circuits might form as a result of exposure to a lifetime of music or even a short period of music .
If I could borrow the pointer please .
So this is - each one of these ovals here represents it sort of a theoretical neuron in the brain and there are neurons that are tuned to different pitches .
So here we have the do re me fa so la ti do , just as an example of neurons that are going to get active when those particular frequencies are present in the music .
At the top , we have another set of neurons that , that we call expectation representations .
They are probably in a different part of the brain , and represents what the brain expects for remembers or perhaps misremembers as part of a gestalt or a holistic representation of the musical scale .
And these neurons in the first layer and the second layer are connected by all of these lines that are synapses .
Now , let ’s say you start off not having any cultural exposure and then you get some cultural exposure .
What happens is that these synaptic connections represented by the lines get stronger or weaker .
Some become excitatory , some become inhibitory , and the next slide shows what happens as a result of cultural learning .
The red lines are the synaptic connections that have gotten stronger .
The green lines are the synaptic connections that have gotten a lot weaker and just , the pattern of red and green lines really constitutes the brains and representation of culture in this particular context of tonal culture .
SCHAEFER : If I can just ask , so in this example , if we ’re talking to a do re me and let ’s just call me an e for sake of argument .
If your cultural scale leads you to expect an E flat or an E natural , it leads you to not expect .
That ’s what the green crossings there to you to not expect the reverse .
BHARUCHA : Exactly .
And these crosses here of green cross .
Whoops .
I ’m sorry .
I need to go back a slide .
Thank you .
These crossed lines here mean if you hear a re flat , uh , you ’re not going to expect a re .
And if you hear a re you ’re not going to expect a Re flat .
And the same with me flat and me .
What you ’ll see in a later slide is that the western brain sometimes shows an equal expectation for me flat and me .
Because if you play at a fragment of the Indian scale Bhairav , it thinks it ’s both major and minor , and I ’ll show you that in a minute .
LEVITIN :
The key point here , if I could just add , is that your brain does n’t born hardwired for the music of a particular culture .
It ’s not because you were born in India or in the United States , that you ’re more likely to , you know , to learn one or the other as far as the brain is concerned .
The brain is essentially configured to learn any of the world ’s musics or any of the world ’s languages .
And it ’s exposure .
It ’s the actual input influences the shape that the neural circuits take .
BHARUCHA : Exactly .
This particular neural net model can learn potentially any cultural system .
And in fact , we ’ve done simulations using this model of ancient Greek modes which used to exist in the West , but no longer exists to try to understand how the ancient Greeks might have heard music and the kinds of expectations they might have had .
So now if this is the network that has learned the Indian scales and if you are now presented with a fragment , that ’s just me fa so la flat , it expects the re flat to stay at the top .
If you instead have - Sorry , this is so big in the back , it ’s hard for me to pay attention .
SCHAEFER : Cover one eye and read the bottom line .
BHARUCHA : We see the Indian , the Indian brain expecting the ref lot based on the fragments that have been played .
OK , so the expectation is up there in the left - hand corner .
Now a simulation of western exposure would be in the next slide where the network has been exposed only to major and minor scales .
You ’d you do n’t see the same shot crossing of the green lines here , for example .
Now what if you expose this western trained neural net to the same fragment , mi fa so la flat .
You do n’t get the re activated at all .
You do n’t get the re flat expected at all and still get the re .
And as I said earlier on , you get some expectation of me flat and me , as you can see , both of them are slightly colored red , which means that there ’s a little bit of ambiguity .
As soon as the western a computer simulation hears the flat la , it thinks , ah Ha , you know , that must be minor .
MCFERRIN : So Julie Andrews did n’t expect “ doe , a deer , female deer . ”
BHARUCHA : Could you sing that now with a re flat ?
So this , this is just a computer simulation of how the brain actually learns a culture .
The brain is the organ of culture and it ’s like a sponge .
It really absorbs the patterns that are in your culture and encodes the brain using those patterns and then uses those encoded patterns as filters to filter the music that you hear .
SCHAEFER : And I guess one of the , one of the great difficulties in a world that has been changed by Internet access and you know , jet age travel and stuff , is that it ’s very hard now to find a culture where the people who ’ve been so kind of isolated that you can actually have them , you know , expose them to western music for the first time .
And do some kind of real theoretical work with a real practical work .
BHARUCHA : Nowadays if you want to do cross-cultural work and find a tribe that has never been exposed to work outside to music outside .
You come to the United States .
SCHAEFER :
Well it really goes back to both expectation and end the quality , Dan , of the intervals as well .
I mean , you know , those , those minor seconds which , you know , can denote anger in , in some cases , you know , played together is this kind of a crushing dissonance .
And it raises the whole question of what is consonant ?
What is dissonant ?
Is that distinct from culture to culture ?
LEVITIN : It ’s hard to say because there are some cases of minor seconds where they do n’t sound aggressive .
When Thelonious Monk plays them , they sound cheerful and almost comical .
It ’s not just that you ’re playing a minor second , you ’re playing it within a certain context of melody and harmony , rhythm , tempo , a certain timbre .
Now Tom Fritz ’s experiment is very impressive and it has given an answer that many of us have wondered about , I think for a long time , but going the other direction I listened to , I ’ve been listening to a lot of Chinese opera and I can’t tell what emotion is being represented at all in that .
I like the music and I find it interesting and beautiful , but I do n’t know , maybe it ’s just me .
SCHAEFER : It ’s not just you .
I have the same , you know , maybe it ’s just the two of us .
MCFERRIN : Can I try something ?
Talking about expectations .
Expectations .
MCFERRIN :
What ’s interesting about that is regardless of where I am anywhere , every audience gets that , but it does n’t matter , you know , it ’s just , you know , the pentatonic scale for some reason .
[ 01:01:33 ] LEVITIN :
If you ’re looking for a job in neuroscience .
SCHAEFER : Just to phrase the question scientifically , Larry , what the hell just happened ?
Expectation .
I mean , you know , how , how does the brain know that ?
What and how does it fall into the pentatonic scale of all the intervals that are out there ?
PARSONS : On the one hand , he takes a spatial metaphor which is the key , you know , essentially the keyboard and he builds it up , notice he starts in a small interval and then slowly expands it out and the audience , sort of builds their expectations about what they ’re going to sing .
And then Bobby just plays without an inexpensive out and he builds a melody and harmonizes and improvises on top of it .
So it starts with some shared knowledge and shared expectations and then it ’s improvised collectively .
I think that ’s how we would think of it as a behavior - that ’s the behavioral side .
And then there ’s elements of a joint action , shared cognition .
BHARUCHA : It ’s also related to motion .
Music is integrally related to movement and I think the fact that Bobby was so clear in his movements really enabled that to establish the spatial representation in a kind of solidified way .
SCHAEFER : If this were not New York City , if this were Bangalore and you know , people were expecting those , you know , the second to be flatted , would they have been singing a slightly different tune ?
PARSONS : Well if he moved in the same way they ’d be singing the same tune but with slightly different syllables .
LEVITIN : So I wonder if you ’ve ever jumped back to make the sharps and flats .
SCHAEFER : Let me , let me raise to other related questions .
One is people who grow up in a culture with a pitched language like Chinese , where you know , the pitch of speech will change the meaning of a word .
And the other related question is people who grow up in a culture with a click language , where there ’s a rhythm like , like Xhosa and those other South African languages .
I ca n’t even pronounce the name of .
PARSONS : The original languages .
SCHAEFER : So in both of those cases , there is music inherent in the speech , is n’t there ?
Or at least there ’s musicality .
I mean there ’s pitch in one and there ’s rhythm in the other .
PARSONS : Music or what we call prosody or tone changes , tone contours are part of implicit with speech .
I mean , the general thing is that music in its primordial or evolutionary path was deeply embedded in dance and mimicry .
So we would , you know , before maybe language , we would mimic animals , mimic physical events , mimic our own actions , mimic the gods .
Whatever sort of things we needed to dramatize .
We would , we would find out ways to convey them .
And there will be this very broad , rich bandwidth of music , dance language , protolanguage , gesture , facial gestures , and it would all be participatory .
This complicated soup in the sense of human , a shared social experiences is a source of human culture in some ways .
When we think about a music concert , it , we just take a little slice of that in a sense , pull it out .
And then there ’s an audience that ’s supposed to sit there .
You know , Bobby ’s an exception .
There ’s an audience that sits there passively and then some performer , either a music performer or a dance performer , pacifies them while they look at the experts do his thing or her thing .
And then that ’s a very unnatural evolutionary speaking , unnatural situation .
[ 01:05:48 ] SCHAEFER :
That ’s a question for another panel and maybe another world science festival , but you know , how and why did we begin separating out all these different components of what seems to have been a kind of proto- communication that involved the body and speech and music and whatever .
What is , I mean , can we look at infants as you know , a kind of a Tabula Rasa , a blank slate to give us some kind of clue of what early human communication might have been like ?
Some of these assumptions that their brains do n’t have the greens and the reds yet .
Everything is - all possibilities are open , right ?
PARSONS : It ’s important to keep in mind that humans are special .
No other creature really cares about consonance and dissonance .
It ’s important to keep in mind that the things we prefer , we prefer them because we ’re human and there there ’s nothing in the sound itself that other animals , other species would prefer .
BHARUCHA : I would be a contrarian here .
I do n’t think that these data show that it ’s hardwired .
I think that it shows that it could have been learned very , very early , but , but we do n’t know for sure that …
SCHAEFER : In utero for example .
How would that happen ?
Just through exposures of …
LEVITIN :
The part that the thing that ’s difficult about doing experiments in physics or in neuroscience is controlling all the variables and the developing fetus by the age of 12 weeks , the auditory system is fully functional and it can hear sound through the amniotic fluid .
It sounds like what it would , what music sounds like if you put your ears under the bathtub .
You get mostly low frequency information , but that ’s enough to track chord progressions and bass notes .
So just born infants .
I ’ve already had months of exposure .
SCHAEFER :
It would be great to be able to do an experiment like this right here , right now .
We can make a step in that direction .
Bobby , you ’re going to get hooked up to , to do …
MCFERRIN : I ’m gonna get hooked up .
LEVITIN : Like you were that night of the Miles Davis concert .
SCHAEFER : Dan , you talked about having the control variables and how difficult that can be .
So what are the ways in which we measure some of the things that you ’re talking about in these experiments ?
I mean , for example , what we ’re about to do now , features , galvanic skin response , things like that .
Does that sort of the , the , the general … Larry ?
PARSONS : I ’m describing at least initially is a way to understanding those things is how does the brain represent emotions that you experience in music ?
And so in the way we ’ve been studying as neuroscientists is on this slide , which is there .
Yeah .
Well , before that we ’ll just mention maybe briefly , a little bit about evolutionary theory .
So the reason that something is pleasing to us as a , as a , as an animal , as a human is because it ’s good for us and our survival .
So the reason we have these positive associations and maybe all this range of emotion when we listen to music and dance is because those experiences are important to our survival .
Things that are important to our survival are linked by our history into our reward system to make us seek them out and experience them .
Again , and again , and again , so why is music adaptive or is it adaptive ?
So this is a point of controversy and you ’ll see if you see the film that there are different views about it .
And there are speculations , there ’s no yet clear evidence for how to decide if it ’s adaptive or not , but these are the kinds of speculation .
So people speculate that emotion , that music allows us to regulate our emotions together and that ’s a way of sort of harmonizing ourselves socially as a group .
That it allows us to choose our mates , that it allows us to bond with our offspring , the ones that were caring for as caretakers .
It allows us to cohere as a group before a battle or hunt or some other kind of ritual that we might have .
Manages situation of social complexity where it ’s ambiguous or difficult to figure out how we proceed .
[ 01:10:27 ] PARSONS :
We can use music in that sense .
Coalitions , we signal to other groups that by singing and dancing together in a kind of coherent way that we ’re organized , we ca n’t be screwed with .
You ca n’t come and take our belongings , our land , because we ’re a coherent signal group .
And then finally , the most interesting from a neuroscience point of view is that music is a source of play and play allows different parts of the brain , different neural systems to wire up at critical periods of development and that those things confer an advantage and there ’s a set of findings that look at the benefits of being a musician early in life on intellectual development and intellectual abilities later in life that tap this idea .
So these are all speculations about how music has an adaptive nature .
So it ’s adaptive and then it has an emotional component as well .
And in the next slide after this slide , is an example of some of the kind of brain activity you see .
Again , this is just average people lying in a scanner listening to music from the 1920 ’s in Turkey that they ’d never heard before , but they really liked .
And as a consequence , you get a lot of a set of brain areas activated that are active for things like reward situations for drugs or sexual experiences or food , all kinds of gratifications .
And here they are active just for novel music you ’ve ever heard before .
A bit like walking along and hearing some kind of music just that you did n’t expect .
You can also plot the kinds of brain areas that are active when you have these experiences that are sometimes called chills , chill experiences where you have this kind of shiver effect , it ’s something you really care for and you get all the emotional areas .
And then you get this so madison that represent motion and sensing your body move at the same time and memory , all of these kinds of areas that are richly embedded .
And then finally , an important feature about emotional experiences in general , which are shown in , in music as well , is that we can distinguish subtle changes between , in we ’re just choosing gross verbal terms , happy , sad , angry and danceable .
And there ’s a whole range of things you could use , terms to describe music , but it ’s much more complicated and language fails to describe music ’s experiences .
Yet people can distinguish these subtle emotional states and their distinguished , their discriminations depend on these subtle differences in brain activity that we all feel sometimes we can describe , but we can all feel and , and scientists , people like me and the rest of the three of us here work at trying to distinguish how those things happen in the brain .
So they happen in the brain , but they also are connected from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous system .
Changes in the peripheral nervous system affect the way the sort of perspiration and other properties of your skin which can be detected by what ’s called a galvanic skin response , GSR .
And what we ’re going to do right now is when a wire up Bobby and two other volunteers and we ’re going to let them listen to some music .
And while they listen to music , we ’re going to show you an image of the , the skin conductance , for each of them in three separate panels on the screen .
And then we ’ll chat with them about their experiences , about what they felt and their verbal descriptions of it .
And then we ’ll go back and forth between them and across the four different samples of music and give you a sort of an informal demonstration of the kind of scientific objective measures that we use to study music and emotion .
SCHAEFER : All right .
So shall we - do we have our two volunteers ?
Have they been dragged kicking and screaming from the audience up onto the stage yet ?
All right .
Here we go .
[ 01:15:37 ] LEVITIN :
You might ask yourself , why do n’t we just ask people what they ’re feeling when they listen to music ?
You know , why all this other , why all these wires and all this other stuff .
Then one reason is that people often try to please the experimenter , they say what they think the experiment or wants to hear .
And for the most part we trust that people are giving us honest answers .
But if we can find something that is not under conscious control , that ’s often considered to be a pure measure .
And for the most part , most people can’t control how much their hands sweat , their hands , sweat or they do n’t .
And you know , it ’s part of what we call the autonomic nervous system for a reason .
It ’s automatic .
Unless you ’re a true zen master , it ’s not something that you can typically control .
SCHAEFER : And so in addition to the skin response , a pulse rate ?
Is that also… ?
PARSONS : Breathing , pulse rate .
There ’s a range of things we can use which are outside of the brain which reflect these changes .
LEVITIN : That are governed by automatic processes .
EMG , whether you ’re tensing your muscles are not subconsciously , part of the fight or flight response , which is the galvanic skin response is also part of .
This is the sympathetic nervous system gearing up to take some action .
SCHAEFER :
And the chill effect that sugar that runs down your spine when you ’re really , really lucky .
What is , you know , how does that , is there a way to measure that ?
Does that , is there kind of , aside from the images in the brain , is there a skin response to repulse response that goes with that ?
PARSONS : There is probably a pulse response .
Nobody ’s studied it closely as far as I know , and we do n’t understand why .
It ’s obviously a complicated experience and so far as I know people have people like John has figured out what seems to be a musical undercurrent to it , but no one understands why we are actually .
SCHAEFER : So Mitchell ’s doing the galvanic skin response .
Is he measuring pulse rate as well ?
MITCHELL : No , we ’re just doing GSR .
MCFERRIN : And why the headphones ?
MITCHELL : I wanted to create a little bubble for the subjects so that there ’s no distractions .
MCFERRIN :
We ’re going to hear it too , right ?
MITCHELL : We ’re going to hear what they ’re going to hear except for the white noise that they ’re hearing right now .
So , Bobby , please enjoy
SCHAEFER : Enjoy your white noise , Bobby .
What ’s the point of the white noise , Mitchell ?
MITCHELL :
The white noise is I ’m basically starting the recording right now and I am recording their baseline physiological state because if we want to do a comparisons between , between our three participants , we need to normalize for some physiological differences .
There is one thing I wanna point out is that the GSR is there ’s a little lag involved .
So from the time our participants are hearing it and processing it and the neural signal getting to the fingers and actually producing sweat , it takes about one to three seconds .
So keep that in mind when , when you ’re looking at the signal .
So can you play track one ?
SCHAEFER : Can you guys hear us ?
[ 01:20:03 ] PARSONS :
While you ’re chatting we ’re going to do some data analysis .
Let me start with you .
What did you , how did you react to that music ?
Had you heard it before ?
AUDIENCE : I ’ve heard this song before .
Yes .
PARSONS : Did you like it ?
How did you feel ?
AUDIENCE : I liked it .
I mean , it makes me think of the intro to half of the 80’s movies I can think of .
I like 80 ’s movies .
PARSONS : And how about you ?
AUDIENCE : I ’ve never heard of that music before .
But yeah , I also liked it and I ’ve found that as I was listening to it in my head , I was trying to follow the melody because there was some repetition .
I liked it .
MCFERRIN : Yes , I liked it .
Yeah .
I found myself listening to the different textures , different voices .
PARSONS : What ’s interesting is the thing to notice here , is that are , you know , so we have a non-musician , an amateur musician , which most people are kind of an amateur musician , and she ’s from a different culture since you had n’t heard this piece .
Bobby is a musician as well as a member of our culture .
So we have sort of a mix of individual backgrounds and presumably that ’s reflected in some of their responses in what they say as well as …So this is the average response , during the last piece .
You can see this is the response here , Bobby ’s response here .
So the average over the whole interval of listening to the music and then response as the middle value .
So now with a little bit of preparation .
SCHAEFER : Can I just ask , what is that response measuring ?
PARSONS : It ’s sort of a excitability .
In a sense , it ’s just one dimension .
Are you surprised ?
I mean , the sort of things Bobby described as an expert listening are not reflected in this signal .
This is a response to the emotional and of course as members of the audience , you all had an idea of what maybe this music was about , but as we go through the other selections , you ’ll see that there ’s an experimental design behind the contrast between the different music pieces .
So why do n’t we go to the next one .
So we ’ll just play round robin again .
So , what kinds of feelings or emotions did you have for reactions ?
Did you have to do that piece ?
AUDIENCE : I guess a contemplativeness tinged with a little bit of stress .
I listen to classical music station when I study , and I am taking the GRE in three weeks .
PARSONS : You ’re taking a test .
AUDIENCE : So I was actually listening to some music earlier today while studying for the GRE .
PARSONS : So you can see that there are very specific associations which are kind of unpredictable to particular pieces
AUDIENCE : For me , I play a lot of classical pieces and piano , so , I guess I can say that I ’m more familiar with piano sounds and I enjoy it very much so I think it was very soothing and made me happy .
PARSONS : Do you actually know the piece ?
AUDIENCE : No .
[ 01:25:09 ] MCFERRIN : I enjoy that a lot when I was a kid .
Well first of all , I grew up in a home where there was a lot of classical music .
Both parents were classically trained singers and whenever I was sick , my mother would give me two things .
She ’d give me music and medicine because she knew that the medicine will take care of the aches and pains , the music , but also get me to relax and to focus the , you know , take my attention away from how bad I was feeling .
So that was like medicine in a way .
PARSONS : So when you were listening here , it made me think of the memories of …So you can see quite different experiences .
Let ’s see what the , how it looks .
I think that if you have n’t noticed in public , many of you have zero .
All the bars are going below zero .
MITCHELL : That ’s right .
So this is with respect to the white noise , so somewhere somewhat of a neutral state is that white noise .
So we can see here that across the board , our participants were actually relaxing while they were listening to this piece .
PARSONS : We can say that Forrest , he ’s the extreme whereas Bobby was the extreme for the , for Delirious , Prince ’s Delirious .
So I think we can , any other questions ?
So we ’ll move to the next selection .
How bad does this interact with the GRE experience ?
AUDIENCE : Probably not well .
PARSONS : What were your reactions to that ?
AUDIENCE : Irritating noise .
PARSONS : Was it music ?
AUDIENCE : Debatable .
PARSONS : Was it familiar ?
AUDIENCE : No , it was n’t .
PARSONS : So irritation was the core feeling that you had .
Did you have a sense of it going anywhere ?
Like resolving ?
Did you have a expectancy that moving in a particular direction or meaning something to you ?
AUDIENCE : No , I would n’t say that .
I was hoping it would move towards .
PARSONS : Do you think the composer had an idea that he was trying to convey or she was trying to convey ?
AUDIENCE : Probably .
PARSONS : Did you recognize something in it ?
If you had one word .
So you did n’t recognize it .
OK , well let ’s , let ’s move on .
How did you react ?
AUDIENCE : I pretty much agree with him that it was annoying , sound , irritating sound , but I ’m just waiting for it to end .
PARSONS : So irritation that ’s the keyword there .
AUDIENCE : Well , in the beginning when it first started , I was surprised .
It was n’t a pleasant feeling for me I guess .
PARSONS : Was it shocking or did you feel …
AUDIENCE : I was expecting sort of a melody or music of some kind , but yeah , I would say shocking and surprising in a not pleasant way .
MCFERRIN : I was waiting for …
PARSONS : So we had an idea of what that would , that piece of music would , the kind of emotion that would elicit .
None of the except for this cultural reference , none of the people actually used the sort of canonical term that we were expecting to elicit .
But they seem to concur on the reaction in some ways .
So let ’s see what the data looked like on this from the GSR .
[ 01:30:25 ] PARSONS :
So again they ’re excited in a way .
There ’s a difference between the three .
Maybe judging by this , but you can see it ’s quite different than what we saw for the contemplative piece that preceded it .
MCFERRIN : Yeah .
I have a little headache .
SCHAEFER : So this is the same scale as the first piece .
But all three are much higher up than they were in the first piece .
PARSONS : Yeah , I think so .
What at the fourth selection will compute some statistics that will average across the , the three listeners and then show you the difference between each of the four different selections and their responses .
So we get a clearer sense of how they vary .
But now will go for the very last of the pieces .
Start again .
Give us your reactions to that .
AUDIENCE : I liked it any different than anything that I normally listen to , but I was n’t quite sure what to expect at any point .
It was very peaks and valleys , but it was really nice .
PARSONS : And did you have a sense of what feelings the singer or the composer was conveying ?
AUDIENCE : I think it sounded mostly happy , but I could be wrong .
AUDIENCE : I agree with him for the most part .
But I sort of recognize that it might be , might have an Asian related , possibly Chinese opera .
PARSONS : You have n’t heard it before ?
AUDIENCE : I ’ve heard Chinese opera before , but I would n’t say that I ’m really familiar with that .
PARSONS : Could you read the emotion or the changes in emotion as you heard it ?
AUDIENCE : Hmm .
Not really .
PARSONS : Could you understand any of the language ?
AUDIENCE : No .
PARSONS : OK , Bobby .
[ 01:34:05 ] MCFERRIN : Well I find it interesting , I ’m not sure if I liked it or not .
I ’d have to listen to a little bit more of it to see where it ’s going to go .
It was a little bit irritating in a way , but at the same time , I wanted actually I wanted to hear more of it because I wanted to hear where it was going to go , you know , so I was curious , I was just curious about it .
If it had gone on in the same way with the same intensity for five or 10 more minutes I think I would have gotten tired of it .
PARSONS : Yeah .
So that you can see , again , he ’s looking for the musical structure , maybe because it ’s quite novel for your listening experiences and the musical side of the production is of interest to you , whereas you two seem to have slightly different reactions again .
So let ’s look at the average for this one and then we ’ll pause briefly and then let him …check it out .
Where were you ?
OK .
So , you know one thing we might notice is that for the first time , the highest of the responses for this last piece .
Bobby shows the least of the response overall .
So the , again , there ’s this quite specific interaction as we say in science between each of their individual backgrounds and makeup and the particular piece , and it changes across the four different kinds of pieces that were used that which we thought of as having a different either cultural and - or emotional valence or kind of general tone .
Apart from all the musical subtleties of listening to the piece .
So now if you can compute the average .
We ’re approaching the end of our presentation of our event tonight , but we ’re going to just show a little bit of the average , across the three .
MITCHELL : This is more emotionally relevant pieces .
The other one was more of a cultural , right .
PARSONS : So what we thought in Prince ’s Delirious , it would be something which is danceable , very physical or sort of , you know , yeah , sexual .
I ’m from Los Angeles .
This piece was of course meant to be more contemplative , peaceful , a slightly sad .
And then of course the stressful or angry or I ’m not sure what term we had in mind there exactly as a single verbal label was quite different , but again , average across our three listeners who have different experiences and different reactions sometimes share , but sometimes you can see that we get this a distinct pattern showing again how scientists approach the problem in a studying as a component , people ’s overt conscious awareness of emotional reactions to music as well as these subtle , implicit as we say , reactions to music .
So I think we ’re done with that .
SCHAEFER : Mitchell , thank you very much .
Thank you guys too .
SCHAEFER : we ’ve been talking a lot about music .
And we ’re going to conclude with some actual music .
This will actually give a couple of our panelists a chance to join the musicians who I have not properly or formally introduced so far yet .
So let me introduce you to our cellist , Amber Docters van Leeuwen .
The tabla player , Naren Budhakar .
And Parag Chordia plays the sarod .
And our final performance will necessitate a little bit of musical chairs .
So Dan and Bobby are gonna move over here and Jamshed and I are going to move over there and we ’ll have a little musical encore .
[ 01:39:19 ] SCHAEFER :
Now we all know what to listen for , right ?
( Music )
SCHAEFER : Thanks to the musicians and our panelists , Larry , Dan , Jamshed , Bobby , of course .
I want to thank you folks as well for coming to our panel tonight .
It ’s been much more than a panel .
Much more we could talk about , but we ’ll leave it there for the moment .
Again , thank you all and good night .
Wasilla , Alaska
On the Fourth of July , a thousand people gathered on the banks of Lake Wasilla for a Tea Party , one of those anti-tax , pro-liberty bits of street theatre that have been springing up around the country .
The day before , three miles away , Sarah Palin , in her characteristic tumble of words , had resigned .
At the party , from the flatbed of a tractor - trailer , a string of speakers preached resistance to a crowd that came bearing the standard liberty accessories : Gadsden flags , holstered sidearms , signs reading “ DON ’T TAX ME BRO . ”
In the middle of all this stood a thirty - eight - year - old middle - school teacher from Hudson , New York .
Adrienne Ross , the media director and New York organizer for the 2012 Draft Sarah Committee , had been in Wasilla for only two days .
But she said she had already “ witnessed history , ” had a salmon bake — using Palin ’s recipe — with the Governor ’s hairdresser and confidante Jessica Steele , and , just that morning , met Palin ’s parents and joked around with Piper .
It was like going to Sarah Palin fantasy camp , and , regardless of Palin ’s next move , Ross said , “ I am exactly where God wants me to be . ”
Ross ’s uncle is the New York Senate Majority Leader Malcolm A. Smith , and the rest of her family supported Barack Obama , but Ross fell for Palin during the Republican Convention .
“ It was an answer to my prayers , because I did n’t want to just vote against Barack Obama .
With Palin , I was voting for someone . ”
Other Palin pilgrims at the Tea Party shared Ross ’s fervor , if not her grace .
“ You better not call her a quitter , ” said Nyla van Brunt , who had come to Wasilla from Mesa , Arizona , along with Brenda Peterman , a fellow - retiree .
“ That ’s right , ” Peterman warned , eyes narrowing beneath her visor .
“ Do n’t write anything stupid . ”
This is the pro-Palin recipe : adore her , be angry for her , and , above all , defend her .
It does n’t matter that her intentions are sometimes known only to God and Todd , as they like to say here ; those who are with her are staying loyal .
Pundits pronounced her dead in the days following her resignation , but the following week her poll numbers among conservatives held steady or even rose .
A USA Today / Gallup poll showed that seventy - two per cent of Republican voters would vote for her if she ran for President in 2012 .
Holding a no-taxes sign in the face of oncoming traffic , Cecilia Pavek nodded toward her son and said , “ If people were talking smack about my kids , I would have beat them down a long time ago . ”
The local talk - show host Eddie Burke was there ; many of his regular callers were also in the crowd .
He pointed out that he was the Palin supporter whose face had been Photoshopped onto baby Trig ’s head by a liberal blogger last month , provoking waves of outrage that Palin echoed in her resignation speech .
After a prayer by a local deacon ( “ Give us change you can believe in , Lord ” ) , the rally ’s organizer , Cheryl Brooks , gave a speech that hopped between passion and panic .
Brooks , a soon - to - be great - grandmother ( “ The little booger wo n’t come out on time ” ) , started her activism online , but the Anchorage Daily News and the Alaska Dispatch have blocked her IP address so that she can’t comment on their stories anymore .
She said she was impatient with the social networking done by groups like Second Amendment Sisters ( who co-sponsored the rally ) .
“ I was tired of the whining and the socializing , ” she said .
“ They do n’t do anything . ”
So she took to organizing .
State Representative Carl Gatto got off the stage and seemed pleased with his speech — both he and Wasilla ’s mayor , Verne Rupright , offered a mixture of revolutionary history and contemporary populism in their talks .
He said he thought that Palin ’s vagueness had worked .
“ She could do anything for two months , and wait for the offers to roll in , ” he said .
“ She ’s got a book deal .
She ’s doing very well . ”
Gatto ’s own book - in - progress , a memoir stretching from his childhood in New York City to his new life in Alaska , was not faring as well .
“ I ’m writing it , ” he lamented .
“ But nobody will buy it . ”
“ We ’re out there because we love our country , ” Brooks said after the rally .
“ We do n’t want armed conflict .
But we want the government to know that they have to listen to us . ”
For Palin , listening to them might just be the ticket back into government .

Let me preface this article by saying that I know it will come off as anti-Lance Armstrong .
For that reason , I ’m sure some will hate the article , and by extension me .
But the main point of the article is n’t to attack him , as much as it to present a more neutral viewpoint of recent events and examine why we root for athletes .
I. Introduction
Cycling , for most Americans , is not at the forefront of the sports consciousness .
Many of you may or may not be aware that the 96th running of the Tour de France , cycling ’s crown jewel , was just completed .
A race that Lance Armstrong placed 3rd overall in .
That was a pretty impressive feat given the fact he is 38 - years - old and three years removed from competitive cycling .
However , despite the sport ’s popularity overseas , coverage by the major American sports outlets amounted to little more than Armstrong updates .
For example , if you happened to surf on through ESPN.com on any day during the three week Tour , the headline of the day ended up being very Lance - centric .
II .
Cycling Coverage
It ’s a bit disappointing from a fan ’s perspective to see such appeal to the lowest common denominator by the networks .
There ’s a lot more excitement going on than just Lance , but you never get to hear about it .
Why ?
For the same reason people complain that ESPN is just about the Yankees and Red Sox .
Ratings .
Everyone is out there trying to get ratings to push sponsors and more money into their pockets .
And there ’s no denying that Armstrong ’s presence dramatically boosts ratings .
Not only is he a lightning rod for controversy ( the French press have notoriously hated him ) , but he ’s the one individual that sparks American interest in the sport simply because of the fact he was born inside of America ’s borders .
Americans root for Lance because he is American .
This simple fact poses two issues .
First , most of the coverage not only is about Lance , it is very pro-Lance .
It ’s not exactly an unbiased opinion .
If you ever watched a Chicago White Sox game called by Hawk Harrelson , you get the general idea .
In fact , most local announcers , no matter the sport , have their own hometown bias .
And coverage of Lance Armstrong is no different , except instead of rooting for a specific team , there seems to be rooting for a specific person / country .
It also does n’t help that the main coverage of the Tour is done by Versus and all the major personalities involved have had long personal relationships ( and in some cases business relationships ) with Armstrong .
You can imagine their reluctance to speak ill about him , both from a personal and professional level .
The second issue is the question : why do Americans root for Lance ?
Probably because we come from the same country .
I ’ll admit I root for Lance .
I ’ve followed the Tour de France since I was a kid , and even remember seeing Greg LeMond capture the 1989 Tour by 8 seconds on a final stage time trial in Paris .
I like to see the American riders do well .
Due to the fact television coverage of the Tour was not easy to come by , I instead kept up with the standings in other ways .
In recent years , cable television and coverage on OLN / Versus ultimately expanded my opportunity to watch and follow the cycling .
And I could continue to root Armstrong on against his rivals , riders like Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso .
But why did I do so ?
I ’ll let Chuck Klosterman explain this phenomena …
III .
Why We Root for Athletes
Klosterman has come to the conclusion that events like the Olympics are designed for people who want to care about something without considering why .
The idea can be expanded to many typical sports enthusiasts .
Which is the concept of rooting for a team ( or individual ) without justification .
For many , this kind of support is considered mandatory to be a traditional , loyal , and “ true fan . ”
But in Klosterman ’s view , all it proves is that one is ridiculous , and that one does n’t consider the motivations that drive one ’s emotions .
Instead , geography and the color of the uniform are more important factors than anything else .
To prove his point , Klosterman states that he adored the Boston Celtics in 1986 , but is wholly ambivalent towards the franchise today .
Why ?
The current Celtics have different players , a different coach , a different offense , different management , different ownership , and they play in a different arena .
The only similarity between the current incarnation and the ’ 86 squad are that they both wear green and they both use the same parquet floor .
But Klosterman is not rooting for flooring .
Klosterman goes on to point out this is exactly what the Olympics , or any international sports , asks us to do .
They ask us to support athletes solely because they happen to stand on U.S. floors when they pay their federal income tax .
But he does n’t want to blindly root for a bunch of serial killers that simply wear American uniforms .
He wants to root for Americans because they are worth rooting for .
Which brings us back to Armstrong .
Is he worth rooting for ?
Recent evidence tends to suggest no .
IV .
A Cycling Primer
To understand the problem , you have to understand cycling a little .
The Cliff ’s Notes version is this .
While cycling is done in teams , it is each team ’s goal to work to the benefit of the team leader .
The team leader is the best rider , and it is his job is to do as well as he can in everything that he does .
Win stages , win races , win entire Tours .
You get the idea .
The rest of the team sacrifice themselves to set - up the leader for success .
No one knows this way of life better than Armstrong , who in his heyday hired some of the best riders in the World to work and sacrifice their personal goals for his benefit .
They did so for the greater good ( and in many cases a lot of cash ) .
Working in tandem with the riders is the team director .
The Director is essentially the coach , laying down the strategies , picking the riders who compete in specific races , and so forth .
In Armstrong ’s seven Tour victories , he had one man , Johan Bruyneel , as team director .
Armstrong not only has maintained a great business relationship with Bruyneel , but also maintains a close personal relationship .
V. Do n’t Call it a Comeback
When Armstrong announced his return to cycling nearly a year ago , he wanted to ride for Bruyneel .
Problem was that Bruyneel already had a job , directing Team Astana .
Astana also happened to be the world ’s best cycling team ( and by a healthy margin ) .
If that was n’t enough , Team Astana also employed the world ’s best cyclist , Spaniard Alberto Contador .
Contador had won the 2007 Tour de France riding for Bruyneel , and when Astana was excluded from the 2008 Tour , Contador won the other two Grand Tours of cycling , the Giro d’Italia ( Tour of Italy ) and the Vuelta a España ( Tour of Spain ) .
This made him one of only five cyclists to have won all three of the Grand Tours during their career ( joining all - time greats like Jacques Anquetil , Bernard Hinault , and Eddy Merckx ) .
In short , Contador is very good and still only 26 .
This presented a problem for Armstrong .
He wanted to ride for Astana and Bruyneel , but the team already had a team leader in Contador .
How would Lance ’s presence affect the team leadership ?
Would he be willing to ride in support of Contador ?
If not , who would the team ride for ?
Contador or Armstrong ?
Bruyneel went ahead and signed Armstrong anyway , which many in the business thought would create problems and upset team balance .
More questions began to crop up .
Could Bruyneel effectively control his team ?
Would loyalties among the riders be split ?
How could Bruyneel plan a race strategy that benefited both his top riders ?
Contador made his name as a climber in the mountains , where as Armstrong ’s biggest strength were the individual time trials .
How would this all play out , particularly with two top riders going for the same overall goal through different methods ?
VI .
The 2009 Tour de France
These aforementioned issue were the big buzz before the start of this year ’s Tour .
If you followed the race at all , or Lance ’s constant twittering of it , you might have remembered two things .
Lance and Bruyneel ’s public comments against Contador and the bickering that went on between the two after the Tour was over .
Those were the two big stories .
Not the race on the road .
In the aftermath of the final day , Contador made the follow statement at press conference , “ My relationship with Armstrong is none - but independent from his personality , he ’s a great champion , has won 7 tours and done a great job in this one , but on a personal level ( referring to his personality ) I have n’t had a great admiration towards his , and never will , but again - as a rider - he ’s a great champion . ”
Actually he spoke in Spanish , so the above is a translation .
You can imagine certain news outlets had a field day with this .
Whatever coverage American networks gave to the events painted Lance as the one in the right .
Versus coverage backed him up .
And yet , other international publications told a completely different story .
So what ’s the truth ?
Who was in the right ?
Who comes off as the douche ?
Truthfully , I ca n’t say for sure .
I was n’t there in the race .
I was n’t privy to private Astana meetings .
I do n’t profess to know the truth behind any of what has been reported in the media .
And realistically , I do n’t know if there is a right in this kind of situation .
I do know of certain facts , but ultimately one has to rely on circumstantial evidence and some speculation to get a better picture of the whole situation .
A recent article by El País , the biggest newspaper in Spain , paints an much different Armstrong then portrayed by American networks .
VII .
The El País Article
It paints a guy who leveraged his personal friendship with Bruyneel to the professional detriment of Contador .
Its about a guy who leveraged the economic opportunities he is able to offer as the boss of a new team to isolate Contador .
And it shows a guy who essentially practiced psychological warfare against his own teammate in an effort to win at all costs .
But not just a war of words , there are a few dirty tricks mixed in as well .
In short , Armstrong , together with Bruyneel , set a “ team strategy ” that was counterproductive to Contador ’s strengths and capabilities .
Is this the real Armstrong ?
The El País article mentioned six specific points that I ’d like to address and comment on .
They are summarized as follows :
1. Armstrong ’s Plan and Revised Plan on Camarga
“ If I would ’ve had gotten the yellow , I would n’t have had to relinquish it .
I would ’ve defended it , ” Armstrong had said .
According to El País , acquiring the yellow jersey in the first week of the Tour was a priority in Armstrong ’s strategy .
The idea was that having yellow would paralyze any initiative that Contador might have had to establish his own hierarchy in the team .
However , due to a poor Stage 1 time trial in Monaco , Armstrong was not in a position to execute his plan .
In fact , he was 22 seconds behind Contador ( who was second overall ) , a mild surprise .
That was until a fortunate change of the wind on the Camarga .
The main group of riders split , and a small select group , including Armstrong , were able to gain 41 seconds on the main field .
After the stage , Armstrong climbed from 10th to 3rd overall .
And in the process , jumped ahead of Contador .
In theory , the move allowed Armstrong to recover the leadership of Team Astana as the top placed rider .
The team time trial followed on Stage 4 , and after the team time trial , Contador was left at the back of the peloton ( the main group of riders ) on Stage 5 , being beaten up by the wind from the coast without any teammates with him .
Comments : Given Armstrong ’s historic time trial strength , getting yellow early on not only seemed like the plan , but what most experts expected to happen .
And certainly having Armstrong in the yellow jersey would have made it harder on Contador for a number of reasons .
That is if Armstrong showed he was the Lance of old .
Unfortunately he was not , and finished 10th behind three teammates in the time trial .
That was at least until the surprising 41 second gain on Stage 3 , which catapulted him to third overall and ahead of all the other major contenders .
A real conspiracy theory is that the peloton split was intentionally caused by Team Astana .
In truth , two Astana riders did cause the split , but there ’s no evidence to support it was intentional .
I also ca n’t say I have any verification of the Stage 5 claims on the team leaving Contador out to dry ( and for what reason I have no idea ) .
2. Arcalis
In the Tour de France , overall contenders generally only gain time on two types of stages , mountain stages and time trials .
Arcalis was the first mountain stage of the Tour , and the only real difference making stage since the Stage 1 time trial .
It would also be the only place to gain any real time on contenders for the next week of racing .
Astana team orders were not to attack , but Contador made a very late move with 2 kilometers remaining .
No one went with him , and he ended up gaining 21 seconds on all the main contenders .
It also put him two seconds ahead of Armstrong .
Afterwards , there was a “ team meeting ” where Contador got chewed out .
Comments :
Most experts will tell you to never leave time on the road , and Contador won the 2007 Tour by only 23 seconds .
So gaining 21 seconds on everyone , not just Armstrong , was very useful .
It seems weird to criticize a guy for doing his job well , but that ’s just what Armstrong and Bruyneel did .
I ca n’t think of one logical reason why it was bad for Contador to do what he did , in fact the move was fortold by the great Bernard Hinault .
Is it not perfectly acceptable for Contador to exploit his competitor ’s weaknesses and attack the way he did ?
As the team leader , his team should applaud his success .
3. No English
Contador hails from Spain , but can speak at least some English .
Exactly how much is a matter of debate .
Still , his press releases were in Spanish only , with translations in French .
This allowed Armstrong to dominate the English - speaking press .
And dominate Armstrong did , criticizing Contador during the race and even announcing his new Radio Shack team during the Tour ’s final week when Contador ’s victory looked pretty assured and the attention began to focus off Armstrong and on to Contador .
Beaten on the road , Armstrong turned to the battle of the images .
Comments : Announcing a new team while still riding in the biggest event of the year for your current team is a dick move .
It would be like a player announcing at halftime of the Super Bowl he would leave his current team at the end of the game .
4. Armstrong steals the car
In the time trial , riders go individually and start in reverse order of standings .
As a result , it is expected that each rider leave the team hotel individually in anticipation of their respective start times .
Contador , as race leader , would be the last to start in the entire field and last to leave the hotel .
After training and warm - ups , Contador requested a team car take him to the start of the Annecy Time Trial .
Except there was none .
Armstrong made sure all the cars were used to pick up his family and friends upon their arrival that day in France .
Contador ended up calling his brother to pick him up in order to make his start time .
And it was n’t an isolated incident .
It happened a few days later on Mount Ventoux .
Contador came to the press hall with his brother , because the team cars had left him on the top of the mountain .
Comments :
This has been reported in many places , but not verified .
If true , a very childish move on behalf of Armstrong .
5 . The Grand Bornand attack
Le Grand - Bornand was one of the big stages of the Tour , and in retrospect the final major sort out of the overall contenders ( there was still two major stages to go , but they ultimately were not huge factors in the overall standings ) .
A lead group of four riders emerged .
Contador and teammate Andreas Klöden were in the group .
So too were the Schleck brothers , Andy and Fränk .
Andy Schleck was considered by many to be the biggest threat to Contador ’s overall victory .
The Schlecks relentlessly attacked on the stage , dropping Armstrong and all the other main contenders except Contador and Klöden on the penultimate climb .
With 18 km to go to the finish , Contador decided to throw in his first attack of the day .
The Schlecks both covered , but Klöden did not .
In fact , Klöden completely fell apart , and was dropped like a hot potato .
He was roughly two minutes ahead of the Armstrong group when he cracked , but would get caught and passed by both Armstong and Italian Vincenzo Nibali .
Following the stage , Armstrong ’s twitter lit up with criticism .
Bruyneel piled on , claiming that Contador ruined the Astana sweep of the podium ( Top 3 finishers ) .
Comments : Contador ’s tactics have been questioned , and there is at least some debate as to what he did was right or wrong .
But whatever criticism he receives seems to be horribly blown out of proportion .
In his defense , I ’d state these retorts :
(1) Contador ’s the team leader and his sole job is to worry about himself .
He can do whatever he can to win , be it gaining time on his rivals or winning stages .
He should n’t ever be worried about Klöden ’s interests .
No one should know this better than Armstrong , who repeatedly asked some of the world ’s best riders to sacrifice individual achievement for him .
(2) Contador ’s acceleration was actually very brief and fairly tame .
Still , Klöden lost ground hard and fast .
Contador tried to wait up , but ultimately stuck with the Schlecks as Klöden faded into the horizon .
The idea that Klöden would have remained with the leaders absent the Contador attack ( and stuck with them for an additional 18 km ) seems like wishful thinking .
Klöden looked absolutely spent and faded so bad that he was caught and passed by others further down the road .
(3) The idea of an Astana sweep of the podium is a myth perpetrated by Bruyneel and regurgitated by the media .
Even assuming Klöden does stick with the Schlecks on Stage 17 , he rode a substandard time trial and lost even more time on Mont Ventoux ( a stage Contador and Andy Schleck basically cruised through with nothing to gain ) .
There ’s no argument that three Astana riders could beat Andy Schleck .
Heck , even giving Klöden two minutes and fifteen seconds back , he still does n’t beat Schleck .
And there ’s really no argument Armstrong could either .
Andy beat Lance fair and square .
Contador had nothing to do with that .
And you cannot fit three Astana riders in the same podium if Schleck is on the second step .
Although seeing Bruyneel blame Contador for Klöden losing time is the height of hypocrisy , considering it was Klöden who sacrificed time ( probably at Bruyneel ’s orders ) on Verbier dragging Armstrong up to the finish .
The irony of all of this is that Armstrong possibly got his 3rd place thanks to Alberto dropping Klöden .
(4) By all accounts , Klöden was on board for Contador ’s attack , and such an attack may have dislodged either Schleck brother .
Something that would have been quite beneficial to Astana , and Contador and Klöden in particular .
Because an attack failed , does n’t mean it was automatically the wrong tactic to try .
6. Water on Ventoux
Ian Gutierrez , a Spanish rider from Caisse d’Epargne , tried to give Contador his water bottle after he was caught following an early day breakaway .
Gutierrez stated that he , “ offered him ( Contador ) my bottle because I saw that he did n’t have any water and I am his friend . ”
But Armstrong intercepted the attempted pass .
To add insult to injury , after Contador locked in the victory in the Tour at the stage ’s end , Armstrong did n’t bother to attend the celebratory team dinner that night .
Comments :
This actually did happen , although why Armstrong took the bottle is unclear .
His intention could have been innocent , although I wonder how often Armstrong takes water bottles from riders on other teams .
Also , not showing up for the team dinner was pretty classless .
VIII .
Conclusion
Armstrong ’s results in this year ’s Tour de France were remarkable considering his age , fractured collarbone , and time off during retirement .
However , making the Astana in - fighting public , his twittering , announcing Team Radio Shack when he did , and his immaturity in his response to Contador ’s post - Tour press conference has detracted from his achievements this year .
If he had shut his mouth and stopped twittering , then more people would likely be complimentary rather than antagonistic of him .
To some extent , it seems like it was new territory for him .
Contador had the audacity to be better than him at the one event ( other than cancer ) that defines who he is today .
Most highly successful individuals are extremely competitive and usually a bit narcissistic .
When things go well , great .
But when they do n’t go as planned , it seemed Armstrong could n’t act appropriately or follow a scripted behavior .
Armstrong has tweeted “ there is no I in team ” , but by his own actions he certainly has shown that there is a “ me . ”
My guess is the real reason Contador rode the way he did is that is the way he wants to ride .
He may not be content to sit on the wheels and let someone else take the stage win while he waits for Paris , he ( shock , horror ) may actually like winning stages and may actually enjoy going on the attack .
He rides the way he does , not as some grand plan to debunk the Church of Lance , but because he likes racing .
And I think that ’s a good thing that , unfortunately , we do n’t see more of .
The real question is why did n’t Bruyneel have control over his team ?
He apparently just could n’t say no to Armstrong , and the team suffered .
It was clear before the Tour who had the best chance of winning .
Not just within Astana , but overall .
It was crystal clear by the time Stage 1 was done .
Contador had ridden better throughout .
And yet , it seems apparent that Contador held back , and was held back , many times during this Tour .
It also seems apparent he did not trust that Armstrong or Bruyneel had his best interests in mind .
The attack on Arcalis could have been an attempt to put an end to the shenanigans .
But it did n’t .
And instead we get bizarre Twitter fights .
One thing is for sure , no one is coming out well with these personal attacks .
Update ( 11/08/09 ) : I 've just added another 10 or so stations .
Any help would be greatly appreciated .
You can view the latest map here .
Being a huge fan of London and pubs , I thought I would take a copy of the London Tube map and replace the stations with the best pubs in the vicinity of each station ( ideally within walking distance ) .
Download the full version ( 1.7MB )
Unless you know the Underground well , you will need to refer to a real map to work out where everything is .
I 've visited many of the pubs on the circle line and within and are ones which I think are some of the better ones .
Some stations have more than one good pub nearby , especially in the centre of London so it 's hard to pick just one .
As much as I 'd like to visit a pub at each station so that I can add it to the map , I do n't that 's going to happen any time soon .
Therefore , I 'm looking for all the help I can get in populating the map .
If you think you can help by associating some pubs with stations , drop me an e-mail or let me know in the comments .
And if you think some of my choices are poor , let me know .
It 'll be good to try and work out the best pubs in each area .
Note : whilst working through this project I realised that the map I used is not up - to - date and is missing part of the National Rail line .
Rather than transfer all of the changes now , I thought I 'd wait until I 've populated as many of the stations as possible .
With a dragon slain and the world saved , the people of this great land grow bored and unhappy of their 2D world .
Wanting to bring happiness back to his people , the King decides to transform the world into 3D , and that is where the quest begins .
This is the ambitious premise behind 3D Dot Game Heroes , the RPG built on blocks from developer Silicon Studios .
Details are scant on this mystery RPG for the PlayStation 3 , the basic plot and ability to create your own hero is all that is known .
However new screenshots have just been emerged to show us more of this colorful world , which seems to bear a striking resemblance to Nintendo ’s Zelda .
3D Dot Game Heroes is set to release in Japan on November 5th , with no word yet on if the game will make it outside of Japan .

What if eight years ago the World Trade Center had been leveled by a small nuclear bomb that took out most of lower Manhattan as well ?
How many millions of innocent civilians would we have killed in retaliation ?
Would we still be a free society , or would Dick Cheney have attained the power of a demented king , having moved on from snooping on our phone calls and outing honest CIA agents to destroying the last vestiges of the rule of law ?
As assaults on a society go , the 9/11 attacks , which left 3,000 dead and are sure to be described in this anniversary week as being among the greatest of historical outrages , were something less than that , given the world ’s experience with the ravages of war .
The countless Russians and the 6 million Jews killed by those so finely educated Germans come to mind .
The 3.4 million Vietnamese , mostly rice farmers , whom Robert McNamara admitted to having helped kill with his carpet - bombing of their country , are a forgotten footnote .
Yet we who have never experienced such carnage on our home front all too easily poke out tens of thousands of eyes for each lost one of our own .
Surely two planes crashing into office buildings and another hitting the Pentagon does n’t compare to the leveling of every major city in Japan with conventional bombing , capped off by the mass murder of hundreds of thousands more at Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Speaking of eyes lost , mark the words of Hiroshima ’s mayor two years ago : “ That fateful summer , 8:15 AM .
The roar of a B - 29 breaks the morning calm .
A parachute opens in the blue sky .
Then suddenly , a flash , an enormous blast — silence — hell on Earth .
The eyes of young girls watching the parachute were melted . ”
We assumed that the Japanese people would readily forgive us and , having been raised in the spirit of total obedience to their emperor , they accommodated our occupation quite well , even injecting industrial - grade silicon into their women ’s breasts to satisfy the erotic appetites of our soldiers .
Americans who blithely claim the moral high ground with every pledge of allegiance to a flag that , because it is American , is assumed to have never been sullied by imperial greed or moral contradiction expect no less than instant and full forgiveness for our “ mistakes . ”
Only last month , four decades after he led the massacre of 500 villagers in My Lai , Vietnam , did former Army Lt. William Calley express “ regret ” for his crimes .
He served no time in prison for the point - blank shooting of toddlers , thanks to the commutation of his sentence by Richard Nixon , who might have been anticipating his own need for a presidential pardon .
In blind and wrathful retaliation for 9/11 we wreaked havoc on Iraq , a nation that our then - president knew had not attacked us , and we continue to slaughter peasants in Afghanistan who are n’t able to find Manhattan on a map .
We , a people whose nation has never suffered a long and widespread occupation , easily gave vent to our most barbaric impulses , assuming the absolute right to arrest and torture anyone anywhere in the world without revealing his identity , let alone respecting a single one of those God - given rights that we claim for ourselves alone .
And even when we identify the few we hold responsible for the attacks on our soil , we refuse them public and fair trials even after years of torturing them .
But we do have a saving grace for our experiment in democracy — although unfortunately it did not exist in the Supreme Court or Congress as a barrier to an imperial vice presidency .
It is the power of the lone whistle - blower of conscience , occasionally given voice in what remains of our free press and which can influence presidential elections , as happened quite dramatically this last time around .
There are those like Joe Wilson , who exposed presidential fraud masquerading as national security concern over bogus Iraqi purchases of uranium from Niger , and more recently the truth - telling of Ali H. Soufan , a former FBI agent and lead interrogator of terrorists .
In Sunday ’s New York Times , Soufan , who was involved in obtaining much reliable information from prisoners before they were tortured , observed that the recently released memos cited by Cheney to back his argument that torture was efficient actually “ fail to show that the techniques stopped even a single imminent threat of terrorism . ”
So , Cheney is again proved wrong , but if there had been a larger attack on 9/11 , I doubt whether many free souls would be around now to tell him so .

LET ’S say you have what you believe to be a healthy marriage .
You ’re still friends and lovers after spending more than half of your lives together .
The dreams you set out to achieve in your 20s — gazing into each other ’s eyes in candlelit city bistros when you were single and skinny — have for the most part come true .
Two decades later you have the 20 acres of land , the farmhouse , the children , the dogs and horses .
You ’re the parents you said you would be , full of love and guidance .
You ’ve done it all : Disneyland , camping , Hawaii , Mexico , city living , stargazing .
Sure , you have your marital issues , but on the whole you feel so self - satisfied about how things have worked out that you would never , in your wildest nightmares , think you would hear these words from your husband one fine summer day : “ I do n’t love you anymore .
I ’m not sure I ever did .
I ’m moving out .
The kids will understand .
They ’ll want me to be happy . ”
But wait .
This is n’t the divorce story you think it is .
Neither is it a begging - him - to - stay story .
It ’s a story about hearing your husband say “ I do n’t love you anymore ” and deciding not to believe him .
And what can happen as a result .
But , overall , the leading bills and the President 's proposal are , like the dog that did n't bark , more notable for what is missing .
Here are 13 problems with the current health care bills ( partial list ) :
No cost controls on insurance companies .
The coming sharp increases in premiums , deductibles , co-pays , co-insurance , etc. will quickly outpace any projected protections from caps on out - of - pocket costs .
Insurance companies will continue to be able to use marketing techniques to cherry - pick healthier , less costly enrollees .
No restrictions on insurance denials of care that insurers do n't want to pay for .
In case you missed it , the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee uncovered data on the California Department of Managed Care website recently that found six of the biggest California insurers rejected , on annual average , more than one - fifth of all claims every year since 2002 .
No challenge to insurance company monopolies , especially in the top 94 metropolitan areas , where one or two companies dominate , severely limiting choice and competition .
A massive government bailout for the insurance industry through the combination of the individual mandate requiring everyone not covered to buy insurance , public subsidies which go for buying insurance , no regulation on what insurers can charge , and no restrictions on their ability to decide what claims to pay .
No controls on drug prices .
The White House deal with Big Pharma , which won bipartisan approval in the Senate Finance Committee , opposes the use of government leverage to negotiate real cost controls on inflated drug prices .
No single standard of care .
Our multi-tiered system remains with access to care still determined by ability to pay .
Tax on comprehensive insurance plans .
That will encourage employers to reduce benefits , shift more costs to employees , promote proliferation of bare - bones , high - deductible plans , and lead to more self - rationing of care and medical bankruptcies .
Not universal .
Some people will remain uncovered , including those exempted , and undocumented workers , denying them treatment , exposing everyone to communicable diseases and inflating health care costs .
No definition of covered benefits .
No protection for our public safety net .
Public hospitals and clinics will continue to be under - funded and a dumping ground for those the private system does n't want .
Public monies going to hospitals serving low - income communities will be shifted to subsidies for private insurance .
Long delay in implementation .
Many reforms do n't go into effect until 2013 .
Nothing changes in basic structure of the system ; health care remains a privilege , not a right .
We may be slow learners , but the rest of the industrial world has figured it out : Universal , single - payer or national health care systems .
That 's the reason why all those other countries cover everyone , have better patient outcomes , cause no one to declare bankruptcy or lose their homes because of medical bills , and spend less than half per capita on health care than we do .
We could do it too , by reducing the starting age for Medicare from 65 to 0 .
There 's still time to act .
Call on your Congress member to support the vote coming up on the House floor on the Anthony Weiner amendment to protect , expand and improve Medicare for All .
Senators have the same opportunity in a vote on Senate bill 703 , being offered as a floor amendment by Senator Bernie Sanders .
Democrats must also ensure that whatever bill passes includes a provision enabling states to set up their own single - payer systems .
These votes are the true litmus tests of the Democrats ' commitment to guaranteeing health care for all , and finally solving our health care crisis .
Grand Junction police say the report of a death threat against U.S. Rep. John Salazar turned out to be “ unfounded . ”
The threat reportedly had been made outside Salazar ’s Grand Junction office Aug. 24 as health care reform opponents and supporters squared off .
“ People who witnessed the interaction between the man who made the complaint and the suspect confirmed they never heard any direct threats made regarding Congressman Salazar , ” said Kate Porras , spokeswoman for the Grand Junction police .
“ Also , a ( Grand Junction police officer ) in close proximity when the interaction took place never heard any direct threats made against Salazar by the suspect , ” she said .
Asked whether the person filing the report faced any kind of charge , such as filing a false report , Porras said , “ Not at this time .
We do n’t have any information to show the person who filed the report intentionally gave us false information . ”
Salazar ’s spokesman , Eric Wortman , said the staff had no idea police were investigating a threat report until police stopped by their office four days later with a copy of the report and a picture of the suspect .
Police did not know the suspect ’s name , but the person filing the report had snapped a picture .
The staff became alarmed because the person in the picture had been in Salazar ’s office earlier that day to invite the Manassa Democrat to a health care rally sponsored by Republicans .

ASHEVILLE , N.C. 
In the small trailer her family rented over the summer , 9 - year - old Charity Crowell picked out the green and purple outfit she would wear on the first day of school .
She vowed to try harder and bring her grades back up from the C’s she got last spring  a dismal semester when her parents lost their jobs and car and the family was evicted and migrated through friends ’ houses and a motel .
Charity is one child in a national surge of homeless schoolchildren that is driven by relentless unemployment and foreclosures .
The rise , to more than one million students without stable housing by last spring , has tested budget - battered school districts as they try to carry out their responsibilities  and the federal mandate  to salvage education for children whose lives are filled with insecurity and turmoil .
The instability can be ruinous to schooling , educators say , adding multiple moves and lost class time to the inherent distress of homelessness .
And so in accord with federal law , the Buncombe County district , where Charity attends , provides special bus service to shelters , motels , doubled - up houses , trailer parks and RV campgrounds to help children stay in their familiar schools as the families move about .
Still , Charity said of her last semester , “ I could n’t go to sleep , I was worried about all the stuff , ” and she often nodded off in class .
Sin llegar a un acuerdo salarial , los trabajadores colocaron las banderas rojinegras en las entradas de la armadora .
La crisis automotriz no les permite dar aumentos , argumenta la empresa
En punto de las 11:00 horas comenzaron a ser colocadas las banderas rojinegras en las diferentes entradas de la armadora Volkswagen , luego que los directivos de la empresa y el Sindicato Independiente de Trabajadores de la Industria Automotriz ( Sitiavw ) no llegaron a un acuerdo de aumento salarial .
La huelga , que afecta a cerca de 14 mil 700 trabajadores - cerca de 9 mil 400 de ellos obreros sindicalizados - estalló luego que las pláticas entre las partes se rompieron esta mañana , pues la empresa no aceptó dar un aumento directo al salario que exigía el sindicato .
A su vez , la representación gremial rechazó - por mandato de las bases - un bono de 5 mil 500 pesos que le ofrecía la empresa y que sería el único ingreso extraordinario que recibirían los trabajadores al menos hasta febrero de 2010 .
El argumento de los directivos es que las ventas de la armadora germana han caído cerca de 37 % de enero a julio del presente año , como consecuencia de la crisis automotriz que azota al mundo , y lo cual les impide dar un aumento directo al salario en este año .
Aunado a ello , se remarca que la empresa mantiene en su plantilla a 400 obreros sobrantes , con el fin de evitar despidos .
Sin embargo , el líder sindical Jaime Cervantes Rosas insistió en que se debe dar dicho aumento a los trabajadores , pues en el caso de otras empresas del ramo en que se ha dado un bono , ha sido porque estaban al borde de la quiebra , lo que no sucede en Volkswagen .
Así , a lo largo de esta mañana , los trabajadores que se presentaron a laborar de manera normal comenzaron a abandonar las naves industriales y las áreas administrativas , a fin de que la planta quedara vacía al momento de la colocación de las banderas rojinegras .
La última huelga que estalló en Volkswagen de México fue en 2006 , en que tampoco se llegó a un acuerdo salarial .

Travelling is often about trying the unusual and attempting to experience the different culture of the country you are visiting .
One of the best ways to do this is to try the foods the native people eat .
They may not be to everyone 's tastes , but the following foods , whilst considered weird and bizarre to some of us , are considered delicious delicacies in other countries .
Although eating these foods might seem like a form of ' extreme dining ' to us , they are in fact quite normal to the people who eat them .
1 - Birds Nest Soup , China
You would n't necessarily think a birds nest would be edible , but the Chinese use Swifts ' nests to make this soup , known as the ' Caviar of the East ' .
Right now you 're probably imagining a nest made out of twigs and leaves , but Swiftlets make their nests predominantly out of saliva .
It 's something in the saliva of the bird that makes it have this unique gelatinous , rubbery texture and it's one of the most expensive animal products consumed by humans .
It 's expensive because the swiftlets build the nests during breeding season over a period of 35 days and nests can only be harvested around three times a year .
The nests are typically built in coastal caves and collecting them is a treacherous process involving climbing and nimble skill , which adds to the hefty price tag .
With an increase in demand for birds nest soup however , manmade nesting sites are often constructed .
Hong Kong and the US are the largest importers of birds ' nests and a bowl of soup can cost around $ 30 to $ 100 per bowl , whilst a kilo of nest can cost between $ 2,000 and $ 10,000 .
The soup has been a tradition for centuries and is believed to be nutritious in proteins and minerals and have aphrodisiac qualities .
2 - Fried tarantulas , Cambodia
Eensy weensy spider , climbing up the spout ... if you suffer from arachnophobia you probably do n't want to try eating these eight legged monsters .
They 're not tiny little house spiders , they 're great big tarantulas and you can buy them in the streets of Skuon , Cambodia .
They 're fried whole - legs , fangs and all .
They were first discovered by starving Cambodians in the bloody , brutal days of the Khmer Rouge rule and have gone from being the vital sustenance of these people to a delicacy tourists come far and wide to try .
The black hairy arachnids found in the jungle around the market town of Skuon have become a source of fame and fortune for the region as bus loads of people stop to try them on their way to other places .
They cost only a few cents and supposedly taste delicious , as they are best plucked straight from the burrow and pan fried with a bit of garlic and salt .
They 're supposed to taste a bit like crickets or scrawny chickens and are crispy on the outside with a gooey body on the inside .
3 - Puffer fish , Japan
You 've got to be careful with this delicacy or you might end up in the morgue .
The deadly Puffer fish , or fugu , however is the ultimate delicacy in Japan even though its skin and insides contain the poisonous toxin todrotoxin , which is 1,250 times stronger than cyanide .
That 's why in Japan only expert chefs in licensed restaurants are allowed to prepare it .
Otherwise you 're likely to become paralysed whilst still conscious and eventually die from asphyxiation because there is no known antidote .
Fifteen people died in Thailand when the fish was made illegal and people started dying it pink and passing it off as salmon .
4 - Balut , Phillipines
A bit like with a Kinder Surprise , you certainly will be surprised to open these eggs , though not in the same pleasant way as finding a toy inside .
You get to eat your chicken and your egg at the same time with Balut .
Fertilized eggs are boiled just before they 're due to hatch , so your yolk oozes out followed by ... a chicken ( or duck ) foetus .
They are cooked when the foetus is anywhere from 17 days to 21 days depending on your preference , although when the egg is older the foetus begins to have a beak , claws , bones and feathers .
In Filipino culture Balut is almost as popular as the hot dog in America and street vendors yell out ' Baluuuuuuut ' as they push their carts down the street .
They are popularly believed to boost the libido and are also a hearty snack full of protein .
Balut are usually guzzled down with beer and are prepared with a pinch of salt , lemon juice , black pepper and coriander , although some Balut eaters prefer it with chili and vinegar .
The way to eat Balut is to crack open the egg , sip the broth and then eat the yolk and foetus ... it's not everyone 's cup of tea , but apparently it 's delicious .
5 - Casu Marzu , Sardinia
This Sardinian cheese is a cheese with a difference ; it 's riddled with insect larvae .
Casu Marzu means ' rotten cheese ' and is most commonly referred to as ' maggot cheese . '
It 's now banned for health reasons but can still be available on the black market in Sardinia and Italy .
The sheep 's milk cheese is basically Pecorino , which has had the larvae of the cheese fly , Piophila casei , introduced to it .
Fermentation occurs as the larvae digest the cheese fats , and the texture becomes very soft with some liquid seeping out .
The cheese has to be eaten when the maggots are still alive because when they are dead it is considered to be toxic .
Since the larvae can jump if they are disturbed , diners have to shield their eyes or place the cheese in a sealed paper bag until the maggots are starved of oxygen and die .
Health issues have arisen in relation to Casu Marzu , including reports of allergic reactions and the danger of consuming cheese that has advanced to a toxic state .
There 's also some risk of intestinal larval infection .
6 - Surstromming , Sweden
One of the world 's strangest dishes can be found in Sweden .
Surstomming is fermented Baltic herring and can be found on supermarket shelves all over the country , although you probably wo n't see it next to the Ikea meatballs .
The herring is caught in spring when it is just about to spawn and is fermented in barrels for one to two months before it is tinned where the fermentation continues for several months .
The cans often bulge during shipping and storage because of the continued fermentation process .
Certain airlines have in fact banned these cans from being taken on flights , as they consider the pressurized cans to be potentially dangerous , like fireworks and explosives .
When the can is opened the smell is usually what will get to you first as the fermented fish has a really strong odour .
It 's usually eaten with a type of flat crispy bread and boiled potatoes .
Sometimes people drink milk with it , but beer and water are often used to guzzle it down .
7 - Live Octopus , Korea
In Korea Sannakji is a raw dish consisting of live octopus .
The octopus is cut into pieces whilst still alive , lightly seasoned with sesame oil and served immediately whilst the tentacles can still be seen squirming on the plate .
Eating live octopus is a challenge not only mentally trying to get your head round eating something that 's still alive , but physically , as the tentacles stick to any surface they touch .
You actually have to fight with your food before you can devour it and savour its taste .
The first hurdle is to get the tentacles off your chopsticks , and once the octopus is in your mouth it will suction to your teeth , the roof of your mouth and your tongue essentially trying to preserve its own life .
It is supposedly enjoyable to experience the party in your mouth as the tentacles wriggle around and stick to your mouth as you chew it .
Special care should be taken to chew thoroughly , however , because if the suction cups stick to the mouth or throat , this can be a choking hazard .
8 - Kopi Luwak , Indonesia
You might want to think twice if someone offers you a cup of this coffee when you pop round to their house .
Kopi Luwak is the rarest , most expensive gourmet coffee in the world .
Sounds divine right ?
It 's actually made from the excrements of an Indonesian cat - like creature called the Luwak .
The Luwak eats only the ripest coffee cherries but its stomach can't digest beans inside them , so they come out whole .
The coffee that results from this process is said to be like no other , and the stomach acids and enzymes that perform the fermentation of the beans give the coffee a special aroma .
This process takes place on the islands of Sumatra , Java and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago .
With an expensive price tag of anywhere between US $ 120 - $ 300 per pound , you might want to start saving now if you want to try this gourmet coffee .
9 - Puffin Heart , Iceland
Sometimes referred to as the ' clown of the ocean ' or ' sea parrot ' , the puffin , with its colourful beak and clumsy behaviour , is considered an adorable bird .
The sight of a puffin flapping its wings and jumping from a cliff to generate enough lift to become airborne is enough to make anyone go ' aaaah ' .
In Iceland , however , these seabirds have been a source of sustenance for Icelanders on the islands for centuries .
Iceland is home to one of the world 's largest colonies of puffins and ' sky fishing ' is a sport which involves catching the low flying birds in a big net .
The best place to catch a puffin or two is in the Westman Islands , where they are sustainably harvested to prevent them from coming extinct .
The heart of a puffin is eaten raw whilst it is still warm in traditional Icelandic delicacy .
Puffins are eaten by breaking their necks , skinning them and then eating the fresh heart raw .
Puffin is supposed to be delicious like a fishier version of chicken or duck .
It is often smoked , grilled or pan-fried .
TV chef Gordon Ramsey caused quite a stir when he was seen eating this rare delicacy on TV .
10 - Snake Wine , Vietnam
Fancy some wine with a difference ?
A bouquet of snake with some snake blood notes perhaps ?
Snake wine is a bottle of rice wine with a venomous snake inside and has ' medicinal purposes ' , but is probably more useful for display purposes than to drink .
The snake is left to steep in the rice wine for many months to let the poison dissolve in the wine .
The ethanol makes the venom inactive so it is not dangerous , and snake wine supposedly has many health benefits .
It has a slightly pink colour like a nice rose because of the snake blood in there .
It originated in Vietnam , where snakes are thought to possess medicinal qualities , but it has spread to other parts of South East Asia and Southern China .
Snake blood wine on the other hand is made by slicing the belly of the snake to let the blood drain into the wine and this is served immediately .

The official Spanish translation is not due out yet
Translation mistakes and poor graphics litter the version of the book , issued five months in advance of the official Spanish volume 's release .
But the author apologises for his or her shortcomings in notes in the book .
On one page the translator warns : " Here comes something that I 'm unable to translate , sorry . "
Readers will also find the translator admitting not knowing how to translate the word " breathy " , while on another page , it reads : " You gave him ' the old one - two ' ( I 'm sorry , I did n't understand what that meant ) . "
The cover is an exact copy of the English - language version , which has been on sale since 21 June .
The book is 777 pages long , compared to the 870 - page original .
Daily newspaper El Universal reported that two people had been arrested last month and charged with producing the bootlegs .
Legal action
Bootleg translations of the latest Harry Potter book have appeared all around the world .
Fans not content with waiting for the official translation have taken matters into their own hands .
German fans of the books were threatened with legal action after translating the book online .
In Chile , two men were arrested for producing their own translated copies of the Potter book .
The president of the Chilean Book Chamber business group urged people not to buy the book , which was selling for about $ 15 ( £ 9.30 ) , saying it was not just a pirated copy but also " a bad translation " .
And in France , English speakers impatient for the book 's official release in December have bought the original version , making it the first English book to top the best - seller list .
Eurozone stimulus : A myth , some facts , and impact estimates
Volker Wieland
Eurozone governments have engaged in substantial fiscal stimulus .
This column argues against further fiscal measures , claiming that forward - looking firms and households will cut their expenditure in response to governmental expansions .
It warns that further fiscal efforts risk eroding financial and monetary policies that are combating the crisis .
Fact : Fiscal stimulus packages put together by Eurozone governments were much smaller than the US package ( American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , ARRA ) .
Announcements of discretionary fiscal measures by Eurozone governments only add up to about 1 % of GDP in 2009 and a little less in 2010 .
The $ 787 billion stimulus by the US government amounts to over 5 % of US GDP .
Myth :
It ’s the fault of the German government .
If only they had followed the example set by the Americans , the Eurozone economy would have enjoyed a big boost , and the recession would have been much smaller .
This view still appears to be widely held .
To give just one example , as recently as July 20 , the German business daily Handelsblatt reported on an interview with Robert Shiller under the front - page heading “ We need more stimulus ” as follows :
Handelsblatt : Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman accused the German government some months ago of " boneheadedness " in fighting the recession .
How do you judge the crisis management in Germany ?
Shiller :
My impression is that the stimulus program of the German government was weak .
Though the money from the stimulus package in America was also flowing with some delay , it has at least strengthened confidence .
In this regard the US was more active .
Fact :
The German government , which was heavily criticised in the fall of 2008 for not spending enough , quickly followed up with a second “ Konjunkturpaket ” in January 2009 .
The two fiscal packages , together , imply additional spending , transfers , and tax cuts of about 1.5 % in 2009 and 2 % in 2010 .
This is actually quite close to the US stimulus for those two years , since the ARRA measures are spread over five years .
The German stimulus is about 50 % of the Eurozone stimulus , quite a bit more than its share in Eurozone GDP .
Given that Germany is a country with much more pronounced automatic stabilisers than the US , this is a strong sign of fiscal activism .
Thus , the German government should get good grades from those who trust in the boosting power of fiscal stimulus .
How much of a boost to Eurozone GDP should we expect ?
Proponents of discretionary fiscal stimulus hope for a Keynesian multiplier effect .
It follows from the national accounts spending identity when combined with the textbook Keynesian consumption function .
The latter has current income as the main driver of consumption spending .
A government - induced increase in total spending then raises income and boosts private consumption , which in turn raises total spending further .
Does the multiplier work ?
The recent debate in the US indicates quite some disagreement even among Keynesian economists .
President Obama ’s advisers Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein estimate that 1 % of government spending would generate a 1.6 % increase in GDP .
They give much weight to the type of traditional macro models used by some forecasting firms .
As a result , they believe the ARRA stimulus is good for 3 % to 4 % additional growth by end of 2010 .
A robustness analysis with New - Keynesian models conducted by Cogan , Cwik , Taylor , and Wieland ( 2009 ) indicates only about one - sixth of this effect .
Our analysis suggests government spending quickly crowds out private consumption and investment , because forward - looking households and firms will consider eventual increases in future taxes , government debt , and interest rates .
New evidence on the multiplier
In a recent paper , Tobias Cwik and I assess the magnitude of Eurozone stimulus and construct a range of impact estimates ( Cwik and Wieland 2009 ) .
We use a database of macroeconomic models that includes several models developed and used at important policy institutions such as the ECB , the EU Commission , and the IMF .
Our findings confirm the earlier analysis with models of the US economy .
Once you allow for a significant role of forward - looking behaviour by households and firms , there is no multiplier .
The expectation of future tax increases , or rising government debt and future interest rate increases leads to a reduction in private consumption and investment spending .
This holds in particular for the three New Keynesian models developed by economists at the ECB , the IMF and the EU Commission ( see Smets and Wouters 2003 , Laxton and Pesenti 2003 , and Ratto , Roeger and in’t Veld 2009 ) .
These models include extensive Keynesian features such as price and wage rigidities , but also employ up - to - date microeconomic foundations .
The model of EU Commission researchers is especially interesting because it is recently estimated and one - third of its households do not care about the future and follow a traditional Keynesian consumption function .
Broadly similar results are obtained in the multi-country model of Taylor ( 1993 ) , a slightly older vintage of New Keynesian economics with price and wage rigidities and forward - looking households and firms .
Only the ECB ’s area - wide model delivers the desired multiplier effect .
However , all its firms and households look backwards .
Its developers therefore caution that it is adequate for short - term forecasts but not the evaluation of major policy changes ( Fagan et al. 2005 ) .
Likely implementation lags make things worse .
If anticipated , the initial effect of fiscal stimulus may even be negative .
Monetary accommodation , of course , helps .
For example , if the ECB puts off the usual interest rate increases for a year , the fiscal stimulus gets more play , but not enough to generate a substantial multiplier .
Spillovers to Eurozone neighbours and a conclusion
Additional spending may partly be diverted to imports .
For this reason , proponents of fiscal stimulus in Europe have talked much about spillover effects and lobbied for coordinated measures .
As it turns out , Eurozone stimulus remained limited because most Eurozone members did not really follow the US example .
Using Taylor ’s multi-country model , we tried to estimate likely spillovers from the major stimulus package in Germany to France and Italy .
This model exhibits significant direct demand effects for French and Italian exports .
Nevertheless , the spillovers are negligible .
Readers who remember the impact of the German unification spending boom on members of the European Monetary System in the early 1990s will not be surprised .
The direct demand effects are offset by the upward pressure on the exchange rate with countries outside the Eurozone , as well as the expectation of somewhat higher future interest rates .
Conclusion
In light of these findings , European policy makers ought to ignore calls for further stimulus packages .
Instead , they should carefully monitor the impact of decisions already taken on the burden imposed on future taxpayers .
If governments exhaust their fiscal space in measures that have little aggregate effect , their continued capability to back up the financial system will be questioned .
At the same time , the economy is likely to benefit more from the increases in base money engineered by the ECB than traditional Keynesians would tend to believe ( see Orphanides and Wieland 2000 ) .
In addition , fiscal responsibility on behalf of Eurozone governments would help avoid a premature exit from unconventional measures by the ECB .

SALMON , Idaho ( Reuters ) - The American
West is losing its autumn colors as global warming begins to bite and there is far more at stake than iconic scenery .
Aspen , the white - barked trees with golden leaves that gave their name to the famed Colorado ski resort , have been dying off across the Rocky Mountain states .
The die - off is puzzling but some foresters point to climate change .
This disaster coincides with beetle outbreaks that have laid waste to millions of acres of pine and spruce forest in the American and Canadian west .
They too have been linked to warmer winters since extremely cold temperatures are needed to kill the insects .
Recent droughts and other factors linked to global warming are seen as likely causes for “ sudden aspen decline , ” or SAD , so named because it can strike a forest so quickly .
“ Assuming climate predictions are true , it probably is a sign of things to come , ” said Jim Worrall , forest pathologist with the U.S. Forest Service .
Dwindling aspen would spell trouble for mountain towns like Aspen , Colorado , where tourists flock each autumn to see their spade - shaped leaves turn from green to gold before skiers arrive for the winter .
Failing aspen forests also hurt sawmills and threaten large animals such as elk seeking food with consequences for hunting and other outdoor industries .
The effects have yet to hit home in a city that trades on its scenic beauty , but officials are braced for the worst .
“ A large die - off could be devastating , ” said Aspen Mayor Mick Ireland .
Colorado acreage ravaged by SAD quadrupled from 2006 to 2008 to more than 850 square miles ( 2,200 square km ) .
The syndrome has also struck in Utah , Wyoming and Idaho , where researchers suggest a warmer , dryer West may all but eliminate aspen from the Rocky Mountains by the end of the century .
Stands afflicted by SAD lose leaves , are assaulted by insects and frequently fail to reproduce .
Delta Timber Co. in southwest Colorado , where SAD is at its height , depends almost entirely on aspen to produce paneling for walls and ceilings .
“ We ’re struggling right now with the same thing all sawmills are facing because of the housing crunch , ” said owner Eric Sorenson .
“ Now with the trees dying , it ’s going to create more challenges . ”
NOTHING TO BE DONE ?
Dale Bartos , aspen ecologist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Logan , Utah , is cautious about using climate - based forecasts to predict an end to aspen .
“ I see aspen moving up and down the hillsides with climate change , ” he said .
“ As it dries out , we may see aspen on the lower end move up the hill .
I do n’t think the answer is cut and dried . ”
Others foresee a grim outlook for a tree whose image has long been associated with the outdoors appeal of the West .
“ What we think will happen is that aspen will disappear in some areas and there will not be anything we can do about it , ” said SAD expert Wayne Shepperd of Colorado State University .
A study by scientists with the federal Rocky Mountain Research Station in Moscow , Idaho presented just such a scenario .
It predicted the near total disappearance of aspen in the Rocky Mountain region by 2090 .
The research , to be published in Forest Ecology and Management , links ailing aspen to global climate change and concludes that up to 41 percent of Western forests would be unable to support aspen by 2030 .
That figure would rise to 75 percent by 2060 and as much as 94 percent in 2090 .
Study co-author Gerald Rehfeldt said a combination of less rain and snow , the timing of precipitation and warmer summers would outstrip the tree ’s ability to colonize new areas .
Future forests may show an increase in evergreen seedlings as they encroach on areas once occupied by aspen .
But aspen in other areas may also replace dying spruce and pine .
“ Things are happening pretty quickly and that ’s what ’s scary , ” said Forest Service plant pathologist John Guyon .
The employees at Tesco seem to be immune to mind tricks , and have kicked out the founder of the International Church of Jediism .
Daniel Jones , 23 , who founded the religion based on the Star Wars movies , was asked to leave because his robes were against store rules which forbid the wearing of ' hoodies ' in their premises .
" I told them it was a requirement of my religion but they just sniggered and ordered me to leave , " he told The Daily Telegraph newspaper .
" I walked past a Muslim lady in a veil .
Surely the same rules should apply to everyone . "
It 's exactly this kind of stuff that turns young Jedis to the dark side .
Bullit Cargo Bike : Sporty And Stylish Utility Bicycles
Got a heavy load to transport , but still insist on pushing pedals ?
Your persistence is admirable and should be rewarded with a Bullit Bike , an extra-long cargo bicycle with spiffy good looks that wo n’t cramp your style .
Sporty looks and outstanding utility rarely manage to come together , especially in the world of mechanical rides .
That ’s why these long - wheelbase units from Larry vs Harry offer a tremendous upside to your daily errands , whether that involves delivering large packages or giving your mate a ride to the subway when his car breaks down ( not sure if that ’s legal in your area , though ) .
The Bullit is available in thirteen different versions , all built off the same stretched frame , with differences mostly in brake , gear and color configurations .
Each one sports hardened aluminum tubing ( which helps keep the bike just a few kilos heavier than regular two - wheelers ) , stainless steel discs , puncture - proof Schwalbe tires and double - bound aluminum rims .
Models include the Bullit Classic ( which comes with a hydraulic front brake and 7 - speed SRAM Truvativ crankshaft ) , the Clockwork ( pictured above , with an 8 - gear Shimano Alfine hub and Shimano Alfine hydraulic brakes ) and the Milk Plus ( same system as the Clockwork , with a milky white color and a Chuck Berry likeness on the frame ) .
Measuring the same width as a regular bike , it should n’t pose much problems for regular cyclists .
In fact , the front dock seems much easier to handle than other cargo bikes , which chooses to outfit the load behind you – not the most confidence - inspiring design by a large measure .
The Larry vs Harry Bullit Bike seems available strictly in Europe for now .
Price starts at € 1800 ( $ 2,570 ) .
Now , I ’d like to see someone do freestyle on this thing .

Probably not !
Earlier this week , London ’s Daily Mail reported that a producer for Creation , the Charles Darwin biopic starring Jennifer Connelly , Paul Bettany , and this terrible hairdo , is blaming the film ’s inability to secure U.S. distribution on the film ’s subject matter — specifically that “ religious American audiences ” would find “ his theories on human evolution too controversial . ”
Jeremy Thomas , the producer in question , continued : “ It is unbelievable to us that this is still a really hot potato in America .
There ’s still a great belief that He made the world in six days . ”
You ’ve no doubt been subjected to a million tweets from outraged friends and invited to join Facebook groups defending Creation against the mobs of pitchfork - wielding creationists massing against it .
But maybe the movie ’s just not that good ?
And a money loser to boot ?
For instance !
Hardly anyone liked Creation when it screened last week in Toronto .
( Sample quote : “ Flat , dull , and painful to sit through . ” )
And it stars two actors who , despite being former Brooklynites and adorable and married , are not exactly stars with box - office clout .
Let ’s see : Period biopic about a writer most people do n’t feel that strongly about ?
Marginal lead actor who ’s liked but not loved ?
British pedigree and bad reviews ?
This sounds exactly like the kind of movie that some distributor would have snapped up three years ago in an attempt to put together an Oscar campaign and then would have lost a big fat wad of cash on .
It ’s like the 2009 version of Miss Potter , but with Paul Bettany in the Renée Zellweger role .
More to the point , the article in the Daily Mail ( motto : “ Okay , George Clooney did n’t actually write that “ ) does n’t cite any actual instances of actual distributors shying away from the movie because of fears of Christian protest .
It just quotes a guy with a vested interest in raising a little controversy around his movie .
( We asked the film ’s publicists if the producers could provide any evidence to back up the claim and were told , “ They remain optimistic that they will get U.S. distribution and are working hard to make that happen . ” )
So hold off on the angry tweeting for now .
Maybe creationists will picket Creation when it finally gets a distribution deal , maybe as soon as today .
And maybe it ’ll turn out to be great and get nominated for a hundred Oscars and divide the nation like no movie since Fahrenheit 9/11 .
But it is n’t under attack yet , and it does n’t need you to defend it .

His is the other face of the shopkeeper ’s rage , the one that draws cheers from crime - weary citizens and business owners .
At his store last week , Mr. Drame watched on the dozens of televisions on display as Mr. Augusto spoke about the Harlem shooting .
“ How are you going to rob an old man like that ? ” Mr. Drame said in disgust .
He opened his store nine years ago , after stints working as a fishmonger , a parking attendant and a cleaner of vendors ’ carts .
“ I worked so hard , and they wanted to take what is mine , ” Mr. Drame , 35 , said of the men who tried to hold him up .
Mr. Drame , who has five children , grabbed the man ’s gun and started firing .
When it was over , one of the robbers was dead , and another died in the hospital .
The other two men fled .
Mr. Drame spent a few weeks in Kings County Hospital Center , then went back to work , installing security cameras that cover every approach to his store .
If anything , the shooting gave him new strength , he said : “ I did n’t come to America to die . ”
Many of the stores where owners made stands over the years have vanished .
Gone is the delicatessen on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan where , in 1930 , Adolph Sargenti fired two bullets into the temple of a robber in a shabby suit who rifled through the cash register .
So is La Cabana , the restaurant in Bushwick , Brooklyn , where Rafael Disla fatally shot robbers in two separate episodes in 1991 .
Leonard Rosenthal owned the Gold Star Jewelry Store in Sheepshead Bay , Brooklyn , for almost 20 years until he died of cancer in 2006 , said his wife , Marina Rosenthal .
She spoke at her daughter ’s New Jersey home this week about the aftermath of the robbery that took place at the store 15 years ago .

A.S .
Yesterday , I had the pleasure of visiting my parents and getting out an old computer .
One of the first computers I used a lot was the Sharp MZ - 80 K which was sold from 1979 to 1982 .
I was but a wee bairn , but this is the first machine I really programmed .
First using BASIC and then using Z - 80 assembler ( and sometimes by typing in characters directly on the screen corresponding to Z - 80 opcodes and then calling the address of the start of screen memory to have the program on screen executed ) .
My parents have a Sharp MZ - 80 K that I purchased as a nostalgia item some years ago .
Yesterday I fired it up for the first time and was straight into the boot ROM .
Oddly , I could remember everything about the machine 's operation and shoved a cassette tape containing SP - BASIC into the tape drive , hit play and typed
The machine duly loaded SP - BASIC and gave me the prompt .
Then I did the real test .
After poking around and finding a tape of my old BASIC programs I typed LOAD again and explored the tape .
30 years on all the programs loaded from tape just fine and executed .
I was able to spend a happy few hours playing character - based games that I wrote .
Here 's a screen shot of the listing of one such game : notice theinitials at the start .
This was one of the few programs I put my name in ( I think because it was clearly co-written with ) .
I put the survival of that tape down to two things : my parents careful handling of a box of Sharp MZ - 80 K and BBC Micro tapes and my obsession at the time of being the highest quality CrO 2 cassette tapes available : " It is still considered today by many oxide and tape manufacturers to have been the most perfect magnetic recording particulate ever invented .

The tankers were crossing a river when the air strike took place
Scores of people are reported killed after a Nato air strike blew up two fuel tankers hijacked by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan .
The governor of Kunduz province told the BBC that Taliban leaders were among at least 90 killed .
Witnesses said locals taking fuel also died .
Nato said its commanders believed only insurgents were present but that it had reports many civilians were injured .
Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said an investigation was under way .
A statement from Hamid Karzai's office said the Afghan president believed that " targeting civilians in any form is unacceptable and [ he ] emphasised that innocent civilians must not be killed or wounded during military operations " .
' Beheaded '
The Taliban confirmed to the BBC that they had stolen the tankers , one of which became stuck at a river crossing .
Map of the area ANALYSIS Chris Morris , BBC News , Afghanistan
If it emerges that a number of civilians have been killed then that will obviously be very disappointing to Nato .
The issue of civilian casualties caused by international military action is extremely sensitive here .
It has caused great anger .
It is something military commanders have said they are determined to clamp down on , because they say if they win territory and not the people then they are not doing their job .
At this point , a Nato air strike hit the tankers causing a huge explosion , he said .
The Nato attack occurred about 7 km ( four miles ) south - west of Kunduz city at about 0200 Friday ( 2130 Thursday GMT ) .
International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) spokeswoman Lt Cdr Christine Sidenstricker said Afghan forces had reported the fuel trucks hijacked and Nato aircraft had spotted them on a river bank .
" After observing that only insurgents were in the area , the local Isaf commander ordered air strikes which destroyed the fuel trucks and killed a large number of insurgents , " she said .
" The strike was against insurgents .
That is who we believe was killed . "
Later another spokesman , Brig Gen Eric Tremblay , was quoted by Reuters as saying : " It would appear that many civilian casualties are being evacuated and treated in the local hospitals .
" There is perhaps a direct link with the incident that has occurred around the two fuel trucks . "

The AFP news agency reported that there were many seriously burned people in a hospital in Kunduz .
One of the drivers of the tankers told the BBC that two of his colleagues had been beheaded when the Taliban carried out the hijacking .
Kunduz province Governor Mohammad
Omar said most of the dead were Taliban fighters - some of whom were Chechens .
Witness Mohammad Daud , 32 , told AFP the militants had been trying to transport the tankers across a river to villages in Angorbagh .
" They managed to take one of the tankers over the river .
The second got stuck so they told villagers to come and take the diesel , " he said .

In pictures : Afghan tanker strike Limited time for Afghan success Taliban infiltrate Afghan north " Villagers rushed to the fuel tanker with any available container that they had .
" There were 10 to 15 Taliban on top of the tanker .
This was when they were bombed .
Everyone around the fuel tanker died . "
Mr Rasmussen said the leader of international troops in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal , had told President Karzai he was committed to investigating the incident .
" It is really a focal point for our Isaf troops to minimise the number of civilian casualties , and a new strategy to that end has already been introduced , " Mr Rasmussen said .
" Civilian casualties caused by Isaf are down over 95 % from last year 's levels .
But , as we all know , in conflicts like these , mistakes can happen .
In this case , let us now see what the investigation concludes . "
The incident came days after Gen McChrystal reiterated calls for a fresh approach to the conflict .
" The situation in Afghanistan is serious , but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy , commitment and resolve , and increased unity of effort , " he wrote in a strategic assessment .

I WAS sitting in a theater watching movie previews when the trailer for Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds exploded on the screen .
I almost retched .
A " hero " smashes the head of a Nazi prisoner with a baseball bat .
Other sadistic delights are promised for our viewing enjoyment .
Supposedly , a " renegade " outfit of mostly Jews has been organized to go behind German lines , and kill and mutilate Nazis .
Each soldier is given the duty to take 100 scalps .
I do n't mean kill .
They are literally supposed to cut off the tops of their heads .
The band also carves swastikas in foreheads .
The reviewers say that , true to Tarantino 's " style , " when a head gets bashed in , we 'll get to see " pulp " and brain " spatter . "
Admittedly , none of the film is true .
The movie is a Second World War " fantasy , " a " comedy , " our " wish fulfillment . "
For the viewer , exactly how is all this different than watching a snuff film ?
What pernicious effect will this " cinematically dazzling " gore - fest have on U.S. or Israeli soldiers sent to fight in Gaza , Lebanon , Afghanistan , Iran or who knows where else ?
After all , they 're always told they 're fighting the troops of the " new Hitler , " and only wimps would refuse to " take the gloves off " when fighting " Nazis . "
What a revolting insult the movie is to the Allied infantrymen who fought in the Second World War , who by and large never engaged in atrocities .
I HAVEN'T seen Tarantino 's cinematic dreck , and I do n't intend to .
Instead , I 'm re-reading the autobiography of a Second World War hero , a real Jew who really fought Nazis , someone who Hollywood never thought to put in a movie .
His name was Leopold Trepper .
He was the " conductor " of the Red Orchestra , the Soviet spy group in Nazi- occupied Europe .
Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler claimed Trepper " cost Germany the lives of 200,000 soldiers " ( according to Gilles Perrault in The Red Orchestra ) .
Trepper was a Jew from Galicia , which , when he was born , was part of Austro - Hungary .
His family was dirt poor , and he dropped out of school to take working - class jobs .
He took part in a general strike in Krakow , Poland , that was viciously suppressed .
He was blacklisted and he left for Palestine in 1924 .
After a few months of Zionist enthusiasm , he saw the class struggle at work and joined the Communist Party of Palestine .
The party wanted to organize Jews and Arabs together , but the British , Ben Gurion 's Jewish police and the Palestinian Grand Mufti thought otherwise .
After an arrest , a hunger strike and constant harassment , Trepper was deported .
His closest comrades in Palestine would eventually become the core of the Red Orchestra .
After a stint in France , Trepper left for the Soviet Union .
He was there during the height of the purges , and describes how a party of militants degenerated into a collection of fearful robots , him among them .
Yet the danger of Nazism was always uppermost in his mind , and he joined the Red Army Intelligence Service under Gen. Jan Berzin .
Trepper went to Belgium in 1938 to set up a network that would awaken in the event of war with Germany .
To make a long story short , Trepper was able to send to Moscow 1,500 radio messages with an incredible store of information about troop deployments , industrial production , raw material availability , aircraft production and even the plans for the top secret T6 - Tiger tank .
In May 1941 , he gave the Soviet military attaché in Vichy the proposed plan of attack of " Operation Barbarossa , " the German invasion of the Soviet Union ( this and other independent reports of German war preparation were ignored as forgeries by the all - knowing Stalin ) .
Within a few days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union , German radio operators began intercepting coded messages that were being sent to Moscow .
A special group was set up to hunt down the Soviet network , which the Germans dubbed the " Red Orchestra . "
Gradually , they met with success , and through arrests and torture , finally found the " Big Chief . "
Trepper was arrested by the Gestapo in November 1942 .
Incredibly , he was able to outwit the Gestapo from within their dungeons .
They never found out he was a Jew .
They thought they could " turn " Trepper and make him work for them .
Trepper convinced them to continue sending radio messages to the Soviet Union to make it appear that he had never been captured .
He even went on numerous " outings " from prison with his guards to let supposed free agents know that all was well .
The Gestapo eventually trusted him so well that he was lightly guarded .
One of his interrogators constantly complained of stomach pain , and Trepper told him of a pharmacy he knew that had the " ideal remedy . "
On September 13 , 1943 , Trepper was allowed to go unescorted into the pharamacy to buy the medicine .
Trepper walked out the back door and escaped , laying low for the rest of the war .
IS THERE any movie on this ?
I think there 's blood and gore enough even for a Tarantino .
Most of Trepper 's comrades were captured , about a hundred were executed - - often they were beheaded .
Not enough suspense and twists and turns ?
Well , there 's more to Trepper 's story .
After the liberation of France , he took the first available plane back to Moscow .
Within a few weeks , he was in Lubianka prison .
His " crime " was belonging to the " counter - revolutionary gang " of General Berzin .
Berzin had been executed during the purges .
Despite Trepper 's years of amazing work for the Soviets , his association with an " enemy of the people " was all that mattered .
In 1947 , he was given a sentence of 15 years .
Not until Stalin died was his case reviewed honestly .
He was exonerated and let out of prison in 1954 .
If that 's not enough for a movie , there 's still more .
Trepper and his family returned to Poland in 1957 , and he became the leader of the Cultural Association of Polish Jews .
Ten years later , Gomulka , the first secretary of the Polish Communist Party , made a speech at a union meeting saying , " The Jewish community is the Fifth Column . "
A wave of anti-Semitic outbursts swept the country .
Jews started leaving .
In June 1971 , Trepper was put under virtual house arrest .
An international campaign was started on his behalf .
Yet the conditions of his confinement did not improve .
Two years later , after a serious illness , he wrote a letter to the Polish Communist Party Central Committee , saying he intended to go on a hunger strike .
Either he would be allowed to leave Poland , or he would starve himself to death !
The CP caved .
In November 1973 , he was allowed to leave for England .
Trepper died in Jerusalem in 1982 .
In the epilogue to his autobiography The Great Game , he wrote that he did not regret his revolutionary commitment " that socialism will triumph , and that it will not have the color of the Russian tanks that crushed Prague . "
So there you have it -- a proud , tough Jew and a Red who made the made the Nazis pee in their pants .
I think there 's a movie in there somewhere .

Gabon 's First Lady Lives on Food Stamps in California Inge Bongo demands to take her place as first lady and reform the country .
NAIROBI , Kenya , Sept. 8 , 2009  --
The new president of Gabon , Ali Ben Bongo , is the son of the country 's ruler for the last 42 years and a member of one of the wealthiest families in Africa .
Gabon 's new first lady is American - born Inge Bongo .
But there 'll be no inauguration ceremony or redecorating of the presidential palace for her .
Inge Bongo lives in California and is on food stamps .
The new president is confronting angry demonstrations in the streets of the country 's capital , Libreville , and other cities protesting what they claim was a rigged election .
The beleaguered president - elect is also facing demands from his estranged wife to be allowed to take her place as first lady and to reform what she says is a lack of human rights .
Inge Bongo makes it clear that she does n't expect her husband to quickly agree .
" I 'm going to claim my right as first lady .
I 'm going to make a lot of noise .
I 'm going to take this opportunity to make some changes , whether he likes it or not , " Inge Bongo told ABC News .
" He can deny a settlement and a divorce .
But he 's a young man , he 's 50 .
And I 'm relatively young .
I can just keep doing this forever . "
Inge and Ali have had a tempestuous relationship after meeting 23 years ago on a blind date in California .
It was love at first sight .
" We met on a Sunday morning before he was supposed to take a flight out , " she says .
" He ended up not taking the flight .
We fell in love . "
A worldwide whirlwind romance ensued with meetings in California , Paris and Gabon , until the couple married in Madrid in 1994 .
The marriage was made legal in the United States , according to documents obtained by ABC News .
Inge was allowed to make her primary residence with their three children in California , visiting Gabon often while Ali would remain in the country carrying out his duties .
Inge says throughout her 23 - year relationship with Ali Bongo , she travelled to Gabon often but could never adjust to the disparity between the rich lifestyle of the Bongos and the abject poverty the general population lived in .
" Gabon is a country of the haves and the have nots , and the haves were all Bongos , " she says .
" When I would complain , they literally laughed at me .
They thought Americans were kind of foolish , that they did n't have time to worry about human rights . "
Gabon is a small country in West Africa , with major oil reserves , and that means oil money .
The country also had the same president for over 40 years , Omar Bongo , Ali 's father .
Inge 's husband served as the country 's minister of defense and was widely expected to succeed his father in the presidency .
Omar Bongo died in June , and the campaign to elect the next president began , with the election Aug. 30 .
There were 17 candidates , but Ali Ben Bongo , the most visible and best financed , was declared the winner .
Accusations of election fraud and voter intimidation have prompted street demonstrations in recent days .
Over Omar Bongo's 42 - year reign , he and his family amassed a large amount of wealth .
The country enjoyed strong ties with its former colonizer France , and the Bongo family owns several homes in France , including a $ 21 million apartment in one of Paris ' plushest neighborhoods .
The French government has frozen $ 900 million of the family 's assets in response to a lawsuit filed by the anticorruption group Transparency International on behalf of a Gabonese citizen , who 's accused the family of corruption , embezzlement and fraud .
Inge said the Bongo family would take frequent shopping trips to Paris and other cities around the world .
Inge Bongo Appeared on VH1 Show
" They wake up in the morning and decide what are they going to buy , but it's at the expense of their character , " says Inge .
" Shop and shop and shop .
They charter 747s and fill them .
Everybody would get an envelope and you could buy your car and whatever you want .
There were fleets of Porsches . "
Inge was also a beneficiary of the wealth .
She says her three children attended top private schools around the world and lived a luxurious life complete with private chefs , drivers and nannies .
At one point , Inge Bongo appeared on the VH1 show " Really Rich Real Estate , " where she put in a $ 25 million bid for a mansion in Malibu .
She also rented a home from Sean " P. Diddy " Combs for $ 25,000 per month ( eventually suing him for landlord neglect of the home ) .
That changed about four years ago , when President Omar Bongo told his son that his wife needed to reside in Gabon , says Inge .
She tried living there , but decided she could not make her permanent home in Gabon .
" [ Ali ] got very violent , " she says .
Inge claims that witch doctors convinced her husband that something was wrong with her .
" He had me kidnapped several times , he had me mutilated , he beat me beyond recognition . "
Pictures taken after the alleged incident show her bruised and cut around her waist .
Inge escaped back to California , where Ali Bongo had tried to win her back several times , she says .
She even travelled back to Gabon for short visits to try and work things out , but by that time the relationship was essentially over .
Of those visits she says , " He treated me like a zombie . "
Ali Bongo has since married a much younger Gabonese woman named Sylvia Valentin Bongo .
In interviews and official announcements she is referred to as his wife , but legally Inge Bongo remains married to him .
Her youngest son , whom she adopted with Ali Bongo , is 10 years old , and now goes to public school , while she says she lives off food stamps and the generosity of friends .
Ali Bongo converted to Islam years ago , allowing him to have more than one wife .
Inge is not Muslim and says she has thought about divorce , even going so far as to obtain a lawyer in California to work out a settlement , but Gabon 's new president has not responded .
According to her , the last time she received money from him was more than a year ago .
" We had a pact that we 'd never divorce .
To me that did n't involve being broke , " she says .
" He promised he would take care of us . "
Now Inge says she wants her rightful place as the new first lady of Gabon .
She wants to make changes in the country 's wealth disparity and the rights of women and children , and has called for the Obama administration to get involved in her case .
She says she sees some similarities in Obama being the first black president with African roots , and her being the first black American first lady of an African country .
" Hopefully , I can get the Obama administration to shine some light on the injustices against women and children and everything that I feel is wrong . "
A spokeswoman for the government of Gabon told ABC News the government has no comment on Inge Bongo at this time .

BRAIN TIME [ DAVID M. EAGLEMAN :]
At some point , the Mongol military leader Kublai Khan ( 1215 – 94 ) realized that his empire had grown so vast that he would never be able to see what it contained .
To remedy this , he commissioned emissaries to travel to the empire 's distant reaches and convey back news of what he owned .
Since his messengers returned with information from different distances and traveled at different rates ( depending on weather , conflicts , and their fitness ) , the messages arrived at different times .
Although no historians have addressed this issue , I imagine that the Great Khan was constantly forced to solve the same problem a human brain has to solve : what events in the empire occurred in which order ?
Your brain , after all , is encased in darkness and silence in the vault of the skull .
Its only contact with the outside world is via the electrical signals exiting and entering along the super - highways of nerve bundles .
Because different types of sensory information ( hearing , seeing , touch , and so on ) are processed at different speeds by different neural architectures , your brain faces an enormous challenge : what is the best story that can be constructed about the outside world ?
The days of thinking of time as a river — evenly flowing , always advancing — are over .
Time perception , just like vision , is a construction of the brain and is shockingly easy to manipulate experimentally .
We all know about optical illusions , in which things appear different from how they really are ; less well known is the world of temporal illusions .
When you begin to look for temporal illusions , they appear everywhere .
In the movie theater , you perceive a series of static images as a smoothly flowing scene .
Or perhaps you 've noticed when glancing at a clock that the second hand sometimes appears to take longer than normal to move to its next position — as though the clock were momentarily frozen .
More subtle illusions can be teased out in the laboratory .
Perceived durations are distorted during rapid eye movements , after watching a flickering light , or simply when an " oddball " is seen in a stream of repeated images .
If we inject a slight delay between your motor acts and their sensory feedback , we can later make the temporal order of your actions and sensations appear to reverse .
Simultaneity judgments can be shifted by repeated exposure to nonsimultaneous stimuli .
And in the laboratory of the natural world , distortions in timing are induced by narcotics such as cocaine and marijuana or by such disorders as Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , and schizophrenia .
Try this exercise :
Put this book down and go look in a mirror .
Now move your eyes back and forth , so that you 're looking at your left eye , then at your right eye , then at your left eye again .
When your eyes shift from one position to the other , they take time to move and land on the other location .
But here 's the kicker : you never see your eyes move .
What is happening to the time gaps during which your eyes are moving ?
Why do you feel as though there is no break in time while you 're changing your eye position ?
( Remember that it 's easy to detect someone else 's eyes moving , so the answer cannot be that eye movements are too fast to see . )
All these illusions and distortions are consequences of the way your brain builds a representation of time .
When we examine the problem closely , we find that " time " is not the unitary phenomenon we may have supposed it to be .
This can be illustrated with some simple experiments : for example , when a stream of images is shown over and over in succession , an oddball image thrown into the series appears to last for a longer period , although presented for the same physical duration .
In the neuroscientific literature , this effect was originally termed a subjective " expansion of time , " but that description begs an important question of time representation : when durations dilate or contract , does time in general slow down or speed up during that moment ?
If a friend , say , spoke to you during the oddball presentation , would her voice seem lower in pitch , like a slowed - down record ?
If our perception works like a movie camera , then when one aspect of a scene slows down , everything should slow down .
In the movies , if a police car launching off a ramp is filmed in slow motion , not only will it stay in the air longer but its siren will blare at a lower pitch and its lights will flash at a lower frequency .
An alternative hypothesis suggests that different temporal judgments are generated by different neural mechanisms — and while they often agree , they are not required to .
The police car may seem suspended longer , while the frequencies of its siren and its flashing lights remain unchanged .
Available data support the second hypothesis .
1 Duration distortions are not the same as a unified time slowing down , as it does in movies .
Like vision , time perception is underpinned by a collaboration of separate neural mechanisms that usually work in concert but can be teased apart under the right circumstances .
This is what we find in the lab , but might something different happen during real - life events , as in the common anecdotal report that time " slows down " during brief , dangerous events such as car accidents and robberies ?
My graduate student Chess Stetson and I decided to turn this claim into a real scientific question , reasoning that if time as a single unified entity slows down during fear , then this slow motion should confer a higher temporal resolution — just as watching a hummingbird in slowmotion video allows finer temporal discrimination upon replay at normal speed , because more snapshots are taken of the rapidly beating wings .
We designed an experiment in which participants could see a particular image only if they were experiencing such enhanced temporal resolution .
We leveraged the fact that the visual brain integrates stimuli over a small window of time : if two or more images arrive within a single window of integration ( usually under one hundred milliseconds ) , they are perceived as a single image .
For example , the toy known as a thaumatrope may have a picture of a bird on one side of its disc and a picture of a tree branch on the other ; when the toy is wound up and spins so that both sides of the disc are seen in rapid alternation , the bird appears to be resting on the branch .
We decided to use stimuli that rapidly alternated between images and their negatives .
Participants had no trouble identifying the image when the rate of alternation was slow , but at faster rates the images perceptually overlapped , just like the bird and the branch , with the result that they fused into an unidentifiable background .
To accomplish this , we engineered a device ( the perceptual chronometer ) that alternated randomized digital numbers and their negative images at adjustable rates .
Using this , we measured participants ' threshold frequencies under normal , relaxed circumstances .
Next , we harnessed participants to a platform that was then winched fifteen stories above the ground .
The perceptual chronometer , strapped to the participant 's forearm like a wristwatch , displayed random numbers and their negative images alternating just a bit faster than the participant 's determined threshold .
Participants were released and experienced free fall for three seconds before landing ( safely ! ) in a net .
During the fall , they attempted to read the digits .
If higher temporal resolution were experienced during the free fall , the alternation rate should appear slowed , allowing for the accurate reporting of numbers that would otherwise be unreadable .
2
The result ?
Participants were n't able to read the numbers in free fall any better than in the laboratory .
This was not because they closed their eyes or did n't pay attention ( we monitored for that ) but because they could not , after all , see time in slow motion ( or in " bullet time , " like Neo in The Matrix ) .
Nonetheless , their perception of the elapsed duration itself was greatly affected .
We asked them to retrospectively reproduce the duration of their fall using a stopwatch . ( " Re- create your freefall in your mind .
Press the stopwatch when you are released , then press it again when you feel yourself hit the net . " )
Here , consistent with the anecdotal reports , their duration estimates of their own fall were a third greater , on average , than their recreations of the fall of others .
How do we make sense of the fact that participants in free fall reported a duration expansion yet gained no increased discrimination capacities in the time domain during the fall ?
The answer is that time and memory are tightly linked .
In a critical situation , a walnut - size area of the brain called the amygdala kicks into high gear , commandeering the resources of the rest of the brain and forcing everything to attend to the situation at hand .
When the amygdala gets involved , memories are laid down by a secondary memory system , providing the later flashbulb memories of post - traumatic stress disorder .
So in a dire situation , your brain may lay down memories in a way that makes them " stick " better .
Upon replay , the higher density of data would make the event appear to last longer .
This may be why time seems to speed up as you age : you develop more compressed representations of events , and the memories to be read out are correspondingly impoverished .
When you are a child , and everything is novel , the richness of the memory gives the impression of increased time passage — for example , when looking back at the end of a childhood summer .
To further appreciate how the brain builds its perception of time , we have to understand where signals are in the brain , and when .
It has long been recognized that the nervous system faces the challenge of feature - binding — that is , keeping an object 's features perceptually united , so that , say , the redness and the squareness do not bleed off a moving red square .
That feature - binding is usually performed correctly would not come as a surprise were it not for our modern picture of the mammalian brain , in which different kinds of information are processed in different neural streams .
Binding requires coordination — not only among different senses ( vision , hearing , touch , and so on ) but also among different features within a sensory modality ( within vision , for example : color , motion , edges , angles , and so on ) .
But there is a deeper challenge the brain must tackle , without which feature - binding would rarely be possible .
This is the problem of temporal binding : the assignment of the correct timing of events in the world .
The challenge is that different stimulus features move through different processing streams and are processed at different speeds .
The brain must account for speed disparities between and within its various sensory channels if it is to determine the timing relationships of features in the world .
What is mysterious about the wide temporal spread of neural signals is the fact that humans have quite good resolution when making temporal judgments .
Two visual stimuli can be accurately deemed simultaneous down to five milliseconds , and their order can be assessed down to twenty - millisecond resolutions .
How is the resolution so precise , given that the signals are so smeared out in space and time ?
To answer this question , we have to look at the tasks and resources of the visual system .
As one of its tasks , the visual system — couched in blackness , at the back of the skull — has to get the timing of outside events correct .
But it has to deal with the peculiarities of the equipment that supplies it : the eyes and parts of the thalamus .
These structures feeding into the visual cortex have their own evolutionary histories and idiosyncratic circuitry .
As a consequence , signals become spread out in time from the first stages of the visual system ( for example , based on how bright or dim the object is ) .
So if the visual brain wants to get events correct timewise , it may have only one choice : wait for the slowest information to arrive .
To accomplish this , it must wait about a tenth of a second .
In the early days of television broadcasting , engineers worried about the problem of keeping audio and video signals synchronized .
Then they accidentally discovered that they had around a hundred milliseconds of slop :
As long as the signals arrived within this window , viewers ' brains would automatically resynchronize the signals ; outside that tenth - of - a- second window , it suddenly looked like a badly dubbed movie .
This brief waiting period allows the visual system to discount the various delays imposed by the early stages ; however , it has the disadvantage of pushing perception into the past .
There is a distinct survival advantage to operating as close to the present as possible ; an animal does not want to live too far in the past .
Therefore , the tenth - of - a - second window may be the smallest delay that allows higher areas of the brain to account for the delays created in the first stages of the system while still operating near the border of the present .
This window of delay means that awareness is postdictive , incorporating data from a window of time after an event and delivering a retrospective interpretation of what happened .
3
Among other things , this strategy of waiting for the slowest information has the great advantage of allowing object recognition to be independent of lighting conditions .
Imagine a striped tiger coming toward you under the forest canopy , passing through successive patches of sunlight .
Imagine how difficult recognition would be if the bright and dim parts of the tiger caused incoming signals to be perceived at different times .
You would perceive the tiger breaking into different space - time fragments just before you became aware that you were the tiger 's lunch .
Somehow the visual system has evolved to reconcile different speeds of incoming information ; after all , it is advantageous to recognize tigers regardless of the lighting .
This hypothesis — that the system waits to collect information over the window of time during which it streams in — applies not only to vision but more generally to all the other senses .
Whereas we have measured a tenth - of - a- second window of postdiction in vision , the breadth of this window may be different for hearing or touch .
If I touch your toe and your nose at the same time , you will feel those touches as simultaneous .
This is surprising , because the signal from your nose reaches your brain well before the signal from your toe .
Why did n't you feel the nose - touch when it first arrived ?
Did your brain wait to see what else might be coming up in the pipeline of the spinal cord unti lit was sure it had waited long enough for the slower signal from the toe ?
Strange as that sounds , it may be correct .
It may be that a unified polysensory perception of the world has to wait for the slowest overall information .
Given conduction times along limbs , this leads to the bizarre but testable suggestion that tall people may live further in the past than short people .
The consequence of waiting for temporally spread signals is that perception becomes something like the airing of a live television show .
Such shows are not truly live but are delayed by a small window of time , in case editing becomes necessary .
Waiting to collect all the information solves part of the temporal - binding problem , but not all of it .
A second problem is this : if the brain collects information from different senses in different areas and at different speeds , how does it determine how the signals are supposed to line up with one another ?
To illustrate the problem , snap your fingers in front of your face .
The sight of your fingers and the sound of the snap appear simultaneous .
But it turns out that impression is laboriously constructed by your brain .
After all , your hearing and your vision process information at different speeds .
A gun is used to start sprinters , instead of a flash , because you can react faster to a bang than to a flash .
This behavioral fact has been known since the 1880s and in recent decades has been corroborated by physiology : the cells in your auditory cortex can change their firing rate more quickly in response to a bang than your visual cortex cells can in response to a flash .
The story seems as though it should be wrapped up here .
Yet when we go outside the realm of motor reactions and into the realm of perception ( what you report you saw and heard ) , the plot thickens .
When it comes to awareness , your brain goes through a good deal of trouble to perceptually synchronize incoming signals that were synchronized in the outside world .
So a firing gun will seem to you to have banged and flashed at the same time .
( At least when the gun is within thirty meters ; past that , the different speeds of light and sound cause the signals to arrive too far apart to be synchronized . )
But given that the brain received the signals at different times , how can it know what was supposed to be simultaneous in the outside world ?
How does it know that a bang did n't really happen before a flash ?
It has been shown that the brain constantly recalibrates its expectations about arrival times .
And it does so by starting with a single , simple assumption : if it sends out a motor act ( such as a clap of the hands ) , all the feedback should be assumed to be simultaneous and any delays should be adjusted until simultaneity is perceived .
In other words , the best way to predict the expected relative timing of incoming signals is to interact with the world : each time you kick or touch or knock on something , your brain makes the assumption that the sound , sight , and touch are simultaneous .
While this is a normally adaptive mechanism , we have discovered a strange consequence of it : Imagine that every time you press a key , you cause a brief flash of light .
Now imagine we sneakily inject a tiny delay ( say , two hundred milliseconds ) between your key - press and the subsequent flash .
You may not even be aware of the small , extra delay .
However , if we suddenly remove the delay , you will now believe that the flash occurred before your key - press , an illusory reversal of action and sensation .
Your brain tells you this , of course , because it has adjusted to the timing of the delay .
Note that the recalibration of subjective timing is not a party trick of the brain ; it is critical to solving the problem of causality .
At bottom , causality requires a temporal order judgment : did my motor act come before or after that sensory signal ?
The only way this problem can be accurately solved in a multisensory brain is by keeping the expected time of signals well calibrated , so that " before " and " after " can be accurately determined even in the face of different sensory pathways of different speeds .
It must be emphasized that everything I 've been discussing is in regard to conscious awareness .
It seems clear from preconscious reactions that the motor system does not wait for all the information to arrive before making its decisions but instead acts as quickly as possible , before the participation of awareness , by way of fast subcortical routes .
This raises a question : what is the use of perception , especially since it lags behind reality , is retrospectively attributed , and is generally outstripped by automatic ( unconscious ) systems ?
The most likely answer is that perceptions are representations of information that cognitive systems can work with later .
Thus it is important for the brain to take sufficient time to settle on its best interpretation of what just happened rather than stick with its initial , rapid interpretation .
Its carefully refined picture of what just happened is all it will have to work with later , so it had better invest the time .
Neurologists can diagnose the variety of ways in which brains can be damaged , shattering the fragile mirror of perception into unexpected fragments .
But one question has gone mostly unasked in modern neuroscience : what do disorders of time look like ?
We can roughly imagine what it is like to lose color vision , or hearing , or the ability to name things .
But what would it feel like to sustain damage to your time - construction systems ?
Recently , a few neuroscientists have begun to consider certain disorders — for example , in language production or reading — as potential problems of timing rather than disorders of language as such .
For example , stroke patients with language disorders are worse at distinguishing different durations , and reading difficulties in dyslexia may be problems with getting the timing right between the auditory and visual representations .
We have recently discovered that a deficit in temporalorder judgments may underlie some of the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia , such as misattributions of credit ( " My hand moved , but I did n't move it " ) and auditory hallucinations , which may be an order reversal of the generation and hearing of normal internal monolog .
As the study of time in the brain moves forward , it will likely uncover many contact points with clinical neurology .
At present , most imaginable disorders of time would be lumped into a classification of dementia or disorientation , catch - all diagnoses that miss the important clinical details we hope to discern in coming years .
Finally , the more distant future of time research may change our views of other fields , such as physics .
Most of our current theoretical frameworks include the variable t in a Newtonian , river - flowing sense .
But as we begin to understand time as a construction of the brain , as subject to illusion as the sense of color is , we may eventually be able to remove our perceptual biases from the equation .
Our physical theories are mostly built on top of our filters for perceiving the world , and time may be the most stubborn filter of all to budge out of the way .

A critical point is that the speed at which one can discriminate alternating patterns is not limited by the eyes themselves , since retinal ganglion cells have extremely high temporal resolution .

We introduced the term postdiction in 2000 to describe the brain 's act of collecting information well after an event and then settling on a perception ( D. M. Eagleman and T. J. Sejnowski , " Motion Integration and Postdiction in Visual Awareness , " Science 287( 2000 ) :2036 –8 ) .

We have no way to verify that there is no backdoor in Mac OS X that could install changes without permission , but that is no basis to claim there is one .
I apologize for repeating a criticism of Mac OS which I cannot substantiate and must presume is false .
While Apple has not , it seems , imposed changes by force , it has a record of making users install harmful changes on pain of losing functionality , and misleading users about what these changes do .
In 2005 , Apple made users install version 4.7 of iTunes in order to continue using the iTunes music store .
This " upgrade " was billed by Apple as fixing a " security hole . "
What the update actually did was change the iTunes system of Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) to make PyMusique stop working .
PyMusique was free software that allowed GNU / Linux users to access the iTunes store .
( See http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-03/22/content_2728356.htm and http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/22/apple_blocks_pymusique/.)
Apple similarly imposed other incompatible iTunes changes later in 2005 , and in 2006 : users could not play music purchased using newer versions of iTunes in older versions of iTunes .
So users had to update iTunes on all of their computers that they wanted to play their own music on , not just on the computer that they used to actually purchase the DRM - afflicted music .
( See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay.)
In 2008 , Apple snuck a new DRM malfeature into Quicktime in an update advertised as adding a feature for renting movies .
This malfeature stopped users from playing video files they themselves had made .
( See http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/26/quicktime_drm_cripples_adobe_programs/.)
If Mac OS X does not have a backdoor to forcibly install changes , that does not make it ethical .
It has other malicious features , such as Digital Restrictions Management ( see http://defectivebydesign.org/apple).
What makes those malfeatures possible is that users can't remove them .
Mac OS is proprietary software , so the users do n't have control over it -- rather , the developer has sole control over the program , and employs it as an instrument of control over the users .
So I do n't withdraw my condemnation of Mac OS .
But I do withdraw the claim that it has a known backdoor .

I found Ty Burrell 's Phil to be the funniest character and he made me laugh the most .
He 's the cool dad that is up to date with everything kids do .
Hilarity ensues as his daughter invites a guy to hang out .
My favorite moment was when Eric Stonestreet 's Cameron who is married to Jesse Tyler Ferguson 's Mitchell brings out the baby to the music of the Lion King .
A problem with the episode was the old guy Jay played by Ed O'Neil with the much younger wife , Gloria .
The entire deal seemed more surreal than the rest of the show and I was confused about their relationship .
I 'm sure that will be dealt with quickly as we kind of jump right into the documentary without much background .
Personally , the premise is n't as funny as events at a community college ( NBC's Community ) , but there are many storylines the show can have .
There are plenty of social issues the show can touch on , and the pilot briefly had a few moments with the gay couple .
I have a lot of shows to watch , so I 'm not sure if I can fit Modern Family in there .
I 'd like to see more of the show and maybe I 'll have a sudden revelation how good the show is and burst out laughing whenever I see this .
My Wednesday 's look pretty empty with just Criminal Minds ( I refuse to watch Glee ) , so we 'll see .

On Aug. 8 , 1969 , less than one month after Neil Armstrong made one giant leap for mankind , the Beatles took a few steps outside the recording studio where they were working on their penultimate album and turned a quiet road into one of the most famous streets in London .
The group spent 15 minutes to shoot the album cover –- an image that has been reproduced countless times since .
From the BBC :
The idea for the cover of the Beatles ’ Abbey Road album was initially to call it Everest , after the favorite brand of cigarettes smoked by their engineer Geoff Emerik .
Then the thought of doing a Himalayan cover helped kill the idea , and instead they considered doing [ the ] shoot closer to home .
“ There ’s a sketch Paul McCartney did with four little stick men crossing the Zebra , ” says Brian Southall , author of the history of Abbey Road Studios .
In the album photo , the Beatles appear to be walking across a quiet London street .
But it is actually quite a busy intersection .
Abbey Road Studios now has a Web cam focused on the zebra striped crosswalk , showing all manner of people stopping for photo ops , while disrupting the flow of traffic .

A Trinity College Dublin geologist has come up with fresh ideas on how space debris and dust manage to form themselves into planets
UNDERSTANDING
the origins of our solar system is one of the great questions of science .
A “ hunch ” that is being backed up by hard facts has led Trinity College geologist Dr Ian Sanders to a radical new idea – one that goes against the conventional wisdom .
Our sun , like other stars , was formed from a disk of gas and dust around four and half billion years ago , which is why the planets all lie in the same plane , says Sanders .
The dust and gas in this disk combined to form tiny planets , or “ planetesimals ” , and ultimately the planets we see today .
It is the details of this process that Sanders has studied for the past 15 years .
“ The asteroid belt is a region where this process was thwarted – probably because Jupiter was too close .
This has led to lots of leftover material , ” explains Sanders .
We have access to this material through the meteorites that fall to earth .
“ Common meteorites formed right in the beginning , providing samples of the material that never made it to planets , ” says Sanders .
When meteorites fall to earth they carry with them valuable , ready - made clues called chondrules .
Chondrules are grains that formed from molten droplets of rock , like lava , explains Sanders .
“ The conventional idea is that they formed when dust was zapped by some unknown source , possibly solar flares .
The main reason for this hypothesis is that their chemistry is exactly the same as that of the sun – they are the raw material of the whole solar system , ” he says .
He sees flaws in this assumption however .
The alternative explanation , that Sanders believes is much more likely , is that chondrules formed when much larger molten bodies collided , “ splashing ” out tiny droplets of molten rock .
But how did these larger bodies themselves form ?
And why were they molten if the temperature in the surrounding space was so very cold ?
Sanders believes they formed directly from the dust drifting around the sun , along with radioactive aluminium - 26 which was also readily available .
The radioactivity provided the large amounts of heat required to melt dust and rubble as it accumulated .
These planets of 50 to 100 km across would form a frozen crust , helping to insulate the molten core , he explains .
A great advantage for Sanders ’s hypothesis is that it removes the need for the unknown “ zapping ” mechanism in the conventional model .
His ideas are finding more and more support in the scientific community , and recent dating of meteorites supports this alternative hypothesis .
So how did Sanders come to these new ideas ?
“ This is an interesting philosophical observation of the way science works , ” he says .
“ Anyone in science is curious and this goes back to the very beginnings of the solar system . ”
His own interest began in 1993 when he got a letter “ out of the blue ” from a student eager to study meteorites – a field Sanders at that time knew little about .
“ I had to find out fast ! ”
And so began his scientific journey to re-think how chondrules where formed .
“ This was actually an old idea , that I thought was very plausible , ” says Sanders .
“ Sometimes you have a hunch and if you ’re lucky it ’s supported by the data , otherwise you abandon it . ”
And in this case the data seems to back him up .
Sanders believes that a great advantage was starting out as an outsider in the field : “ I was not blinkered by conventional thinking ” .
However , being an outsider he was keen to get his message out there .
So he threw a party .
Every year about half of the 1,000 members of the Meteoritical Society get together for a scientific meeting .
In 1998 , five or six years into this research , Sanders hosted the meeting .
“ I decided to give a really good party and ran the meeting in Dublin .
There was a party every night .
It was a turning point .
As a newcomer on the scene , everyone now new who I was . ”
A decade later , Sanders has just presented his latest findings at the 2009 Meteoritical Society , held in France last month , and his work was the subject of a recent article in New Scientist .
Now that his ideas seem to be gaining more and more acceptance in the scientific community , does Sanders think he will be famous for this work ?
“ I think I ’ll be more famous for running a good party in Dublin ! ”

" In completing the unit the student has demonstrated the ability to walk to the local bus stop " - Using public transport ( unit 1 ) , by exam board AQA
Bobby McHale , 15 , is the proud owner of a certificate , earned by successfully catching a bus .

“ In any other country , Milton Glaser would have been knighted by now , ” said Steven Heller about the legendary designer recently .
The implication : Americans do n’t care about design as much as people in other countries .
A recent email conversation touched on the same nerve …
“ I do n’t think they could have made it any uglier if they had tried — even if they were trying really , really hard to make it ugly . ”
That ’s what ex-37 signaller and now Nike employee Ernest Kim wrote in a note to a few of us about the 2010 Accord Crosstour ( shown here ) .
Looks like others agree with him too .
Ernest wonders why the cars Honda designs for markets outside the U.S. look better than the ones designed specifically for the American market .
Could it be that Americans just have bad taste ?
The sad part to me is that Honda cars designed for markets outside of the U.S. generally look at least decent ( examples being the Fit , Euro / Japan Accord ( aka the Acura TSX here in the States ) , S2000 ) , but the ones specifically for U.S. consumption are horrendous ( examples being this awful Crosstour , the Pilot SUV and Ridgeline pick - up ) .
One reason might simply be that their U.S. - based design team is not very good , but I suspect it has more to do with U.S. - based focus groups and lowered standards for U.S. focused products , which is the approach that led to GM ’s eventual bankruptcy .
I know it ’s the trendy thing to do to say that Americans , on the whole , have bad taste , but I really believe it ’s true .
A product that ’s just good enough to be wildly popular in the U.S. typically does n’t make the cut anywhere .
I have to wonder why our standards seem to be so much lower ?
Having traveled to Europe and Asia , I do n’t think the average European or Asian person is any smarter than the average American , but their standards for product design seem appreciably higher .
Is it because people outside the U.S. tend to buy fewer items and so have higher expectations for those items ?
Or some other cultural influence that they have and we do n’t ?
What do you guys think ?
Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer ?
The swine flu vaccine has been hit by new cancer fears after a German health expert gave a shock warning about its safety .
Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg is a politician and a specialist in lungs , hygiene and environmental medicine .
He is the chairman of the health committee in the German parliament and European Council .
More news The Berlin Wall
The photos we must never forget August 13 will be the 48th anniversary of the building of the Berlin Wall – and a new book of photos takes a look at the cruel barrier we must never forget .
Lung specialist Wolfgang Wodarg has said that there are many risks associated with the vaccine for the H1N1 virus .
He has grave reservations about the firm Novartis who are developing the vaccine and testing it in Germany .
The vaccination is injected “ with a very hot needle ” , Wodarg said .
The nutrient solution for the vaccine consists of cancerous cells from animals and " we do not know if there could be an allergic reaction " .
But more importantly , some people fear that the risk of cancer could be increased by injecting the cells .
The vaccine - as Johannes Löwer , president of the Paul Ehrlich Institute , has pointed out - can also cause worse side effects than the actual swine flu virus .
Wodrag also described people ’s fear of the pandemic as an " orchestration " :
“ It is great business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” he told the ‘ Neuen Presse ’ .
Swine flu is not very different from normal flu .
“ On the contrary if you look at the number of cases it is nothing compared to a normal flu outbreak , ” he added .
The chairman of the health committee in the European Council has urged for a careful and calm reaction to the virus .
Up until now , the producers of the vaccine did not know how many orders they would have by the autumn , but the German Government is now a guaranteed customer .
Even the pharmaceutical companies are trying to exploit the fear of the swine flu pandemic .

Looking for answers ?
This might be the place to start
In these uncertain economic times , people want answers - one reason perhaps why Google 's brand value is soaring and bank brands are plunging .
Google 's brand value rose 25 % to $ 31.9 bn ( £ 19.5 bn ) from the year before according to Interbrand 's survey of global brands , the year 's biggest rise .
This is the first time that the total value of the world 's top 100 brands - down 4.6 % at $ 1.15 trillion - fell .
The world 's two most valuable brands remained Coca Cola and IBM .
World 's most valuable brands Coca Cola $ 68.7bn IBM $ 60.2 bn Microsoft $ 56.6bn GE $ 47.7bn Nokia $ 34.8bn McDonald 's $ 32.2bn Google $ 31.9bn Toyota $ 31.3 bn Intel $ 30.6 bn Disney $ 28.4bn
In a year when some banks were taken under government control and others fought off collapse , the value of financial brands plunged .
Citi 's brand value fell 49 % to $ 10.2bn , while that of UBS fell 50 % to $ 4.3 bn .
The value of American Express 's brand fell 32 % to £ 14.9bn and that of Morgan Stanley fell 26 % to $ 6.39 bn .
Car companies , struggling to make cars that people want to buy in these straitened times , were also hard hit .
Toyota , Mercedes Benz , BMW , Volkswagen and Porsche all saw their brand values fall .
No longer a brand to bank on " Some historically valuable brands normally associated with scale and stability , experienced a very bad year , " Interbrand said , alluding to the poor performance of bank and car brands .
Brands that performed poorly were those perceived to have " fundamentally broken " businesses , a category which included UBS , it said .
Tougher economic times can lead to people re-evaluating " the nature of the relationships that we have with brands and indeed how confident we feel in brands to live up to the promises they make , " Jez Frampton , Interbrand chief executive , said .
" Brands are promises which we value and are prepared to pay for and if we feel those promises have been broken , we 're less likely to trust . "
But some brands are resistant to recession .
While consumers may have less cash for big - ticket items such as cars , and their distrust of banks has increased , they still have enough coins in their pocket for Coca Cola , McDonalds , Gillette and H&M .
" Brands that are day - to - day staples and are easy to purchase and experience have done well , " Interbrand said .
The very top - end brands - those which speak of luxury for the very few , with names such as Gucci , Prada , Louis Vuitton and Hermes - held their own , falling less than the average drop of 5 % .

Oh for Christ ’s sake , you must be living under a rock if you did n’t know that the answer is Monsters of Folk !
How to describe this collaboration …
Monsters of Folk is a glorified sort of hillbilly rock that leaves room for a little class and a lot bite ( I mean , they are monsters after all ) .
Since Tuesday , the debut of their self - titled album , I ’ve been listening to this collection of 15 tracks on repeat to get a good , firm grasp on my opinions .
They do n’t seem to mess around with the music , so I wo n’t mess around with the review .
But so far , I ’m really liking it .
The songs take you to other worlds .
On my way back from Coolidge Corner last night , I pumped up ‘ The Right Place ’ in my earphones , and when I closed my eyes I saw people ho - downing in the grass at sundown .
A more formal review to follow , I promise .
But anyways , if you missed it last night or want to watch it again , check out their performance on Conan O’Brien :

Conor opted for the aviators .
Last night , four Vietnam veterans protested Joan 's concert in Idaho Falls with signs reading : " JOAN BAEZ - SOLDIERS DON'T KILL BABIES , LIBERALS DO " and " JOAN BAEZ GAVE COMFORT & AID TO OUR ENEMY IN VIETNAM & ENCOURAGED THEM TO KILL AMERICANS ! "
Joan was informed that the men were protesting her concert about an hour before it was due to begin and she immediately walked out onto the street to talk to them .
When she approached , one of the first things they said was " We appreciate the work you did on civil rights and women 's rights . "
They wanted to make that point clear .
She listened closely as they discussed their views .
Primarily , they wanted to express the way they felt betrayed by anti-war protesters when they returned from combat .
Joan assured them that she stood by them then and now .
They had mixed reactions as she explained her actual positions and her support for all veterans , across the board .
At this point , Joan 's merchandise salesman , Jim Stewart , who was a Captain in the US Army during Vietnam , approached the group .
Jim is one of the most kind - hearted people you could ever meet .
He is not one to speak lightly of what he went through in Vietnam .
He took Joan 's arm and said to these four men , " I stand by this lady 100 % .
She did the right thing then , and she stood by us when we got home .
She even recorded a song at that time from which 100 % of the proceeds went to us vets . "
Here Jim listens , then engages in conversation :
Unbelievably , one of the four protesters began to question Jim in an accusatory fashion , pressing him for details about what division he was in and and where he served , as if , somehow , he were making it up .
It brings tears to my eyes , as I write this , to remember Jim being questioned in this way .
These protesters were there , theoretically , to lament the poor treatment of American soliders and yet they belittled and questioned the service of a veteran because he did not agree with their views .
Jim played their game for a bit before seeing it for what it was and disengaging .
Joan stood by his side and said , " Oh , he 's got the stories all right .
But he does n't feel the need to talk about them . "
Ironically , a man on his way to the concert approached at this moment and , without really following all that had gone on , interjected , " Those who do n't realize that what they did in Vietnam was wrong are kind of SLOOOOOOW . "
I watched Jim 's face as he heard that statement - literally getting it from both sides within less than a minute .
At this point I engaged in conversation with the man holding the sign accusing liberals , rather than soliders , of killing babies .
He said " I never killed any babies and I do n't believe in guilt by association . "
I asked him how in the world he could justify holding a sign with Joan Baez 's name on it that basically implied she killed babies if he did n't believe in guilt by association .
He replied " It 's an analogy , you probably would n't understand it ! "
Uhhhh .... yeah .
Jim said he should destroy the sign and he then claimed we were trying to trample his Constitutional right to free speech .
We replied that we were n't questioning his right , by any means , but rather his sense of decency , considering that he was there having a conversation with Joan and she was clearly not a baby killer .
Since his entire point was that guilt by association was wrong , it made sense to us .
But he replied " I 'm Pro -Life and I 'm proud of this sign . "
With those words , he held it higher .
As we discussed these things , one of them repeated , " Soldiers do n't kill babies . "
I said that so many horrible things happen in war that it 's impossible to make such a blanket statement , especially when bombs get dropped from the sky , and I said it all comes down to the truth that " War is hell . "
I continued , saying , " And you all know that far better than me . "
They were suprised by this statement , as if shocked that anyone on the " other side " recognized what they 'd been through .
It seemd to render them speechless for a moment .
At this point , Joan 's continuing acceptance of their stories and her willingness to hear them out began to melt their anger .
In a twist that seems hard to fathom , they then asked her to SIGN THEIR POSTERS !
She replied that she would sign the back but not the front of " those horrible things . "
Incredibly , the man with the baby - killing sign replied that he would take her name off the poster if she would sign it .
She did end up signing them , and also getting copies of her book for each of them , and offering tickets to the show , which they did not accept .
She signed the back of the poster about her encouraging the killing of American soldiers - " All the very best to you , Joan Baez . "
When we got back inside the theatre , Joan broke down in tears .
I said to her " You are so brave to face people like that . "
She was n't crying about the way she had been treated , however , but about the way Jim Stewart had stood up for her .
" Did you hear his voice shaking ? " she said .
" That was bravery ... "
And she was right .
Stepping back into the mire of Vietnam was not something he did lightly - he bore the literal denigration of his service by another veteran in order to defend her .
During the concert afterwards Joan dedicated a song to the protesters and said " You know , they just wanted to be heard .
Everyone wants to be heard .
I feel like I made four new friends tonight . "
She took the high road , as always .
It was n't my name on those signs , yet I gave into anger .
She never did .
As we deal with tea parties and increasingly violent right wing protests it would do us all good to remember the example of non-violence and compassion that Ms Baez has exemplified for the 50 - plus years of her career .
Her heroes are Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
In my book , she 's right there with them , leading the timeless and essential march along the high road .
UPDATE : Thanks to everyone for the recs !
I 'm so happy that this story has inspired members of this community .
You may want to check out the version of " We Shall Overcome " that Joan recorded in her kitchen in June , with some lyrics in Farsi , in the hope of directly inspiring the people of Iran as they stand up for real democracy against real oppression .

Twitter may be the hottest thing in social media , but so far very few companies in the video game world have been able to figure out what , exactly , to do with the popular micro-blogging service .
Do you add it to your console ?
Do you make your game support it ?
Ignore it entirely ?
So far , the first few attempts to leverage the power of Twitter to spread the word about games have ended rather poorly .
First , the strange case of Uncharted 2 .
We 've shut it off
Uncharted 2 was created with a feature Naughty Dog seemed rather excited about : the game would tweet your progress in the game automatically .
That meant that your friends would know what you were playing , and how far along you were .
It seemed like a good idea , until review copies were sent to the gaming press .
Soon , if you followed the industry , the entirety of some Twitter feeds consisted of messages about their progress in the game .
This created something of a backlash , as other gaming writers — which may have included this one — took to tweeting about their progress in random boardgames .
A consensus seemed to be reached that allowing a game to take over your Twitter account was a bad thing .
Naughty
Dog noticed the negative publicity , and very quickly pulled the plug on the feature .
" We obviously want to provide the best experience for everybody , so for the time being we 've disabled Twitter updates on chapter completions , " Evan Wells , the co-president of Naughty Dog , said on the PlayStation Blog .
" The option will still exist in the menus when the game ships on 10 / 13 , but if activated , it will do nothing .
Some time after the game has shipped , we 'll release a patch to reactivate the feature , but with a limit on the frequency of updates .
" We 're certainly sorry for any inconvenience , but I guess that 's the risk you run when trying to blaze a new trail in the complicated world of Social Media ! "
Companies love it when you tweet positive comments about their games , but automated messages ?
It may be awhile before anyone else tries it , and when the Twitter update for the Xbox 360 goes live , we 'll see how many gamers think turning on automated tweets is a good idea .
Is it possible to do it well ?
" Since Twitter is so new and changing so rapidly , everyone is still learning how best to use the service , " Sam Houston told us .
Houston is the community manager for GamerDNA , a site dedicated to creating and fostering communities around the gaming world .
He knows a little something about how to track ( and create ) buzz .
" There is a bit of a learning curve and I think everyone is still learning what the best practices are , and what works and does n't work . "
GamerDNA tracks who is tweeting about what games , and uses that to create a picture of what 's hot in the gaming world ; the Tweet My Gaming site almost looks like a stock ticker for gaming buzz .
The big games at the moment ?
World of WarCraft , Halo 3 : ODST , and Aion , among others .
What have they found users want from Twitter ?
Infrequent tweets , and a lack of automation .
" The service is also innately personal , since a Twitter user is ' following ' someone 's personal Twitter stream in most cases , " he explained .
" Because of this , you naturally expect personal tweets from that users ... not exactly automated tweets . "
At GamerDNA , many users send out one automated tweet a day summarizing their gaming habits .
It 's a balancing act to allow users to share their information easily , without being obnoxious about it .
" It 's impossible to make everyone happy , " Houston says .
" But we try our hardest to provide a great service while respecting everyone 's preferences . "
Everyone 's getting in on the action
Twitter is being used heavily in the gaming world , although missteps are frequent .
EA ran into issues with its Twitter - based competition built around Dante 's Inferno , and the negative buzz around that issue led to the #EAFail meme and a conversation about whether bad PR can be good for business .
On the flip side , Microsoft 's Major Nelson gives out free game codes to Xbox Live Arcade games on Twitter frequently , and big announcements are often made on Twitter before they hit the gaming blogs and news sites .
The trouble comes when companies try to make what 's by nature an informal and limited communication device work as a marketing tool .
Do people want to know what their friends are playing ?
Surely .
Do they need to know every time a level or milestone is passed in a game ?
Certainly not .
Portland 's Gary Moody has been caught — for a second time — hiding inside a pit latrine at a campsite .
The first time he claimed he 'd dropped his wedding ring ( authorities sieved the biomass and found no ring ) ; this time he claimed he 'd dropped his shirt .
In an affidavit , he describes himself as having an " outhouse problem . "
In October of 2005 , Moody pleaded no contest to trespass .
The judge imposed a 30 - day jail sentence but suspended all of it in exchange for two years of probation .
Moody was ordered to pay a $ 1,000 fine and $ 700 restitution to the Forest Service for the cost of pumping out the toilet tank and screening the contents .
He also was sentenced to 30 days in jail in Maine for violating conditions of his probation by leaving the state without permission .
He had been on probation for a drunken - driving conviction .
" This gentleman has been subject to a great deal of media scrutiny and drawn to himself , should I say , notoriety .
And a healthy share of bathroom humor , if you will , " District Court Judge Pamela Albee said during the sentencing in New Hampshire .
Earlier this month , we were invited along to Blizzard 's headquarters to have a crack at the single player campaign of StarCraft 2 .
This is what we found ...
Yes , we know the game 's been pushed back to a 2010 release date , but we 're not too upset by that .
Why ?
Like the original blockbuster title and its Brood War expansion pack , StarCraft 2 is set to have a standalone enthralling single player campaign that is well worth waiting for .
Wings of Liberty is the first ( and main ) title , with the single player campaign focusing on the Terran race ; it will be followed by the Heart of the Swarm Zerg and the Legacy of the Void Protoss campaign expansion packs .
The game retains the visual style of the original but significant updates have been made to the graphical engine , with all units displayed in full 3D with lighting effects and great visuals .
The initial title will only feature single player gameplay from the Terran point of view , and while this might be initially disappointing for fans of the original StarCraft ’s three 10 - mission campaigns — one for each race — we were informed by Blizzard to expect a full single player campaign in Wings of Liberty of around 28 possible missions .
The game may have one start and one inescapable finish , but players now have the freedom to pick and choose the missions they want to complete from a sector map — up to five missions will be available simultaneously .
Combined with the two expansion packs , we ’re confident that the StarCraft 2 story arc will be between two and three times as long as that of the original .
So , what ’s the state of play when StarCraft 2 opens its curtains ?
In the Koprulu sector , it is four years after the events of Brood War .
Despite winning a crushing victory over the Protoss and Terran forces , the Zerg swarm led by the Zerg - Terran hybrid Sarah Kerrigan has retreated back to the planet Char .
No-one has seen the Zerg in the last four years , while the Protoss race has similarly drawn back to the Dark Templar homeworld of Shakuras .
Terran forces of multiple factions squabble over the planets and while the Dominion is the chief power in the sector , the story focuses on the marginalised character of Jim Raynor .
You ’ll know him from the first games — he ’s the ex-marshal of Mar Sara and commands the stolen battleship Hyperion .
The opening missions of the game see Raynor on Mar Sara , ‘ liberating ’ an ancient Xel ’ Naga artifact from Dominion forces .
While also serving as a tutorial , the missions set up some back - story and remind players of anything they might have forgotten of the storyline of the earlier games .
The real story arc begins when the Zerg appear in the sector , chasing the same relics that Raynor is finding .
The missions we played were varied in structure .
In one , we liberated a Mar Sara outpost from Dominion forces and found a valuable Xel ’ Naga artifact , while in another we were forced to hold a rundown outpost against massed invading Zerg forces .
A more interesting gameplay style was exposed in a mission where we were asked to gather a large amount of minerals on a Zerg - infested lava planet , requiring a careful balance of unit production and mineral harvesting .
To make matters worse , the lava surges every few minutes , obliterating all units on lower ground — where all the minerals are .
( Here ’s a hint : to survive , you ’ll have to use the lift - off ability to raise your command centre , as well as rush all your units to the Zerg - filled higher ground and hold them off until the lava cools . )
Oh , and there ’s also a massive Zerg Brutalisk to deal with .
We played through the first five missions of the storyline , and found the story gripping and enticing — when our two hours were up , we really did n’t want to leave !
So what ’s new ?
If you want to quantify it in terms of dramatic changes — then not very much .
But that ’s part of the beauty of the StarCraft franchise : it incrementally builds on the ultimate tried - and - tested formula of three opposing races with unique capabilities .
There are a few nifty additions , though , that we think will really add a new element to gameplay .
Not for the weak - kneed , the dull - witted or the weeny - minded !
This site will look at everything from news and humor to bad science and lying politicians .
Early estimates from the company are that it could deliver more than 3bn barrels , but BP said more test will be needed on the 250 miles south east of Houston to determine its size and commercial viability .
DETROIT  General Motors expects to lay off thousands of factory workers after the number who voluntarily quit through a recent buyout and early retirement program fell short of the carmaker ’s target .
G.M. said Monday that about 6,000 hourly workers had left as of Saturday .
That means the company still has about 48,000 hourly workers , which is 7,500 more than its year - end goal of 40,500 .
A G.M. spokeswoman , Sherrie Childers Arb , said the company planned to meet with the United Automobile Workers union to determine how it could meet its goal by Dec. 31 , but she said the company was not considering another buyout offer .
“ Some people will go into a layoff situation , ” Ms. Childers Arb said .
“ Others will be offered positions at other G.M. facilities .
But we probably would not be able to find positions for all of those workers . ”
The utterly stupid , ridiculous clusterfuck that 's in Albany is the perfect example of why some citizens decide not to pay their taxes .
Someone finally realized as much , so they 're not getting any more money until they get back to work .
Seeing as how the mostly crooked , idiotic politicians running the New York State Senate have grinded their work to a complete stoppage due to a leadership standoff that 's involved everything from locking the other party out of the chambers , to screaming matches , to making face - slashers a crucial factor in New York politics , it 's about goddamn time we stop feeding the zoo 's inhabitants .
State comptroller Thomas " The Clench " DiNapoli has stopped paying the New York Senate until they get their shit in gear .
He 's withholding their paychecks along with $ 560,000 worth of travel vouchers until they get back to work .
Naturally , they 're pissed .
" I have strived to avoid inserting my office into what is essentially an internal matter within a separate branch of government , " Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement .
" But the deadlock in the Senate is undermining the ability of state government to function . "
Austin Shafran , a spokesman for the Senate Democrats , said simply , " We 'll see him in court . "
Spoken like a true agent of progress !
Meanwhile , DiNapoli's the only one doing his job in this political tesseract of jackassery , and he 's about to be villianized by the State Seanate and harassed for trying to get something accomplished .
I bet the guy 's a good dad : they act like children ' so he 's treating them like the dumbass brats they are .
Either way , this should be it : if anything can make a crooked New York pol move their ass , it 's a constipation of the single motivating force in New York politics : money .

LOS ANGELES  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did not get the election results he sought .
Now he seems determined to show California voters the consequences .
In a special election on May 19 , voters rejected a batch of measures on increasing taxes , borrowing funds and reapportioning state money that were designed to close a multibillion - dollar budget gap .
The cuts Mr. Schwarzenegger has proposed to make up the difference , if enacted by the Legislature , would turn California into a place that in some ways would be unrecognizable in modern America : poor children would have no health insurance , prisoners would be released by the thousands and state parks would be closed .
Nearly all of the billions of dollars in cuts the administration has proposed would affect programs for poor Californians , although prisons and schools would take hits , as well .
“ Government does n’t provide services to rich people , ” Mike Genest , the state ’s finance director , said on a conference call with reporters on Friday .
“ It does n’t even really provide services to the middle class . ”
He added : “ You have to cut where the money is . ”
The advertising market experienced a " significant " shift this year as companies spent more money on the internet than on television for the first time .
Spending on internet advertising grew 4.6 per cent in the first half of 2009 to hit £ 1.7bn , according to digital marketing trade body Internet Advertising Bureau ( IAB ) .
Advertising on television amounted to £ 1.6bn , down from £ 1.9 bn year on year .
" The internet has now overtaken television advertising to become the UK 's single biggest advertising medium , " the IAB said , adding it now accounts for 23.5 per cent of the total market .
Industry experts pointed to more time spent online , faster broadband speeds and more sophisticated online techniques as reasons for the shift .
The IAB said : " The results signal a significant restructure of marketing budgets as advertisers follow their audiences online and look to the internet for even more measurable and accountable methods . "
The body 's chief executive , Guy Phillipson , said : " Internet advertising has beaten all expectations to achieve growth in the most challenging market conditions . "

Spending on internet advertising in the UK hit £ 3.3 bn in 2008 , up 17 per cent year on year , while total advertising spending fell 3.5 per cent to £ 17.5 bn .
Stefan Bardega , director of digital at Mediacom , who specialises in media buying on the internet , said : " Online has surpassed television earlier than we expected , " adding the move was driven by the recession .
He said : " There is further to go , as it still does n't match up with the amount of time some core demographics are spending online . "
The favoured method of advertising online is through paid - for search , which is dominated by Google .
Search is proving " recession - friendly , " the IAB said , with spending increasing almost 7 per cent in the first half of 2009 over the same period last year , to £ 1.05 bn .
It made up almost 60 per cent of online advertising expenditure .
Google made about 97 per cent of its revenues from advertising last year , with about 70 per cent from paid - for search .
While classified advertising in print publications has been declining , it grew by a tenth this year online .
The online value hit £ 385 m in the first half , or 22 per cent of online spending .
Display advertising was not so successful , falling 5.2 per cent year - on - year to £ 316.5 m .
The IAB pointed out this was not as bad as display advertising in mainstream media , which saw double - digit declines .
Eva Berg - Winters , online advertising expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers , said the extent of the move to digital technology was " perhaps surprising " , but added that " online is constantly innovating , developing itself and pushing itself to be better " .
Experts said that the change in users ' habits underpinned the move online .
Mr Bardega said : " The audiences are moving online and the advertising money is following it , " he said , pointing out that 16 - to 24 - year - olds were now spending 29 per cent of media time on the internet .
The move has been helped by the rise in faster and cheaper broadband .
The report quoted the British Market Research Bureau Internet Monitor from May , which said that 92 per cent of people now had a broadband speed of over MB .
" That is allowing companies to use more innovative formats , " Mr Bardega said .
Video advertising has increased 195 per cent year - on - year , showing what the IAB said was a " willingness to experiment and invest in more engaging and interactive multimedia content " .
Dave Katz , head of trading at Media Contacts , said : " The measurability really sets it apart .
You can track any money you spend online , " adding the industry was built around ad revenues .
" Television was initially built without advertising in mind , whereas online was driven by those revenues . "
Thinkbox , the trade body for TV advertisers , said it was " meaningless " to sweep together all the money spent on the diverse aspects of online advertising .
Marketing director Lindsey Clay said : " TV advertising is proven by impartial sources such as the IPA and PwC to be the most effective ad medium pound - for - pound .
But it is even more effective when put together with online .
They are the perfect marketing marriage . "
She added that one of the most exciting advertising opportunities online " is TV content " .
Also the IAB 's figures do not involve sponsorship , spot and interactive advertising .

For More than two decades I have been playing video games of all types .
Some of my favorite have been war - related games .
Games where I am behind the gun , or with an all - seeing eye controlling troop movements .
Here is a rundown of some of the all - time greats
Call of Duty : Currently there is not a better military based shooting game around .
With realistic effects and ailments you can almost feel yourself in the action .
Between hearing loss after a shell lands and a dizziness when blood loss mounts , there is a reason that this series has won multiple awards .
Crysis : This was the Game of the Year award in 2007 .
Based in the future , this game centers around the super - human powers enabled by the Crysis suit .
The graphics are incredible .
The ability to punch someone and have them fly 100 yards is entertaining .
Running fast enough to walk on water is fun too .
While it is not the most realistic game around it does have hands down the best graphics and sound .
Americas Army :
The US army got into the gaming world a few years back , and who could blame them .
with the rampant game play of military based games , this became a great recruiting tool .
You can download the latest version for free here .
Lots of gunplay with weapons that you could actually use in real life ( once properly trained by the Army of course ) .
Download it and play today !
Medal of Honor :
This was one of the first military shooters that I remember playing .
As an Air Force ROTC cadet we would gather to play in large groups .
The game is historic .
Your story begins at Normandy .
The opening sequence reminds me a bit of Saving Private Ryan .
Using an M1 Garand and a lot of guts you join the 101st in their assault .
Very fun .
Command and Conquer : Red Alert :
This series is the only of the real time strategy games that I will cover .
In a fictitious future the Russians are still very much alive and well .
Guide either side through multiple missions to conquer the world for the side you choose .
Nuclear weapons are in play and even encouraged to be used .
Personally I have spent many hours beating the Russians and taking the world for the side of Democracy and Capitalism .

Polling has a new poll out on the national ‘ birther ’ movement .
And it turns out to be another fascinating look at the mystic overlap between ideological and simple ignorance .
Of the 24 % of the population in the ‘ birther ’ category , one interesting thing to note is that more Americans seem to think Obama was born in Indonesia ( 10 % ) than Kenya ( 7 % ) , which suggests not only that a frighteningly large number of Americans are birthers but that they have a shockingly low level of basic ‘ birther ’ literacy .
As you know , according to orthodox ‘ birther ’ theory , Obama was born in Kenya .
Even better , 6 % fully concede that Obama was born in Hawaii .
They just do n’t believe Hawaii is part of the United States .
[ ed.note : Special thanks to TPM Reader SR for flagging my attention to the poll . ]
Americans were introduced to the Sport of Ghosting on Jay Leno ’s new show this week .
Created by comedy duo Hamish & Andy , Ghosting has apparently very little to do with Patrick Swayze .
The object is to follow behind strangers for as long as possible before the target notices the ghost .
Take a look :
My wife ’s been forcing me to watch Leno this week , and so far , this has been the funniest bit on the show .
Of course this is their bit , and they ’ve done it before on other shows :
Welcome to America boys , well done .
Gunaxin will be putting together our ghosting team shortly .
Confronting the climate crisis : Preparing for Copenhagen and beyond
Nairobi , Kenya , August 30 , 2009 --
We , the leaders of various people 's movements , community - based groups , academia , NGOs and civil cociety organisations , met in Nairobi under the banner of the People 's Movement on Climate Change ( PMCC ) to discuss strategies to confront the climate change crisis for Copenhagen and beyond from August 27 to 28 , 2009 .
Do hereby affirm that :
Irresponsible and unaccountable consumption concentrated in the industrialised North , and some countries of the South has and continues to cost Africa by creating an ecological crisis ;
The people of Africa , as well as other developing nations , are creditors of a massive ecological debt ;
This ecological debt continues to accrue today through the continued plunder and exploitation of Africa ’s resources , its people , labour and economies ;
The groups most affected by climate change are Indigenous peoples , women -- especially poor women in the rural areas , noting that the phenomenon has a connection with resources such as land or water , and related farming and business activities that they are specifically engaged in ;
The negative effects of climate change are sharply felt on agriculture and food sovereignty .
This is manifested through soil degradation , deforestation , intensified food insecurity , super weeds , desertification , cultural shock , identity loss and forced consumption of unsafe , untraceable food ;
Imposed false solutions ( GMOs , Agro-fuels , synthetic fertilisers , agrochemicals ) deepen these effects and perpetuate food aid dependency ;
The current unbalanced global trade relations and policies between the industrialised North and the global South are a contributor to the negative ecological effects of climate change .
Our calls :
We reject the principle and application of carbon trading , which is a false solution based on inventing a perverse property right to pollute .
A property right to air ;
We demand that human rights and values be placed at the centre of all global , national and regional solutions to the problem of climate change ;
We call on colleagues in the social and economic justice movement globally to rigorously campaign against the undemocratic corporate led agendas which will dominate the deliberations and processes at COP 15 [ Copenhagen in December 2009 ] ;
We emphasise that ecological , small holder , agro- biodiversity - based food production can ensure food and seed sovereignty and address climate change in Africa .
We support the call by African leaders for reparations on climate change and support the initiative of the upcoming African Union ministers of environment meeting and call for African governments to embrace more people - centred alternatives for African peoples .
[ We ] urge African governments to engage civil society groups positively and collaborate with them to build common national and international responses on the problems of climate change .
Our strategies :
Immediately activate existing networks and resources within our ranks , to build each other 's capacities to engage meaningfully on pro-people solutions to the crisis of climate change ;
Launch a call to action for a coordinated global response to climate change , based on solidarity and practical collaboration between affected peoples of the industrialised North and the global South ;
To create synergy of platforms , networks and initiatives amongst African communities most affected by climate change and henceforth use any appropriate political space to articulate their concerns ;
That such political spaces should include the annual continental , regional and national social forum spaces , as well as the parallel People 's Summit of the people of Southern Africa amongst others ;
Facilitate dialogue of women directly affected by climate change to engage with policy makers at both local and national levels as well as regional and global level ;
Organise and mobilise communities for action towards food sovereignty - based food self - sufficiency through research , articulation of issues and capacity building for informed engagement and alternatives ;
To mobilise agricultural , pastoral , fisherfolk and other affected communities to have a common face and voice in Copenhagen ;
Urgently reform the unbalanced global trade relations and policies , with specific focus on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) and their ecological effects on Africa ;
To continue our engagement on ecological debt and call for reparations for the climate crisis and seek alternative modes of channeling such resources to the people of Africa ;
To support African governments ' call for reparations and increased space for negotiations for a progressive deal that does not impoverish Africa further ;
Commit ourselves to a coordinated follow up on any outputs from Copenhagen .

Objective :
The authors sought to determine whether prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders interact synergistically to increase the risk of later developing schizophrenia .
Method :
The authors linked two national registers , the Medical Birth Register and the Finnish Population Register , to identify all women in Helsinki who received hospital treatment during pregnancy for an upper urinary tract infection ( N=9,596 ) between 1947 and 1990 .
The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used to ascertain psychiatric outcomes in adulthood of offspring exposed to infection prenatally .
Family history of psychotic disorders was determined by linking the Hospital Discharge Register and the Population Register .
The authors used an additive statistical interaction model to calculate the amount of biological synergism between positive family history and prenatal exposure to infection .
Results : Prenatal exposure to infection did not significantly increase the risk of schizophrenia .
However , the effect of prenatal exposure to pyelonephritis was five times greater in those who had a family history of psychosis compared to those who did not .
The synergy analysis suggested that an estimated 38 % –46 % of the offspring who developed schizophrenia and had both prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders did so as a result of the synergistic action of both risk factors .
Conclusions :
These findings support a mechanism of gene - environment interaction in the causation of schizophrenia .
The search for risk factors for schizophrenia is taking us ever further back in development ( 1 ) .
Prenatal exposure to infection has been the subject of particular interest since Mednick et al .
( 2 ) first reported an increased risk of schizophrenia among individuals exposed prenatally to the 1957 influenza epidemic in Helsinki .
Most subsequent studies examining this issue have found a positive association , but there have also been some negative findings ( see references 3 – 6 for reviews ) .
Early studies pointed to the importance of exposure to infection during the second trimester of fetal development , but recent work places the window of vulnerability in the first trimester ( 7 – 9 ) .
A wide variety of infections , such as influenza , herpes , polio , rubella , toxoplasmosis , and respiratory infections , have been implicated , indicating that some pathogenic mechanism common to many infections , such as fever or production of cytokines , may be in operation ( 8 , 10 ) .
The effect sizes reported for the association between prenatal exposure to infection and later schizophrenia have generally been in the region of a 1.5 - to 2 - fold increase in risk ( 4 , 11 ) .
While it is possible that these small effect sizes represent random noise and that no real association exists , recent studies using prenatal maternal serum samples have found that individuals exposed prenatally to rubella had a 10 - to 20 - fold increase in risk of adult schizophrenia ( 12 ) and that those exposed to influenza during the first trimester of gestation had a sevenfold increase in risk ( 8 ) .
The presence of inconsistencies among findings across studies suggests that prenatal exposure to infection may be interacting with another risk factor for schizophrenia , such as genetic risk , to produce its effect ( 13 ) .
The importance of considering genetic liability to psychosis when examining the effect of prenatal environmental exposures has been noted by numerous authors ( 1 – 3 , 8 , 14 – 16 ) .
However , previous studies either have lacked the information needed to examine such effects or have had insufficient statistical power to do so ( 2 , 8 , 17 – 20 ) .
Some investigators have included parental psychiatric history as a potential confounder in the analysis ( 21 , 22 ) , but this approach is not adequate to explore the possible synergistic effects of genetic liability to psychosis and an adverse environmental exposure ( 23 ) .
In this study we examined the effect of prenatal exposure to pyelonephritis , an infection of the upper urinary tract , on the subsequent development of schizophrenia in a large Finnish cohort .
Pyelonephritis is particularly common in pregnancy , occurring in 1 % –2 % of pregnant women .
Because most pregnant women with this infection are admitted to the hospital ( 24 ) , hospital records allowed us to accurately time the exposure to infection during gestation .
Record linkage between population and hospital discharge registers gave us the information needed to model the synergistic effects of prenatal infection exposure and family history of psychosis .
We had three hypotheses :
1. Hospital - treated acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in exposed offspring .
2 . The effects of prenatal exposure to infection are dependent on the timing of the exposure during pregnancy .
Based on evidence from recent animal work and archived maternal serum studies , we expected that exposure during the first trimester would have the biggest impact on risk ( 8 , 9 ) .
3 . There is a synergistic relationship between prenatal exposure to infection and family history of psychotic disorders in increasing the risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood .
Method
All live - born individuals in Finland are assigned a unique personal identification number at birth .
This number is used in all registers , which ensures accurate linkage of information between registers .
For this study , three national registers were linked : the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register , the Medical Birth Register , and the Finnish Population Register .
These registers are maintained in computerized databases by the National Research and Development Center for Health and Welfare .
The base study population comprised all individuals born in Helsinki between 1947 and 1990 .
From this study population , using record linkage between the Medical Birth Register and the Population Register , we identified all individuals whose mothers were hospitalized for acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy , that is , while members of the study population were in gestation .
The Medical Birth Register had information on the exact week of pregnancy during which the women were treated in the hospital for pyelonephritis .
Siblings of these individuals who were not exposed in utero to maternal pyelonephritis were taken as the comparison group .
Siblings were identified through linkage with the Population Register .
Psychiatric outcomes in adulthood and family history of psychosis were determined by linkage to the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register , which covers all public and private hospitals in Finland .
Psychiatric diagnoses were ascertained for exposed cases , the sibling comparison group , and parents .
Psychiatric diagnoses are recorded in the register using ICD codes .
Diagnoses before 1987 were made using ICD - 8 , diagnoses between 1987 and 1995 were made using ICD - 9 , and since 1995 diagnoses have been made using ICD - 10 .
In this study we defined “ schizophrenia ” as a 295 diagnosis in ICD - 8 and ICD - 9 or an F20 diagnosis in ICD - 10 .
The following diagnoses were used for “ broadly defined psychotic disorders ” : ICD - 8/9 codes 295 ( schizophrenia ) , 296 ( affective psychoses ) , 297 ( delusional syndrome ) , 298 ( reactive psychoses ) , and 299 ( childhood origin psychoses ) and ICD - 10 codes F20 ( schizophrenia ) , F21 ( schizotypal disorder ) , F22 ( delusional syndrome ) , F23 ( psychotic episode ) , F24 ( induced delusional syndrome ) , F25 ( schizoaffective syndrome ) , F28 ( other psychoses ) , F29 ( psychosis not otherwise specified ) , F30.2 ( mania with psychotic symptoms ) , F31.2 ( bipolar affective disorder with psychotic symptoms ) , F31.5 ( bipolar affective disorder , depression with psychotic symptoms ) , F32.3 ( severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms ) , and F33.3 ( recurrent depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms ) .
A positive family history of psychosis was defined as having a parent or sibling with a diagnosis of broadly defined psychotic disorder on the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register .
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata statistical software , version 8.0 ( 25 ) .
A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) with schizophrenia or broadly defined psychotic disorder as the response variable and in utero exposure to infection as the exposure variable .
Standard errors were corrected for clustering within families using the ROBUST function in Stata .
The effect of exposure to infection at different times during pregnancy on the later development of psychotic disorders in the offspring was examined by analyzing the data according to trimester .
Trimester 1 was defined as weeks 1 – 12 of pregnancy , trimester 2 as weeks 12 – 28 , and trimester 3 as weeks 28 –40 .
To examine the synergistic effect of exposure to infection and genetic liability to psychosis , we stratified the data on the basis of family history of psychotic disorder and examined the effect of prenatal infection within history - positive and history - negative strata .
We calculated the statistical additive interaction between family history and infection exposure ( i.e. , as a risk difference rather than a risk ratio ) using risk difference regression .
The BINREG procedure in Stata , which fits generalized linear models for the binomial family estimating risk differences , was used .
The statistical significance of the interactions was assessed using the Wald test ( 26 ) .
We then estimated the amount of biological synergism between prenatal infection exposure and family history of psychotic disorder using methods developed by Darroch ( 27 ) and previously used by van Os et al .
( 23 , 28 ) ( see the data supplement that is included with the online edition of this article ) .
Results
Prenatal Exposure to Infection and Later Schizophrenia
From the national registers we identified 9,596 individuals born between 1947 and 1990 who were in gestation when their mothers were hospitalized for pyelonephritis .
The comparison group comprised 13,808 siblings of these individuals , who were also born between 1947 and 1990 and who were not exposed to maternal pyelonephritis while in utero .
From record linkage we ascertained that 6.4 % of the sample had a positive family history of psychotic disorder ( Table 1 ) .
Table 1 provides the odds ratios for schizophrenia and broadly defined psychotic disorder in case and comparison groups in relation to prenatal exposure to infection and family history .
Exposure to infection did not significantly increase the risk of developing either schizophrenia or broadly defined psychotic disorder .
However , in a result that approached statistical significance , the risk of developing schizophrenia was almost 50 % higher in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group .
Table 2 shows that the timing of the infection during gestation did not significantly affect the risk of schizophrenia , but there was some evidence approaching statistical significance that first - trimester exposure to infection increased the risk of later schizophrenia but not of broadly defined psychotic disorder .
There was no association between family history of psychotic disorder and in utero exposure to infection .
Therefore , our results were not confounded by any increased tendency for mothers with psychotic illness to develop infection during pregnancy compared to those without psychotic illness .
Interaction Between Prenatal Exposure to Infection and Family History of Psychosis
The results of the interaction analysis are presented in Table 3 .
The effect of prenatal exposure to pyelonephritis was significantly greater in those who had a family history of psychotic disorder compared to those who did not .
Stratified analyses revealed that the difference in risk for schizophrenia ( i.e. , risk difference ) between those exposed and those not exposed to prenatal infection in the genetically vulnerable group was five times larger than the risk difference in those who were not genetically vulnerable ( interaction χ 2 = 7.14 , df=1 , p=0.02 ) .
We calculated the amount of synergism between the two risk factors .
The risk percentages for each risk stratum were as follows : no infection / no family history , 0.23 % ( 30/12,610 ) ; infection only , 0.32 % ( 29/8,956 ) ; family history only , 0.58 % ( 5/857 ) ; and infection / family history , 1.09 % ( 7/640 ) .
These risk percentages were entered into a standard formula for calculating the amount of biological synergism between two risk factors ( 23 , 27 , 28 ; see the online data supplement ) .
This analysis suggested that 38 % –46 % of the individuals who developed schizophrenia in our sample did so as a result of the synergistic action of prenatal exposure to infection and positive family history .
Discussion
To our knowledge , this is the first report in the schizophrenia literature showing a gene - environment synergistic effect between prenatal exposure to infection and familial liability to psychosis .
We found an additive effect of having a positive family history such that , when coupled with prenatal exposure to infection , the risk is significantly increased relative to those who were exposed to infection but are not at increased familial risk .
In those who are genetically vulnerable to psychotic disorder , the risk difference between those exposed and those unexposed to infection was five times larger than the risk difference between the exposed and the unexposed among those without genetic vulnerability .
As noted by van Os et al. ( 23 ) , this type of additive analysis is necessary for detecting the synergistic effects between genetic and environmental risk factors for mental illness .
The effect size found here for prenatal exposure to infection is modest but is in the range of what has previously been found ( 1 ) and is larger than the effect size found for most putative susceptibility genes ( 29 ) .
The analysis of the timing of exposure to infection during pregnancy suggests the possible importance of first - trimester exposure , but because only two patients were exposed in the first trimester , no conclusions can be drawn .
Although many previous studies have found the strongest effects for the second trimester of pregnancy ( 4 ) , these studies were based on ecological data and suffered from a lack of exact information in relation to the definition of exposure .
In line with our findings , recent animal research ( 9 ) and work using archived maternal serum ( 8 ) has found that exposure to infection during the first trimester or very early in the second trimester of pregnancy , compared to later periods in pregnancy , confers the greatest risk of developing schizophrenia .
A recent review of this issue ( 30 ) supports the hypothesis that infection - associated immunological events in early fetal life have a stronger neurodevelopmental impact than such events later in pregnancy .
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has a number of strengths .
First , the sample size was large , providing adequate statistical power to examine statistical additive effects .
Second , the use of siblings as the comparison group meant that exposed and unexposed individuals were likely to have experienced similar environmental and social influences during childhood that might otherwise represent unknown confounders .
The use of a sibling comparison group also controlled for a difference in genetic risk of psychotic disorder between our groups .
The majority of previous studies lacked information on genetic risk in their samples ; it is possible that these studies had more individuals at increased genetic risk of psychotic disorders in their exposed groups , thus inflating the effect size found for infection exposure .
Third , the use of hospital - treated pyelonephritis to establish the infection group gave us exact information on the timing of exposure to infection during pregnancy .
The study also had a number of limitations .
Although our sample was large , we had a small number of cases of schizophrenia in each group when the sample was stratified by infection exposure and family history , and we were missing trimester data on a significant proportion of our infection - exposed individuals .
Therefore , we did not have sufficient statistical power to investigate whether there was an interaction between prenatal infection exposure and family history of psychotic disorder within each trimester .
Given the trend in the data for a first - trimester effect , this would be an interesting analysis in a study with a larger sample .
Another potential limitation is that nearly all women with pyelonephritis are treated with antibiotics .
We have no data on the type of antibiotics used .
Therefore , a confounding effect of medication cannot be ruled out .
It is not inconceivable that the gene - environment interaction found here is actually a gene - medication interaction .
Possible Mechanisms
Despite much speculation , the mechanism by which prenatal infection increases the risk of schizophrenia has not yet been elucidated .
An indirect effect of infection on fetal brain development via maternal immunoglobulin G antibodies elicited by the infection or via maternal cytokines would seem to be the most plausible pathogenic mechanism ( 6 , 31 ) .
In support of this hypothesis , a positive association between elevated maternal levels of the cytokine interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) during pregnancy and an increased risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the offspring has been reported ( 32 ) , and IL - 8 has been found to be elevated in children with acute pyelonephritis ( 33 ) .
The possibility of a direct effect , of either the infectious organism itself or the associated high fever , should be considered .
Escherichia coli is the most common bacterium causing pyelonephritis and is involved in 65 % – 80 % of cases .
However , since most urinary tract infections are not accompanied by bloodstream infection , even in pregnancy a direct effect of the infection is unlikely ( 34 – 36 ) .
A direct effect of hyperthermia is also a possibility as pyelonephritis is clinically associated with high fever ( 24 ) .
Hyperthermia during pregnancy has been shown to significantly increase the risk of a range of negative pregnancy outcomes , including major structural malformations , such as neural tube defects ( 37 – 40 ) .
Gene - Environment Interaction in Schizophrenia
Gene - environment interactions have recently been demonstrated in psychiatric illnesses such as ADHD , depression , posttraumatic stress disorder , and conduct disorder ( 13 , 41 ) .
In schizophrenia , it has been shown that offspring at high genetic risk for schizophrenia are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of a negative family rearing environment ( 42 ) , that the link between early cannabis use and later psychosis is strongest in a certain genetic subgroup ( 43 ) , and that the effect of urbanicity is mediated by genetic liability to psychosis ( 23 , 28 ) .
The urbanicity studies , which carried out the kind of additive interaction analysis that we used in this study , found that 60 % –70 % of those who developed schizophrenia and were exposed to both risk factors examined did so as a result of the synergistic action between urban dwelling and familial liability to psychosis ( 23 ) .
We found that up to half of the cases of schizophrenia in our sample who were exposed to both risk factors could be attributed to the synergistic action of prenatal infection exposure and familial liability to psychosis .
Research using gene - environment strategies is providing robust evidence of the power of looking at environmental exposures in the context of increased genetic risk for disorders with a complex etiology , such as schizophrenia .
Infectious exposures are a good candidate for environmental pathogens for use in such analyses for several reasons .
First , variability in response to exposure has been observed , indicating that the outcome is dependent on at least one other variable .
Second , a number of studies have provided evidence that infection is causally related to schizophrenia , indicating that the association is not wholly genetically mediated .
And third , the maternal immune response to infection represents a neurobiologically plausible pathway along which infection may increase the risk for schizophrenia ( 41 ) .
Until the exact mechanism by which prenatal exposure to infection increases risk of psychosis is elucidated , studies such as this , using proxy measures of environmental risk and genetic liability , will remain useful .

Predicting cities that will emerge as post - recession meccas for the young is easy to argue about , but impossible to forecast empirically .
Whether you prefer hip , casual Austin , Texas , over the cosmopolitan allure of New York City is partly a matter of personal taste .
Still , we asked six experts which 10 cities will emerge as the hottest , hippest destinations for highly mobile , educated workers in their 20s when the U.S. economy gets moving again .
Our panelists — demographers , economists , geographers and authors on urban issues — picked their cities based on the criteria they deem most important , from economic diversity to lifestyle .
Big cities dominate our panelists ' forecasts .
Where trendy smaller cities might have captivated youth in the past , today 's recession - scarred young people are more pragmatic , placing " greater emphasis on where high - quality , high - paying jobs are created , " says Ross DeVol , director of regional economics for the nonprofit Milken Institute .
Northeastern and West Coast cities are ascendant , eclipsing former Sunbelt favorites such as Atlanta .
Other cities once lauded as youth magnets fell off the radar .
Naples , Fla. , cited in an influential 2003 U.S. Census Bureau report on migration among young adults , was bypassed by panelists , a victim of the sagging Florida economy .
The housing collapse sank another past favorite , former real - estate boom town Las Vegas .
And Charlotte , N.C. , a banking center , lost some of its luster to the financial crisis .
Quirky urban cultures have n't entirely lost their allure .
Our panelists '
No. 4 pick is a city with double - digit unemployment — Portland , Ore. , a haven for artists , musicians and outdoor enthusiasts .
The city has shown " staying power " among youth , says Rachel Franklin , a geographer at the University of Maryland and author of the Census Bureau report .
Where young adults settle is no small thing .
People 18 to 29 are the most mobile age group , and their past migration patterns have defined the future of regions , from the long rural exodus of the 1900s to the Silicon Valley boom of the 1990s .
Youth - magnet cities gain an enviable cultural allure and a labor - market edge .
The young are likely to be more restless than usual when the recovery comes .
The recession has brought migration to a grinding halt :
Fewer people moved across state lines in 2008 than at any time since 1950 , when the population was smaller by half , says William Frey , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , a nonprofit Washington research organization .
Here 's a look at our survey 's top five cities :
First Place ( Tie ) : Washington , D.C .
The 2008 election touched off a youthful pilgrimage to the capital that most panelists say wo n't end soon .
" In the eyes of some young people , Barack Obama is America 's coolest boss , " says Richard Florida , author of " Who 's Your City ? " and a professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management .
Government hiring is projected to grow fast , and jobs in lobbying , aerospace , defense contracting and professional services are also a draw .
Mr. DeVol calls Washington the national leader in high - tech services , surpassing Silicon Valley .
Washington 's 4,000 - plus nonprofits hold appeal for service - minded youth .
And amid rising regulation of financial markets , says Barbara Lang , president of the DC Chamber of Commerce , " much of Wall Street is now moving to K Street . "
David Gibson Jr. , 25 years old , passed up finance jobs in Charlotte , New York and Atlanta to settle in Washington as a financial analyst for the Federal Reserve .
Mr. Gibson , who has an M.B.A. , figures the capital , with its many universities , can accommodate him for the long haul , enabling him to pursue a Ph.D. if he chooses .
He loves the city 's museums and live jazz and R&B venues , he says , and its power - center status is helping him " expand my network world - wide . "
That combination of factors , says David Plane , a professor of geography and regional development at the University of Arizona , signals " sustained dynamism " for Washington .
The downside : Not all see the current federal hiring binge continuing .
" Right now Washington is a magnet .
It has become the new New York , " says Steven Cochrane , managing director of Moody's Economy.com .
But the ballooning federal deficit suggests that " by next year , the government is going to be looking seriously at making cuts . "
First Place ( Tie ) : Seattle
Former Ohio residents Lane Kuhlman , 26 , and her husband , Matt Mansbach , 32 , mulled several cities , including New York and Chicago , as potential destinations last summer , after Ms. Kuhlman received her master 's degree specializing in interactive media .
In their eyes , none could match Seattle 's combination of a diverse high - tech sector , cultural life , access to rugged natural terrain and a strong university presence .
Ms. Kuhlman has since taken a post as a new - product researcher for Microsoft , and Mr. Mansbach is weighing attending one of the city 's grad schools in his field , computer animation .
Meanwhile , Ms. Kuhlman says , " we 're only 15 minutes from a beautiful waterfall , and there are amazing places to hike . "
Anchor to a region of corporate innovators , from to Starbucks , Seattle is " a high - tech and lifestyle mecca , " Dr. Florida says .
Mr. DeVol says the city 's high - tech sector , with 226,300 workers , is just slightly smaller than Silicon Valley's .
Joblessness , at 7.7 % , remains relatively low .
City officials see rapid growth in biotech ; Seattle also has tens of thousands of jobs in music and interactive media .
And it enjoys a reputation as home to a lot of brainy people .
The downside : It rains half the time .

How We Selected Our Top - Rated Cities
Naming the next wave of top cities for hip , highly mobile young adults is far from an exact science .
It 's more like a parlor game .
The Wall Street Journal sought out six of the nation 's leading experts to rank the 10 U.S. cities they see as most likely to emerge as " youth magnet " cities after the recession — popular target destinations among young , college - educated , often single people setting out to start a career , find a mate or both .
The panelists , who were also asked to provide two or three reasons for their selections , were chosen based on their achievements in research , forecasting or authorship in the fields of geography , regional economics or demography .
The methodology used to compile a final list is closer to a straw poll than a scientific study .
Using criteria of their own choosing , experts provided ranked lists of picks .
Composite rankings were then assigned to cities based on a point system : Each expert 's No. 1 pick was given 10 points , second choices were given nine points and so on , with 10th - place picks receiving one point .
Final rankings were determined by adding the total points each city received .
The panelists : , managing director , Moody 's Economy.com , head of the Web site 's U.S. regional forecasting service and editor of its monthly Regional Financial Review . , director of regional economics , the Milken Institute , a Santa Monica , Calif. , nonprofit , and researcher on technology and its impact on regional and national economies . , author of " Who 's Your City " and " The Rise of the Creative Class , " and director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management . , senior lecturer , public policy , at the University of Maryland ; former deputy director of the Association of American Geographers , and author of a 2003 Census Bureau report on migration patterns among young , educated workers . , demographer and senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program of the Brookings Institution , Washington , D.C. , and a research professor in population studies at the University of Michigan . , professor of geography and regional development , University of Arizona , Tucson ; a senior editor of the Journal of Regional Science , and researcher on age - related factors in migration .
Third Place : New York
Reeling from the financial crisis , the nation 's largest city may seem an unlikely pick .
But one reason New York 's unemployment rate is stuck at a daunting 10.3 % is that hopeful job seekers continue to move there , city officials say .
Clearly , " the city 's mythic status as a place to test one 's mettle against the best and the brightest " remains intact , Dr. Florida says .
New York has n't lost as many financial - services jobs as predicted , says Deputy Mayor Robert Lieber ; so far , fewer than half of the 293,000 job losses that were projected by the city from 2009 through mid-2010 have materialized .
Residential growth in boroughs outside Manhattan , such as Brooklyn , is making the city marginally more affordable , and some panelists see housing prices falling more .
At Vermont 's Middlebury College , New York surpasses nearby Boston as the destination of choice for the class of 2010 , says Jaye Roseborough , career - services director .
Allison Bailey , a 2009 grad , loves the city 's " European lifestyle , " she says .
After studying in France , " I wanted to be in a ' walking city ' like Paris . "
Working lots of overtime as a litigation assistant for a law firm , she can manage the $ 1,450 monthly rent for her Manhattan studio , she says .
And she is happy to leave behind the long car commutes of her native Houston .
The downside :
The city is still unaffordable for many , and the less - pricey suburbs can impose enervating commutes .
Fourth Place : Portland , Ore .
Los Angeles native Ryan O'Leary , 23 , did n't expect when he graduated from college with a journalism degree last year to be working construction at this point , he says .
But he decided about a month ago to give top priority to moving to the place he most wanted to live , and Portland was it — despite its daunting 11.2 % unemployment rate .
Mr. O'Leary , who found an apartment downtown , calls his move " the best decision I 've made in a long time . "
He loves the city 's nightlife and neighborhoods , and the city 's streetcars — one of which stops by his building — are a refreshing change from Los Angeles 's car culture .
He continues to job - hunt in his field , public relations , on his days off .
A symbol of " West Coast hipness , " Ms. Franklin says , Portland has continued to draw migrants through the recession .
An urban - growth boundary fosters a strong downtown culture while containing suburban sprawl , easing travel to nearby mountains and forests .
Portland has expanded mass transit and boasts sizeable electronics and activewear companies , several wind - and solar - energy firms , and many green - building projects .
Its quirky culture appeals to musicians and artists :
The city has more than its share of oddball events , including an adult soap - box derby and an urban Iditarod ( wherein costumed revelers pull shopping carts ) .
" Keep Portland Weird " is a popular bumper sticker .
Although Austin claimed that motto first in the 1980s , " we live it pretty well here , " says a city staffer .
The downside :
While regional officials have laid plans to add 10,000 jobs in the next five years , Portland has done better at promoting its quality of life than fostering job growth .
" As nice as it may be to live in Portland , " says Economy.com 's Dr. Cochrane , " you can only sleep on someone 's couch for so long .
At some point you have to get a job . "
Fifth Place : Austin , Texas
After a year spent traveling and working overseas in 2007 , New Jersey resident Olga Garcia , 26 , and her boyfriend , Kevin Kurkjian , 27 , debated places to settle .
Then Kevin announced , " Olga , I 've got it figured out :
We 're going to Austin . "
She agreed .
Both had heard from friends that Austin offered housing and career opportunities and a welcoming , youthful culture .
" I had never heard anything bad about Austin , " says Ms. Garcia , a marketing consultant .
A state capital and the site of a big University of Texas campus , Austin has become a gathering place for tech - and arts - conscious young adults .
Its SXSW media and arts conference , and its Austin City Limits music festival , draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year .
Both unemployment and the cost of living are relatively low .
And with significant high - tech , videogame and renewable - energy sectors , Mr. DeVol calls Austin " a model for a thriving 21st - century knowledge - based community . "
The downside : Some panelists have doubts about how strongly Austin will rebound after the recession .

Check out my Official Fake Kenyan Birth Certificate</a>
by Ben Cohen
This I would like to see .
According to Taibbi :
Apparently Goldman has weighed suing me for … well , I ’m not exactly
sure what the grounds would be .
Being annoying ?
Covering finance
without a nice enough tie ?
I seriously doubt they would do something like this , but if they
actually have considered such a step , that says a lot about their
mentality .
If the bank really wanted to defuse controversy at a time
when people are pissed at Wall Street they could have juggled their
second - quarter profit numbers to make them look less obscene , or
announced even a nominal loan forgiveness program for some of their
notorious subsidiary Litton ’s struggling customers , something like
that .
Instead … well , we ’ll see if this is true .
I doubt it .
In many Better Late Than Never cases , viewers / readers / listeners go into the experience with a lot more information than they probably should have .
( If there ’s one piece of Roger Ebert advice we ’ve chosen to completely ignore , it ’s his suggestion that we never watch movie trailers . )
For example , Tasha Robinson ’s 2008 appraisal of Titanic was colored by her almost - complete knowledge of a movie she ’d never actually sat down and watched .
Advertisement
In the case of Big Trouble In Little China , I ’m in a different boat .
( Get it ?
Boat ?
Titanic ? )
My colleagues here at The A.V. Club professed serious shock that I ’d not only never seen John Carpenter ’s 1986 cult classic , but I knew basically nothing about it .
This is surprising not because the movie was some sort of huge cultural touchstone or box - office success in general , but more because my generation seems to have embraced it as some sort of marker .
( Or maybe it ’s just the people in this office . )
Wikipedia tells me that it was actually a box - office failure , raking in only $ 11 million .
I think it ’s odd that I ’ve never seen Big Trouble mostly because I really , really liked John Carpenter ’s Escape From New York when I was about 10 , and I ca n’t imagine my 12 - year - old self not figuring out some way to con my mom into renting me a VHS tape with Kurt Russell looking kick - ass and holding a machine gun on the cover .
( She once rented me the Duran Duran video collection with all the nudity , so there was precedent . )
That was probably exactly who I wanted to be when I was 10 — Kurt Russell holding a machine gun and delivering a huge shit - eating grin .
There ’s also a girl on the cover , but small , and in the corner .
And a semi , which I guess is pretty cool , too .

Anyway , for the last year , Kyle and Keith have been bugging me to get down to business and watch it , so on the occasion of its re-release on Blu-ray ( it ’s currently # 1 among martial - arts , comic- action , and Kurt Russell movies at Amazon ) , I figured I ’d better .
Let me throw you a curveball and answer this column ’s titular question right away .
Better late than never ?
Yeah , sort of .
My first reaction after Big Trouble ’s goofily violent 99 minutes was that I really wish I had seen it when it came out .
If I had , I could probably look at it 20 years later with genuine fondness , and have that strange experience where you communicate with your younger self and say , “ You loved that movie with all of your heart ?
Remember how seriously you took it ?
What were you thinking , you little knucklehead ? ”
( And then give yourself noogies . )
The closest analog in my experience to this feeling is The Golden Child , a movie I probably watched 10,000 times ( okay , 100 ) when I was a kid .
Both films feature ridiculous plots , incredibly dated special effects that surely seemed amazing at the time , and mystical Asian powers .
Two of the main Asian dudes in these two movies are played by the same actors , Victor Wong and James Hong , who play the wise / weird old Asians in every movie that requires one .
They ’re both hilarious , too .
Advertisement
Golden Child and Big Trouble also both came out in 1986 , and both feature a pretty funny protagonist working at the height of his powers , and playing an atypical hero .
Golden Child , of course , has Eddie Murphy when he was still awesome , between Beverly Hills Cop movies .
Before you dismiss it completely , remember the “ I want the knife ” scene !
Big Trouble , which is what we ’re here to talk about , stars Kurt Russell .
I did n’t have a strong opinion about the studly actor coming into this one , and looking over his filmography , I realize I have n’t seen most of his big movies .
But Russell is pretty great as Jack Burton , the big-rig driver who gets mixed up in Chinatown ’s deep , deep underground .
I ’m not sure whether his low - wattage John Wayne impression is deliberate , but it ’s pretty damn funny .
And that ’s just the voice .
The look is great , too :
He wears high - waisted jeans and a wifebeater throughout pretty much the whole movie , and he ’s rarely without a knife or a machine gun .
But he ’s never a tough guy , which is why it works .
He ’s an unevolved everyman , supremely confident in everything he says , but basically outmatched by the world and his situation .
And what a situation :
If it were any less dumb , it would look like Big Trouble was trying too hard to be serious .
When Asian gangsters kidnap Russell ’s friend ’s fiancée at the airport , it sets off a chain of ridiculously choreographed kung - fu battles that eventually lead to an underground lair .
Turns out the girl was kidnapped because she has green eyes , and an ancient ghostly mystic dude ( Hong ) must marry a green - eyed woman and then sacrifice her in order to lift a curse .
But most of that does n’t matter .
What matters is Russell bumbling through fight after fight , running scared one minute and acting tough the next — and keeping an incredulous ( yet somehow credulous ) look on his face every time something weird happens .
Three dudes descend from the sky in the middle of a gang war , and their names are Thunder , Rain , and Lightning ?
Apparently that ’s only moderately weird .
And Russell always , always takes a little time out of his action scenes to hit on Kim Cattrall , who plays a green - eyed lawyer along for the ride .
Advertisement
The great thing about Russell ’s performance is that he never gets any smarter as the movie progresses .
Twice during the movie ’s biggest battle sequence , he ’s incapacitated by his own stupidity — once by firing a gun into a ceiling and being knocked out by the resulting falling concrete , and once by knifing a really heavy bad guy , who falls on top of him .
The whole thing is treated with exactly the amount of seriousness it deserves , which redeems the silliness of a floating eyeball .
( It ’s exactly the kind of special effect that probably looked incredible in 1986 , and now just looks strange .
And hey , it was rendered by the Ghostbusters special - effects team . )
But Big Trouble is plenty conscious of its silliness , which it embraces fully .
The baddies ’ underground lair not only has tons of ancient Buddha statues ( huh ? ) , it also has a Buddha - belly elevator , an escalator running into a giant mouth , and tons — I mean tons — of neon accent lights .
It ’s the perfect backdrop for a battle that looks like it takes place almost entirely on trampolines .
In that way , Big Trouble is the best kind of action movie , because it ignores real - world logic in favor of having some fun .
( And yes , I love the Crank movies .
Sue me . )
It sets up its own parameters of ridiculousness and then runs with them , winking a little , but sticking to its story .
I do n’t know that I ’ll ever need to watch it again , but I ’m happy that it awoke a little of my 12 - year - old soul for a couple of hours .

( AP ) --
The West Coast groundfish fleet has struggled to stay afloat during major cutbacks to reverse long - standing problems with overfishing and to protect the seafloor from damage caused by bottom trawling gear .
They are now embarking , after years of work and negotiation , on the latest system in fisheries management , known as " catch share . "
Fishermen are given their own individual shares of the total catch , personal responsibility for not catching overfished species , and a promise of better prices for the fish they do haul up .
" In the short term it might hurt people .
In the long term I think it 's the way to go , " said Todd Whaley , 46 , part - owner and skipper of the Miss Sarah , a 102 - foot trawler that he rigs for groundfish , Pacific whiting , and crab , depending on the market .
NOAA Fisheries Service , the federal agency that oversees commercial fishing , is pressing regional fishery councils that set harvest limits around the country to adopt catch share programs .
The agency is under a congressional mandate to end all overfishing in U.S. waters by 2011 , the year that the West Coast groundfish accord goes into effect .
It still has 41 fisheries to bring in line out of 244 that have been assessed .
" The scientific evidence is pretty clear that commercial fisheries that are managed with catch shares on balance perform better than traditionally managed fisheries , " Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told The Associated Press on a recent visit to Newport .
" So we are encouraging every ( regional fishery management ) council to simply look at this tool and say , ' Is it appropriate for these fisheries , or is it not . ' "
Chief among candidates for switching to catch share is the New England groundfish fishery , which has been struggling for 15 years to rebuild cod and haddock stocks .
The stakes are high .
According to NOAA , commercial fishing contributes $ 28 billion a year to the economy .
Meanwhile , the nation 's appetite for fish outstrips domestic supply .
Sixty percent of the seafood consumed comes from imports .
The scientific foundation for catch share comes from studies like one examining fisheries in New Zealand and Australia published in the journal Science in 2007 .
The report found that fishermen who owned a share of the harvest made more money fishing less while doing a better job of conserving the resource .
The idea is when they no longer have to race to fill their nets they can concentrate on quality and efficiency .
" There is nothing magical about catch shares rescuing overfished stocks , but they do change the incentives so that the fishermen who have a dedicated share of a stock know they will be the ones who benefit when stocks are rebuilt , " said co-author Ray Hilborn , fishery sciences professor at University of Washington .
West Coast groundfish have been rebuilding since 2000 , when harvests were cut in half to protect overfished rockfish .
Despite limiting harvests and cutting the fleet through buybacks , several groundfish species remain overfished .
They are still the region 's most valuable fishery , with landings worth $ 55 million in 2007 .
The classification covers 82 species , caught mostly by trawlers - also known as draggers - hauling nets along the ocean bottom .
The fish are sold as sole , flounder , lingcod , black cod , snapper , and imitation crab .
For five years fishermen and conservation groups have been working with the Pacific Fishery Management Council to adopt a catch share system , already in force with a dozen U.S. fisheries including Alaskan halibut , Gulf red snapper and Atlantic surf clams .
The council approved the move last year .
The rules go into effect Jan. 1 , 2011 .
Catch share gets rid of the traditional race for fish , where fishermen go full - bore until they fill an overall quota , or inadvertently catch too many overfished species - known as bycatch .
With their own quota , fishermen can fish when the weather and market are best .
With that comes individual responsibility for not exceeding limits on bycatch .
Those who do can buy shares to cover the excess .
To reward captains who avoid bycatch , and penalize those who do n't , each West Coast groundfish trawler will have an observer on board to count every fish hauled up in the net .
The New England Fishery Management Council is headed in the same direction .
In July they approved a plan giving fishermen the option of a catch share fishery , with sectors rather than individuals allocated shares .
NOAA Fisheries is seeking $ 18.6 million from Congress to implement the switch .
Among the first to feel the pain of declining cod harvests - and the first to opt for catch share - were small - boat fishermen on Cape Cod , Mass. , who still fish with hooks and lines the way their forefathers did .
" We were almost like the canary in the coal mine , " said Eric Brazer , sector manager for the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen 's Association , which went to catch share in 2004 .
" We 'll live within the limits set by science .
Other fishermen are willing to go toe - to - toe with the scientists .
We 're most interested in preserving our community and making sure we get through the next few years till we start seeing the fish populations come back . "
Not everyone in the 120 - boat West Coast groundfish fleet will be a winner under the new rules .
An analysis estimates 50 to 70 boats will be left with fishing permits after things sort out .
The remainder will have to stop groundfishing .
Don Taylor , captain of the Little Joe , has built his knowledge of where and when to find fish on decades of trial and error , and fears that now even one bad tow could shut him down if the net comes up with a single canary rockfish , an overfished species with no bycatch quota .
As for Whaley , he is confident that he will be able to figure out how to succeed under the new rules .
" Instead of the race for fish , lately , it 's been the race for bycatch , " he said .
" A person who has his own bycatch quota is going to be fishing much more carefully . "

Called " Prok " as an adult ( short for Professor Kinsey ) , Alfred Kinsey , Jr. ( Liam Neeson ) has been interested in biology since he was a child growing up in the early twentieth century , despite the criticisms of such being evil nonsense from his overbearing and devoutly Christian father , Professor Alfred Seguine Kinsey ( John Lithgow ) .
Prok goes on to become a biology professor at Indiana University , initially focusing on the study of gall wasps .
But those studies , in combination with questions from his students , coming to terms with the needs of sex with his own wife , a former student of his named Clara McMillen ( Laura Linney ) ( whom he calls Mac ) , and what he sees as the gross misinformation on the subject currently within popular belief makes him change his focus to human sexuality .
Many of those gross untruths - as he sees them - are that oral sex and masturbation cause a slew of maladies , which are perpetuated by what is presented in the university 's hygiene class taught by Professor .

Despite rising unemployment , credit - card debt and thinning discretionary spending , American pet owners remain loyal customers of an industry that is enjoying consistent growth .
The pet - food industry is fueled by consumers who wo n’t back away from spending on food and necessities for their animals , though they ’re likely to pare down the family vacation .
The strong spending comes amid price increases in nearly every pet - food category , the result of rising costs of fuel , ingredients and transportation for manufacturers .
Dogs and cats , though , still feel the pinch in other ways , owners said .
Fewer treats , new toys or accessories such as collars and leashes , even fewer trips to the groomer are all part of the cost savings .
“ We ’ve cut back for us all , ” said Kathy Schmidt of Lone Tree , whose miniature schnauzer , Archie , has had to wait longer between clippings .
Though the family has trimmed back , Archie still eats pretty well because “ he needs to eat what he ’s accustomed to , ” Schmidt said .
That ’s one reason spending on pets remains robust , with total sales of all pet products topping $ 45 billion this year , a 5 percent increase , according to the American Pet Products Association .
And retail sales of pet food are up 4.5 percent in 2009 at about $ 18 billion .
Future pet - food sales are projected to top $ 21 billion by 2013 .
It ’s showing up at local stores , where boutique owners are enjoying growth as many of their counterparts catering solely to humans struggle .
“ We ’ve seen double - digit growth this year .
The recession has n’t really touched us , ” said Deb Dempsey , owner of Mouthfuls in Denver ’s Highland neighborhood .
“ We ’re not selling tons of bedding and clothing , and treats and durable goods , the foofy stuff , has stayed down . ”
Dedication to their pet ’s health apparently has much to do with how owners spend .
“ We have so many customers who say they ’d eat macaroni and cheese before they ’d cut back on their dogs , ” she said .
The pet - food recalls of 2007 did n’t leave the industry unscathed but did reinforce owners ’ focus on quality , not price .
“ I ’ll go to McDonald ’s and eat lunch from the dollar menu , but a can of food is n’t something I want to skimp on , ” money manager Pat Janssen said of his dog - food buying .
“ But there are fewer toys and chews in the bag these days . ”
Prices are stabilizing , but consumers should n’t expect too big a drop any time soon .
Much is because of long - term supply contracts producers locked into when prices were already high , analysts say .
“ We ’re trying to cut back , though we ’re not real good at it , ” Mark Niederhauser said of his two chow - chows and papillon during a recent trip to PetSmart near Park Meadows shopping center .
“ I just ca n’t deny the dogs . ”

Bryant Gerley Munoz walked into the Harris County criminal courthouse facing a minor drug charge Wednesday , but law officers charged him with a felony after they reported spotting him pointing his camera phone up an unsuspecting legal assistant 's skirt while he pretended to tie his shoe .
Authorities charged Munoz , 19 , with improper photography , alleging he victimized the 29 - year - old woman in the courthouse lobby .
The legal assistant was talking to a Precinct 1 constable 's deputy when Munoz , who was at the courthouse on a misdemeanor drug charge , sneaked several pictures , said constable 's Lt. Bill Ruland .
“ You can actually see the officer in the photos , ” Ruland said .
He said Munoz gave a full confession after being taken into custody .
Munoz is now charged with a state jail felony , which carries a maximum sentence of two years behind bars , court records show .

excerpts from ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON by Henry Hazlitt
Chapter II , " The Broken Window "
_________
- A young hoodlum , say , heaves a brick through the window of a bakers shop .
The shopkeeper runs out furious , but the boy is gone .
A crowd gathers , and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies .
After a while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection .
And several of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that , after all , the misfortune has its bright side .
It will make business for some glazier .
As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon it .
How much does a new plate glass window cost ?
Two hundred and fifty dollars ?
That will be quite a sun .
After all , if windows were never broken , what would happen to the glass business ?
Then , of course , the thing is endless .
The glazier will have $ 250 more to spend with other merchants , and these in turn will have $ 250 more to spend with still other merchants , and so ad infinitum .
The smashed window will go on providing money and employment in ever - widening circles .
The logical conclusion from all this would be , if the crowd drew it , that the little hoodlum who threw the brick , far from being a public menace , was a public benefactor .
Now let us take another look .
The crowd is at least right in its first conclusion .
This little act of vandalism will in the first instance mean more business for some glazier .
The glazier will be no more unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death .
But the shopkeeper will be out $ 250 that he was planning to spend for a new suit .
Because he has had to replace the window , he will have to go without the suit ( or some equivalent need or luxury ) .
Instead of having a window and $ 250 he now has merely a window .
Or , as he was planning to buy the suit that very afternoon , instead of having both a window and a suit he must be content with the window and no suit .
If we think of him as part of the community , the community has lost a new suit that might otherwise have come into being , and is just that much poorer .
The glaziers gain of business , in short , is merely the tailors loss of business .
No new employment has been added .
The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction , the baker and the glazier .
They had forgotten the potential third party involved , the tailor .
They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene .
They will see the new window in the next day or two .
They will never see the extra suit , precisely because it will never be made .
They see only what is immediately visible to the eye . * -- excerpted from Chapter II of Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt .

SEOUL , South Korea  North Korea unleashed walls of water from one or more of its dams on Sunday , sending a flash flood roaring through the heavily armed border with South Korea and sweeping away six South Koreans , officials in Seoul said .
The six South Koreans , who are still missing , include an 8 - year - old boy .
They were camping or fishing on the Imjin River , which flows from the North , enters South Korea north of Seoul , and meanders close to the border before emptying into the Yellow Sea .
“ The government will send a telegram to the North on Monday to protest and demand a satisfying explanation , ” the Unification Ministry of South Korea said in a statement .
Officials said the Imjin River ’s water level on the border doubled , to 15.1 feet , after North Korea began releasing water without warning at 2 a.m. on Sunday , either from its newly built Hwanggang Dam 17 miles north of the border or from a smaller dam downstream .
( CNN ) -- South African athletics officials have rallied behind controversial new running star Caster Semenya , who won the women 's world 800 meters title just hours after the sport 's governing body asked for the 18 - year - old 's gender to be verified .
Semenya celebrates her gold , which came just hours after the IAAF called for a gender test on the athlete .
Semenya crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in a time of one minute 55.45 seconds -- the best in the world this year and more than eight seconds quicker than her fastest effort of 2008 .
She finished more than two seconds clear of second - placed Kenyan Janeth Jepkosgei , the 2007 champion .
However , the race was run amid controversy following the announcement by the International Amateur Athletics Federation ( IAAF ) .
Have your say :
What 's your opinion on the IAAF 's decision ?
Semenya 's masculine build fueled rumors , but the South Africa team manager said there should be no dispute .
" Even the ID that she has , the passport , says she is a female , " Phiwe Mlangeni - Tsholetsane told CNN by phone from Berlin on Thursday .
" There was no cheating on our part , or even on the part of the athlete . "
She said Semenya was not bothered by the questions over her gender and was simply focusing on improving her times .
" If there are tests being done , we accept that .
We can't stop that , " Mlangeni - Tsholetsane said .
" We have nothing to hide . "
Meanwhile , Semenya received her gold medal in the podium ceremony on Thursday , receiving a warm ovation from the crowd in the Berlin Olympic Stadium .
Dressed in the yellow and green track suit of South Africa , Semenya mouthed the words of their national anthem as her country 's flag was raised .
Results from the IAAF 's planned tests are not expected to be known in the near future .
" The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure , " said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya 's gender was first raised after her astonishing African Junior Championships displays .
" In the case of this athlete , following her breakthrough in the African Junior Championships , the rumors , the gossip were starting to build up , " Davies told reporters .
Semenya declined to take part in the scheduled post - race interview , reported South African tabloid Sowetan , and her place was taken by IAAF general secretary Pierre Weiss .
" The investigations will take some days or weeks and I 'm not a doctor to give a conclusive answer on her gender .
But we know her as a woman , " Pierre said .
Athletics South Africa president Leonard Chuene accused South African media of trying to " destroy " Semenya , according to Sowetan -- which described the runner as " our golden girl . "
" They have their own agenda and I can tell you that they will not succeed , " Chuene said .
" This girl has been to African youth championships and other international events , and why was this issue not raised then ?
" Why now ?
Is it because she is not an athlete they were expecting to do well in her maiden appearance in the senior championships ? "
Her father Jacob Semenya told the paper before the race that the accusations were unfounded .
" She is my little girl .
I raised her and I have never doubted her gender .
She is a woman and I can repeat that a million times , " he said on Wednesday .

— A bird strike shortly after take - off might have caused an engine malfunction that forced a pilot to make an emergency landing at Raleigh - Durham International Airport Sunday morning , a Northwest Airlines spokeswoman said .
Shortly after take - off at 8:40 a.m. , those on board Flight 1546 to Minneapolis heard a loud boom when an engine blew out , RDU spokeswoman Mindy Hamlin said .
The captain shut down the left engine and landed safely at RDU at 9:02 a.m. , Northwest Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Parker said .
" Whoever was piloting was doing a hell of a job , " said Dan Gilvary , who saw the plane pass directly overhead .
Seen anything interesting ?
Share your photos , videos and stories .
The 148 passengers and five crew members on board were not injured .
Passengers were re-scheduled on other flights , Perry said .
Parker said that a bird strike is suspected as the cause of the engine malfunction .
The plane will likely receive maintenance work and then go back into service and be flown to Minneapolis .
RDU had six “ substantial ” incidents of birds striking planes between 1990 and 2007 , most recently in June 2002 according to an April report from the Federal Aviation Administration .
No one was injured in the collisions .
In January , Hamlin described measures to keep birds away , including setting off fireworks , communication between air - traffic controllers and pilots , and removing birds from RDU property .
Most jet engines are designed to digest birds up to 4 pounds .
Thirty - six species of birds weigh more than that , and many fly in flocks .
Witnesses saw flames
Hamlin said that RDU fire crews checked out the plane and saw no signs of a fire .
However , a passenger and multiple witnesses told WRAL News that the plane caught on fire .
Rhett Lawson , 14 , of Greensboro , was flying to a summer camp .
He was sitting in the last row of the plane when he thought he saw an engine blow out .
“ A whole bunch of people started screaming , ' Fire . '
And I look over , I open my window , and I could see this huge flame coming from the engine , ” Rhett said .
Passengers were ordered to get in position to prepare for a crash , and a lot of people on board were praying , he said .
" I just thought , ' This is it .
This is not going to end up well , ' " Rhett said .
Witnesses said they heard an explosion and saw a low - flying plane on fire over north Raleigh and Falls Lake .
Greg Walker said he heard what sounded " like a Harley Davidson " in his back yard in the Ethan 's Glenn subdivision , off N.C. Highway 98 .
He looked out and saw a plane with flames coming from its front and reaching almost its entire length .
Gilvary and his wife thought they heard a tractor back - firing while they were riding horses .
Then in the distance , over the field , they saw a plane on fire .
When the plane got closer , he saw flames coming from the left front engine .
" ( My wife ) was immediately in tears .
She said , ' How many people are on that plane ? ' "
Gilvary said .
" We thought for sure it could have exploded any second .
... I could n't believe it did n't blow up . "
But the engine was quickly shut off , extinguishing the fire , he said .
Three times , the plane drifted to the left , its left wing dipping down , he said .
" Every time , he 'd bring it back level , " Gilvary said .
" We thought , ' Man , what a good pilot . ' "
Twenty - two minutes after take - off , Flight 1546 was back on the ground – safe .
" Everyone was clapping at the end and saying , ' Good job . '
Everyone was really happy once we landed , ” Rhett said .
License Plate Cameras
This one really set off my B.S. meter : State officials hoping to shut off drug pipeline by putting in cameras .
Huh ?
Illinois officials are hoping to shut off the drug pipeline between Chicago and Mexico with a few snapshots .
Illinois State Police officials , on behalf of 13 states to the south and west of Illinois , are asking for federal stimulus money to buy hundreds of special cameras that would be placed on interstates known as frequent routes for drug - runners .
The projected cost is listed at $ 9.9 million .
I do n’t get it .
The cameras , 242 in all , would be able to record license plate numbers .
That information would then be shared with other states involved in the proposal .
Most of the cameras would be mounted , but some would be placed on mobile vehicles traveling up and down interstates 55 and 80 in Illinois , as well as a handful of other cross-country routes between Illinois and Texas .
And what ’s the point ?
Chicago is at the heart of the proposal because it is a top destination for drugs flowing into the nation from Mexico , said Kurt Schmid , who leads the Chicago office of White House Office of Drug Control Policy , specializing in drug trafficking .
“ Chicago is a major major transit point , ” said Schmid .
Similarly , the same couriers who bring drugs to Chicago often return along the same routes with large sums of money or guns , Schmid said .
The cameras could be used in those instances , too .
Um , OK , let me get this straight .
You have a whole bunch of cameras capturing thousands of license plates traveling on a heavily used set of expressways .
And you ’re going to catch drug trafficking … how ?
During the summer , I travel to Chicago on I - 55 every week , so I suppose the cameras might find that interesting , along with hundreds of salespeople , or admissions counselors , or customer service representatives , or students going home for the weekend , or …
How is the information from these cameras going to be stored and analyzed ?
How is this anything but a massive attempt at comprehensive data collection on the movement of American citizens ( under the completely unexplained guise of shutting down drug trafficking ) ?
NO ONE DOUBTS that the words we write or speak are an expression of our inner thoughts and personalities .
But beyond the meaningful content of language , a wealth of unique insights into an author ’s mind are hidden in the style of a text — in such elements as how often certain words and word categories are used , regardless of context .
It is how an author expresses his or her thoughts that reveals character , asserts social psychologist James W. Pennebaker of the University of Texas at Austin .
When people try to present themselves a certain way , they tend to select what they think are appropriate nouns and verbs , but they are unlikely to control their use of articles and pronouns .
These small words create the style of a text , which is less subject to conscious manipulation .
Pennebaker ’s statistical analyses have shown that these small words may hint at the healing progress of patients and give us insight into the personalities and changing ideals of public figures , from political candidates to terrorists .
“ Virtually no one in psychology has realized that low - level words can give clues to large - scale behaviors , ” says Pennebaker , who , with colleagues , developed a computer program that analyzes text , called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC , pronounced “ Luke ” ) .
The software has been used to examine other speech characteristics as well , tallying up nouns and verbs in hundreds of categories to expose buried patterns .
Character Count
Most recently , Pennebaker and his colleagues used LIWC to analyze the candidates ’ speeches and interviews during last fall ’s presidential election .
The software counts how many times a speaker or author uses words in specific categories , such as emotion or perception , and words that indicate complex cognitive processes .
It also tallies up so - called function words such as pronouns , articles , numerals and conjunctions .
Within each of these major categories are subsets :
Are there more mentions of sad or happy emotions ?
Does the speaker prefer “ I ” and “ me ” to “ us ” and “ we ” ?
LIWC answers these quantitative questions ; psychologists must then figure out what the numbers mean .
Before LIWC was developed in the mid-1990s , years of psychological research in which people counted words by hand established robust connections between word usage and psychological states or character traits
The political candidates , for example , showed clear differences in their speaking styles .
John McCain tended to speak directly and personally to his constituency , using a vocabulary that was both emotionally loaded and impulsive .
Barack Obama , in contrast , made frequent use of causal relationships , which indicated more complex thought processes .
He also tended to be more vague than his Republican rival .
Pennebaker ’s team has posted a far more in - depth breakdown , including analyses of the vice presidential candidates , at www.wordwatchers.wordpress.com.
Skeptics of LIWC ’s usefulness point out that many of these characteristics of McCain ’s and Obama ’s speeches could be gleaned without the use of a computer program .
When the subjects of analysis are not accessible , however , LIWC may provide a unique insight .
Such was the case with Pennebaker ’s study of al Qaeda communications .
In 2007 he and several co-workers , under contract with the FBI , analyzed 58 texts by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , bin Laden ’s second in command .
The comparison showed how much pronouns are able to disclose .
For example , between 2004 and 2006 the frequency with which al - Zawahiri used the word “ I ” tripled , whereas it remained constant in bin Laden ’s writings .
“ Normally , higher rates of ‘ I ’ words correspond with feelings of insecurity , threat and defensiveness .
Closer inspection of his ‘ I ’ use in context tends to confirm this , ” Pennebaker says .
Other studies have shown that words that are used to express balance or nuance ( “ except , ” “ but , ” and so on ) are associated with higher cognitive complexity , better grades and even the truthfulness with which facts are reported .
For bin Laden , analysis showed that the thought processes in his texts had reached a higher level over the years , whereas those of his lieutenant had stagnated .
Healing Words
This power of statistical analysis to quantify a person ’s changing language use over time is a key advantage to programs such as LIWC .
In 2003 Pennebaker and statistician R. Sherlock Campbell , now at Yale University , used a statistical tool called latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) to study the diary entries of trauma patients from three earlier studies , looking for text characteristics that had changed in patients who were convalescing and met rarely with their physician .
Again , the researchers showed that content was unimportant .
The factor that was most clearly associated with recovery was the use of pronouns .
Patients whose writings changed perspective from day to day were less likely to seek medical treatment during the follow - up period .
It may be that patients who describe their situation both from their own viewpoint and from the perspective of others recover more quickly from traumatic experiences — a variation on the already well - established idea that writing about negative experiences is therapeutic .
Or perhaps the LSA simply detected the patients ’ recovery as reflected by their writing but not brought about by it — in that case , programs such as LIWC could aid doctors in diagnosing illness and gauging treatment progression .
Researchers are currently investigating many other patient groups , including those with cancer , mental illness and suicidal tendencies , using LIWC to uncover clues about their emotional well - being and their mental state .
Although the statistical study of language is relatively young , it is clear that analyzing patterns of word use and writing style can lead to insights that would otherwise remain hidden .
Because these tools offer predictions based on probability , however , such insights will never be definitive .
“ In the final analysis , our situation is much like that of economists , ” Pennebaker says .
“ It ’s too early to come up with a standardized analysis .
But at the end of the day , we all are making educated guesses , the same way economists can understand , explain and predict economic ups and downs . ”
He Said , She Said
The way we write and speak can reveal volumes about our identity and character .
Here is a sampling of the many variables that can be detected in our use of style - related words such as pronouns and articles :
Gender :
In general , women tend to use more pronouns and references to other people .
Men are more likely to use articles , prepositions and big words .
: In general , women tend to use more pronouns and references to other people .

Age :
As people get older , they typically refer to themselves less , use more positive - emotion words and fewer negative - emotion words , and use more future - tense verbs and fewer past - tense verbs .
: As people get older , they typically refer to themselves less , use more positive - emotion words and fewer negative - emotion words , and use more future - tense verbs and fewer past - tense verbs .
Honesty :
When telling the truth , people are more likely to use first - person singular pronouns such as “ I . ”
They also use exclusive words such as “ except ” and “ but . ”
These words may indicate that a person is making a distinction between what they did do and what they did not do — liars often do not deal well with such complex constructions .

We said a lot of things together , and they said a lot of things in Indian too .
We 'd laugh at one another .
We used to have a lot of fun .
The sauna is something the Finns brought into the country .
But the Indian knew it before -- as a " sweatbath .
"
( 3 ) The Indians always had a sweatlodge before the Finns came .
Before the Finns came we called it a " sweatbath " but we called it a " Finnbath " later on .
Finns , Norwegians , Swedes , and everybody went to sauna .
We knew that , but we still called it a " Finnbath " at that time .
The others got it from the Finns , and the Finns know how to do it .
The Finns use the sauna for bathing .
They used it for rheumatism .
They used it for doctoring .
That 's where they kept clean , and it was always busy .
They used the sweatbath for the flu or anything .
And they did n't use that sweatbath house for anything else .
It was only a bath house .
They did n't use their saunas for washing clothes , or smoking fish , or making jerk - steak , or anything like that .
They might have in the Old Country , but we did n't here .
(4) We always had enough lumber here to separate the bath from the other buildings .
We separated them in respect for what we use them for .
See , we respect the meat -- smoke - meat -- and we have separate ovens up here that smoke fish and smoke meat .
They 're more like ovens than a sweatbath , and they work good because we use maple and hardwood for that .
We have lots of wood ; yea .
So we have separate buildings for smoking fish and meat .
The Finns came in our area . . . well . . . the way I remember , it was about 1912 , ' 11 , ' 12 .
I saw one once before I left for Tower School , ( 5 ) but -- mostly -- they came into our area while I was away at school .
(6 ) The Finns did lots for us here when they came in .
We learned a lot from them .
I 'm talking about Deer River and the Leech Lake Reservation near there , seven miles west of Deer River .
Some of them -- most of them -- by about 1918 , had their own sweatbath .
It was about 1920 , 1919 , and all that time in there , when they began to have their own sweatbaths .
Some of the Finnish settlers who came about 1916 -- or before 1918 -- had their own saunas or sweatbaths too , but they were little ones .
They were accustomed to that .
The first one or two Finns just made a little wiigwaam sauna like the Indian .
They were built out of ash .
They used the Indian idea of putting poles together to make a little wiigwaam , and they sweat in that .
And we told them , " You do n't have to use sticks .
If you 're going to use the sweathouse permanent , you better get lumber .
( 7) Lumber seals better . "
Then after a while , when they got lumber , they made a little Finnbath house .
I remember the Finns at first having bath houses without fire places -- without barrels .
They had the center of the bath house filled with rocks .
They just piled the rocks in -- maybe four by five feet -- and smoke would come out between the rocks .
They 'd just throw the rocks in and build a fire underneath them .
There 'd be air space , and the flame'd go right through it .
And then they 'd open it on the top , so that the heat 'ed go out through a big chimney -- through a stovepipe .
When the rocks got hot enough , they shoveled the ashes and coals out , and shut the draft .

The first permanent sauna was just a little lumber building that was sheeted and insulated .
It was made out of lumber , and the outside was tarpaper .
It was well built .
There was no draft .
The door shut tight .
When the Finns came to Deer River and Ball Club and first built a sweatbath sauna with lumber , that building was n't very wide .
It was just a small room , because when they build a sauna the size depends on how many will use it -- and there were n't that many Finns around them days .
When I first saw that Finn sauna house -- where I grew up , near Deer River -- there was a bench in there about two feet high .
They 'd go in there and then they 'd strip off ; ya .
The room inside was about twelve feet -- twelve feet round !
The first sauna baths in Deer River were round buildings .
They were round -- some of them .
And the size of them all depends on the size of the crew who 's going to take the saunas .
If he 's alone , he does n't have to make it big .
Some of the Finnbaths were made out of logs -- sometimes .
Especially in the lumber camps .
But sawed lumber ( 8 ) was so cheap , and they built so fast with that lumber , that the Finns most generally used lumber for their bath house .
Besides , with logs you have to chink or plaster ( 9 ) regularly .
They did n't trust the logs very much because the logs may get rotten , and if a spark got in there between the logs it might burn down the whole thing .
Now - a - days , those old log Finnbaths are falling down .

The first time I went in and looked around at a sauna was in nineteen . . . about 1940 , '38 .
That was a Finnish sauna .
I was up there in the woods by Iron River working for this logging company , Tom Bradley of Duluth .
I was working in a big lumber camp , and there were Finns there . ( 10 ) I drove team -- a team of horses .
I took any job I wanted .
I worked for Campbell too -- I think it was for Campbell .
Anyway , I worked for two together -- two loggers together .
Tom Bradley had a drying kiln there , which he used to dry lumber .
He had a mill up there too , and I went there to work with him .
That was about ' 36 , ' 38 .
That was quite a while ago ; maybe it was even in ' 40 or ' 42 somewhere .
I worked up near Grand Marais , between Grand Marais and Two Harbors , somewhere in about 1942 .
I was the only Indian there , and I heard them laughing in the bath house .
Geeze I felt like getting in there with them .
Sure !
I walked in there to see what a sauna looked like .
And there it was !
That bath house was built of two - inch - thick lumber .
It was about eight by ten -- something like that .
Maybe it was ten by twelve .
And it was sealed !
There were no windows in that bath .
It was sealed ; yea .
There they used a barrel stove -- rocks with a barrel - stove inside .
They heat those rocks on a rack around the barrel stove .
The barrel stove was placed on the ground , because the barrel stove heats up the ground also .
They 'd make them barrel stoves and racks through the blacksmith 's shop .
We had a blacksmith 's shop in the lumber camp , and those people who wanted a bath house made racks to hold the rocks around the barrel stove .
A Finn in that lumber camp constructed that bath stove and rock rack .
He made it just right , the way he wanted it .
That way they did n't have that smoke coming against you , or the flames .
No .
There 's tricks in all trades , you know .
They had a bath room in camp -- a shower bath room -- but nobody used that .
They used that sauna !
They used that Finnish bath in the lumber camp .
Lots of the lumberjacks would take such baths , but not everybody .
We had a hundred - fifty in that camp .
They hired many people in those camps , and they realized they had to have room for anybody that wanted to go in there and take a Finnbath .
They used that bath house pred 'near -- pred 'near -- twice a week -- because there were so many men , way up in the North .
If they had a little cold , or a touch of flu , they 'd sweat it out .
They get up on the sauna bench and sweat it out .
With that sauna they all feel good .
You just naturally feel good on that .
Later on they 'd always stand on a bench .
Boy I thought this was really good .
I used to go in there and see them standing on a bench , oh , about six - feet wide .
The stove was in the middle and some of the men were standing against the wall .
Others stood on both sides .
They 'd stand over the rocks -- on both sides -- and one of them would spray the rocks .
They had boughs in there -- cedar boughs -- to splash water on the hot rocks .
Sometimes they used a ball of hay ( 11 ) instead .
They dip it in water and just splash that on the rocks and the steam comes .
And sometimes they 'd stand there and just pour cold water on the rocks to make steam .
And that steam makes you sweat .
The steam is the one that helps you .
They did n't use soap in that bath house -- to wash themselves .
It was just sweated out , yea , with steam .
You steam the sweat out from you -- but you have to drink water .
Drinking that cold water keeps your internals cool , but the sweat on the surface of your skin comes out .
So if you drink cold water , you 're all right .
You can't go in there without cold water .
You can't stand it without a little cold water .
We used cold water too , in the Indian sweatbath .
It gets so hot in the little Indian ones I could hear them groan in there : " Ah$. Iuu$ .
Iu . "
That steam would come up so fast it would make them holler .
Some of the Finns also use the cedar boughs to beat themselves .
They would beat themselves while they were standing or sitting on the platform .

Paul Niska was the first Finn person that I took notice of in our area .
I friended with him a long time -- Paul Niska .
Unlike the others that came in later , Niska did n't start a farm or go for timber work in the woods .
He was a watchman for some land and for the summer resorts that were coming in and building up in the area .
He just started working , and he knew how to work .
Later on he helped around resorts , cleaning out the shoreline , pulling all the timber out .
He utilized the deadheads and timber that was uprooted -- " driftwood " you call it in English .
He cut it up by hand and piled it .
He used that for the winter .
That 's a Finn .
I think he was a good manager of the land .
He was a good person .

" It must be time . "
That 's all I thought .
I went to school .
See , I left the country around Ball Club and Deer River for school in 1909 , ( 14 ) so I do n't know much about the Finns actually moving into our area .
I was away when the first Finnish people besides Niska came into the Deer River area .
I did n't know when they came in because when I was nine and ten years old I was up north in the government school .
Then afterwards , when I was done with school , when I came back to the Deer River area , I saw a lot of Finns .
When I came back from school ( 15 ) I saw the Finns working .
" How come we have a lot of Finns here ? " I asked my folks when I got home from school .
" How come they are Ma - du - duu wI - nI - nii ? "
My Dad , my Step - dad , told me about the Finns , and their sweatbath .
And he said , " They 're workers .
You watch that swampland they 're taking .
They go through the swampland and pull up roots and everything .
They clear land . "
Later I saw what he was talking about .
When the Finns came into that country by Deer River , by our area , what did they do ?
They did the same thing as the Indian had done for a living .
They 'd hunt .
You did n't have to go far to see a deer .
They were good shots too .
And sometimes they 'd trade for venison .
We took what venison we could trade and traded them for their crops .
They knew how to farm , you know .
They grew crops like turnips , carrots , onions , and everything .
And they fished !
Finns like fish !!!
They were full of smoked fish .
Yes , they like fish .
They ate any kind of fish .
They ate any fish they could get a hold of -- whitefish or anything .
They 're right there with their nets too .
We ate the same food , so we grew food , and hunted , and traded what we could with them .
We hunted , grew , or traded everything , and all we had to do was buy sugar ; but even then -- early on after the Finns arrived -- we still made most of our own sugar .
It was much easier to get along those days .
You had everything .
You had animals for stew .

The Finns like to work on their own .
They like to do their own contracting .
( 17 ) A Finn always thought that , well , things work better just taking a contract job rather than working for an hour wage .
He 'd take a contract of forty acres and he'd put up a little log cabin there .
He 'd chink it up with moss and everything .
It had a low roof .
He 'd get his own tools .
He stayed there all winter , and when he came out of that woods he had money coming .
Some of them spent that money too easy , but most counted every cent .

At Scott 's Landing , ( 21 ) they 're all Finns .
You know how they started ?
The frontier of Finns came .
And all they were after was work in the swampland .
You know what they cut ?
They cut posts , cedar posts , and poles .
They 'd peel them all too .

Scott 's and all the farms along the river ( 22 ) were solid timber -- cedar , cedar , cedar .
The Barnes ' farm ( 23 ) is one of them too .
That was all cedar swamp where Joe Barnes ' folks ' house is .
Besides the Finns cutting cedar in the swampland , the Norwegians and Swedes were on high land cutting the Norway pine and white pine with a two - man cross - cut saw .
Nobody bothered the cedar until the Finns came .
The Finns did n't handle the Norway and white pine .
They were making good on the cedar , and the Norwegians and Swedes went into the gI - po - a ( 24 ) for the white pine and Norway .
There the Norwegians and Swedes were making good money on good timber .

They made pretty fair money , because they knew how to sharpen their tools by hand and everything .
Mostly they used a one - man cedar saw -- a wide one with one handle on it -- and an axe .
All they had to do was knock down the cedar , cut it up , trim it , and pile it -- and they were good at that .
And the timber and the ties they cut were just like they were planed with a planer -- some of them .
And they piled them up and got them right out of the woods .
They did n't leave anything in the woods .

As they cleared the land , they were planting at the same time , so they still got their crop while they were working on clearing the land .
That 's what they figured .
Along the edges of swamps there is black muck and they cultivated that first .
They chopped up the sod and planted crops at the edge of swamps .
It does n't take much of a piece of ground to raise a big crop .
They grew big cabbages -- big cabbages -- for sauerkraut .
They grew all kinds of stuff -- carrots . . . big son - of - a- guns .
" How can you do it ? " I asked one of them when I first saw that .
He said , " You gotta take care of 'em on the start .
When they get their foothold they grow later on by themselves . "
Some places the Indians used to plant around the stump .
They put in their garden while they were killing the roots , younger trees , and young shoots coming up .
So when they worked on the land they still got a crop too .
And then after a while , in the spring , the Finns started breaking a bigger piece of ground .
They broke so much ground every year .
The more you worked on the land the more crops you 'd get and the more land would get cleared .
Even if you just used a grub hoe to cut the roots and everything , eventually you got the land cleared -- after so many years .
Finally their piece of land became large enough so they could cultivate it with a horse and plow .

Hoh !
They would clear out forty acres , sometimes two or three forty - acres .
They worked ' till dark !
They were glad to be settlers and have a home .
They built log cabins and everything like that .
Then they got a one - horse plow , a lot of them .
Boy they made big farms out of that swampland !
They 'd work it , and they 'd go in the sauna and wash up .
I think they 're hard workers .
They were hard workers !
So that 's what improved the land .
But even after they improved it , it was still rough swamp .
That 's the frontier of our country .
They were the frontier of the country , you might as well say .
They cleared up a lot of land , and they planted good gardens .
They 're hard workers .
They 're fit for any job , as a hard laborer .
They do a good , a wonderful job .
The Finns did great work .
Oh , they 'll work !
At five o'clock in the morning they 're out there , and they 're there until six at night .
When it was dark you could still see them working out there .
They worked ten hours a day -- a good ten .
Sometimes some of them worked twelve hours .
If you were working for somebody else -- in those days -- you had to work ten hours to get any money on account .
That 's what learned us how to work -- most of us .
We compare what we 're doing with the whites -- ' specially the Finns .
So we are learning from the Finns as we go along , and also from the other newcomers .
Of course , a lot of the other newcomers I met I did n't know were Finns .
But anyhow , I got along good with the Finns .
I figured that they should know what they 're bringing in because they knew how to get across from the Old Country in the first place .
I talked to many of them .
" How did you come across ? "
" Well , by working my way through , on the boats , handling freight . "
" What did you come for ?
Why did you come ? "
" Ah , we want to live on a piece of land , and the country , the soil and everything , is good .
The climate is good .
So I think we could do better here , especially by working together . "
" OK . "
" How we going to work together ? " I 'd say .
" Well , we 'll build a farm .
We 'll build cabins and everything .
And if you need any money for anything , the Federal Government will pay for that for you .
The Government will give you a few dollars to help you build a cabin , but you have to furnish the timber . "
There was a time when these swamplands were let out by the Federal government as homesteads .
White people were taking homesteads in our area about 1912 -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 1912 , because I heard at the time when I came back from Tower School that they were letting out homesteads .
To get a homestead you had to improve that land .
Then -- after so many years of working on that land and making improvements -- you could file for a private ownership and the land was yours .
( 27 ) They 'd give you papers and tell you what to do at the State or County office , or wherever the offices were .
That 's when I saw a lot of Finns come into this area .
Some of the Finns first came to clear‑ify their plantations .
What I mean clear‑ify is that they came to get the proof of how much work they put in on a piece of land , certifying how much ground they cleared in order to get a provement ( 28 ) to go ahead and live there , to go ahead and put a station -- a camp -- on there .
Later -- after they had their provement -- they built log houses on their piece of land .

The government figured this swampland was worth ten cents an acre as it was , so by clearing it up they could get more money out of it through taxes .
These swamplands would cost the government more than ten cents an acre to have it cleared for the state or county .
The government found out it would be much cheaper to let a man take the land over for so many years , make improvements , and after they improved it the government would let the outsiders file for the land with improvements .
Then the State got tax money on the improved land , and they ended up -- eventually -- with more money than the original value of the land .
Most of the high land -- with the white pine and the Norway -- was federal land .
( 29 ) The Forestry administrates that land through reforestation .
And that was ceded land -- ceded a long time ago by treaties .
That 's Federal -- mostly Federal -- but some of it 's still tribal lands .
We had tribal lands there too .
We still do .
Anyway , now - a - days that high land most generally belongs to the tribe or the Federal government .
In this area the government gave the homesteads that I 'm talking about in the swamplands .

And we had individual lands -- " allotments " -- and the government gave us enough timber with those lands to cut and build log cabins and everything .
Some of the land that was given to individuals as allotments was tribal land .
A 160 acres of land was promised to the Indians , but a lot of them only got 40 or 80 acres for individual ownership .
But many of those individuals that got an allotment did n't do anything with it within twenty years , and it went back to the tribe , or it was sold off to white buyers , or it went to the State for taxes .
But the ceded land was for the settlers to improve as homesteads .
After they improved it , they were legalized to get a fee patent .
But they had to show that they lived there and that they improved the land .
By making use of that land and staying on it , they got an improvement .
I think -- according to the rules and regulations -- you have to show that you 're making a living off of that land that 's allotted to you .
Well , those who made the improvements got results , and they'd hear at the land office , " How many acres ? "

And the land was theirs .
Some Finns settled that way , and by improving a homestead they got a piece of land to live on .
But some of them already had a family waiting for them in the Old Country ( 30 ) and they figured on getting their family over here and getting a place -- a better place -- to live without waiting so long .
So maybe they bought that forty instead of homesteading for the full five years .
( 31 ) See , they got the land cheap after being there just a short time .
And they knew that if it 's no good , then the government will buy it back from you .
I think they paid low because it was just growing up to quack grass .
After they took the cream out of the land ( 32 ) there was nothing there .
See , much of the soil was so light that it would have to be fertilized .
But with some of the low land you could go for many years without fertilizing .
Either way , the Finns got the best deal -- but they worked hard for it too .
That 's the answer there .
People often ask me , " What do the Indians think of all the Finlanders and everybody else coming and taking their land ? "
Well , some of them did n't just take the land .
We had to give it to them .
Well , you might as well say , we approved that .
The land was mostly worthless swamp and everything .
And they did n't take away any of the tribal land that we still had left at that time -- about 1910 , ' 12 .
Boy they were workers !
That 's why we learned lots from the Finnish .
I like the Finnish .
They 're hardy workers .
They 're the only people -- one of the only people -- who have done right with the United States .
They paid up what they owed Uncle Sam for World War II .
And they did right by paying this country up .
They 're not afraid to work .
They 're not afraid to pay for anything because they 're active .
They 're husky .
They 're workers .
They have a good mind .
In 1912 there were about one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine . . . about fifteen Finns in our area -- Deer River and Ball Club included .
There were about fifteen or twenty Finns ; ya .
They came pushing in .
They were welcome ; ya .
They work !
The first houses these Finns built were little log cabins -- just built of logs .
If they were going to have a home there permanently and build a farm there , they would make the houses better .
But for temporary housing , for the first little houses -- the first building -- they just had a little log cabin with a lean - to roof .
They did n't waste any of the first material they had .
No .
But they still built good homes .
The Finns did lots for us .
I believe in them .
I know lots of them .
For the main house they'd get logs according to the size of the building they needed .
If they had two in the family -- him and his wife -- they 'd have a small house .
If they had three or four , they got logs for a big house .
The log houses were about twelve by fourteen feet , and they had pitched roofs .

When they build their houses they put the logs together by notching them at the corners .
They build them by putting a notch right towards the end , and then they 'd build a notch on the next one .
Then they 'd roll that log in the notch .
That stands there !
You can't move those logs .
The more weight you have on there , the more solid that is .
They 'd build a barn the same way , and they 'd chink it up with moss .
That made good plastering .
Moss makes good chink .
Later on we all used plaster .
But before , we always used moss .

The planks were put on the corners to hold the walls together without building with a notch .
( 35 ) When you build these log houses down on the ground like that , you can do it much faster .
You have pickaroons now - a - days and you can line the logs up any way you want to .
You line up the logs and cut them off to come out even .
Then you can take a level plank and where it hits the logs you can tap it so the logs line up good , then you start spiking .
Get four sides done , then raise it up .
That 's the way they built , later on .

The Finns used cedar saws -- those a one - man saws -- to build their house .
They always had sharp axes and then -- later on -- they got bow saws .
They had sharp axes ; yea !
They were n't broad - axes .
Broad - axes were made for big buildings .
They were not always very big guys , the Finns , but could they ever throw a broad - axe !
Quite a few of them buildings had birch bark roofs .
Yea .
You could get birch bark in about four - foot strips those days .
You just put them on top for waterproofing .
But to hold heat you needed something else .
For that , they used cedar shakers on the roof .
You know what a shaker is ?
Like they use on a roof ?
They split the cedar to make shingles .
The shingles were about two feet long .
They 'd put them on so as to lap on one another .
That cedar 'll hold heat .
Straw roofs hold heat good too .
Some of the Finn barns had straw roofs .
The more straw you put on , the warmer the barns are .
They shed water too .
They 're made so they shed water .
After each tier they laid a big pole , longwise across the roof -- not a very big pole , one about four inches across -- and they tied each tier of straw on there so that water would drain off .
That 's where the pressure comes down .
That weight -- that pressure -- keeps the straw in place .
They also had straw roofs on houses -- if they wanted .
But the houses usually had shaker roofs .

Here and there you still see their log cabins and other buildings .
The Finns showed us how to build log cabins too .
This happened just about right after they began to build up their own places .
The Finns were logging and there were just a few of them at first , but after they started getting a little bit of a farm built up , then more started to come .
When I first took note of the Finns coming into our area , sometime around 1912 , there were n't many families .
There were only a few .
The wives mostly did not come along with the men .
The wives came later .
Some Finns came with their wives , but most of the wives hung back in the Old Country .
See , the ones that hung back wanted to know how these other Finns made it once they got here .
And the ones that made it , they showed the other Finns how to do it .
See ?
That 's the best part of that .
That 's a natural way of life .
I do n't know how many different families came right around 1912 .
It all depends on the area you 're talking about .
They were shipped all over the northern part of Minnesota .
At first they just had a whole load of men
Finns here to seek a job -- to find out how the job would be , and how this country would be .
They had to be here by themselves .
Later on they got money enough to send for their wives .
In later years , after these on the frontier wrote back on how they liked it , more Finns arrived .
In later years -- about five , six years later -- the other Finns commenced to show up .
About 1918 they started to build up .
Yea , and then their wives came .
The wives came about 1919 ; yea .
So when the wives came the men had the cabins ready for them .
And , of course , the little sauna houses .
About 1920 I began to see more Finn families .
Just in the Deer River area -- just in the Deer River , Ball Club , Leech - Mississippi area -- there were one , two , three , four , five -- about six , seven families .
Yea .
There was n't much relation to one another of those six or seven families at first , but then -- at that time -- you never knew who wanted to come next .
When the Finns came in about 1917 and 1918 they were not always related to the Finns that came earlier .
There might be one or two new families who were related .
But it all depended on what city , what division of Finland they came from -- north , or east , or west .
If they were living close together in Finland that was all right , but , when they came here it did n't make any difference if they were related .
If they knew the language , they got along together .
The language makes it so that you 're related to the nationality .
They all worked together when they got here .
They work together and hung together .
One family to another they told one another how they made it .
It was n't the family relationship at all that was important to them .
( 38 ) No .
The nationality was important , at least for the natives of the Old Country .
When the families started coming in they came in here as Finns and as nationals of the Finn nation .
They knew they were related as a people .
A Finn knows and understands his language , the language they use in Finland .
When you understand the language of the people , you 're related to them .
Regardless if he 's a Finn or not , he 's still related because he can understand the language .
Those first six or seven families stuck pretty close together , even though they were n't relations .
Most of the Finns were only a couple at first , but finally -- maybe -- they had a boy and girl .
There were also intermarriages later on .
All across the country they began to have these basket socials , and dances in a private home .
Well , in that way they associated , and so they knew one another .
Finally , some of them engaged and got married .
That 's the way they started to multiply , to help the father - in - law . ( 39 )
The boy helped the father - in - law and the girl helped the mother - in - law .
So that 's the way it went , because the old people were getting old .
In 1917 , I know one family that got up to six or seven kids -- six or seven -- but they were Dutchmen .
( 40 ) Well , they called them " Dutchmen , " but they were n't really Dutchmens .
I think they were Germans .
Later on some of the Finns would have six or seven too -- sometimes eight .
They figure on their children for the future .
Their children work right alongside of the folks .
The children look after the cows , milk the cows , and make butter with father or with the mother .
The children were always working around the barnyards .
They helped cleaning the barn and cutting hay .
And when the old man hired a couple of monthly guys ( 41 ) to help with clearing land , they just stayed in his house right with the family .
Children were working on farms a lot , especially afterwards when they got a team of horses .
In my earlier days -- before my mom married Jack Nason -- we did n't have working horses , and we only even saw one here and there .
( 42 ) But one time -- before I left for the Tower Minnesota School ( 43 ) --
I saw an old Finn going in to see my grandfather at Bena . ( 44 ) He said to us , " I 've got a team of ponies over there .
Go get them .
I 'll leave the harness on .
Go get them and haul yourself wood .
You do n't have to go far from here for wood .
Instead of packing it in by straps , ( 45 ) use that team .
Uh uh , you do n't have to use those straps anymore . "
" Well , how much you gonna charge us ? " my folks asked .
" Nahthing .
You just come and use them like they were your horses . "
" Ya ; I 'll feed 'em and give 'em plenty of water . "
" As long as they 're not abused , you can use them . "
" OK . "
Yep , the Finns helped us lots like that , right from the beginning .
The Finns like horses .
They talk common sense to them .
But they did n't always have horses either .
No. But . . . they had oxen .
Yea !
Oh boy , these oxen were the frontier of the horse , ( 46 ) you know !
Boy , they carry a load , those things , with just a stick around their shoulders and a pull - pole hooked onto the sled or wagon !
Later on they had tugs .
Everybody laughed when they used a horse collar upside down to fit the ox .
Ya , they used a horse collar upside down .

Some new Finn families came in 1918 and in the early ' 20's .
One . . . two . . . three . . . four -- four or five new Finn families came about 1918 -- and there were a lot of business people who came then .
Two of those four or five families were business men .
They came with education , and they started a business here .
( 48 )
Andrew Hannula came and started a - hiring .
Andrew Hannula also came about 1918 .
Andrew Hannula had a big . . . he had a grocery store .
He 's Finnish .
One other business man also came then , but . . . well . . . that 's farming again .
I forgot his name .
He was on highway number six .
He had a big barn , a big farm and everything .
. . .
These farms kept growing up .
A farm would keep growing until it looked like a business place .
They were so clean about it .
It was hard for them to start , but by keeping a - working they found a way to make 'er .

When they raised chickens , they got a setting hen .
They used the eggs and the chickens , and . . . the chickens came to multiply on that farm for improvement to their living .
They knew what to do .
They would multiply everything they had to eat on for the winter .
They did this with vegetables and everything .
If they 'd end up with 75 or 50 chickens they thought they were doing pretty good .
These young chickens , as they grew , became eat‑able .
Then they graded the chickens down to the hens .
( 49 ) They killed the roosters and cooked the roosters as meat , to make stew and everything .
That helped them too .
They kept all the female cattle too , and kept one bull .
They knew that !
Incubators came later on , and they used them , but they did n't understand how to keep the number of chickens up with the incubators .
They did n't have many turkeys because they figured the chickens alone would eat them out of the farm , because they 're eating all the time .
They had very few turkeys .
Of course , there were prewestern turkeys .
( 50 ) But tame turkeys are better where there 's more open country .
The turkeys and the birds around here do n't get along together .
We had owls and hawks and everything .
An owl could sit on a tree , and from there he could grab quite a few of those turkeys .
What helped the chickens in this area was that there were a lot of grasshoppers and a lot of insects and worms they could pick by scratching around .
That helped them uphold their feeding , upholding their power to carry themselves around and cluck .
But the Finns gave them feed every morning too .
Besides the chickens , they had the couple pigs -- around 1917 .
And , as I said , most generally they 'd start off with two , three cows .
Later on they got five , six head ; yea .
They always built a barn for their cows .
In the first stage it would always depend on their herd .
If they bought two cows -- or whatever they had -- they each generally had a stall in the barn .
If they had a stall , it was generally a double stall , made of poles -- inside the barn .
But those poles were well - trimmed up .
The cows stood alongside the horse .
Maybe they were partitioned off a little bit with a pine log -- so they would n't disturb one another at feeding time .
A horse might kick too , you know .
But anyhow , the cows and the horse got along after they knew one another good , after they got used to one another .
And chickens were well - denned up too , and kept warm .

When a Finn built the barn he figured that the barn was going to be built because he had cows that were going to have a calf , so he made a room for them -- a stall or calf pen -- in the barn .
He always counted on the milking cows that were " coming in " -- that were going to be milked .
( 51 ) In 1917 -- when one of the Finns built a barn for ten cows -- he would likely have only four , five , or six cows .
Most generally he had five -- or four , five , six .
You know , cows multiply fast .
But while he was building , there were times when most of the Finns lived on the meat and butchered some cows , or traded for whatever they could get .
He graded the cows , he graded the bulls , he graded to keep what he wanted .
That eased the expenses of feeding them through the winter .
Early on , the Finnish family would generally have two , three , four , five , six cows .
Later on -- in the ' 20s -- they 'd regularly have about eight milking cows -- most of them .
If it was a big place they would have a few more .
But it would have to be a big farm to have fifteen or twenty head .
But even if they only had five or six , they were rich -- in 1917 -- because they got a lot of rich cream from those cows .
They sent their cream to Deer River .
There was a Deer River creamery -- later on .
We even sold cream there . ( 52 ) I sold a lot of cream there myself .

Occasionally Finns sold things for money and a lot of them did well by spending that money carefully !
In 1917 most of the Finns would sell something .
They did n't spend time in town anywhere , and always wore overalls and worked .
Working always was the only thing they seemed to do .
If they were n't doing logging work -- and even if they had nothing else to do -- they always had something to work on .
They built log cabins and milk houses , and coolers .
How much of their money would be made from their farm -- in 1917 - ' 18 -- all depended on the expenses and on the output -- including what it cost to help their farm family and everything .
I do n't think they made any more than ten or fifteen dollars a month -- but another ten or fifteen dollars was utilized to add more buildings and improve the farm , and for feed and everything .
That was clear money , the ten or fifteen dollars a month .
But then automatically that money was reserved and accounted for later on .
Every cent was counted for their living .
They 'd slip it back into the running of their farm during the dead part of the season , when there was a slowdown .
So . . . the money slips back again to pay the expenses . . . .
. . .
In fact , to tell the truth about it , I do n't believe there was any money in that farming !
Just a good living .
There you are !
That 's the answer to everything .
That 's the way the people ran it , and that was a hardship for the poor .
Feed was n't too high . . . but oats , feed for the cattle , or bran , still cost money .
Feed -- the oats and everything -- was 90 cents at that time . ( 54 ) Maybe it was 80 cents or something like that .
If they had a pig , that was another 90 cents .
Altogether , feed would cost them about six dollars , eight dollars , a month -- if they had a pig . . . but they 'd also have to feed the pig milk ( 55 ) with some vegetation off of the garden .
They would throw some garden vegetation in the pig pen . ( 56 ) And this money had to come from the profit they had saved up .
That 's what I meant to say before : the money keeps slipping back into expenses .
They made money all right , but when they had slow days come -- that was in the summer -- they did n't have enough to spend on much but expenses .
In the winter you could go in the woods and make money , but you could n't do that in the summer . ( 57 )

There were some sheep , them days .
They had a pretty good size sheep ranch up along Leech River .
Flemming had a big herd .
Sheep came in and killed all the brush .
They had sheep here too , closer to our place on the Mississippi .
( 58 ) The Finns had three or four sheep -- something to work on , a few , that 's all .
There was n't much goats .
The Finns did n't have time for goats .
But some farmers sooner or later got to be modern and they had some extra cash , so they got guineas ( 59 ) -- some of them .
When there 's a hawk around , the guineas will make a lot of noise .
They 're ready to battle , so the hawk kept away .
That guinea cost a little more than other birds , but he kept other birds alive .
See ?
How those guineas would make noise when they saw a hawk come !
Maybe they had them -- one or two guineas -- but they did n't have too many because the guineas were pretty good on the market .
Everybody wanted a guinea to watch the farm .
If a stranger came in there they 'd make noise .
They make a lot of noise for any stranger .
For human beings , or dogs , or wolves , or anything , they 'd make a lot of noise , and the farmer then knew , " there 's a stranger in here . "
They had dogs .
The Finns had dogs , mostly cattle dogs -- big . . . big dogs .
Some of them had duck dogs , like a rattail water spaniel .
They used them for hunting -- to hunt ducks .
Some of them finally got tame ducks up here .
The Finns did n't have much time for ducks because there were plenty of wild ones .
They did n't care for what they already had in this country .
They raised what they did n't have , like guineas .
Guineas were good , they did the job , and they were utilized .
Now speaking of later years , George Scott had a big farm .
Now that 's turned over to the State .
He was a big farmer .
George Scott had horses and cattle , and he always had a hired man to take care of them because he was on the road all the time .
Earlier on he had a big hotel up at Mud Lake .
( 60 ) The hotel had tables and everything in there for the hunters -- duck hunters .
It cost him money to get food , and he did n't make very much for the food they ate .
The other two or three white people that came in to our area right around 1918 always labored out , sometimes on road work .
Road work was a big outfit in those days .
Timber work was a big outfit too .
They got pretty good pay -- for those days -- but they did n't get much money for that -- and the work was hard .
They 'd work ten hours a day and they 'd go to bed tired out .
They did the same thing over and over .
The money was short in those days too .
It was hard to get a dollar when you were working for fifty cents a day .

Anywhere the Finns wanted to , they could apply for a job .
They were eligible for anything .
In those days we had unemployment , and those that wanted to work had to show what they knew about the work , about the job they applied for -- carpenter helper , or carpenter , and all that stuff .
But Finns were mostly loggers and farmers .
When the Finns worked for somebody else they did n't go away for long periods to work .
They did n't go except just for the day .
They had a job to come home to every night .
They had to tend to the animals .
I 've seen them in the barn with lanterns , taking care of their stock .
Boy they were hard workers .
I 'll tell you , they always were working on something .
They did n't dress up much .
Usually they just wore overalls .
And the women -- the Finnish women -- they were helping !
They 'd dress like a man !
I tell you the women were good workers !
Yea .
And they were strong as a bull .
And I could hear them talking Finn .
Other nationalities from other foreign countries came in and worked also .
And a lot of these people helped anybody .
It did n't make any difference who they were .
There were Polish too .
I did n't notice the Polish until later .
Later -- about 1920 -- I looked around .
There were other groups moving in -- like the Polish .
I was out amongst the Polish .
They 're hard workers too .
In our area the Polish were more or less on the railroad .
The railroad was trying to pull through from Grand Rapids .
( 61 ) The Polish were working in Grand Rapids .
In our area that 's the only means of summer labor they had .

They have a beautiful church made of stone , with a stone from old Warsaw in it .
When I saw that church I started thinking , " That 's a Polish church . . . that Catholic church is Polish there . "
There were also other people there in Dakota -- grain farmers -- who could n't make money out of their farm because the value of the crops was so low .
In Dakota -- when you read about the first settlements -- you read about how these farmers also went through in groups .
The Polish came in and helped clear fields for these farmers .
They were working there in the summer , and after summer was over they 'd go home and work .
I looked at the Polish and how they work in the fields .
They were making things go at both places .
It did n't take them long to find the channel of good living .
A lot of Polish are hard workers .
Polish are hard workers and they balance their food pretty particular .
They eat fruit and stuff like that -- stuff that 's good for you .
I talked to them .
And they 're all husky .
They 're good workers .
They 're very careful .
It looks to me like they seem to be like how they live in Warsaw of the Old Country .
It looks to me like regardless whether they 're Polish or not -- or in whatever area they used to live -- they 're living here as a community .
( 63 ) At least that 's the way it looked to me .
Regardless of the nationality , when people come in this area they 're ready to work .
Other nationalities also came into the same area .
They had farms too .
They go along the same .
One works hard and the other wants to work just as hard .
That 's the way it makes for a betterment .
They brighten up their home , and others want a home like it .
They go along and pretty soon the group , the area , is a settlement .
Then we all begin to think .
" Why are there better homes here ?
Why are there nice clean lawns , like a park and everything ? "
They did n't get that by sitting around .
They worked .
They got up in the morning and went to bed late .
They worked !
That 's how they advance .
They had money enough to put away .
They realized they were getting somewhere .
They were not discouraged .
They just labored .
They were satisfied .
When you work , you 're satisfied .
When you accomplish a day 's work , there 's balance to your living .
That 's what I learned from the Finns and the Polish in my early days , and I 'm glad I did .
I think it 's too late to learn that at my age .
Never wait !
Start right when you 're young .
Start right when you 're young because you just have one chance .
When you go through that chance -- if you make good from the beginning -- it 'll be better in the end .
That 's good .
I think the Finns improved the area .
They worked hard , just the same as the Polish .
They believe in hard work .
They had to support themselves .
But they figured . . . well . . . that the Indian could get by because the Indian had a voice .
They figured the Federal Government had to work with the voices of the tribe , otherwise the Indians would put in a big claim against them .
But this claim was held down by the government feeding the Indians .
The Indian wanted help , yep , because they did n't know how to build things .
But that 's all the Indian wanted .
Later on in years they learned lots of things from the Finns and Polish .
I feel that through their experience of life the Finns and Polish taught us how to do things .
They share in with others .
And we share in with them .
And they started to learn some things from us too .
Sometimes we talk about " Finn‑dians . "
That 's just a joke .
That 's the way we pointed out to them that the way they acted , the way they lived , was getting to be like the Indians .
The Indians are thinking , " All these ' Finn‑dians ' showed that they want to be like an Indian . "
That 's why I call them , and everybody else called them -- somebody , in spots , would call them -- " Finn‑dians . "
The Finns are the next people following behind Indians . ( 64 ) And they dress like Indians , with bands around their heads .
Well , that proves that they like the style of America .
They were very interested in this country and interested in getting along with the Indians .
But they do better work than the Indian because they 're working all the time .
I told the Finns in the early days , " I think you 'll have power later on to do things in the best way , in your free way of doing things .
I kind of feel that you 're shy‑ed ( 65 ) because you feel you 're in a bunch and that the Indian might kick on you . "
" Ah un . "
" The Indians do n't want to bother you .
You always had a good place , a nice place , with everything you wanted -- a garden crop , chickens , and anything . "
I do n't think we ever had trouble with Finns .
They were very much like Indians .
They love the Indian way of life .
A lot of them told me , " We heard in our country that you need help , and we come to help you .
If any Congressmen goes against your resolutions we 're going to shove resolutions in our council to adjust that .
You and I will work together , as a person .
So that 's why we 're here .
You . . . you can't help it that you were n't educated .
We have a little experience and maybe we can help . "
They still help me to this day .
They tell me , " I 'm going to help you .
You 're getting to be an old man , grandpa .
Anybody that bothers you gets us mad , Old Indian . " ( 66 )
" No , I never get in trouble . "
I 'm satisfied the way they showed us how to live , as a friend .
They used to use knives in fighting years ago .
But they 're more satisfied now .
They 're more . . .
I do n't know . . . they 're more . . .
I think they'd like to figure on the next day to live with their wives and with their kids .
So now when there is trouble going on they walk out .
That 's the best .
Yep .
They just walk out when they sense trouble -- in later times .
They do n't bother us .
We do n't bother them .
I think they 're nice people to get along with .
I think we got along with Finns .
I still have some old Finn friends .
Go ask any of them , " You know Buffalo ? "
" Why is he still kicking ? "
" Yea . "
I 'm going on seventy - six years old .
I 'm busy all the time .
I never stay home .
Some days I take off to go the seven miles to Ball Club .
I never have to walk because somebody always gives me a ride .
First thing they do when they see me on the road is stop , because I 'm well - known too much .
They are always ready to give us a hand .
They 're nice hard - working people .
So the Finns are going to stay here -- and they 're multiplying to beat sixty of a kind !
Gee !!!
We get along good with them .
I said to them years ago , " Some day you wo n't hear about Indians .
Some day the Indian 's going to be as white as you are .
Intermarriage is going to cause that .
They 'll have a lot of chances to meet one another , regardless of the creed , color , race .
The boys are going to marry the Finn girls , and the Finn girls are going to marry Indians .
Regardless who they are , they contact one another and they discuss what to them is a good way of living .
Years ago it was n't long before the Finns and Indians began to marry .
You have to be careful what you say now .
A guy may be partly Finn , partly a white person -- and look like a Finn -- but he 's an Indian all right .
He 's on the reservation enrollment .
Be careful when you 're talking about the Indian , because if he does n't like that , you 're going to be caught outside . ( 67 )

3. See Ch. 25 , " ' Self - Houses , ' Sweat Houses , and Blood - taking . "
4. Neither Finns nor Indians used their sweatbath structures for any other purpose .
5 . Paul says he saw a Finn once before leaving for school in 1909 ( for the 1909 - 1910 school year ) .
Cf. , Ch. 35 , " Boarding School Days . "
6 . Most of the initial group of Finns moved into the area while Paul was at Tower Indian Boarding School , from 1909 ( for the 1909 - 1910 school year ) to spring of 1912 ( at the end of the 1911 - 1912 school year ) .
Cf. , Ch. 35 , " Boarding School Days , " and Rottsolk ( 1960 , pp. 42-45 ) : " Most of the land in Itasca County was not homesteaded until after 1900 .
. . .
The last large amount of public land was offered for homesteading in 1910 .
This was land formerly part of the Chippewa reservation , mostly in Morse , Oteneagen , Sand Lake and Bowstring Townships .
The land had originally been classified as pine land but was reclassified as agricultural land .
. . .
Very likely the first homesteader [ around Deer River ] was August A. Chase ; he settled on the shore of Chase 's Lake in 1889 .
. . .
August Chase did not file a claim for his land until 1892 and did not receive the patent for it until the following year . "
Rottsolk lists the names of the individuals included in Itasca County the 1905 Minnesota State Census ( 1960 , pp. 135-147 ) .
7. Finnish use of the sauna was much more frequent and regular than the occasional medicinal / ceremonial use of the sweatbath practiced by Anishinabe .
Hence the suggestion to make a sweathouse of lumber , rather than with saplings and a temporary cover of canvas or birch bark .
8 . Sawed lumber is flat lumber boards , as opposed to whole logs .
Cf. Ch. 38 , " Timber Days . "
9 . With log structures you need to periodically chink the spaces between the logs .

They worked in the woods cutting trees on a piecework or per -" stick " basis .
17 .
They liked to contract with someone to cut a given area , rather than to work for someone else on an hourly basis for wages ; or , alternately , they liked to " piece cut " on a per - " stick " basis .
18 . If they wanted to work for somebody else as a wage laborer or piece cutter rather than get a contract to log an area basically as an independent contractor , they would sign on with a Finnish logging camp .
19 .
That is , the Finns wanted to work by themselves as a group , not necessarily alone as individuals .

24 . Here Paul is mimicking of the Finnish pronunciation of " [ The ] Chippewa , " refering to the Chippewa National Forest .
25 .
By working together cooperatively the Finns " got a voice " and began to have influence on what was happening in the area .
26 .
In this manner of working and clearing the land they got title to their homesteads .
The various " Homestead Acts " that gave away Indian lands to independent non-Indian farmers generally required that the settlers , homesteaders , occupy the land for five years and show evidence that they had made improvements during that time of occupancy .
27 . " Individuals could homestead from 40 to 160 acres .
Anyone who made such a homestead claim had to live on the land the better part of a year , erect buildings and clear enough ground for gardens to support a family .
After fourteen months he could buy the land at $ 1.25 an acre .
Or , he could live on the land five years , but not over seven years , and obtain the land free .
Two witnesses were required to ascertain that he had lived off the land as he claimed . "

Paul uses the term " Old Country " when talking about Finns at this particular time in history in part because Finland did not become independent from Russia until 1917 .
31 . As Rottsolk ( 1960 , p. 43 ) suggests , in Itasca County at least , homesteaders had the option to buy the land at $ 1.25 an acre after fourteen months , rather than wait the full five to seven years to get the improved land free .
See also footnote # 27 .
32 . At that time and place the " cream of the land " was the timber .
33 .
The log houses at that time did n't have basements or slabs .
They put the log house on cedar blocks .
See discussion in text that follows .
34 . Earlier on they notched the ends of the logs and let the ends hang out beyond the notch .
With the later method they cut the logs to size , and fitted the logs of a wall between " two - by - six " planks , spiked them on , and stood the side section up .
35 .
The wall sections were put up without notching the logs individually ( and fitting them together at right angles ) .
36 .
The house rests on about fourteen blocks to a half ( i.e , along one end and one side ) , plus some in the center if it had a wooden floor .
37 .
The houses often had cedar shakes on the roofs .
38 . From Paul Buffalo's point of view this is a bit of a curiosity , since , for him , the family -- the patrilineage which extended back to the beginning of the world through the dodaim ( totem ) groups -- was of primary importance .
The idea that geographic identity could take precedence over family identity was , to Paul , a bit unusual .
Interestingly enough , as the following passages show , he clearly understood the importance of language in defining relationships and memberships .
39 .
Paul Buffalo's people traditionally practiced bride service , wherein , for a time after marriage , the newly - wed couple lived with the bride 's folks and helped them out .
This compensated , in part , for the ultimate economic loss of the daughter to her family .
Here Paul is suggesting that the Finns also practiced this , and even extended it so that the girl helped her mother - in - law .
Paul 's people very much liked the Finns , in part because they saw in them many of their own traits .

42 . Paul here is talking about working horses .
Early on , and in Paul 's younger days , there were small herds of wild horses in northern Minnesota .

51 . Cows that are " coming in " ( or are " coming in fresh , " or are " freshening " ) are milking cows who give birth and their milk production is beginning .
After " freshening " the the cow is known as a " wet " cow ( as opposed to a " dry " non-milking cow ) .
Regular milk production starts about forty - eight hours after the birth of a calf .
For a short time a dairy calf might be allowed to suckle colostrum , initial milk with high - density nutrients and antibodies , but the calf is then usually separated from the mother and put into the " calf pen " so that humans can make use of the milk .
Paul 's family , and others with milking cows , often then " separated " the cream from the milk and sold the cream to a small local creamery in Deer River for a little cash income .
52 . As mentioned above , later on Paul 's family sold cream at the Deer River Creamery .
Cf. , Ch. 43 , " Cattle , Horses , ' Siouxs . ' "
53 .
In 1965 the national average replacement cost for a dairy cow was about $ 200 ; it would probably be less than that in the northern Minnesota market ( Progressive Dairyman , 2014 , 23 August 2018 ) .
54 .
Feed in those days typically was a mix of things ; hence it is difficult to know exactly what the " ninety cents " was for .
When Paul lived at the Leech - Mississippi Forks , and later when he lived with his wife in Bena , he had experience feeding animals , so his estimate is likely to be related to those experiences , but adjusted for the costs in earlier years .
Given the amount of though he devotes to being accurate , it is likely to be a close estimate .

61 . Paul is referring to the extension of the railroad from Grand Rapids to Cass Lake , begun in 1899 - 1900 ( Cf. , U.S. National Park Service , 2005 ) .
In 1899 the town of Deer River was " moved out of the swamp to the point where the M. & R. [ Railroad ] crossed the Great Northern [ Railroad ] . . . " ( Rottsolk , 1960 , pp. 45 - 46 ) .

Last week , at the suggestion of Jonathan Rosenbaum on his must - read blog , I watched the 1953 curio The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T , perhaps best known as the only live - action feature from the mind of Dr. Seuss .
The film , produced after Seuss ' earlier cinematic success with documentaries like Design for Death but years before his breakout success with The Cat In the Hat , Green Eggs and Ham , or How the Grinch Stole Christmas , is ostensibly a children 's musical , and the involvement of legendary producer / director Stanley Kramer makes it clear that the studio , Columbia Pictures , thought they were investing in a bankable film .
Yet Seuss , who wrote the screenplay , story , and most of the song lyrics , created a nightmarish , claustrophobic fantasy ripe with unsettling WWII undertones and overt references to the era 's nuclear anxieties .
The film 's strange balance of gigantic , elaborate Technicolor scenery and generally small dramatic scale ( the entire story involves four characters and takes place in one building ) only heightens our uneasiness .
Bart Collins ( Tommy Reitig , a little boy who looks uncannily like the Seussian pre-adolescents in Grinch or McElligot 's Pool ) is a ten - year - old whose mother forces him to take piano lessons with the villainous Dr. Terwilliker ( played by Baltimore native Hans Conreid ) .
After a brief expository opening scene — where we learn that Bart 's father has died and his mother wishes that the plumber , Mr. Zabladowski , would provide a little male guidance to the boy — Bart falls asleep at the piano , and the rest of the movie , like a boy 's version of The Wizard of Oz or the 1951 Disney Alice in Wonderland , plays out in his dreams .
Here , Dr. T runs a musical institute for young boys , where he 's busy constructing a gigantic two - tiered piano where he will soon force 500 boys to simultaneously play his song " Ten Happy Fingers " ad nauseum .
He 's also holding Bart 's mother , Heloise , under a spell , and employing Zadbladowksi as the institute 's plumber .
The campus itself is recognizably Seussian and dreamlike , although with a distinct influence of German Expressionist films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari .
5000 Fingers may be too dark and slow for younger children to enjoy , though a number of hilarious song - and - dance numbers enliven the proceedings throughout .
There are also innumerable insinutations of still - fresh Nazi terror , from Dr. T's goosesteps ( contrasted by Zabladowski 's literally blue - collar earthiness ) to the scene when hundreds of boys are signed in to the institute and herded through to the site of their ceaseless labor .
Bart 's final rebellion against Dr. T , " Music - Fix , " is an invention that sucks sound from the air , though it eventually " turns atomic " and explodes the entire institute , including the boys inside , whereupon his nightmare ends .
Children from later generations may not relate to the film 's nuclear fears , just as kids in 1953 ( and 1958 , when the film was rereleased as Crazy Music ) might have found it a little much to handle .
Naturally , 5000 Fingers has acquired a modest cult following since its initial release and commercial failure , though it 's still under - seen , particularly since its influence on the foremost pop culture success of the last 20 years is undeniable .
As Bart 's name implies , The Simpsons abounds with references to Seuss ' musical , including the boy 's preferred toy : a slingshot .
At the Dr. T institute , all the boys are made to wear the signature hat , with an open palm and fingers that stick straight up , not unlike the Simpson children 's unique hair .
Dr. Terwilliker also seems plainly an influence on the character of Mr. Burns , from his fey , gesticulating hands to his exaggerated Mid-Atlanic accent .
This all seemed like pretty benign stuff to me until about two - thirds of the way through 5000 Fingers , when Dr. T suddenly explodes into song , a dark ditty about his wardrobe called " Do - Mi- Do Duds " :
The punning turns of phrase , swooshing closet doors , and sprightly evil of this number make it a nearly note - for - note forebear to one of The Simpsons ' best - known musical highlights :
Not convinced ?
Consider the full name of Bart Simpson 's nemesis , another villain with impeccable diction , a vaguely European accent , and a penchant for musical theater : Robert Underdunk Terwilliger .
Goldman
Sachs owns quite a lot of office property , the Observer , er , observes today .
And , as savvy financiers are wont to do , they also occasionally rent out things they do n’t actually own .
Like the property at 180 Maiden Lane , currently occupied by AIG , which recently sold its old headquarters at 70 Pine Street .
Back in June 2008 , just a few short months before the Great Crash of 2009 , AIG took over Goldman ’s lease in the glass building downtown .
It was what the pink paper called “ the largest lease transaction so far this year “ : 800,000 square feet , valued at around $ 215 per .
And should AIG have failed to pay their rent , guess who would have taken the fall ?
According to a conversation between Paul McDowell , the CEO of Caplease — which holds the lease for embattled property owner Joe Monian — and an analyst on the company ’s recent earnings call , that would be Goldman .
CRAIG MAILMAN : Okay .
All right .
Just switching topics , do you guys have any update on the 180 Maiden Lane loans ?
It sounded like the landlord was considering not servicing the debt anymore , from market reports .
PAUL MCDOWELL : That ’s not our understanding .
We do n’t particularly have much in the way of an update , other than we are expecting and have currently been modeling that that loan will likely extend …
CRAIG MAILMAN : Okay .
Then just going back to your second half ‘ 09 –
PAUL MCDOWELL : Actually , let me – I actually do want to make one other point there .
With respect to 180 Maiden Lane , it ’s important to remember their in - place leases are pretty long .
They run to 2014 , 2015 , with Goldman Sachs as the primary tenant .
So the cash flows at the property are stable .
It ’s just a question of the maturity of the loan .
CRAIG MAILMAN : Okay .
So Goldman ’s still on the hook if AIG were to vacate that space that they ’re subletting ?
We ’re not saying it ’s a conspiracy or anything .
After all , a little fancy math and that exposure totally rounds to zero .
CAPLEASE INC Earnings Conference Call ( Q2 2009 ) [ Yahoo Finance ]
Senator Tom Coburn is a physician who until recently still went home to Oklahoma to deliver babies .
He believes Congress should weigh the dangers of a nationalized health system much more seriously than it has .
In the tradition of someone using a 2x4 to win the attention of a mule , yesterday he successfully pressed the Senate Health Committee to approve his idea of requiring Members of Congress themselves to enroll in whatever " public plan " is passed to compete with private insurance companies .
" Let 's demonstrate leadership -- and confidence in the system -- by requiring that every member of Congress go into it , " Mr. Coburn told his colleagues as they were marking up the health care proposal championed by Senator Ted Kennedy .
His idea was n't exactly greeted warmly by many public plan supporters .
Senator Jeff Bingaman , a New Mexico Democrat , responded : " I do n't know why we should require ourselves to participate in a plan that no one else needs to participate in .
This bill goes to great lengths to show that the choice is there for everybody . "
But Mr. Coburn disagreed , saying his reading of the 1,000 - page health care bill convinced him that everyone would end up being forced into the public plan as private insurance carriers were squeezed out of the market by mandates and regulations .
Therefore , if Congress decides a government - run health plan is good enough for the American people , it should be willing to put itself under its care umbrella .
By a 12 to 11 margin , the Senate Health Committee agreed .
Senator Chris Dodd , the committee 's acting chairman , and Senator Kennedy were absent from the committee but sent in proxy votes in favor .
Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski was the only other Democrat to back the measure .
Every Republican save for New Hampshire 's Judd Gregg voted in favor of the Coburn mandate .
Obviously , many members of Congress -- who are used to a generous and flexible set of health benefits -- have no intention of letting the Coburn mandate become law .
They will undoubtedly try to strip it from the bill at some point , in a conference committee between the two houses if necessary .
But for now it is embedded in the bill and any overt attempt to remove it would be met with howls of public outrage .
Slightly more than one year ago — just before the utter collapse of the economy — John McCain stood on a podium at Wright State University , in Dayton , Ohio , to announce that his vice - presidential running mate would be Sarah Palin .
Three days later , as many Americans were returning home from their Labor Day barbecues and picnics , McCain ’s campaign announced that Palin ’s unwed 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , was five months pregnant .
In a statement released by the campaign , Sarah Palin and her husband , Todd , said that Bristol was planning to marry the child ’s father , her boyfriend of two and a half years , an 18 - year - old former hockey star from her hometown of Wasilla .
“ Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child , ” the statement read , “ which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family . ”
That young man , Levi Johnston , made his one and only campaign appearance later that week at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul .
But Johnston would remain with the Palin family throughout the campaign and eventually live full - time in their house , from the end of November until late January , when he and Bristol ended their relationship .
As both a frequent visitor to and temporary inhabitant of the Palin home , Johnston witnessed never - before - reported behavior from the woman who almost became vice president of the United States of America .
In this account , as told to editors at Vanity Fair , Johnston paints a vivid portrait of his time with the Palins .
He debunks commonly held notions about the closeness of their family ; Sarah ’s relationship with her husband , Todd ; the “ special love ” she showed her special - needs infant , Trig ; and even her self - professed prowess as a hunter and commitment as a hockey mom .
This is Levi ’s story .
I had been hunting sheep with my father and uncle for almost two weeks up in Delta Junction , about a six - hour drive from Wasilla .
When the hunt was over we got on our four - wheelers and began driving through the woods , mud , and swamp , for five hours , back to the highway for the trip home .
When we reached our truck , I looked at my cell phone — there ’s no reception in the mountains — and saw that I had about 100 missed calls from my girlfriend , Bristol Palin .
She was five months pregnant and I was wondering what the hell was going on .
“ You ’ve got to come down here , ” she said when I called her .
“ Hurry up .
Mom wants you to pack your bags .
The plane will be waiting to pick you up .
Mom ’s running for vice president . ”
“ I do n’t know if I want to go on this trip , ” I told her .
I ’m a country guy and I did n’t want to be involved with anything that would put me in front of thousands of people .
But after about five minutes of arguing this with Bristol , she handed the phone to her mom .
“ Levi , you ’re coming down here , ” Sarah Palin said , “ even if I have to pick you up . ”
Sarah ’s got a way of getting her way .
And at the time she was going to be my mother - in - law .
She would n’t give up , and I headed back to Wasilla .
The whole ride home I did n’t know what to think .
The Sarah I knew could carry her own and she was a hardworking lady .
She was the governor .
But was this really happening ?
I thought ,
Was this woman — who , at home , would literally say things that did not make sense — really running for vice president ?
The Palin house was much different from what many people expect of a normal family , even before she was nominated for vice president .
There was n’t much parenting in that house .
Sarah does n’t cook ,
Todd does n’t cook — the kids would do it all themselves : cook , clean , do the laundry , and get ready for school .
Most of the time Bristol , now 18 , would help her youngest sister , Piper , 8 , with her homework , and I ’d barbecue chicken or steak on the grill .
I only saw Sarah help Piper — the youngest before Trig — with homework a few times , and I ’ve only seen her read a book to her once .
I actually never saw Sarah reading much at all — once in a blue moon , I ’d see her reading a book , and I ’ve never seen her read a newspaper .
The Frontiersman and the Anchorage Daily News were always there in the morning , but the only one who looked through them was Todd .
“ We must prepare ourselves for waves of higher resource prices and periods of shortages unlike anything we have faced outside of wartime conditions .
In fact , I believe we are already several years into this painful transition but are still mostly invested in denying it . ”
Wow !
Who said this ?
Weirdo Freak ?
Eco Hippie ?
Doomer Dud ?
Nope .
Jeremy Grantham did in July 2009 .
For those of you who do n’t have millions under management with his firm , GMO , let me tell you a little about it :
GMO , founded in 1977 , is a privately held global investment management firm servicing clients in the corporate , public , endowment , and foundation marketplaces .
As of June 30 , 2009 , we managed $ 89 billion in client assets using a blend of traditional judgments with innovative quantitative methods to find undervalued securities and markets .
Mr. Grantham is the Chairman of the Board of GMO .

Getting Used to Lower Growth and Higher Prices – by Jeremy Grantham
As the economy sorts itself out from the recent financial turmoil , we are very likely to have lower growth rates for quite a few years .
We described the reasons for this last quarter : writing down excessive loans and curtailing expenditures as we realize we are not as rich as we thought .
Behind these two issues , however , lurks another longer term and more important factor affecting future growth , and that is the increasing limitations on resources : we are simply running out of everything at a dangerous rate .
We apparently have trouble processing numeric issues of this kind , and this missing faculty will cause considerable grief .
We do not understand the implications of exponential orcompound growth rates : the main implication being that they are impossible to sustain .
No better example of resource limitation in the face of both denial and strong efforts can be found than U.S. oil production .
As is well known , we have been on the steep downslope of production since 1974 despite our best attempts to “ Drill , baby , drill ! ”
The largest oil discovery in the Gulf in the last 20 years will keep our engines running for a mere 41 days .
Nothing we do can reverse the decline , and drilling our reserves faster has been described as “ oil independence through more rapid exhaustion of our reserves ! ”
Coal reserves of the highest quality – anthracite – are basically mined out everywhere , and the second choice – bituminous coal – has probably also passed its peak .
All attempts to maintain the growth of total hydrocarbon output must now depend on subbituminous coal , lignite ( which is a little bit better than burning rock , but not much ) , and tar sands , which are themselves increasingly energy - and water - intensive to exploit .
Modern agriculture has been described as a way of turning hydrocarbons into food .
Without cheap energy – a single gallon of gas is the energy equivalent of 100 hours of old fashioned labor – the world would certainly have trouble producing half of the current food supply , and that fraction could be substantially less .
Hydrocarbons are not only critical to farm equipment and food distribution over very large distances , but also play a dominant role in fertilizer production .
With sparse hydrocarbon usage , Americanagriculture would have to be totally and painfully restructured away from very large scale monoculture .
Hydrocarbons are very efficient in the use of manpower but surprisingly inefficient with everything else , including output per acre and output per unit of energy .
All metals are facing the same depletion problem as hydrocarbons .
Where 30 tons of copper ore once produced a ton of copper , it now takes 500 tons of ore !
And with every extra ton of ore required , the energy intensity also rises .
Several specialized metals critically important as catalysts are past their peak production .
Water resources , so necessary for agricultural growth , are under incredible economic pressure , and are simultaneously diminishing in absolute terms .
This would be a dangerous situation with zero population growth ; in fact it would guarantee that per capita growth would slow .
Yet population growth in the last century has been the fastest in the history of man .
The recent 100 - year growth exceeded that of any 2000 - year block in history .
And in terms of absolute numbers added , the world ’s population has increased 2.5 times in my lifetime , from 2.5 billion to 6.5 billion .
It should be obvious from simple arithmetic that populationgrowth is on a direct collision course with increasingly scarce resources .
For millennia , food constraints held the world ’s population nearly constant .
About 12,000 years ago , these constraints were altered significantly with the start of organized agriculture .
Then , around 200 years ago , the so - called Agricultural Revolution – the introductionof science to farming – allowed for another doubling in output .
All of this was dwarfed , however , by the harnessing of hydrocarbons – the sun ’s energy stored over hundreds of millions of years .
This remarkable patrimony is now about half gone , and sometime in the next 10 to 40 years , half of all of our resources will have been used or , stated another way , one last doubling will remain .
We are looking at the last of 14 doublings in the past 250 years .
We are , if you prefer , 13/14ths of the way through the game in exponential terms !
At 1 % growth in hydrocarbon consumption , which would be a dramatic reduction in the growth rates of the last 30 years , our reserves would lastfor merely one more generation .
As we move through our remarkable and irreplaceable hydrocarbon reserves , the price will , of course , rise remorselessly to ration supplies .
Hydrocarbons will increasingly be limited to their highest and best uses : ( probably ) petrochemical feed stocks and aviation fuels .
The price rise , which for a while is quite likely to be parabolic – rising at an increasing rate rather than a steady rate – will have an immediate effect on the price of all agricultural products .
Also affected will be the price of all metals , which too have become extremelyenergy - intensive , as has hydrocarbon production itself .
This transition away from carbon - based fuels could have been relatively painless on paper , but in real life our species has such a modest ability to deal with distant outcomes or to defer gratification that a bad ending is probably inevitable .
We need , it seems , the shock of a Pearl Harbor to really gear up and make sacrifices .
For the record , in 1977 President Carter pointed out that we were running out of oil and would need to make some “ sacrifices . ”
By “ sacrifices , ” by the way , he did not mean real wartime - like sacrifices , but merely a time of settling for a lower rate in the increase of wealth .
He noted quite accurately that in the 10 short years preceding 1977 , our planet ’s population had used as much oil as in its whole previous history !
( That is to say , it had doubled usage in10 years , or had grown at 7 % a year , which does n’t sound so Draconian but , of course , is . )
Carter urged us to fully insulate 80 % of our houses in 10 years and to continue President Ford ’s auto fuel economy initiatives ; following these recommendations would have actually freed us from the need to import any sensitive Middle Eastern oil !
As a famous symbol , he had solar panels installed on the White House roof .
Remarkably , this very un-American speech of his was well received by its audience but , unfortunately for him ( and probably for us also ) , very little else he did was .
Carter was dispatched by President Reagan , who was admirable in many other ways in my opinion , butapparently had psychological problems when dealing with limits .
In a display of brilliant politics and complete innumeracy , Reagan argued passionately and appealingly that the whole idea that our children were not entitled to a much richer life than their parents was un-American , sacrifice was unnecessary , Carter had overstated the case , and down came the solar panels .
Thus , our sole effort atdealing with some foresight with the iron laws of limits was brushed aside , and the particularly egregious age of SUVs and increasing dependence on oil imports was ushered in .
Well , dear readers , happy thoughts and wishful thinking do not make it so ; 30 precious years have passed , and there is now no safety margin .
We must prepare ourselves for waves of higher resource prices and periods of shortages unlike anything we have faced outside of wartime conditions .
In fact , I believe we are already several years into this painful transition but are still mostly invested in denying it .
Everything within the investment business will be affected as well as everything outside of the business .
GMO intends to make a sustained effort in this area to get ahead of the curve , and we will keep you posted .
As a parting note , let me point out that China is showing every sign of being a country ahead of the curve .
There has been a whiff of panic – which I believe is justified – in China ’s last 5 years of behavior regarding resource limitations and possible mitigation through truly dramatic increases in alternatives , desperate attempts at resource acquisitions , and the fostering of special foreign
relationships .
Being more authoritarian may come with great long - term advantages in this field .
It would be convenient if we could offset China ’s natural advantages with some of our own ; for example , flexibility , a vigorous venture capital industry , and , above all , an enlightened government policy .
A Carter - type statement of resolve would be a good start , and would show a willingness to take a short - term political hit in the interest of a significant long - term advantage .
I must confess to not holdingmy breath , but I am crossing my fingers .
Do not allow yourselves to be kidded by our usual optimism – this is the Real McCoy !
Have a good ( if worried ) summer !
Aug. 3 , 2009 -- Seven out of 10 U.S. children have too - low vitamin D levels , putting them at risk of heart disease , rickets , and weak bones .
Nearly one in 10 kids -- 7.6 million American children -- are actually deficient in vitamin D. Low vitamin D is risky , but vitamin D deficiency is a serious health threat in which the body begins to reabsorb calcium from the skeleton .
The new findings come in a study by Juhi Kumar , MD , MPH , of Montefiore Medical Center ; Michal Melamed , MD , of Albert Einstein College of Medicine ; and colleagues .
" We expected the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency would be high , but the magnitude of the problem nationwide was shocking , " Kumar says in a news release .
Rickets , a bone disease of infants caused by too little vitamin D , has been on the rise .
It 's not the first time : A U.S. epidemic of rickets at the end of the 1800s ended only when the U.S. fortified milk with vitamin D .
It 's now apparent that more must be done .
People get vitamin D from foods like milk and fish , but it 's hard to get enough from diet alone .
The body makes its own vitamin D , but only when a person gets at least 10 minutes of direct sunshine a day , before putting on sunscreen .
Most people need regular vitamin D supplements .
Indeed , the Kumar study found that children who took vitamin D supplements were least likely to have low vitamin D levels .
But only 4 % of kids get these supplements .
Some kids were at particularly high risk of low vitamin D levels :
Older children
Girls
African - American children
Mexican - American children
Obese children
Kids who drank milk less than once a week
Kids who spent more than four hours a day watching TV , playing video games , or using computers
Melamed noted that the widespread use of sunscreens keeps kids from getting vitamin D from sunlight .
" It would be a good idea for parents to turn off the TV and send their kids outside , " she says in the news release .
Just 15 to 20 minutes a day should be enough .
And unless they burn easily , do n't put sunscreen on them until they 've been out in the sun for 10 minutes , so they get the good stuff but not the sun damage . "
The Kumar study is an analysis of data gathered in the 2001 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) of a nationally representative sample of 6,275 children aged 1 to 21 .
It is a vital part of owning a property to keep it properly maintained and that includes taking care of the guttering and the roof .
These parts of the structure are an important defense against the weather and their condition also impact on the value of the property when it comes to selling .
If you ignore your roof you can run into issues caused by damp like damage and mold .
This can lead to leaks and damage inside the home too .
Usually we do not think of calling in a roofing contractor until we see the result of damage already happening but you do not have to wait for damaged or missing tiles or a hole in the ceiling before you find a roofing contractor .
There are other services too that can help you ensure your roof stays tight and weather proof over the years , and can help you avoid larger and more expensive repairs .
They can assess your roof to see if it will be fine through the next winter , look at entry points like the flashing to check for water damage and make sure your warm air is not getting out , clean gutters to ensure the water is flowing away and not back onto the roof , inspect the tiles for damage , check the mortar for cracks and so on .
They can also help ensure you have the right roofing materials for the structure and the climate it is in .
Roof Type and the Roofing Materials Used
The most usual type of roof used is pitched .
The pitch is a measurement of the steepness of the roof , and that steepness will affect how fast the water and so on runs off the roof .
Most roofs of this type measure between 4/12 and 8/12 in pitch , under that is very shallow and may not shed water , and over it is too steep to stand on when repairs are needed .
A pitch of 1/12 or under is called a flat roof .
The roofing material most often used on pitch roofs are composition shingles but there are other options that can work such as slate , wood shingles , metal , slate and more .
Flat roofs with a low to no pitch where water does not run off do not tend to have traditional roofing materials used on them .
For a while they were covered in flat seamed soldered metal and tar and gravel but in the last two decades other roofing types have been developed using materials like modified bitumen , plastic and rubber .
The most common one used is modified bitumen which is manmade and combines bitumen ( asphalt ) with chemicals to extend its life .
These chemicals are either elastifiers , which are added to ensure the asphalt is kept flexible , and then there are UV blockers , which are added to ensure the sun ’s UV light does not damage it .
Modified bitumen comes in large rolls that can be positioned on the roof and then melted together to form one sheet that covers the whole roof .
While tar and gravel are still used in some situations , modified bitumen is far more popular as it is not just more effective it is also cheaper .
Understanding Roofing Materials
Since the first days of man part of his activities have been trying to create a barrier between himself and the elements and to create a warm , dry and safe place to live .
At first he used materials he had close to him , mud , grass , wood , rocks .
Roofing today is not that different in principle to those basic times apart from the complexity of the materials .
In fact slate , one of the best materials to use today for your roof as been around and used especially in Europe as roofing for hundreds of years .
You can also still find homes with simple fired clay tiles , or wood shingles .
When you consider asphalt tar it has been refined into a composition shingle that is the most popular roofing material used in America today .
All materials will have some advantages and disadvantages .
Choosing the right material from the many roofing materials for you is about considering those strength and weaknesses in terms of the conditions you live in , your needs and your budget .
Composition shingles
Most commonly the least expensive shingle is used with a 20 year warranty and it is known as the 3 tab shingle or the strip shingle .
You can get a variety of types , warranties and colors though .
The second most popular is the dimensional shingle with a 30 year warranty which is also called an architectural shingle or laminated shingle .
This one differs from the 20 year warranty shingle in being heavier , thicker and was made to like wood shingles .
You can get laminated shingles with 40 and 50 year warranties too , each a little thicker than the last but otherwise the same in terms of looks .
When you look at all composition shingle roofs , around 95 % of them use laminated and strip shingles .
There are other options though such as hail resistant shingles and other specialty shingles .
3 tab composition shingles
AS said the most commonly used shingle in the US with a 20 year warranty .
They are popular mostly because they are inexpensive , they are easy to install and there is a wide choice in color .
However they do have a shorter life than other options , they are quite plain in terms of appearance and if your roof has any variation in placing these 5 ” x 12 ” rectangles it can look obvious when the pattern has to adjust or be altered .
Laminated shingles
They are made in a similar fashion to the strip or 3 tab shingle but an extra layer of material is laminated on after being cut in a saw tooth pattern .
Laminated shingles are therefore a little thicker and last longer .
Different variations on that saw - toothed pattern can give a nicer varied appearance almost thatch like , and it does not have the issue of having to be a perfect repeating pattern .
Another attribute of this option is it is better at hiding any imperfections in the roof deck .
You can get 30 , 40 or 50 year versions too so can get a longer lasting more durable shingle .
Hail resistant shingles
You can get 3 tab and laminated styles of hail resistant shingles with the 3 tab style having a 30 year warranty and the laminated style having a 50 year warranty .
When you look at them they do not seem to be different from the regular kind above , but they are made with modified bitumen a special asphalt that has 2 chemical modifiers added called UV blockers and elastifiers .
Specialty shingles
While these only make up 2 to 3 per cent of the market for composition shingles there are still a large range to look at .
Some are made to look like slate , some like wood grain , some are heavy and thick , some have multiple layers of laminate and some are even coated in copper .
Tile
In the Southwest and Texas the most commonly used roofing material is tile .
You have two basic groups , clay tile and concrete tile .
Concrete is more commonly used as it is very durable and it is cheaper .
Clay is more durable but costs more .
There are a large number of styles , colors and brands for concrete tiles but these are variations of three types , the small barrel , large barrel and flat .
There is a fourth version a few companies make called a bar .
If you are looking for the villa style tiled roof look that would be the large barrel tile .
The Mediterranean style tile is the small barrel .
The flat tile has two types , the shake tile with a textured surface and the slate tile with a smooth surface .
The colors are mostly created by baking on a glaze .
The colors that are more natural though are often produced by taking the concrete and dyeing it .
These are also called color - through tiles .
Some people opt for this rather than the glaze option because the more natural options tend to stand the weathering a lot better and will not change appearance so much over the years .

Tokyomango : Summary of Joi and Lisa ’s session about Japanese obsessions at Foo Camp
Joi Ito and Lisa Katayama are two of the most influential voices on Japanese culture for a global audience , but I was a bit troubled by some of their analysis of otaku for the O’Reilly Foo Camp .
In trying to explain the obsessiveness of otaku culture , they were quick to whip out “ cultural explanations ” — Zen Buddhism , the Tokugawa caste system , and ukiyo -e .
Apparently Japan , despite massive social changes over a thousand years , has somehow retained the same “ spirit ” over time , which oddly manifests not in the middle of society , but in its strangest marginal outcast subcultures .
The danger of using the blunt “ culture ” explanations , however , is that it neglects to look at the actual and specific mechanisms which maintain or change culture .
In most cases , these mechanisms are political or economic , and values shift according to structural situations .
And most importantly , those within the system are often actively fighting against it .
For example :
For generations , people have been taught to be happy perfecting their role in society , without necessarily viewing social or financial gain as a measurement of their success — it ’s the shokunin culture in which focusing on one job allows one to obsess with abandon until they reach perfection on a very local level .
During the Tokugawa era , the rigid class system attempted to keep society stable by dividing society into four classes ( five if you count the burakumin ) .
At the bottom of society , however , the merchants actively worked against the system by pushing further and further with financial success .
And you can make a case that this uneven financial gain of those at the bottom of the caste system led to the system ’s downfall .
Furthermore , when this class system was abolished in the Meiji Restoration , there was a huge rush of farmer ’s and merchant ’s sons successfully increasing their station in life — despite some kind of eternal Japanese “ taboo ” against this .
In other words , there is no straight line of social stratification from the 17th to 21st century , and plenty of people have fought against the pre-determination of social class .
The real question , which these issues do little in addressing , is why otaku in particular tend to go to extremes of perfection .
Surely there are cultural factors at work , but this kind of behavior is almost universal for subcultural units : in which participants tend to push further and further within accepted codes in order to show dedication to the group .
There were surely British mods in the ’60s who were identical to otaku in their obsession with mastering their subcultural language of fashion signifiers .
Some factors of Japanese culture make this more extreme , but there must be something about the unique social position of the otaku — and their birth in the high consumer years of a mature post - industrial capitalist economy — that serves as the best explanation .
Lisa mentioned that , when she was interviewing people for her 2D love story in the NY Times magazine , several sources likened the ability to fall in love with a body pillow to the Buddhist practice of mindfulness training .
I am sure if I openly loved an inanimate object , I too would be desperate to justify that love with some kind of ancient Japanese spirituality .
I am not sure , however , that we are supposed to take this self - diagnosis seriously .
Is there a way to demonstrate a path between these Buddhist values and a fringe sexual subculture ?
How did the pillow - humper access these Zen Buddhist principles ?
Are they just in the “ ether ” of Japanese society ?
Then why does n’t everyone hump pillows ?
Again , the question about the otaku is less about their adherence to Japanese values , but their reason for anti-social and mostly frowned - upon behavior .
But this one bothered me the most :
While young Japanese people might have the outward appearance of rebellion , the majority follow a certain set of social rules .
They will probably wait in line to get on the train just like any other good citizen .
For example , Joi once bumped into a guy wearing a button that said “ fuck off and die . ”
The guy promptly bowed , apologized , and walked away .
Note that the button did not say “ Fuck Off and Die ” in Japanese .
And Joi did not run into a yankii guys who told him 「 死ね!」 .
The fact that the button was in English explains everything .
Now , I am sure the guy wearing the button generally understood the meaning of the statement , but we have to think about the actual mechanics of foreign culture importation in Japan .
Punk culture — from which the button ’s attitude comes — came to Japan explicitly through consumerist mass media in the late ’ 70s and early ’ 80s , mostly marketed to and read by the upper middle classes .
This process automatically tends to purge the signifier of its original meanings and turn it into pure “ fashion . ”
The media in which the message was spread in general does not spread or advocate a real “ punk ” view of society .
Punk kids — whether in the UK or US “ punk ” mold — have always been primarily drawn from the consumer classes , and this consumer activity is correlated with higher placement in the social ladder .
This ironically means that punk attitude has a real social risk for those most likely to buy punk fashion .
Japan ’s real punks — the yankii , the bosozoku — are not a part of this consumerist world and embrace a “ punk ” attitude as part of their lifestyle .
They would not bow to you if you accidentally bumped them .
So the reason that “ rebellious - looking ” teens follow the set rules is because they have imported a “ rebellious ” look as a look .
Otherwise , their values are aligned with other members of middle - class society .
This explanation that “ punks are really polite , ” however , only accounts for middle class teens .
Working - class delinquent teens , who are not officially パンク 系 but are punks in the broadest sense , are less likely to follow social rules .
I do n’t mean to suggest that nothing in Japan can be explained by cultural heritage , but there are always enough exceptions and breaks in the straight timeline to warrant closer scrutiny .
Furthermore , Japanese people themselves tend to use cultural tradition as a way to justify their own actions .
This is basically true everywhere in the world .
In the U.S. , conservatives and liberals constantly fight over who has the most accurate interpretation of the Constitution and the Founding Father ’s values .
It ’s officially our job to not take culturalist claims at face value , or at least , to discover the engines and pathways that make culture continue throughout time .
Some of the otaku ’s behavior is very Japanese .
But in the end , they probably have little or nothing to do with Zen Buddhism .
White House green jobs czar Van Jones has been accused of being a communist , an old lecture video showed him calling Republicans a** holes , and he 's been connected to a 9/11 conspiracy group .
GOP czar revolt scores its first win
Republicans who have spent months criticizing the proliferation of “ czars ” in the Obama White House have finally landed a major punch .
Over the past few weeks ,
White House green jobs czar Van Jones has been accused of being a communist , an old lecture video showed him calling Republicans a —holes , and he ’s been connected to a Sept. 11 conspiracy group .

With that type of paper trail , Jones , who resigned early Sunday morning , would have trouble surviving a Senate confirmation .
But while public pressure forced him out — in a statement , Jones accused his critics of a " vicious smear campaign " — his czar status meant the White House skipped that step when it appointed him :
Many of the high - level White House policy advisers do n’t require Senate confirmation for their posts .
And while liberals have hailed Jones as a pioneer in the green jobs movement , critics have labeled him a radical — and he ’s become a liability for a White House that does n’t need another distraction .
Republicans began calling for his resignation on Friday , and asked for a public hearing into how Jones slipped past the White House vetting process .
And White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Friday avoided addressing the Jones controversy directly , referring reporters back to a Jones statement apologizing for his affiliation with the Sept. 11 " truthers . "
The Jones debacle shows how czars — dozens of powerful problem solvers tapped to tackle some of the thorniest problems facing the country — could continue to cause problems for the White House .
By some counts , the Obama administration has about 30 czars — a term used as shorthand for long , wonky titles such as Jones ’s “ Council on Environmental Quality 's special adviser for green jobs . ”
To be sure , every president in recent history has had his own czars : President George H.W. Bush appointed the first drug czar , President George W. Bush had a homeland security czar and Hillary Clinton promised to create a “ poverty czar ” if she won the presidency .
But with so many more czars than previous administrations , the Obama White House faces greater potential for controversy .
And the Van Jones case has clearly hit a nerve .
His affiliation with a 1990s group called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement has opened him to accusations that he associated with Communists .
And in 2004 he allowed his name to be put on a letter requesting an investigation into whether the Bush administration allowed 9/11 to happen as a “ pre-text to war . ”
Jones said Thursday he never believed in this so - called “ Truther ” movement , issued an apology for his past remarks , and said in a statement that his involvement with 9/11 conspiracy theories " does not reflect my views now or ever . "
Republicans and a handful of Democrats have called on the White House to review and suspend its use of czars .
“ In the wake of these recent revelations , the president should suspend any further appointments of so - called czars until Congress has an opportunity to examine the background and responsibilities of these individuals and to determine the constitutionality of such appointments , ” said Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , Chairman of the House Republican Conference , who called on Jones to resign .
The czar - attacks have begun to catch fire far beyond the Beltway .
In town hall meetings across the country this August , questioners slammed the administration ’s advisers , claiming that they allowed the White House to wield unchecked power .
It ’s an argument that ’s been fed by Republicans in Congress , who see an opening to attack the credibility of the popular administration .
In an Arizona town hall meeting last week , Republican Sen. John McCain joked that Obama , “ has more czars than the Romanovs ” — a laugh line he frequently uses .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calls the czars , “ administrative chaos . ”
Conservatives argue that the czars are the administration ’s way of pushing a big government agenda — without Congress getting in the way .
And each whiff of controversy , they believe , helps them prove their point .
Conservative pundits are on a czar hunt , combing records for politically dangerous statements made by the policy advisers .
Michelle Malkin has manufactured trading cards adorned with images of some of the White House officials .
FOX News Channel 's Glenn
Beck runs a regular segment on his radio show called “ know your czars . ”
Beck and Sean Hannity of Fox News have hammered Jones for weeks about his statements , fueling the controversy surrounding his background .
While czar ’s controversial backgrounds can open the White House to attacks , experts also warn that too many czars in the room can lead to internal problems .
So much overlapping authority can spark turf wars between Senate - confirmed officials and politically powerful czars , distracting them from the very high - profile issues the advisers are supposed to solve .
“ The problem is people do n’t know who ’s in charge , ” said George Mason University professor Jim Pfiffer .
“ And there ’s going to be more tensions because there are more czars . ”
The Obama administration goes out of its way to avoid referring to its policy advisers as “ czars , ” a nickname they say is bestowed by the media — preferring titles like assistant , director , or special master .
But even they , occasionally , drop the c-word .
“ Our new director of our office of — I always forget the full name of this — I call it the Drug Czar , ” Obama said , introducing Gil Kerlikowske at a July roundtable on urban policy .
Kerlikowske ’s full title is director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Czars are not a new part of White House life : President Lyndon B. Johnson tasked a series of White House advisers to look back at various aspects of World War II .
Conservative William Bennett was President George H.W. Bush 's first drug czar , appointed in 1989 .
But the number of czars in the Obama administration , say historians , is unprecedented .
“ There just seems to be a few more in the Obama administration , ” said University of Vermont professor John Burke , an authority on presidential transitions .
“ And they are using them particularly as a vehicle for their early policy initiatives . ”
There ’s a bailout czar , a technology czar , a climate czar , an urban czar , and a health care czar .
The pay czar is evaluating compensation packages for investment banks .
The border czar is working to curb the violence and drug trafficking on the U.S. - Mexico border .
The WMD czar is working on non-proliferation issues .
The Great Lakes czar is overseeing clean up of the lakes .
Even Obama jokes about his fleet of policy advisers .
“ ABC is planning a series called ' Dancing with the Czars , ' " he said at the Radio and Television Correspondents ' Association dinner in June .
Czars generally lack the huge budgets and staffs of a Cabinet agency .
But they have something even more valuable in power - obsessed Washington : the ear and message of the president .
Earlier this year , Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) criticized the administration ’s use of czars as a power grab by the executive branch .
“ The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances , ” wrote Byrd .
“ At the worst , White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate confirmed officials . ”
Experts do n’t see the lack of congressional oversight as particularly problematic , arguing that czars have limited legal authority that largely restricts them to simply relaying White House wishes .
The lack of real executive and budgetary power , for example , plagued Tom Ridge , who served as homeland security czar during the early years of the George W. Bush administration .
Ridge had access to Bush but did n’t have the money or staff to have a strong influence on policy .
Eventually he became a Senate - confirmed Cabinet secretary when the Department of Homeland Security was created .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s gay community was rocked on Sunday by the killing of two people in a homosexual and lesbian youth center and the possibility they fell victim to a hate crime in the Jewish state ’s most freewheeling city .
“ The biggest shock is to think that it happened in Tel Aviv , which is the most tolerant city in the country , ” said Avi Sofer , a gay rights activist .
Witnesses said a masked gunman clad in black opened fire on Saturday night in a basement club belonging to the Tel Aviv Gay and Lesbian Association , which was hosting a weekly event for teenage gays .
The attacker killed a 26 - year - old man and a 16 - year - old girl and wounded 13 people before fleeing , hospital officials said .
“ He simply fired all over the place , ” Or Gil , 16 , told the YNet news website .
“ At first I thought it was prank , or a toy gun .
After the killings , it was quiet , completely silent and then people came to help the wounded . ”
Police said they were still searching for the attacker and that the shooting was not an anti-Israeli attack by a Palestinian but gave no other details , citing a court order banning publication of details of the investigation .
Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said the motive for the shooting was still unclear .
If the incident proves to be a hate crime , it will mark the most serious attack against the gay community in Israel ’s history .
Condemning what he called a “ horrific killing , ” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet : “ We are a tolerant , democratic country governed by the rule of law and we must respect each and every person . ”
GAY PRIDE
Although coastal , cosmopolitan Tel Aviv has a bustling gay scene , open homosexuality is less welcome in conservative areas .
Annual gay pride parades in Jerusalem meet with often violent protests from ultra-Orthodox Jews , who view homosexuality as an abomination against God .
Four years ago , an ultra-Orthodox Jew stabbed three parade participants in Jerusalem .
They survived .
The attacker is serving a 12 - year prison term .

Nitzan Horowitz , an openly gay legislator , said he had no doubt there was a connection between the latest killings and what he termed incitement against the gay community in Israel .
“ We demand that the government put an end to this hate campaign and that the Education Ministry institute proper information and education at schools in order to prevent the recurrence of such shameful events , ” Horowitz said .
Despite anti-gay sentiments among some religious Jews in Israel , gays serve openly in the military .
Israel accords same - sex couples a measure of legal recognition and cohabitation rights , though Orthodox religious authorities control formal nuptials in the country .

An 18 - year - old woman , who gave her name only as Alona , said she ran outside at the sound of gunfire .
“ Because this is a very open - minded city , there ’s a place for us ( to meet ) , ” she said of the youth club .
“ But there are also those who do n’t like us . ”
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Asa
Hill was 7 years old when he died .
Although the boy was pulled out of a burning car alive in a horrific accident on the Niagara Thruway on Thursday , his injuries proved critical , and he passed away the following night .
Amilcar Hill and Rahwa Ghirmatzion hug at their son's funeral , which ended with their wedding .
The Buffalo , New York , community , shaken , turned out in large numbers at his funeral Monday to support his parents , Amilcar Hill and Rahwa Ghirmatzion , and were pleasantly surprised when the couple ended the service with a wedding ceremony , a fulfillment of their son 's wish .
The Rev. Joel Miller of The Unitarian Universalist Church of Elmwood , where the service was held , was unsure at first when the idea of a wedding was proposed by the couple and their family .
" I asked twice , ' We 're doing a wedding ? '
This was new for me .
I never did a funeral service and a wedding ceremony at the same time , and normally would n't , but they have known each other since they were teens , " Miller said .
" And they had been providing for Asa , and they made a home together for all of Asa 's life .
...
It was clear they were following through on something they had been talking about for some time . "
Watch the funeral and wedding ceremony »
Hill and Ghirmatzion have been best friends since they were 15 and have been together for almost half of their lives .
After Asa was born , marriage had always been something that they considered but , according to Hill , both felt that a wedding was " superficial and not necessary . "
Asa , however , was insistent that they make their union official .
" Asa really wanted us to do it , and every time he would ask us we would say , ' Yes , we 'll get married , ' " said Hill .
But the couple never did get around to figuring out the logistics for a ceremony .
While holding his lifeless son in his arms at the hospital , Hill was moved to finally officially propose to his lifelong partner .
" Rahwa was overwhelmed at that moment and just looked at me .
When the family sat down to plan the funeral service , she said ' Let 's get married . '
And everyone broke down at the table , " he said .
The marriage took place after a service filled with African drums , dancing , sermons and family and friends sharing memories of Asa , all in celebration of his life .
Miller said about 1,100 people attended the service , with hundreds overflowing onto the church lawn , where sound systems were set up so they could hear the service .
When the wedding was announced , there were shocked cheers and applause from those in the church pews .
" We wanted it to be a surprise , " Hill said .
" We knew it would be a joyous moment .
You could see how it lifted them , and we figured , why not make it a surprise at the end . "
The Unitarian Universalist Church was chosen because its non-denominational tradition would welcome all the diverse groups of the Elmwood community , Hill said .
The family has strong ties to the community and , according to Miller , who had known Asa since he was 5 , Asa embodied this .
" He was a powerful presence : direct , smart , and had a way of bringing people together , " Miller said .
" When you met him , you knew you met someone .
We all did n't know each other , but we knew Asa and his family . "

There are three things in baseball that are a reliable source for laughter .
1. Mr. Met .
2 . A player getting hit in the groin .
3. Mr. Met getting hit in the groin .
Oh sure , at first we grimace and turn away when we see someone hit in the toolbox , but once the player gets out of the fetal position and stops vomiting , that grimace almost always turns into a grin .
Not that getting hit in the Chicken McNuggets is a comic device strictly limited to baseball .
It is the single most reliable gag in movie comedies , challenged only by someone farting .
Which brings up an obvious question :
Why does something that we all know hurts so damn much make us laugh so often ?
I ask this because Seattle Mariners third baseman Adrian Beltre took a hard - hit grounder in the frank ' n ' beans last week .
Beltre does not wear a protective cup and suffered a severe contusion in the right testicle -- feel free to wince -- that put him on the disabled list and may knock him out for the season .
And yet when Beltre 's teammates saw the play , they could n't help but laugh .
" I feel bad for him , but it was funny , " Ken Griffey Jr. said .
" You laugh after you found out he was OK .
While he 's still on the ground rolling around , it 's like , ' Awwwww . '
But once we found out he was OK ?
It became funny . "
Here 's the thing , though .
After the Mariners later found out the injury actually was fairly serious , Griffey says they still laughed : " Because we knew he was going to be OK .
It might take him a little longer , but he was going to be able to lead a normal life . "
Even manager Don Wakamatsu chuckled when describing the seriousness of Beltre 's injury to reporters the next day .
And remember , this was not only a manager on the fringe of a wild - card race who just lost his third baseman for a month or more , but also a former catcher who was hit in the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe many times , including so hard once that it broke his cup ( he missed several games after that one ) .
Asked why we laugh when a player takes one in the Lower House of Parliament , Wakamatsu replied , " Location , location , location . "
Screenwriter Ken Levine wrote for " M * A * S*H , " " Cheers , " " Frasier " and " Wings , " so he knows comedy .
He has also done play - by - play for the Mariners , Orioles and Padres ( he currently hosts " Dodger Talk " ) , so he knows baseball , too .
" Here 's what 's odd , " Levine said .
" Usually , in movies , we are allowed to laugh because we know it 's fake .
We can enjoy the indignity of some poor sap taking a spill or getting hit in the ' Beltre . '
But his teammates had to know this was real .
So I do n't quite understand why they were laughing . "
Well , it goes back to what Levine says is an adage about physical comedy .
It 's only funny when it happens to someone else .
In other words , if you can't draw humor from someone else getting hit in the Urologists Wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame , from where can you draw humor ?
As Wakamatsu says , " I think people can relate to how painful it is and are grateful that , ' It did n't happen to me . ' "
OK .
That makes sense .
But here 's the question you 're all probably wondering :
Why was n't Beltre wearing a cup ?
After all , cups are so important they are usually required when you 're in Little League .
( That requirement put me in the awkward position , as a 17 - year - old coach , of having to explain to a 12 - year - old girl why she needed to wear a cup .
On the one hand , I do n't think I explained it very well .
On the other hand , at least I did n't get arrested . )
Anyway , apparently there was no such cup requirement when Beltre was growing up in the Dominican Republic , which may explain why so many great infielders come out of that country -- there is strong incentive to develop good hands .
When he signed with the Dodgers and started playing pro ball here , Beltre 's team told him to wear a cup , but doing so felt uncomfortable to him .
I can understand that .
Wearing a cup can be uncomfortable .
It 's why we so often see players adjusting themselves down there as if they were Michael Jackson rehearsing a video shoot .
Of course , sometimes it gets out of hand ( Julio Lugo ) and you wish the guy would just get a cup that fits .
Anyway , in a desire for comfort , Beltre tossed aside the cup and went commando .
He figured that if he could get by without a cup on the crappy , bad - hop amateur infields in the Dominican Republic , he would n't need one on the well - groomed professional infields here .
And he did n't .
Until last week .
" He might wear one now , " Derek Jeter said .
Jeter always wears a cup and assumes most players do , as well , but he does n't know for sure about that because " it 's not really a question I ask . "
Well , I did ask some players before Sunday 's Yankees - Mariners game , and I got a full range of answers ( as well as some odd looks ) .
Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia says he does n't wear a cup , nor does Seattle pitcher Ryan Rowland - Smith , even though he once saw a catcher get hit there so badly that the player went into shock and needed an ambulance , paramedics , an oxygen tank and , eventually , ultrasound .
( On a positive note , Rowland - Smith says the nurse performing the ultrasound on his teammate was very attractive . )
After Beltre got hit in the Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau , Mariners rookie pitcher Luke French decided to wear a cup his next start .
He put it on while warming up in the bullpen but took it off because it felt uncomfortable .
He says he 'll continue to wear a cup while warming up until he becomes comfortable enough to wear it in a game .
( No doubt , he 'll cross his fingers until then . )
Mariners third baseman Jack Hannahan says he would " feel naked " playing without a cup , while catcher Rob Johnson says he would never go behind the plate without one .
" I have one son , and my wife and I want to have more kids .
So I do n't want to take any risk , especially knowing how much it hurts . "
Griffey , on the other hand , says he does n't wear a cup in the outfield .
" If I get hit in the [ Insert Your Favorite Euphemism Here ] from 300 feet , I deserve it . "
BOX - SCORE LINE OF THE WEEK
Dodgers starter Randy Wolf finished a triple short of the cycle , which is a bit like finishing an ace , king and queen of diamonds short of a royal flush .
But it 's still pretty good for a pitcher .
Meanwhile , Detroit's Ryan Raburn , filling in at third base so Brandon Inge could rest his sore knee , made three errors in one game .
But this week 's award goes neither to an individual player nor to a team , but to the Angels and the Orioles for the amazing line they combined for on Sunday .
Baseball fans and writers love to say that you can go to a game on any given day and see something you 've never seen before .
This was certainly true when you could look up at the out - of - town scoreboard and see this line :
Angels : 301 201 100 000 9 -- 17
Orioles : 002 220 011 000 -- 8
Yes , a team held a nine - run lead in the 13th inning of a game .
According to Elias , there had only been three previous games that went that long and were decided by that many runs -- in 1919 , 1933 and 1933 .
None of those games ended 17 - 8 , so it 's probably safe to say that fans who saw that score on the board Sunday were indeed seeing something for the first time in major league history .

• There are already suggestions for repairing baseball 's draft in the wake of the Stephen Strasburg signing , but here 's a better idea : Just get rid of it .
The original point of the draft was to hold down signing bonuses , but it no longer does that .
It also does n't mean the poorer teams will sign the best players available .
And obviously , it also unfairly impedes a player 's right to freely choose an employer .
Would stopping the draft benefit the richest teams by allowing them to sign the best players ?
That 's certainly the prevailing belief , but I 'm not so sure .
Yes , they will sign some of the best players , but they can't sign anywhere near all of them , even if they could accurately project each player 's future career .
Which they would n't .
Despite all the scouting , most prospects flop -- a whole lot can go wrong on the way to the majors -- so teams would also be throwing away a whole lot of money on what likely would turn out to be very expensive , very bad investments .
Think of it this way -- the more money the richest teams spend on players who never reach the majors , the less money they can spend on players who are in the majors .
• Griffey was Seattle center fielder Franklin Gutierrez 's hero when he was a kid and Junior gave him a great complement recently after watching him chase down a fly ball into the gap .
" Man , " Griffey told him , " you 're amazing . "
He is .
I 've covered Griffey , Kirby Puckett , Torii Hunter and Mike Cameron , and Gutierrez covers as much ground as any of them and more than several ( his ultimate zone rating is 17.9 ) .
He is also developing as a hitter .
• It does n't seem possible that Jeter has been around long enough to have more hits than any shortstop in major league history but he does .
Jeter set the record for most hits by a shortstop Sunday , passing Luis Aparicio 's total of 2,674 .
" It 's kind of hard to believe , " Jeter acknowledged .
" I just try to be consistent from year to year and if you do that , good things happen . "
Right behind Jeter is Omar Vizquel , who had 2,669 as a shortstop as of this weekend .
By the way , Jeter is currently third in the American League in Baseball Prospectus ' VORP statistic .
Are people touting the wrong Yankee as New York 's top MVP candidate ?
Is Jeter ( gulp ) underrated this season ?
The AL leader in VORP and the Off Base MVP , meanwhile , is Joe Mauer , who hit his 24th and 25th home runs Tuesday and raised his league - leading average to .383 .
According to Elias , the last four American Leaguers to have 25 home runs with an average of .380 this late in the season are Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio .
( George Brett hit 24 home runs in 1980 ) .

OMA : the interlace residential complex , singapore image courtesy of OMA
designed by ole scheeren , partner of OMA , ‘ the interlace ’ adopts a new residential typology which breaks away from the standard isolated , vertical apartment towers of singapore .
the large - scale complex takes a more expansive and interconnected approach to living through communal spaces which are integrated into its lush surrounding greenbelt .
thirty - one apartment blocks , each standing at six - storeys tall and identical in length , are stacked in a hexagonal arrangement to form eight large open and permeable courtyards .
the layered formations allow light and air to flow through the architecture and surrounding landscape .
developed by capitaland and hotel properties limited , the interlace covers 170,000 m2 of gross floor area and will house 1,040 apartment units of varying sizes .
the stacked buildings image courtesy of OMA
the design capitalizes on the generous size of the site which stretches between singapore ’s kent ridge , telok blangah hell and mount faber parks .
the location of the complex is situated at the junction of alexandra road and depot road , bounded by the ayer rajah expressway to the north .
connected with the gillman village , residents can enjoy nature trails and restaurants which are within walking distance .
each of the eight courtyards have an individual landscaped identity defined within the heart of the project , forming various focal points and orienting devices for the surrounding residential blocks .
the primary route through the project leads residents from the main entrance to the courtyards .
the number of paths and pedestrian circulation is a response to the location and density of residents around each courtyard and core residence .
secondary footpaths connect residents to the most direct routes from the building entrances to and from their homes .
a continuous loop which surrounds the site provides a one - kilometer running track and connects the courtyards to the activities around the edge of the site .

landscaping takes up eight - hectares , with the arrangement of the buildings maximizing the presence of the surrounding tropical floral by introducing extensive roof gardens , landscaped sky terraces , cascading balconies and lush green areas .
the continuous landscape is also projected vertically , from the planting of green areas in open - air basement voids , through balconies and rooftop gardens .
the private balconies give apartments large outdoor space and personal planting areas .
cascading gardens spill over the facades of the buildings drawing a visual connection between the elevated green refuges and expansive tropical landscape on the ground .
complex is also embedded within tropical flora , letting nature expand .
sky gardens provide panoramic views across the interlace site and throughout the complex .
the architectural design also incorporates sustainability features through careful environmental analysis of sun , wind and micro-climate conditions on site and the integration of low - impact passive energy strategies .
water bodies have been strategically placed within wind corridors as a means of allowing evaporative cooling to happen along the wind paths , reducing local air temperatures and improving thermal comfort in outdoor recreation spaces .

Juniper : The Last Descendant by Debora Lucken ( Copywright reserved ) Preface
Do you believe in magic ?
In witches , healers , shape shifters .
Spirits and Gods alike ?
I did n't .
My mother 's strong will of not wanting me to believe in anything not human became my will too .
Yet ,
He told me to believe .
He told me that one day I 'd understand , accept and embrace what I was .
He even claimed that one day I 'd fight for every source of magic in the world .
And that He 'd fight with me .
I did n't accept
His words as true ... but I really wanted to .
Chapter 1
My bedroom was always very tidy ; I had the habit of making the bed as soon as I was up and putting all my clothes in the laundry basket to have them washed in order to wash them myself once home and obviously , after doing my homework .
My old style wooden desk , right in front of the little window on the left of my room , was perfectly cleaned ; I would n't allow myself to leave a book out of the shelves .
My mother believed that order and organization held the key for a peaceful life , which she wanted us to lead .
She was a beautiful 40 - year - old , my mother .
Her eyes were as green as our Lake Erie , in Sandusky , where we live .
I loved brushing her long curly brown hair and watching her putting some light make up on .
Her skin was always so white , even after an entire day at the beach .
But that was the only thing that would give away our blood relation .
My skin was as white as snow , yet my eyes were insignificantly brown and my light brown hair wore shoulder - length and straight , was nothing in comparison of the volume of hers .
My mother thought it looked cute that way , but I knew better .
And even all the hair products in the world would have made it look like hers .
I even tried to let it grow longer , but I was never patient enough .
I wanted to be more like her , but I just could n't .
And her voice , oh gosh , her voice was like music to my ears , and every time she 'd talk to me I 'd remember all the lullabies she used to sing to make me fall asleep when I was a child .
My mother and her younger sister , Eleanor , owned a little music shop on Grant Street , on the way to Sandusky High school , where I studied .
She was always with me , never let me go too far from her sight .
Some people might consider that overprotective .
I defined it as loving .
Her name was Pearl and she was my world .
' Mum , have you seen my history book ? ' it was rear for me to misplace something ' Joon , love , I told you to look after your things properly !
I have n't seen it !
And if you do n't hurry up you 'll be late for school ! ' her beautiful voice had a tone of irritation .
She did n't like me losing objects anywhere and she hated when I was late .
Although , for as hard as I was trying to remember the last time I 'd been late to any appointments or to school , I could n't recall any .
I turned around to look at my desk again and , oddly enough , my history book was there .
Sitting on the mouse pad .
' Very strange ' I said out aloud so that my mother could hear me from the kitchen down the stairs ' It 's on the desk , where I would n't have left it and where I looked before ' I was still staring at the book in disbelief .
At first she did n't reply , although I was sure she heard me , then finally said ' You must be more tired than you think !
Get going ... it 's late ! ' her anger was gone completely , replaced with a very rare tone of preoccupation .
But I was indeed late , so I brushed that thought off and rushed down the stairs to kiss her before going to school .
When I arrived in the kitchen , expecting to find her at the table having breakfast like every morning , she was already dressed and ready to go out , which was very unusual .
Her face oddly grave .

When the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation released its annual Network Responsibility Index , Syfy was among the networks receiving " Failing " grades for their depiction of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) characters .
While CBS , NBC , A&E and TBS declined to comment on their showing , Syfy 's executive vice president of original content , Mark Stern , accepted TVGuide.com 's invitation to react as well as discuss his network 's plans for a more diverse future .
" We are disappointed , obviously , " Stern said of the NRI grade .
" The ' F ' is hard because we are trying , it is something that is in our vocabulary .
But we need to work harder . "
See which networks got " Good " and " Adequate " grades from GLAAD
A GLAAD rep told TVGuide.com that Syfy 's grade was based on the fact that there were only two gay characters appearing on the network 's programming during the timetable of the study — Eureka 's Vincent and Battlestar Galactica 's Gaeta — and the latter 's sexual orientation was never directly addressed on the show .
Instead , it was only referred to in a webisode .
Looking ahead , however , Syfy's Stern touts two new series and the diversity depicted within .
" On Stargate Universe , one of the main female characters , we discover , is a lesbian and has a wife at home .
It 's a pretty important facet of who that character is , " he says .
ER alum Ming - Na plays intergalactic diplomat Camille Wray , while 24's Reiko Aylesworth recurs as her wife .
Similarly the Galactica prequel spin- off Caprica has at least two main characters depicted as being in gay relationships .
" [ One ] is a ' goodfella ' - type , and we discover in a nonchalant way that he is gay , with a husband , " Stern says .
" It was very interesting to me to take what is traditionally a very heterosexual role in an organization that we think of as being extremely homophobic , and put a gay character in that world in a very normalized way . "
The other aformentioned Caprica character is part of a communal marriage featuring " heterosexual as well as homosexual couplings . "
In both the SGU and Caprica examples , the character 's sexuality is merely one facet of who they are , says Stern .
" It is not about , ' Oh , look , is n't that progressive , that this person is gay ? '
No , they are simply gay .
There is no commentary necessary , " he says .
" And that 's what were striving for , to make it a naturalistic thing . "

Enoch Powell is the subject of reactionary encomium wherever the issues of race , integration and post - colonial Britain arise .
They say that he was n't a racist , just a decent English patriot who was saddened by the dilution of national identity .
They say that he was right .
They say that the current multicultural situation is intolerable and perverse , and that this was foreseen by Powell .
' They ' talk an incredible amount of rubbish .
What sort of Britishness , what sort of nationhood , did Enoch Powell defend ?
Before coming to his infamous Birmingham address from 20th April 1968 , I want to mention a few things about Powell 's formation as a politician .
He was the off - spring of petit - bourgeois Black Country denizens and , as a child of the lower middle class , he was also a career - minded imperialist .
He had risen through the ranks of the armed forces without seeing combat , and aspired to the highest position in the empire available .
He wanted to be the Viceroy of India , the local proxy of the British crown and as close to royalty as someone of his class and rank could ever aspire to .
He wanted to be a king .
Powell , a classicist , was also a devotee of Britain 's desert travellers , such as Wilfrid Thesiger , Richard Francis Burton , Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Charles Montagu Doughty .
He admired their unworldliness , their readiness to escape from modernity , their self - imposed exile from life .
He experienced the deserts himself as a Lieutenant - Colonel in Algiers and Cairo during World War II , though his experience was not particularly heroic .
He could n't boil water , or handle a simple tin of sausages , and he once burned his moustache when he tried to get a fire going for some cooking .
Still , he thought he was the right stuff to rule over a few hundred million ' coolies ' .
He was also of that shade of imperialist opinion that detested the rising influence of the United States , believing America to be hostile to the British empire .
And he hated Chamberlain not because of any instinctive anti-fascism but for selling Britain out .
Because of his disgust over Munich , he even voted Labour in 1945 , though he joined the Conservative Party .
His regal dreams , as it turned out , were shattered by Indian independence , but he remained committed to the same monarchical and racial principles .
In fact , upon being elected as an MP in 1950 , he drew up a plan to reconquer India , which even Churchill thought was insane .
And he went on to espouse the most right - wing ' free market ' economics in a period when it was extremely unpopular .
There is a peculiarity in British imperial practise which is important to take note of , however .
Although Powell later made his name by attacking immigrants from the Commonwealth , the traditional stance of empire was that all citizens loyal to the British monarch could have free entry to Britain .
This stance was not fundamentally adulterated in the immediate period following World War II .
So , for example , in 1948 , one year after Indian independence was formally conceded and in the same year that the vicious suppression of the Malayan rebellion began , the Labour government introduced the Nationality Act .
The Act upheld the practice of allowing free entry to the UK of all citizens of ' dependent ' Commonwealth countries , affirming continuity in the face of certain post - war changes .
The Act was more symbolic in this respect than it was substantial , since it did not alter the principle of free entry , supported by both Labour and the Tories .
It was later falsely cited by Powellites as the basis for ' uncontrolled ' immigration .
What it really did was define the basis upon which immigration would be controlled , since the apparatus of exclusion was maintained for citizens of ' foreign powers ' and so on .
What changed after 1945 was not the law so much as the problems facing the British state , and British capital .
These included how to keep the empire , or keep as much of it as possible ; how to handle the arrival of the American behemoth ; how to restore the health of capitalism , and divert the growing radicalism of the working class ; how , in effect , to remain a competitive centre of capital accumulation with what had been astonishing global dominion .
Much capital had been destroyed by the war , and the labour force had been depleted .
There was money ready to enter circulation as capital , of course , but in a dirt poor society where consumption was rationed , how was it possible to realise any surplus ?
With a tight labout market and a militant working class , how much surplus would it be possible to extract in the first place ?
The social democratic policies that capitalists often objected to were functional in this respect , since socialised housing and health significantly reduced the cost of labour .
Nationalisations in vulnerable and unprofitable parts of the economy helped support more dynamic parts of the economy .
And if much of the colonial apparatus was to be lost to independence struggles , thus shutting off valuable sources of hyper - exploitation , the Commonwealth could still help solve the labour supply problem .
So , in 1948 , the Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury with 500 Jamaican passengers , all of them British subjects and all of them responding to a newspaper advertisement requesting labourers to come and work in the UK .
The public sector began to recruit extensively from Jamaica and Barbados , raising an extra labour army of about 170,000 people before the first restrictions were introduced in 1962 .
Did Powell have a problem with this ?
If he did , he was careful to conceal it .
He had spoken out against immigration controls in 1956 and , as the Tory health minister , he had continued to draft Carribean labour according to the system 's needs .
In 1964 , he still said that he could not support " making any difference between one citizen of this country and another on grounds of his origin " .
But things were happening that would soon make racist demagoguery an excellent career move .
There had already been racist riots in parts of Britain throughout the 1950s , and there were plenty of shops and landlords who would have no truck with black Britons .
In 1962 , the Tory government had decided to impose the first controls on Commonwealth immigration , with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act .
The labour supply problem had been dealt with , so the British state no longer had an incentive to defend immigration .
The Act said that no Commonwealth citizen could migrate to the UK without an employment voucher issued by the government .
By implication , though they were subjects of the British crown and citizens , black workers were being treated as a problem and a threat to be carefully managed .
After Powell lost the Tory leadership election in 1965 , he settled into the shadow cabinet and , after a few years , emerged in a new guise .
He first debuted this new get - up in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 1967 , entitled ' Facing up to Britain 's Race Problem ' , in which he described the presence of Commonwealth immigrants as an " invasion " a " rising flood " that was seeing white people " driven from their homes and property " as house prices dropped .
He went on to test the waters again at a speech in Walsall in 1968 , where he denounced Sikhs for striking over the right to wear a turban in the workplace .
I 'll come back to this example in a minute .
The notoriety that he received for this stance must have inflamed his ambition .
He could become popular by vocalising the racist sentiments that he had denounced only a few years before .
So , he began his speech in Birmingham in April 1968 by asserting that the mark of a good statesman was a willingness to face up to dangers .
The main danger , as he saw it , was described by a " quite ordinary working man " that he had encountered , who told him he would leave Britain if he had the money because he feared that " In this country in fifteen or twenty years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man " .
As if he was confirming the diagnosis of this " ordinary working man " , Powell went on to say warn that in twenty years time there would be three and a half million Commonwealth migrants in England .
He said that by 1985 , the decendants of immigrants would be in a majority , and that by allowing the inflow of " raw material " for the future " immigrant - descended population " , Britain was " heaping up its own funeral pyre " .
He quoted correspondence from a constituent , who complained about a neighbour , an elderly white woman , being harrassed by " grinning picanninies " as she went to the shops .
The correspondent said they could not speak English , but did know how to shout " racialist " at her .
And , therefore , if she was thus accused , might she not end up in prison under the terms of the Race Relations Act ?
Powell made no attempt to refute this obvious drivel , but instead used it to bolster his claim that the presence of black citizens was a national crisis , an imminent threat to white Britons , whose freedom to live and speak within their ' own ' country was being repressed .
He predicted " civil war " between white and black Britons , and urged repatriation ( " voluntary " , of course ) as the urgent solution .
In so doing , he knew full well that he was encouraging the most poisonous elements in British society .
He may have hoped to place himself well for a future leadership challenge , but the main effect was to strengthen the appeal of the far right National Front ( NF ) , which grew in leaps and bounds for a decade afterwards .
Subsequent governments chose to pander to the racism that he had encouraged .
The Heath government introduced the 1971 Immigration Act , and the rate of migration slowed to near zero .
Labour politicians began to attack migrants , as when Bob Mellish MP stood in the commons in 1976 and said of Malawi Asians , " Enough is enough " .
He was followed by Powell , of course , who repeated the same demand .
The NF gained more than 5 % of the vote in the Greater London Council elections the following year .
The Labour government responded by increasing deportations , while immigration officials imposed " virginity tests " on Asian women .
If the NF was eventually defeated by a broad antifascist coalition , though , the Tory party adopted precisely the kind of new Right policies that Powell had long advocated , and its right flank represented by people like Norman Tebbitt defended his ideas , as indeed they still do .
Pursuing a particular class project , known today as neoliberalism , the Tory right also articulated in different ways the reactionary discourses of nationality and race that Powell , a would - be Viceroy and failed imperial traveller , had propounded .
It is worth noting a few things in conclusion .
Powellism 's defenders have always said that his followers were largely not racists .
The journalist Diana Spearman analysed his post - bag in 1968 and decided that only a minority could be classified as racist , with the majority of his support attributed to fears for British ' culture ' and ' traditions ' .
It was pointed out by anti-racists at the time that this involved precisely the typical racist gesture of constructing a non-white minority as a threat and a legitimate object of abuse and repression .
This was the ideological basis of Powellism .
Its staple conviction was that more black people meant less harmonious race relations , and that relatively few black people meant peace .
That such culturalist arguments are still used as a justification for racism today suggests that the debate has not advanced that far .
Another familiar argument , made by the dockers who protested on Powell 's behalf after he was dismissed from the shadow cabinet , was that they were only protesting about ' free speech ' .
An Englishman , they claimed , had no right to say what he felt in his own country .
And one other echo of the present was when Powell denounced what he called " communalism " during his speech in Walsall in February 1968 , and then again in Birmingham that April .
He was referring to the desire of Sikhs to preserve customs that he referred to as " inappropriate to Britain " , namely the right to wear their turban in work .
This was what he called the " canker " of " communalism " .
In other words , " communalism " was a code for what would now be called multiculturalism .
The current obsession with questions of ' integration ' , the pseudo - problems of ' tolerance ' and its limits , and the ends of multiculturalism , have roots in the seedy and sad career of John Enoch Powell .

It should come as no surprise to those who are faithful to sustainable , traditional ways of eating that many far and wide oppose our beliefs about returning to nutrient - dense and older ways of growing , preparing , and selling food .
It is our duty to take a stand against agencies that seek to bring down the potential of great health we have in our communities by speaking out against literature and “ research ” which makes false claims .
Because of this transfer of false information , there are many people led astray in trying to decide what ’s truthful information and what is n’t .
The American Dietetic Association is one of the primary organizations relied on by the public for sources of health and nutrition .
For decades , the ADA has provided a wealth of information about these topics .
Unfortunately , they have been guilty of releasing much incorrect information , much to the detriment of the masses .
As with many topics on nutrition , they have taken a stand about organic food , and it is this :
If you visit their web site , you will find a definitive statement claiming that “ no scientific evidence shows that these foods are healthier or safer than conventionally grown foods . ”
They maintain this stance despite the following research conducted by their Hunger and Environmental Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group which reveal that plants grown in organic systems contain higher levels of nutrients and an organic diet avoids the serious health risks associated with pesticide exposure .
Unfortunately when agencies like the ADA who are followed so closely by individuals , health centers and organizations , physicians , and other entities recommend information to the public of this nature , many do n’t realize the harmful effects their guidelines have on general health .
By failing to support this important information , the ADA is undermining one of the best ways we as a civilization have of combating degenerative illness and disease , as well as degradation to our environment and economy .
According to the Journal of Applied Nutrition , across the board , organic foods are superior in nutritional content and contain less toxic materials than conventionally grown foods .
But it does n’t stop there .
The ADA also refuses to acknowledge the dangers of chemical ingredients and the genetic engineering of foods grown and sold on the market .

Each of these corporations are well - known and documented to produce industrial food in the form of meat or dairy products , grains , and many packaged , processed foods containing toxins and chemicals found to cause health problems when consumed by human beings .
One great source of information for this is the movie Food , Inc .
Also , visit the Organic Consumer ’s Association for reliable information about the effects of Monsanto ’s product , Roundup .
Sustainable Table has reliable data and sources detailing the dangers of pesticides and other harmful chemicals that are used in every aspect of our food system from meat to dairy to grains to soy to produce .
According to the American Dietetics Association web site , the ADA ’s purpose is the following :
“ The American Dietetic Association Foundation ( ADAF ) is the world ’s largest charitable organization devoted exclusively to nutrition and dietetics .
ADAF is the philanthropic arm of the American Dietetic Association and a 501 ( c ) 3 charity ” .
How could a charitable organization be so closely tied with big powerful corporations ?
Seems that there is a conflict of interest here .
So if you were wondering whether the American Dietetic Association provides factual , scientific information about health , food , and nutrition , it bears mentioning that their philosophies and recommendations about what to eat are right in line with what industrial food companies sell to consumers .
All you have to do is follow the money – some of the most profitable and powerful food corporations in the world , as it turns out , are some of the ADA ’s biggest sponsors .

School lunch woes
One prominent place you can see the influence of the ADA at work is in managing school lunch menus for children .
I ’ve personally had conversations with the registered dietitians who run the school lunch program in my city , Boise , Idaho and gotten pretty much nowhere .
I started an effort and was joined by a small group of parents and other concerned citizens last summer .
We brought the film ‘ Two Angry Moms ‘ to our city in October of 2008 .
The dieticians watched it , and were almost completely unaffected by its important message .
Our goal was to make much needed changes to our menus by doing research , providing reliable evidence of the negative effect the food served by the school system has on children ’s health , and have a discussion after the film about what we could do together to change things for the better .
The head dietician got up to speak after the film and said , “ it ’s nice to know we ’re one of the good guys ! ”
To which the majority of the audience was utterly appalled and in disbelief .
It ’s been over a year and nothing has happened ( yet ) .
The persistent idea held by these dietitians that children need low - fat foods and that processed foods are just fine and healthy to consume is not only annoying , but it is permanently damaging to our children ’s health .
This is one reason among many that I am thankful we are homeschooling this year .
ADA guidelines and recommendations for health
From my own experience , I have observed that the general teachings of registered dietitians ( like many conventional doctors and nurses ) include following a low - fat diet with “ lean meats ” that are “ skinless and boneless ” , little “ red meat ” , and “ whole grains ” ( which include many processed foods such as store - bought breads , crackers , pasta , cereals , bagels , and tortillas ) .
We are also told to avoid healthy fats like butter and lard , cut sodium from our diets , and are encouraged to consume polyunsaturated fats such as vegetable oils ( which seems contradictory given the fact that most of the processed foods they tell us to eat are high in salt ! ) .
Registered dietitians remind us frequently to count calories , watch fat , and maintain portion control .
So , eat less and cut out the things that give us staying power and keep us from getting hungry sooner – fat and protein .
No wonder people are always hungry and can’t maintain their normal weight !
They do recommend eating a lot of fruits and vegetables , but do not stand behind the idea that organic is superior for health .
Because their beliefs include eating a lot of processed , industrial foods , it seems unbelievable that anyone would actually follow these teachings .
But the reality is , it ’s these very ideas which have brought our nation and many other developed nations into the heart disease , Diabetes , obesity , and other degenerative diseases epidemic we now find ourselves in .
Anyone reading this who understands the importance of real food and traditional foods in the role of health knows that dietary fat is critical in maintaining health – but not just any fat …we need real butter , lard , and tallow from healthy animals raised naturally .
We need grass - fed meats and poultry , and pasture - raised eggs .
We need sustainable , organically grown fruits and vegetables .
We also need naturally - fermented foods like yogurt , kefir , sauerkraut , and lacto - fermented vegetables .
In short , we need REAL FOOD .
Can we achieve this ?
Of course we can !
It just takes some education and determination .
We need the real foods from nature as intended by our Creator to make us healthy .
People have been eating this way for millennia .
It ’s only been in the last 100 plus years that we ’ve seen a sharp decline in our good eating habits , and consequently , chronic degenerative disease .
So I ask this simple question :
How could modern - day science possibly succeed at altering and improving on something from nature ( i.e. , real , whole foods ) that have worked to nourish our bodies for so many thousands of years ?

The police chief of Hollywood is speaking out for the first time since a video surfaced showing some of his officers trying to frame a DUI suspect for a February traffic accident .
Chief Chadwick
Wagner spoke outside the Hollywood Police Department today , ensuring the public that his office is investigating the incident , which he said he had no knowledge of until just three days ago .
" I realize and understand those that feel a sense of betrayal over this incident , " Wagner said .
" And I ask each and every one of you to allow this investigative process to run its course and to have confidence that this matter will be investigated accurately and professionally . "
Wagner said that he immediately called internal affairs when he learned of the incident , and he is bringing in the Broward County State Attorney 's office to assist in the investigation .
Wagner said he could n't discuss the specifics of the case because the investigation is ongoing , but he did add a fifth name to the list of Hollywood officials being investigated , crime scene technician Andrea Tomassi .
Tomassi , along with Officers Joel Francisco and Dewey Pressley , Sgt. Andrew Diaz and community service Officer Karim Thomas are under investigation for the shocking February 17 incident that was all caught on a police dashboard camera .
The disturbing video shows Alexandra Torrensvilas , 23 , handcuffed in the back of the squad car as the officers get their stories straight after Officer Francisco , an 11 - year veteran , crashed into the back of Torrensvilas ' vehicle .
When Officer Pressley arrives and questions Torrensvilas , she tells him that she has been drinking .
The 21 - year veteran officer seized the opportunity and arrests her for DUI , and then the cops begin to brainstorm believable excuses for the accident .
" As far as I 'm concerned .
I 'm going to put words in his mouth .
She went to accelerate and a cat jumped out of the window at which point he thought it could have been a pedestrian , which distracted him , " Pressley tells Sgt. Andrew Diaz , another veteran of the force .
" I mean what 's the chances of hitting a f--- in drunk when a cat jumps out of the window ? "
Still , the cops run with the half - baked idea and rush to get Torrensvilas to do a Breathalyzer test so they can officially say she was drunk .
" I nailed her on the video .
I already hung her on video .
She said she has been doing a beer party , " Pressley says .
" She 's gonna blow . "
Then , another cop debates with Pressley on who is going to write up the fabricated report to clear their police comrade .
" I know how I 'm going to word this with the cat so we can get him off the hook .
I 'll write the narrative , " Pressley says .
" We 're going to bend this a little bit .
We 'll do a little Walt Disney to protect the cop because it would n't have mattered because she is drunk anyway . "
The charges against Torrensvilas have since been dropped .
The five employees have been suspended with pay .
The Arakan forest turtle , one of the world 's rarest turtles , had n't been observed in the wild until recently .
Known only by museum specimens and a few captive individuals , one of the world ’s rarest turtle species – the Arakan forest turtle – has been observed for the first time in the wild .
A Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) team discovered five of the critically endangered turtles in a wildlife sanctuary in Myanmar ( Burma ) in Southeast Asia .
The sanctuary , originally established to protect elephants , contains thick stands of impenetrable bamboo forests and is rarely visited by people according to the report .
The adult turtles measure less than a foot in length ; its shell is light brown with some black mottling .
The species was believed extinct until 1994 , when conservationists found a few specimens in a food market in China .
Before then , the last know record of the species was of a single animal collected by a British Army officer in 1908 .
Many Asian turtle species have been driven to near extinction due to their demand as food .
The WCS team also found yellow tortoises and Asian leaf turtles in the sanctuary – two other species threatened by the illegal wildlife trade .
“ Throughout Asia , turtles are being wiped out by poachers for the illegal wildlife trade , ” said Colin Poole , WCS Director of Asia programs .
“ We are delighted and astonished that this extremely rare species is alive and well in Myanmar .
Now we must do what we can to protect the remaining population . ”
A report documenting the turtles ’ discovery was prepared by Dr. Steven Platt of Sul Ross State University , Alpine , Texas and Khin Myo Myo of WCS .
It recommends several steps to ensure that the turtles remain protected in the sanctuary .
These include training of local protected area staff , conservation groups and graduate students to collect additional data on the species , and establishing permanent guard posts on roads leading in and out of the park to thwart potential poaching .
The research was supported by Andy Sabin and the Turtle Conservation Fund .
Chapter One
Empurpled by both the romance novel prose and the new Minnesota twilight , Brett Favre is still shocking .
No one can get used to it , though we 've been through it before , though we 've been staring at him for years .
The pale skin , the stubble , the cargo shorts .
The never - dampened dive watch .
The tattered cap .
The indecision .

He 's back !
Cower and beware , puny mortals !
He is a perfect statue , carved in some unknown stone , smooth like marble , glittering like crystal .
Or maybe Crystal Light .
Strawberry kiwi .
A Falcon . A Packer .
A Jet . And now a Viking .
There is no escaping him .
Like superstition itself , he is everywhere and he is forever .
It has long since been known to the Volturi in the press box , to the Renfields in the media center , to those who bear the ancient knowledge of the forest and the darkness and the NFL conference - call dial - in number , that Favre is an immortal -- a chupacabra , a vrykolakas .
A vampire .
After all these years and all these lives and all these incarnations , can that inerrant fact still come as a shock to anyone ?
That their favorite quarterback is resolutely undead ?
That their hero is a blood - feeding phantasm whose role it is in history to vex and beset humanity , to steal life itself from the lesser beings -- mostly fans and offensive linemen -- who surround him ?
Grant him the respect he deserves for his infernal persistence , sure , but know for whom you 're rooting .
Because whoever made him has unleashed a pestilence against this world .
When asked straight up about his vampirism not long ago , he texted this reply :
" Always played this game like a little kid .
Always been a gunslinger .
Always tried to make something happen .
Always gave 110 percent .
Always took it one game at a time .
And always -- since before the sun first rose in the east and burned across the desert sands walked by Gog and Magog -- survived by gorging on human blood .
Thought you knew that . "
Whether mythology or poetry or alchemy , whether Gilgamesh or Tithonus , Dorian Gray or Ponce de Leon , the search for a happy , endurable eternity goes on .
But Favre has long since found his .
Like Lestat or Nosferatu , though , it comes at the terrible price of his very soul .
And like Dracula or Vlad the Impaler , at the cost of some flexibility in his throwing arm .
Thus he is and remains a creature of the shadowlands , a thief of life , a monster , an abomination and a misery .
His essence , at its unfathomable core , is wickedness .
Still , his career QB rating is 85.4 .
Forget Van Helsing or the Highlander : Favre can not be killed .
Nor will he be ignored or walled up or willed away or destroyed .
Cut his head off ; he 'll just grow another .
There is no weapon against his vainglory , against his rank eternity , against his implacable and infinite self - regard .
No sword or stake or flame can finish him , no garlic clove or silver cross or book of psalms can ward him off .
Although a quick rotation into a Cover 4 will slow him down .
He is , therefore , immutable .
Impossible .
He can neither be ended nor improved .
When he looks in the mirror , he sees nothing .
He will live forever , an eternal rebuke to the weakness of vanity .
A permanent curse on ambition and drive and on the dreams of backup QBs everywhere .
And a likely 9 - 7 record every season from now ' til the thunderclap of Doomsday .

Why do you think the shirt is red ?
He is hunger made flesh , endless , the wanton universal glutton .
Not Octomom or Usain Bolt or the health - care debate , not Michael Vick or Rick Pitino , not an election in Afghanistan or global warming in Kyoto or a felony plea in New York City gets through to him .
None of it matters .
It never has .
All news , any news , any story not his own is lost on him , as it has been forever , as it has been since the time of the Flood , or since the age of Cleopatra , or since the eruption of Vesuvius .
Since the French Revolution .
Since the debut of " Project Runway . "
These things pass as if in a mist , adrift in time , out of focus and supremely unimportant to Brett Favre ; this succession of human foolishness is of no use to an immortal , of no consequence to an undead thing whose only need and appetite is to drain the divine spark from others , to live by stealing life .
And then not even make the playoffs .
Eventually he will see us all lapse into nothingness , us poor mortals , see every generation of us stacked like cordwood upon the one before -- pharaohs and slaves and kings and commoners and kickers and holders and coaches -- as he has seen it done from the beginning of time .
And come the End of Days he will be left alone at last , the only thing with fangs and language still standing .
The price of his peace no less than the end of humanity itself .
And only then , at last , will the interceptions end .
He smiles at the thought .
And cries out to his teammates and the rising moon , " Dive Right , Red Tiger , Zig - 22 Blast .
On two . "
From the preseason sidelines , dazed and disoriented , Sage Rosenfels and Tarvaris Jackson , both now twice bitten , thrice shy , look up ashen and confused from the bright red pulsing of their own blood , drained of life and opportunity , and into the fevered eyes of half a thousand suddenly ravenous sportswriters .
Favre smiles again .
And the chill of his lips is like ice .

Apple has been getting a lot of criticism for its iPhone app approval process .
Developers are calling the criteria for approval inconsistent and unclear , and some have suggested that the final approval involves asking a hamster named Monroe whether he would like some dried carrot .
If Monroe has a tummy ache that day , it 's back to the drawing board .
Apple has neither confirmed nor denied this rumor .
I , myself , have submitted several applications to the iPhone Developer Program , and have been rejected every time .
I think if you look over my list of apps and the supposed reasons for their rejection , you 'll see that Apple 's decisions are pure whimsy , drawn up from the whimsy mines deep beneath the company 's headquarters in sunny Cupertino , California .
Low - Fat Chicken Breast Recipe Book
Apparently , Apple can't even handle the word breast , because it rejected this app , which is nothing more than a guide to cooking healthful , delicious , boneless , skinless chicken breasts .
Each recipe comes with detailed instructions and a helpful video showing the dish being prepared by a naked porn star .
Steve Jobs Strip Poker
Apple has never been the biggest fan of transparency , so I guess it stands to reason that the company would be too cowardly to let the world see what its CEO looks like under the turtleneck .
I 'm no financial expert , but if I were looking to invest in Apple , I 'd wonder what Jobs is trying to hide .
A vestigial twin , whispering design suggestions for the fabled iTablet ?
A " NeXT Forever " tattoo ?
The mark of Cain ?
We 'll never know , because Apple was unwilling to approve this app , much less supply the appropriate texture maps .
Baby Shaker
This was a detailed , realistic sim where you raised a child in the United Society of Believers in Christ 's Second Appearing , aka the Shakers , teaching it to sing hymns and build furniture .
Apple did n't even explain why it rejected this app .
The company 's only comment : " No freaking way . "
i Plummet
This completely harmless game allowed you to shove the politician , celebrity or ex-spouse of your choice off a cliff and watch their body smash against the shattered rocks below .
For added fun , it would send an e-mail to the smashee , saying : " I just killed you !
You are dead ! " and attaching a video of the terrifying murder .
For some reason , Apple found this " offensive . "
I guess the company 's engineers just do n't like social media .
PersonalConnect Voice
It 's sad that Apple can't handle a little competition .
Not only did it reject the Google Voice app , the company also rejected my PersonalConnect Voice app , which provides an instant connection to phone sex operators around the world .
It seems Apple wants to keep the lucrative phone sex market to itself .
I just wish the company would admit it .
Come on , Cupertino — come out and say it : " When someone calls a jaded sex worker pretending to be a nubile , insatiable co-ed , we want them to think ' Apple . ' "
Steal Me !
This handy app uses motion detection to determine when your iPhone has been set down for three minutes or more , at which point it begins to yells a recorded message : " Steal me !
Just grab me and run !
You can get a hundred bucks or so , easy !
Spend it on drugs !
Anyone who buys an iPhone has too much money anyway !
Go for it ! "
I have no idea why Apple rejected this app , but I suspect the company is working on its own version and did n't want the competition .

This will seem rather tame to anyone who has lived through even a medium - grade corporate revamping .
“ We have n’t been good at cutting when we add , ” said Robert Massa , Lafayette ’s new vice president for communications , speaking of colleges in general .
“ We just add . ”
Rising tuition and income from endowments have made this possible .
But the unique structure of universities has also made it inconvenient to do otherwise .
“ In some ways , higher education is more like a political environment than the management of a private corporation , ” Mr. Weiss said .
Except that thanks to tenure , it is difficult to vote anyone out of office .
Still , he added , “ Alienating some of your faculty members , if you can avoid it , is something you should n’t be doing . ”
This is just one of the reasons why it is so hard to make big cuts to a college ’s budget and reduce tuition in turn .
Here are some others :
CUTTING DEPARTMENTS
The political challenges with faculty make something as seemingly simple and obvious as cutting expensive and undersubscribed academic departments pretty hard .
In fact , Mr. Weiss could not remember the last time Lafayette had done such a thing .
But such cuts are practically inevitable for programs that have fewer students .
“ Fine arts has studio - based production , so capital and facility costs are high , ” said Jane Wellman , executive director of the nonprofit group Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs , Productivity and Accountability , speaking of colleges in general .
“ Piano tutoring is pretty much one to one in a room with a piano .
Pianos are expensive .
Agriculture is expensive because of the lab costs , which means a barn . ”
An English student , however , is generally a profit center .
“ They ’re paying for the chemistry major and the music major and faculty research , ” she said .
“ They do n’t want to talk about it in institutions , because the English department gets mad .
The little ugly facts about cross-subsidies are inflammatory , so they get papered over . ”
About all Mr. Weiss will say about this is that he agrees that Lafayette needs to do a better job of discriminating between the things it can and cannot do well .
He is too good on the politics to single out any department .
But there is little doubt that he and administrators like him will need to give up on some foreign languages , minor sciences or parts of the arts pretty soon .
FACULTY PRODUCTIVITY
Professors at Lafayette teach five classes a year over two semesters and work with students on their independent research projects .
At some colleges and universities , the number of classes is lower and at others it is higher .
Could n’t Lafayette lower costs by demanding that the faculty perform less research and teach one additional class ?
Every man I know who sports both a penis AND a vagina twixt his thighs says I should totally read The Time Travelers Wife and have a good cry into my matching brassier and panties .
Do they really expect me to see a “ sci - fi ” movie that seems to have more in common with The Notebook than Blade Runner ?
Ah , but they were n’t suggesting I see the movie .
They were suggesting I explore the source material , which is apparently a very different time traveling animal .
Even those fans of the book seem to have the same misgivings as I do about the movie .
Knowing myself as well as I do , I realized I will certainly never read the book so I did the next best / worst thing and read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia .
I ’m sorry , vengeful Internet !
I just had to know what was up with this quantum leaper and his spouse .
No spoilers , but it ’s actually a very cool story with a wonderfully tragic ending .
Maybe that was a spoiler .
If you do n’t like tragedy , make sure to see the movie because they changed the ending after focus groups said it was too much of a downer .
Movies , after all , are n’t supposed to make you feel sad , or uncomfortable , or angry or be anything but an escape from our mundane lives into mundane fantasy .
I guess that ’s why I ’m having such a hard time selling my screen play about the plight of African AIDS babies getting sold to warlords to work in diamond mines .

Put Not Your Faith in Princes
A post on “ Taking Secession Seriously ” at the Front Porch Republic blog , written four months ago , is still sparking vigorous debate in the comment thread .
Commenter CJ
Foley remarked on the impossibility of managing political and economic affairs on the scale of 300 million people , or of exerting outside democratic control over the political and economic units .
It might be necessary , he said , to scale things down to where they can be effectively controlled .
But given my experience with local government , I responded , that might require scaling things down a lot further than he imagined .
By the time I got a couple of paragraphs into my rant , I realized I was composing this week ’s article for C4SS .
In just about any city with a population in or above the low tens of thousands , the local government is a showcase property of the local real estate industry .
In Fayetteville , Arkansas , three years ago Mayor Dan Coody ( who ’d been elected by the “ green ” faction , on a “ smart growth ” platform , to rein in the real estate interests ) proposed a one cent sales tax to fund expansion of the overburdened sewer system .
Now , the cause of the problem was the new housing developments and strip malls springing up all over the place , built primarily by billionaire real estate developer and Trump - wannabe Jim Lindsey .
But Coody said the “ only alternatives ” were the sales tax or a 30 % increase in sewer rates .
That ’s the way it works , see : he tells us what the “ only alternatives ” are , and we good little voters choose from what ’s put on our plates .
Increasing sewer hookup fees to cover the costs Lindsey and the other hogs at the trough were imposing on the system was never even considered .
The voters , convinced by Coody ’s hint that “ out - of - town ” shoppers would bear much of the burden ( it ’s always easier to cheat a greedy man ) , voted for the tax .
Then , next year , sewer impact fees came up as a local ballot issue .
You ’ll never convince me the timing and the wording of the proposal were n’t a deliberate strategy of the real estate interests .
Since the proposal came after the voters had already approved the sales tax , and not before , they were obviously likely to reject it as double taxation .
And they ’d have been a lot more likely to approve it if it had been proposed as a replacement for the sales tax they were already paying .
Now , the “ progressive ” element in Fayetteville have a better shot than anywhere else in NW Arkansas .
In most other towns , whatever the good ol ’ boys want just gets quietly passed without a peep of public debate .
In Fayetteville , a college town with a large contingent of “ back to the land ” hippies who settled there in the ’ 70s , there is at least grass - roots organizing and heated debate over everything –before the good ol ’ boys win .
And Coody was the fair - haired boy of the “ progressives , ” put forth as David to the Chamber of Commerce ’s Goliath .
His election was the closest thing to a victory the “ progressive ” and “ green ” coalition was or will be ever likely to see .
And in the end , he was just another greenwashed good ol ’ boy .
All the stuff he could have legitimately done to stop sprawl — eliminating barriers to mixed - use development , making new roads pay their way with tolls , making developments pay utility hookup fees — he did n’t have the political guts to do .
So instead , he focused on aesthetic regulations , bike paths , anti-smoking ordiances , and other forms of nannyism — basically just greenwashed gentrification .
At the level of the Northwest Arkansas region as a whole , the Washington - Benton County area ( with a population of several hundred thousand ) has an organization called the Northwest Arkansas Council .
It ’s a nominally private shadow government , made up of representatives of local corporate powerhouses like Wal - Mart , Tyson , J.B. Hunt ( and of course the above - mentioned Jim Lindsey ) , along with ex officio representatives of local governments and the University .
Its primary purpose , civic - minded lot that they are , is to promote the building of regional “ infrastructure ” for “ economic growth , ” and all kinds of other “ government - business partnership ” ( In other words , line up at the trough , corporate welfare piggies ! ) .
I think there ’s a similar organization in just about every metropolitan area in the country of the same size or larger .
For decades , regional elites had attempted to railroad through a regional airport to serve their interests , only to have it fail when it came up for a vote .
In 1990 , the NWA Council changed its strategy .
Like a filthy sneak - thief skulking about under cover of darkness , it quietly lobbied five city and two country governments to create a regional airport authority .
You ’d expect such an authority to be the topic of extensive public debate , considering that under state law such authorities have power to condemn land and levy taxes , and are immortal corporations so long as any two member governments remain parties to them .
You ’d expect wrong .
The seven local governments , under secret pressure from the REAL GOVERNMENT of Northwest Arkansas , voted to create the authority as an “ emergency ordinance ” — without any prior notice , multiple readings , or chance for public debate .
The Northwest Arkansas Council , in partnership with the NWA Regional Airport Authority , immediately began a campaign to suppress opposition .
“ Leadership Fayetteville , ” an elite annual seminar in the city Chamber of Commerce , devoted its primary focus to strategies for combating the “ anti- growth ” faction that had “ hijacked ” Fayetteville ’s progress .
Shortly after , under pressure from local movers and shakers , a popular radio DJ and the editor of the Northwest Arkansas Times were fired ( they ’d both been active proponents of a public vote on the airport issue ) .
In the end , the airport was railroaded through .
We now have a regional airport at Highfill , serving the interests of Tyson , Wal - Mart and J.B. Hunt .
I can cheerfully contemplate the people who did this taking up eternal residence in the Ninth Circle of Hell , with an apartment in Beelzebub ’s rectum and Judas Iscariot for a roommate .
And so it goes .
Democracy does n’t work , at least not above the level of face - to - face direct democracy .
The problem is , regardless of how formally democratic the system of representation is , no matter how “ progressive ” the controls on campaign finance ( or even public financing ) , government is by its very nature a centralized machine whose day - to - day operations must be carried out by a few people .
And by the nature of things , there will be a close affinity between them and similar elites running the corporate economic system , and other centralized institutional networks like the big charitable foundations and universities .
By the nature of things , the average person has only limited energy and attention to devote to public issues , and to keeping an eye on those engaged in public business .
The average person , by necessity , will always devote the overwhelming share of his energy and attention to work , family , and friends .
But for the insiders actually running the large institutions , the politics and policies of those institutions ARE their work and friends .
So the insiders , and the small circles of wealthy outsiders whose pecuniary interests depend most heavily subsidies and protections , will always have an advantage in time , energy , attention , information , and agenda control .
Democracy is and must be a sham , because the public ’s attention will always be the first to wander .
At the national level , Obama is probably the closest thing to a “ progressive ” president ever likely to be elected — a sort of national Dan Coody , in fact .
A friend of Alinsky and “ community organizer , ” he came across last year as a sort of Jerry Brown knockoff , the outside - the - box alternative to Hillary Clinton ( who was almost a parody of establishment managerial liberalism ) .
And what has he done ?
He ’s pursued a Wall Street bailout policy that ’s a direct continuation of Paulson ’s version of TARP , based on the uber - Hamiltonian project of using taxpayer money to ( at least partially ) reinflate the value of the plutocracy ’s investment assets .
He ’s pushed through a “ stimulus ” whose primary goal is to restore the suicidal and pathological economic model of running overbuilt industry at full capacity .
That , in turn , can only be done ( given its present capacity ) through consumer debt and planned obsolescence –the latter extending to actually paying people , via the latest “ Cash for [ insert name of subsidized industry here ] ” program , to throw stuff away and replace it .
Well , THAT ’s certainly a sustainable economic model .
Should work out great , as long as the government can afford to run a $ 2 trillion deficit indefinitely .
In any case , nobody who promotes an intensified version of the 20th century economic model of throwing shit away fast enough to keep the assembly lines running , should be passing himself off as “ green , ” in any way , shape or form .
He ’s designed a “ progressive ” healthcare reform whose overall paramaters were fixed at the beginning by the insurance and pharma industries .
Political activism within the system , at best , may make the system a little more bearable to those who suffer under it while it lasts .
If you want to put energy into that , good luck .
But fundamental change can only come from outside the system .
That ’s why the primary focus of my C4SS research papers has been on the outside forces beyond the control of the people running the system , that render it unsustainable , and on alternatives being built outside the system that do n’t require anybody ’s permission .

For new folks , here are the classical rules :
Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day
You must spend the entire day in costume and character .
The only rule is that you cannot actually tell anyone that you are a time traveler .
Other than that , anything ’s game .
There are three possible options :
1 ) Utopian / cliché Future – “ If the Future did a documentary of the last fifty years , this is how badly the reenactors would dress . ”
Think Star Trek : TNG or the Time Travelers from Hob .
Ever see how the society in Futurama sees the 20th century ?
Run with it .
Your job is to dress with moderately anachronistic clothing and speak in slang from varying decades .
Here are some good starters :
– Greet people by referring to things that do n’t yet exist or have n’t existed for a long time .
Example : “ Have you penetrated the atmosphere lately ? ” “ What spectrum will today ’s broadcast be in ? ” and “ Your king must be a kindly soul ! ”
– Show extreme ignorance in operating regular technology .
Pay phones should be a complete mystery ( try placing the receiver in odd places ) .
Chuckle knowingly at cell phones .
2 ) Dystopian Future –
This one offers a little more flexibility .
It can be any kind of future from Terminator to Freejack .
The important thing to remember is dress like a crazy person with armor .
Black spray painted football pads , high tech visors , torn up trenchcoats and maybe even some dirt here or there .
Remember , dystopian future travelers are very startled that they ’ve gone back in time .
Some starters :
– If you go the “ prisoner who ’s escaped the future ” try shaving your head and putting a barcode on the back of your neck .
Then stagger around and stare at the sky , as if you ’ve never seen it before .
– Walk up to random people and say “ WHAT YEAR IS THIS ? ” and when they tell you , get quiet and then say “ Then there ’s still time ! ” and run off .
– Stand in front of a statue ( any statue , really ) , fall to your knees , and yell “ NOOOOOOOOO ”
– Stare at newspaper headlines and look astonished .
– Take some trinket with you ( it can be anything really ) , hand it to some stranger , along with a phone number and say “ In thirty years dial this number .
You ’ll know what to do after that . ”
Then slip away .
2 ) The Past – This one is more for beginners .
Basically dress in period clothing ( preferably Victorian era ) and stagger around amazed at everything .
Since the culture ’s set in place already , you have more of a template to work off of .
Some pointers :
– Airplanes are terrifying .
Also , carry on conversations with televisions for a while .
– Discover and become obsessed with one trivial aspect of technology , like automatic grocery doors .
Stay there for hours playing with it .
– Be generally terrified of people who are dressed immodestly compared to your era .
Tattoos and shorts on women are especially scary .
There are two competing ideas on the process that governs the formation and maintenance of beliefs : 1 ) people maintain a belief because they have limited access to opposing beliefs , or 2 ) because they actively filter information in a way that avoids conflicting views .
A new meta - analysis of past studies confirms the existence of active avoidance ; when people are offered an opposing viewpoint , they will ignore it in favor of a supportive viewpoint in two out of three instances .
The meta -analysis was performed by researchers at the University of Illinois and the University of Florida .
They managed to identify a total of 91 relevant studies that included nearly 8,000 participants .
The studies were all on the subject of selective exposure , or how people filter out incoming information based on how it jibes with their current beliefs .
The studies attempted to determine whether people wanted to view or read something that either supported their point of view or challenged it .
Analysis of the studies shows that people are almost two times more likely to select information that is congenial to their current beliefs and behaviors than they are to pick information that opposes them .
That is to say , when offered material containing views that were contrary to their beliefs ( either in article or broadcast form ) , people had only a one - in - three chance of taking a closer look at that information .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the bias against conflicting views was exaggerated when the information concerned political , religious , or ethical issues .
Also in the " no surprise " department was the finding that individuals with close - minded personalities selected information that is aligned with their views 75 percent of the time ( for more typical people , the number was 67 percent ) .
The study also found that people who are unsure of their beliefs are actually more likely to avoid conflicting views .
The authors noted certain factors that prompt people to seek opposing opinions .
For example , politicians and others who must publicly defend their beliefs can only be prepared by knowing their ostensible enemy , and they will seek to process and understand an opposing viewpoint .
This exposure , however , can help existing beliefs evolve and become stronger .
The study also showed that age correlates with a bias towards congenial information : younger children were more apt to investigate opposing viewpoints , while older children were increasingly likely to close them out .
This study provides a great deal of information about the way people filter information presented to them , but there is little it can say about the way information is perceived and processed once it is accepted for closer examination .
The researchers note that any bias towards information recalled from memory is somewhat smaller than the one observed when information is selected for processing .
However , bias during processing has yet to be thoroughly investigated , and doing so would be the logical next step in understanding information bias .

Lewis Chessmen : Remarkable Piece of Viking Art
The Lewis chessmen were probably made in Norway about AD 1150 - 1200 by craftsmen in Trondheim , where similar pieces have been found .
Some researchers think that the chessmen were lost or hidden during their transportation from Norway to Viking settlements on the east coast of Ireland .
They were discovered in 1831 in the vicinity of Uig on the Isle of Lewis , Outer Hebrides , Scotland , under rather unclear circumstances .
According to a local legend , the Lewis chessmen were stolen by a cabin boy from a ship anchored in Loch Hamnaway soon after 1600 AD .
A local cowherd known as Ghillie Ruadh killed the boy and buried the chessmen at Uig .
Before being hanged in Stornoway for other crimes , Ghillie made a dying confession concerning the murder of the cabin boy .
The trove with the pieces was discovered three hundred years later by a certain Malcolm Macleod from Pennydonald who sold them to Captain Roderick Ryrie .
All that is certain is that in April 1831 Ryrie exhibited the chessmen at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland .
Soon after , 10 pieces were sold to Kirkpatrick Sharpe and the rest purchased on behalf of the British Museum .
The Lewis chessmen are 78 : there are 8 kings , 8 queens , 16 bishops , 15 knights , 12 rooks and 19 pawns that belonged to at least five different sets .
The majority of the pieces are of walrus ivory and a few of whale teeth .
Along with the chess pieces , 14 round tablemen for the game of tables were found , as well as an ivory belt buckle , with the total of 93 artifacts .
None of them was used much before hidden or lost .
According to some reports , a few pieces were stained red when found , so the chessboard may have been red and white .
The knights are shown mounted on horses , holding spears and shields .
The rooks are warders with a shield and sword ( some of them are portrayed as berserkers who bite their shields in fury ) .
For modern audience the glum expression of many pieces seems rather comic , whereas for contemporary Viking chess players these should embody strength , ferocity , and , in some cases , wise contemplation .
The pawns have the shape of small obelisks .
Early in 2007 a dispute concerning the appropriate place to display the Lewis chessmen arose .
Linda Fabiani , the Scottish Culture Minister , stated that it is unacceptable that 82 pieces are in the British Museum , while only 11 pieces are in Scotland .
In response , UK Culture Minister Margaret Hodge has dismissed such a position as “ nonsense ” , pointing that no one requires the mummies in the National Museum in Edinburgh sent back to Egypt .
It has also been stated that between about 1150 - 1200 , when the chessmen were probably made and buried , the Western Isles were part of Norway , not Scotland .
Until now the controversy does not seem to be quite settled .

Face Recognition Solution 's Visitor Management System deals with the security provided at various premises from the unauthenticated or unwanted visitors .
This electronic solution can overcome the various shortcomings that used to be faced by the primitive security methods for checking the visitors at a particular premise .
Basic Principle for Visitor Management System :
Our visitor management system is based on face recognition technology that means , instead of the pen and paper security method now you can rely on the electronic system .
This biometric system is based on recognizing the facial details of the individual .
During the initial visit of the individual , the system captures the facial details and stores the data in the database of the computer .
In the next visit , the system matches the newly captured facial details with the old stored patterns .
If the system finds a match it grants the permission otherwise it denies .
System Features :
The various features that make the system unique and different than other existing security systems are :
Visitor management system is the easiest and safest method of security .

WICHITA , Kan. , Aug. 10 ( UPI ) --
A federal investigation is underway to determine if more than one person was involved in abortion doctor George Tiller 's death , Kansas authorities said .
Scott Roeder , 51 , of Kansas City , Kan. , is charged with first - degree murder in the fatal shooting of Tiller May 31 at the church where Tiller served as an usher .

Roeder pleaded innocent and is being held in a Wichita jail on $ 20 million bail with trial scheduled for Sept. 21 .
Federal agents , who declined to comment on an investigation , have spoken with many who have visited Roeder since the shooting , including two convicted abortion clinic bombers and several people who signed a declaration defending the killing of abortion providers , the Kansas City ( Mo. ) Star reported Monday .
" This guy has been in the hard - core anti-abortion circle for a long time , and there has been a pattern of communication and encouragement among these people , " Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation , said .
Supporters of Roeder deny a conspiracy , including Jennifer McCoy , a Wichita resident who visits Roeder , the Star reported .
McCoy was convicted in the 1990s of trying to burn abortion clinics in Virginia .

The supermarket expects to hand out around 700,000 lottery cards
An Italian supermarket chain has launched a lottery with a difference - the prize is a job .
Lotteries in Italy are known for their gigantic payouts .
One recent prize in the state - run Superenalotto was a huge 146.9 m euros ( £ 128.3 m ; $ 211.8 m ) .
But the winners in this one will instead be offered one of 10 jobs guaranteed for a year at one of the company 's stores .
The winning tickets are to be drawn next month .
The unusual lottery is being run by a supermarket chain based at Varese in northern Italy .
For the next month anyone who spends about 28 euros ( $ 40 ; £ 24 ) on groceries will get a lottery ticket for a job .
All 10 places on offer come with contracts that could be renewable .
To be eligible , participants must be over 18 and residents of Italy .
The supermarket says it expects to hand out around 700,000 lottery cards .
Although bosses are not matching the prize of the recent nationwide lottery , in the current economic climate the winners of its prize draw may well feel like they have won the jackpot as well .
By Dale Gieringer , Director , CA NORML
Like many medical marijuana users , Kristin Redeen needed additional prescription medications for her severe chronic pain .
For seven years she had been treated at a private pain clinic in the Central Valley , where a doctor maintained her on Percocet , a semi-synthetic opioid .
One day Kristin was unexpectedly asked to submit a urine sample .
“ They already knew about my medical marijuana use , ” says Kristin , who contacted California NORML .
“ I did n’t think I was doing anything wrong . ”
When the test came back , Kristin was informed that the clinic would no longer renew her prescription because she had tested positive for an illegal controlled substance .
Her doctor at the clinic cited legal concerns , claiming –falsely – that DEA regulations forbid giving prescription narcotics to users of marijuana or other illegal drugs .
Kristin was cut off from her Percocet and began suffering seizures .
She finally found a physician who was willing to prescribe her another opioid , Vicodin , but only at low doses insufficient to relieve her constant pain .
Kristin is one of a growing number of medical marijuana patients discriminated against by pain clinics .
“ I must have heard of 25 cases this year , ” says Doug Hiatt , an attorney in Washington state .
“ It ’s Jim Crow medicine . ”
NORML has received a surge of complaints within the last six months .
Many medical marijuana users report that they can’t find a clinic willing to take them on .
Others , like Kristin , have been abandoned by clinics that suddenly adopted aggressive drug - screening policies .
Clinics say they are legally compelled to drug - test chronic pain patients so as to avoid liability for overdoses and diversion of prescription drugs , particularly opioids such as oxycontin – which have nothing to do with cannabis .
Chronic pain patients have good reason to object to being denied medical access to cannabis .
Chronic pain is the leading indication for medical cannabis use , accounting for 90 % of the patients in Oregon ’s medical marijuana program .
More than 60 studies have shown cannabinoids to be effective in pain relief , according to a compilation by the International Association of Cannabis Medicine which includes four controlled studies of smoked marijuana by California ’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research .
Studies indicate that cannabis interacts synergistically with opioids in such a way as to improve pain relief [ 1 , 2 ] .
California medical cannabis specialists consistently report that patients are able to reduce use of opioids –typically by 50 % – when they add cannabis to their regimen .
Cannabis can therefore be seen as a gateway drug leading away from opioid addiction .
Nevertheless , patients are being pressured to stop using cannabis if they want to get prescription opioids .
To their dismay , patients have to pay for the drug tests at their own ( or their insurers ’ ) expense .
Carol , a chronic pain patient who had been treated for seven years by the same clinic without any testing , reports that she was billed $ 325 for a urine screen .
The balance of the bill , which totaled $ 1,601 , was paid by her insurer .
Carol says her doctor told her that “ the DEA requires him to drug test all his clients , that he has no choice , it is the law . ”
In fact , there is no law requiring clinics to drug screen patients for marijuana .
“ It ’s BS , ” says Hiatt .
Not a single case is known in which pain doctors have been sued or prosecuted for allowing medical marijuana use along with opiates .
Prosecutors have argued that marijuana might be obtained on the illicit market in trade for prescription drugs , though such a scenario seems implausible in medical cannabis states .
“ It ’s unwarranted paranoia , ” says Gregory Carter , MD , one of the few practicing pain experts who recommend marijuana in Washington .
Given that cannabis is notably less toxic and addictive than other prescription narcotics , it seems highly ironic that pain clinics are discouraging its use .
The prejudice against marijuana has nothing to do with medical science , but rather with political and legal pressures to crack down on prescription drug use .
Non-medical use of prescription drugs has recently emerged as the nation ’s number - one drug problem du jour .
A new government report , ominously entitled the “ National Prescription Drug Threat Assessment , ” reported 8,500 deaths in 2005 from prescription pain relievers ( mainly opioids ) , more than double the 2001 total .
“ Diversion and abuse of prescription drugs are a threat to our public health and safety – similar to the threat posed by illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine , ” warned Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske .
The Pain Specialists ’ Meeting
The 2009 American Pain Society Convention in San Diego included a panel on “ Cannabinoids in Pain Management , ” chaired by Dr. Mark Ware of McGill University .
Dr. Andrea Hohmann , an expert on stress - level analgesia from the University of Georgia , presented evidence from rodent studies which showed that cannabinoids suppress nociceptive processing through both the CB1 and CB2 receptors , and that endocannabinoids , including 2 - AG and anandamide , help suppress pain .
Donald Abrams , MD , of the University of California at San Francisco , discussed his studies showing that inhaled marijuana significantly reduced neuropathic pain experienced by HIV patients .
Cannabinoids and opioids interact synergistically on separate but parallel pain receptors , Abrams said .
He is conducting another study on combined use of cannabinoids and opioids , preliminary results of which appear promising .
Dr. Ware discussed studies involving the variety of cannabinoid medicines available in Canada , which include dronabinol , Sativex , Nabilone , and herbal THC .
All of them have demonstrated efficacy in pain relief .
Cannabis is now recognized as a “ third line ” agent for neuropathic pain in Canada .
Noting that that its adverse effects are mild to moderate , Ware concluded that “ cannabinoid analgesia is the real thing . ”
During the question session , your correspondent asked why it was that , in light of evidence that cannabis was so useful in pain therapy , there appeared to be an upsurge in drug testing to prevent its use .
The panelists could offer no explanation .
We moved on to the exhibition hall , where drug testing companies were conspicuously displaying their wares .
Their exhibits showed how well their products could monitor usage of opiates .
The exhibitors seemed surprised when we told them that their products were being used against medical marijuana .
One of the more sophisticated exhibitors was Ameritox , which boasted panels for distinguishing a dozen different opioids plus numerous sedatives , tricyclic anti-depressants , barbiturates , and stimulants as well as “ drugs of abuse , ” among them marijuana .
Their saleswoman seemed surprised to hear that the Ameritox test was being used to screen out medical marijuana patients .
She said that clinics could easily order the screens without the marijuana if they wanted .
Another company boasted how their test could be administered at the doctor ’s office , thereby allowing the doctor rather than the lab to collect the bill .
Finally , we spoke to a legal expert on pain medication , Ms. Jennifer Bolen , a former prosecutor turned defense attorney , who has a useful website devoted to the subject :
www.legalsideofpain.com.
Ms Bolen pointed to three recent developments that have increased the pressure to conduct drug screening of pain patients .
First , pain doctors have suffered a string of stinging legal judgments for over - prescribing opioids to patients who subsequently overdosed .
One notable example involved Dr. Thomas Merrill of Florida , whose life sentence was sustained by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals last year .
This February , a prestigious panel of the American Pain Society issued “ New Guidelines for Prescribing Opioid Pain Drugs ” which counsels that “ diligent monitoring of patients is essential .
“
The report specifically recommends periodic drug screens for chronic opioid patients at risk for aberrant drug behavior , though it does n’t mention cannabis .
Lastly , under legislation that took effect this year , the FDA has new authority to require pharmaceutical companies to implement “ risk management ” programs to prevent consumer drug misuse .
Medical cannabis patients have no easy remedy to the current drug testing onslaught .
In the absence of dire bodily harm , malpractice suits are of no avail .
In general , pain clinics have no legal obligation to treat anyone .
They commonly require patients to sign contracts allowing them to conduct drug screening at will .
Nonetheless , patients may have good grounds to complain to their state medical boards .
This is particularly the case where they have been abandoned by their doctors after being made dependent on prescription narcotics .
The ultimate recourse is to educate doctors , many of whom remain woefully ignorant of the literature on medical marijuana and chronic pain .
At the APS convention we encountered a distinguished pain specialist from San Diego , who joked about having enjoyed the marijuana muchies with his son , but averred that he would n’t let his patients use it , on the grounds that it would n’t be useful , and anyway smoked medicine is bad for the lungs .
Like most convention attendees , he had missed the panel on medical cannabis , where Dr. Abrams had discussed the use of smokeless vaporizers .
Still , good physicians should be open to persuasion from patients .
Cynthia , a severe chronic pain patient .
had frequented the same clinic for 10 years when she was confronted with a surprise urine test .
In addition to prescription opiates , she had been using medical marijuana , though her recommendation was four years out of date .
The test cost her $ 100 and her insurer $ 500 more .
On finding her positive for marijuana , her doctor informed her that she would have to reduce her cannabinoid level to zero .
After a heart - to - heart talk , in which she explained to him how she had been able to reduce her opiate use to minimal levels thanks to medical cannabis , her doctor relented .
“ I feel really lucky , ’ says Cynthia , “ You have to feel out the doctor .
We have a special relationship .
I do n’t think he plans to do this with all his patients . ”

Son Of Darts
This contest ended on 20 Jun 2010
The Darts Problem
Suppose that you have a dartboard that is divided into R regions .
Each dartboard region has a positive integer value associated with it .
Further suppose that you have D darts and that you throw each of them at the dartboard .
Each dart either lands in one of the board 's R regions or misses the board altogether .
Your score is the sum of the values for the regions in which the darts land .
A dart that misses the board contributes nothing to your score .
If multiple darts land in the same region , you accumulate the value for that region multiple times .
For example , suppose that R = 5 , that the dartboard regions have values ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 ) , and that D = 3 .
If your three darts land in regions 2 , 4 and 11 you score 17 points .
If one dart misses the board and the other two land in region 7 you score 14 points .
The Darts Problem is this : for a given R and D , determine what values should be associated with a dartboard 's R regions in order to maximize the smallest score unattainable by throwing D darts .
For example , again suppose that R = 5 and D = 3 .
If you choose the values ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 ) for the board 's 5 regions , then the smallest score unattainable with your 3 darts is 27 .
But if you choose the values ( 1 , 4 , 6 , 14 , 15 ) the smallest unattainable score is 37 .
The second choice of values is therefore a better choice for 3 darts and 5 regions .
By the way , the Darts Problem is more commonly known as the Postage Stamp problem , wherein you are asked to determine which R denominations of stamps to issue in order to maximize the smallest postage unattainable with D stamps .
The Contest
Submit ( see How to Enter , below ) your best solutions to the Darts Problem for the following values of R and D :
D = number of darts R = number of dartboard regions 3 1 through 40 4 1 through 30 5 1 through 20 6 1 through 10
Thus , there are 100 problems and you are asked to submit 100 solutions .
You can submit more than one solution for the same problem , but if you do we count only your best solution .
There is no penalty for submitting multiple solutions for the same problem .
See The Scoring System , below , to learn how we determine the winner .

Do not submit entries under more than one account .
The Scoring System
Each time you submit a solution we will merge it with your prior solutions , if any .
The result will be a virtual entry containing your best solutions for each of the 100 problems .
We will give each of these 100 solutions a subscore from 0 to 1 and their sum will be your contest score .
We score the individual solutions as follows .
If your solution is the best that was submitted for that problem , we give it 1 point ; otherwise we give it only a fraction of a point .
The fraction is the solution 's smallest - unattainable - score divided by the best smallest - unattainable - score submitted by anyone for that same problem .
In case of a tie , preference is given to the entrant whose latest improved solution was submitted least recently .
Let 's walk through a simplified example .
Suppose that we reduce the contest to only 3 problems -- finding the dartboard regions that maximize the smallest unattainable score in these cases :
4 darts , 2 regions 4 darts , 3 regions 4 darts , 4 regions
Further suppose that we have only 3 entrants ( Dana , Pat and Syd ) and that these are their best solutions for each of the 3 problems :
Dana Pat Syd 4 darts , 2 regions 1 , 2 1 , 3 1 , 4 4 darts , 3 regions 1 , 4 , 7 1 , 2 , 3 1 , 3 , 5 4 darts , 4 regions 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
The smallest unattainable scores corresponding to these solutions are :
Dana Pat Syd Best Solution 4 darts , 2 regions 9 11 11 11 4 darts , 3 regions 17 13 17 17 4 darts , 4 regions 23 23 17 23
The total scores for each entrant are computed as follows :
Dana Pat Syd 4 darts , 2 regions 9/11 = 0.82 11/11 = 1.00 11/11 = 1.00 4 darts , 3 regions 17/17 = 1.00 13/17 = 0.76 17/17 = 1.00 4 darts , 4 regions 23/23 = 1.00 23/23 = 1.00 17/23 = 0.74 Total 2.82 2.76 2.74
Finally , the standings page listing is as follows :
Rank Score Contestant 1 2.82 Dana 2 2.76 Pat 3 2.74 Syd

The fig - tree in Palestine bears two or three crops a year .
Josephus , indeed , says that fruit might be found on the trees in Judaea for ten months out of the twelve .
Commonly at the beginning of April the trees that still grow out of the rocks between Bethany and Jerusalem are bare both of leaves and fruit , and so probably it was now with all but the single tree which attracted our Lord 's notice .
It was in full foliage , and being so far in advance of its fellows it might not unnaturally have been expected to have had , in the first week of April , the " first ripe fruit " ( Hosea 9:10 ) , which usually was gathered in May .
So , in Song Song of Solomon 2:13 , the appearance of the " green figs " coincides with that of the flowers of spring , and the time of the singing of birds .
The illustrations from the branches and leaves of the fig - tree in Luke 21:29 - 30 , suggest that the season was a somewhat forward one .
On the special difficulty connected with St. Mark 's statement , " the time of figs was not yet , " see Note on Mark 11:13 .
Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever .-- From the lips of one of like passions with ourselves , the words might seem the utterance of impatient disappointment .
Here they assume the character of a solemn judgment passed not so much on the tree as on that of which it became the representative .
The Jews , in their show of the " leaves " of outward devotion , in the absence of the " fruits " of righteousness , were as that barren tree .
But a few weeks before ( Luke 13:6 ) He had taken the fig - tree to which " a man came seeking fruit and finding none , " as a parable of the state of Israel .
Then the sentence , " Cut it down , " had been delayed , as in the hope of a possible amendment .
Now , what He saw flashed upon
Him in a moment ( if we may so speak ) as the parable embodied .
The disappointment of the expectations which He had formed in His human craving for food was like the disappointment of the owner of the fig - tree in the parable .
The sentence which
He now passed on the tree , and its immediate fulfilment , were symbols of the sentence and the doom which were about to fall on the unrepentant and unbelieving people .
Presently .-- The word is used in its older sense of " immediately . "

The tree stood all alone in a conspicuous situation by the roadside , as if courting observation .
It was allowable to pluck and eat fruit in an orchard ( Deuteronomy 23:24 , 25 ) ; but this tree , placed where it was , seemed to be common property , belonging to no private owner .
The sight of the leaves thereon , as St. Mark tells us , attracted the notice of Christ , who beheld with pleasure the prospect of relieving his long abstinence with the refreshment of cool and juicy fruit .
Knowing the nature of the tree , and that under some circumstances the fruit ripens before the leaves are fully out , Jesus naturally expected to find on it some figs fit to eat .
Further , besides the fruit which comes to maturity in the usual way during the summer , there are often late figs produced in autumn which hang on the tree during winter , and ripen at the reawakening of vegetation in the spring .
The vigour of this particular tree was apparently proved by the luxuriance of its foliage , and it might reasonably be expected to retain some of its winter produce ..
It was all outward show , promise without performance , seeming precocity with no adequate results .
There is no question here of Christ 's omniscience being at fault .
He acted as a man would act ; he was not deceived himself nor did he deceive the apostles , though they at first misapprehended his purpose .
The whole action was symbolical , and was meant so to appear .
In strict propriety of conduct , as a man led by the appearance of the tree might act , he carried out the figure , at the same time showing , by his treatment of this inanimate object , that he had something higher in view , and that he does not mean that which his outward conduct seemed to imply .
He is enacting a parable where all the parts are in due keeping , and all have their twofold signification in the world of nature and the world of grace .
The hunger is real , the tree is real , the expectation of fruit legitimate , the barrenness disappointing and criminal ; the spiritual side , however , is left to be inferred , and , as we shall see , only one of many possible lessons is drawn from the result of the incident ..
Such is the sentence passed on this ostentations tree .
Christ addresses it as if replying to the profession made by its show of leaves .
It had the sap of life , it had power to produce luxuriant leaves ; therefore it might and ought to have borne fruit .
It vaunted itself as being superior to its neighbours , and the boast was utterly empty .
The process was doubtless gradual , commencing at Christ 's word , and continuing till the tree died ; but St. Matthew completes the account at once , giving in one picture the event , with its surroundings and results .
It was a moral necessity that what had incurred Christ 's censure should perish ; the spiritual controlled the material ; the higher overbore the lower .
Thus the designed teaching was placed in visible shape before the eyes , and silently uttered its important lesson .
It has been remarked ( by Neander ) that we are not to suppose that the tree thus handled was previously altogether sound and healthy .
Its show of leaves at an unusual period without fruit may point to some abnormal development of activity which was consequent upon some radical defect .
Had it been in vigorous health , it would not have been a fitting symbol of the Jewish Church ; nor would it have corresponded with the idea which Christ designed to bring to the notice of his apostles .
There was already some process at work which would have issued in decay , and Christ 's curse merely accelerated this natural result .
This is considered to be the only instance in which our Lord exerted his miraculous power in destruction ; all his other actions were beneficent , saving , gracious .
The drowning of the swine at Gadara was only permitted for a wise purpose ; it was not commanded or inflicted by him .
The whole transaction in our text is mysterious .
That the Son of man should show wrath against a senseless tree , as tree , is , of course , not conceivable .
Them was an apparent unfitness , if not injustice , in the proceeding , which at once demonstrated that the tree was not the real object of the action - that something more important was in view .
Christ does not treat trees as moral agents , responsible for life and action .
He uses inanimate objects to convey lessons to men , dealing with them according to his good pleasure , even his supreme will , which is the law by which they are controlled .
In themselves they have no fault and incur no punishment , but they are treated in such a way as to profit the nobler creatures of God 's hand .
There may have been two reasons for Christ 's conduct which were not set prominently forward at the time .
First , he desired to show his power , his absolute control , over material forces , so that , in what was about to happen to him , his apostles might be sure that he suffered not through weakness or compulsion , but because he willed to have it so .
This would prepare his followers for his own and their coming trials .
Then there was another great lesson taught by the sign .
The fig tree is a symbol of the Jewish Church .
The prophets had used both it .
and the vine in this connection ( comp. Hosea 9:10 ) , and our Lord himself makes an unmistakable allusion in his parable of the fig tree planted in the vineyard , from which the owner for three years sought fruit in vain ( Luke 13:6 , etc. ) .
Many of his subsequent discourses are , as it were , commentaries upon this incident ( see vers .
28 - 44 ; Matthew 22:1 - 14 Matthew 23 - 25 . ) .
Here was a parable enacted .
The Saviour had seen this tree , the Jewish Church , afar off , looking down upon it from heaven ; it was one , single , standing conspicuous among all nations as that whereon the Lord had lavished most care , that which ought to have shown the effect of this culture in abundant produce of holiness and righteousness .
But what was the result ?
Boasting to be children of Abraham , the special heritage of Jehovah , gifted with highest privileges , the sole possessors of the knowledge of God , the Israelites professed to have what no other people had , and were in reality empty and bare .
There was plenty of outward show - rites , ceremonies , scrupulous observances , much speaking - but no real devotion , no righteousness , no heart worship , no good works .
Other nations , indeed , were equally fruitless , but they did not profess to be holy ; they were sinners , and offered no cloak for their sinfulness .
The Jews were no less unrighteous ; but they were hypocrites , and boasted of the good which they had not .
Other nations were unproductive , for their time had not come ; but for Israel the season had arrived ; she ought to have been the first to accept the Messiah , to unite the new with the old fruit , to pass from the Law to the gospel , and to learn and practise the lesson of faith .
Perfect fruit was not yet to be expected ; but Israel 's sin was that she vaunted her perfection , counted herself sound and whole , while rotten at the very core , and barren of all good results .
Her falsehood , hypocrisy , and arrogant complacency were fearfully punished .
The terms of the curse pronounced by the Judge are very emphatic .
It denounces perpetual barrenness on the Jewish Church and people .
From Judaea was to have gone forth the healing of the nations ; from it all peoples of the earth were to be blessed .
The complete fulfilment of this promise is no longer in the literal Israel ; she is nothing in the world ; no one resorts to her for food and refreshment ; she has none to offer the wayfarer .
For eighteen centuries has that fruitlessness continued ; the withered tree still stands , a monument of unbelief and its punishment .
The Lord 's sentence , " forever , " must be understood with some limitation .
In his parable of the fig tree , which adumbrates the last days , he intimates that it shall some day bud and blossom , and be clothed once more with leaf and fruit ; and St. Paul looks forward to the conversion of Israel , when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled ( Romans 11:23 - 26 ) .

The Java Persistence API ( JPA ) has taken the Java development world by storm and is now recognized as the enterprise standard for object - relational persistence .
The masses have settled into using JPA as a means to persist Java objects to relational databases , but sometimes they require features that are either missing or not fully specified in the 1.0 release .
JPA 2.0 is filling in the feature gap and introducing many of the additional features that developers have asked for .
We will examine where the current standard stops and where the new 2.0 release continues on .
We will discuss some of the tricks to using some of the new features and when it may be appropriate to use them .
This session will be suitable for anyone either using JPA or planning to use it at some point in the future .
People that are just curious about what JPA offers and what it will offer in the future may also find this session interesting .
Recently by Gary North : How To Create a New World Reserve Currency
John Maynard Keynes changed his economic views every few years .
His 1936 book , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , was his last book .
He spent the war years in the British Treasury .
He died in 1946 .
So , he did not change his mind again .
Keynes ’ final book was a defense of government spending .
This is why the book was hailed as a masterpiece .
It backed up what all Western governments were already doing : spending money on welfare projects and running massive deficits .
Keynes believed that there could be permanent depression and price deflation .
He said that prices do not always clear markets by balancing supply and demand .
The General Theory is a convoluted , deliberately incomprehensible book devoted to disproving the fundamental premise of all economics , namely , that the search for profit motivates buyers and sellers to exchange scarce resources .
If the price is n’t right , the seller of resources ( buyer of money ) suffers a loss .
He cannot easily find buyers of his goods .
In contrast , the buyer of resources ( seller of money ) has lots of people bidding against each other in order to get his money .
Money is the most marketable commodity , said Ludwig von Mises in 1912 in The Theory of Money and Credit .
Because of this , sellers of goods and services will eventually deal at some price .
They can not use all of their output .
They need money to survive in a division - of - labor economy .
They buy money by selling products .
The markets will clear .
The depression will end .
Keynes argued that this is not true .
He said that there can be an economy in which falling prices do not clear the market .
The economy can be in an equilibrium with unemployed resources .
In attempting to prove this point , opposed to the logic of economics after Adam Smith ( “ supply and demand ” ) , he resorted to arguments proposed by a pair of crackpots .
One was an engineer , C. H. Douglas .
Douglas founded the Social Credit movement in the 1920’s .
The other was Silvio Gesell , an obscure merchant , journalist , and farmer who had briefly served as the People ’s Representative for Finances for the one - week Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919 .
Both men had a theory of exchange that required the state to inject fiat money into the economy in order to balance supply and demand .
For them , money was not an outgrowth of voluntary exchange .
It was and is a ministry of the state .
C. H. DOUGLAS
Answering Major Douglas ’s crackpottery is easy .
I did it in 1993 in my book , Salvation Through Inflation .
He was convinced that markets needed fiat money produced by the government in order to clear .
He argued that when businesses repay loans after production , this destroys money .
Then consumers cannot afford to buy the output .
This was a distinction between finance credit and Real Credit .
( Note : whenever you see the word Real capitalized , followed by a noun — also capitalized — be on the alert : a crackpot theory is close at hand . )
It did not occur to him that the banks immediately lend out the paid off loans .
That is how they stay in business .
This error is found in most underconsumption theories .
There is always a money bleed - off factor .
Old money goes there to die , like the elephant burial grounds .
The consumers cannot afford to buy .
Every variation of this theory is nuts , with one exception : when bank depositors withdraw currency and do not spend it , thereby not allowing sellers to deposit the spent currency in their banks .
When there is a run on a bank in a fractional reserve system , there is money heaven .
The inverted pyramid of fiat money shrinks , just as it expanded before .
But this has nothing to do with paying off loans .
Douglas offered another theory — conceptually different — which he imagined was irrefutable .
He called it the A + B theorem .
I devoted an appendix to the A + B theorem in my book .
He argued that there is a break in the flow of payments .
A factory pays Group A wages and dividends .
It pays Group B for raw materials , to cover bank fees , and other “ external ” expenses .
His theorem assumed that payments to Group B do not constitute purchasing power for the output of the factory .
The money ceases to provide consumer demand .
So , the state must intervene and create money .
This is another variation of his broken flow of funds argument .
Whenever you see any variation of the broken flow of funds argument , you are in the presence of crackpottery .
It does not matter how many equations or graphs the author provides .
He is an economic crackpot .
The supreme error in Social Credit is the error in all scenarios of price deflation , other than one that relies on the extinguishing of money due to a reversal of fractional reserves .
They all fail to follow the money .
They speak of saving as if it were a system for hiding paper currency under a mattress .
They refuse to answer this crucial question :
What does the bank do with the money that a consumer deposits instead of spending ?
Put another way :
What analytical or conceptual difference does it make whether a saver deposits a dollar his bank , which the bank will lend , or whether he spends it , enabling the seller to deposit the dollar in his bank , which his bank will lend ?
Keynes wrote this about Major Douglas .
Since the war there has been a spate of heretical theories of under- consumption , of which those of Major Douglas are the most famous .
The strength of Major Douglas ’s advocacy has , of course , largely depended on orthodoxy having no valid reply to much of his destructive criticism .
When he wrote of “ orthodoxy , ” he meant classical economics : price as the way to clear a market .
Anyone with even a smattering of classical economics can refute the utterly nonsensical theories of C. H. Douglas .
Nobody bothered .
My book , published in 1993 , was the first book - length refutation , as far as I can tell .
The only reason why I wrote it was to answer a Social Credit promoter who said that I was intellectually incapable of refuting him or Douglas .
It took me maybe three weeks to write that book in my spare time .
Maybe it took a month .
Keynes continued .
He grew incoherent , as you will see .
On the other hand , the detail of his diagnosis , in particular the so - called A + B theorem , includes much mere mystification .
If Major Douglas had limited his B-items to the financial provisions made by entrepreneurs to which no current expenditure on replacements and renewals corresponds , he would be nearer the truth .
But even in that case it is necessary to allow for the possibility of these provisions being offset by new investment in other directions as well as by increased expenditure on consumption .
Major Douglas is entitled to claim , as against some of his orthodox adversaries , that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the outstanding problem of our economic system .
( General Theory , pp. 370—71 )
Keynes was incoherent .
This was deliberate .
Why do I say Keynes was deliberately incoherent ?
Because when he chose to write clearly , he was a master of prose .
Read The Economic Consequences of the Peace ( 1919 ) or Essays in Biography .
When he could not sustain an argument , he adopted the strategy of incoherence .
Most of The General Theory is incoherent .
There is not one argument in Douglas ’ writings — and I have read all of his books — that is an accurate description of how the market works , banking works , or entrepreneurs work .
To the degree that Keynes accepted any idea in Social Credit , he suffered from the same intellectually crippling handicap .
SILVIO GESELL
Keynes devoted a long section of Chapter 23 to Gesell .
This might seem strange , except for the fact that Keynes ’ theory depends on the same conceptual error as Gesell ’s : the inability of the rate of interest to allocate the supply and demand of capital .
He began by admitting that he had long thought of Gesell as a monetary crank .
Keynes ’ initial instincts were correct .
It is convenient to mention at this point the strange , unduly neglected prophet Silvio Gesell ( 1862 — 1930 ) , whose work contains flashes of deep insight and who only just failed to reach down to the essence of the matter .
In the post - war years his devotees bombarded me with copies of his works ; yet , owing to certain palpable defects in the argument , I entirely failed to discover their merit .
As is often the case with imperfectly analysed intuitions , their significance only became apparent after I had reached my own conclusions in my own way .
Meanwhile , like other academic economists , I treated his profoundly original strivings as being no better than those of a crank .
Since few of the readers of this book are likely to be well acquainted with the significance of Gesell , I will give to him what would be otherwise a disproportionate space ( p. 353 ) .
He said that Gesell ’s main book “ as a whole may be described as the establishment of an anti-Marxian socialism , a reaction against laissez - faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx in being based on a repudiation instead of on an acceptance of the classical hypotheses , and on an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition .
I believe that the future will learn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx ” ( page 355 ) .
This is an astounding statement .
It is rarely quoted by Keynes ’ disciples , whose name is legion .
His disciples still think Gesell was a crank .
Keynes then praised Gesell ’s theory at the place where it coincides with his own .
I will not bore you with the details .
They are found on pages 355 — 56 .
Gesell attacked the idea that a free market interest rate allocates capital rationally — in short , the heart of Keynes ’ economics .
Then he praised Gesell at the point of Gesell ’s crackpottery : stamped money .
This was money that had to be spent by consumers fast .
Why ?
Because the government would reduce to zero value dated pieces of paper money .
Holders of money would have to stand in line at the Post Office each month to get their money stamped in order to restore it to face value .
They would have to pay a fee for this service .
Conclusion ?
Spend it fast !
This was the proposal of a failed Communist finance minister and his acolyte , John Maynard Keynes , the most important economist of the 20th century .
The only rival to Keynes in academia today on the money question is Irving Fisher , and he held the same screwball view , as Keynes pointed out .
The incompleteness of his theory is doubtless the explanation of his work having suffered neglect at the hands of the academic world .
Nevertheless he had carried his theory far enough to lead him to a practical recommendation , which may carry with it the essence of what is needed , though it is not feasible in the form in which he proposed it .
He argues that the growth of real capital is held back by the money - rate of interest , and that if this brake were removed the growth of real capital would be , in the modern world , so rapid that a zero money - rate of interest would probably be justified , not indeed forthwith , but within a comparatively short period of time .
Thus the prime necessity is to reduce the money - rate of interest , and this , he pointed out , can be effected by causing money to incur carrying - costs just like other stocks of barren goods .
This led him to the famous prescription of “ stamped ” money , with which his name is chiefly associated and which has received the blessing of Professor Irving Fisher .
According to this proposal currency notes ( though it would clearly need to apply as well to some forms at least of bank - money ) would only retain their value by being stamped each month , like an insurance card , with stamps purchased at a post office .
The cost of the stamps could , of course , be fixed at any appropriate figure ( pp. 356—57 ) .
The idea behind stamped money is sound .
It is , indeed , possible that means might be found to apply it in practice on a modest scale ( p. 357 ) .
Here is the fusion of three great monetary cranks : Keynes , Irving Fisher , and Gesell .
All three of them attacked the idea of the gold standard .
All three of them believed that the economy needs fiat money to operate efficiently .
All three believed that experts should decide what rate of monetary inflation is appropriate .
Then there was the fourth great monetary crank : Milton Friedman , who was Fisher ’s disciple .
He proposed this solution : central bank expansion of the money supply by 3 % to 5 % per annum .
At least it made better sense than stamped money .
( To those who gasp in horror at my assertion that Friedman was a monetary crank , I recommend that they read Murray Rothbard ’s analysis of Friedman ’s monetary theory .
The section on “ Money and the Business Cycle ” is the relevant section .
It is short and to the point . )
I define a monetary crank as someone who proposes a system of causation for money different from causation for other market phenomena .
Ludwig von Mises subsumed monetary theory under the same logic that governs all market processes : Theory of Money and Credit .
In contrast , a monetary crank tells us that private property , entrepreneurship , and the forces of supply and demand explain causation in the overall economy , but then insists that money is different , that government - created and government - planned money is required to balance supply and demand for all other goods and services .
He abandons his theory of economic causation when he gets to money .
Fisher and Friedman were monetary cranks .
MONETARY CRANKS PROMOTE FIAT MONEY
None of the four believed that a free market money system would allow prices , including the interest rate , to allocate capital , apart from government creation of money to assure the clearing of markets .
They saw money as a government function .
They did not trust the free market to provide a market - clearing monetary system under a legal system that prohibits fraud but does not allow government - created money .
None of them accepted the international gold standard .
Keynes hated it .
It kept government and central banks from inflating .
This kept governments from creating policies that would match supply and demand .
I have pointed out in the preceding chapter that , under the system of domestic laissez - faire and an international gold standard such as was orthodox in the latter half of the nineteenth century , there was no means open to a government whereby to mitigate economic distress at home except through the competitive struggle for markets .
For all measures helpful to a state of chronic or intermittent under - employment were ruled out , except measures to improve the balance of trade on income account ( p. 382 ) .
What was Keynes after ?
A fascist state : the fusion of private ownership and socialism .
It is not the ownership of the instruments of production which it is important for the State to assume .
If the State is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them , it will have accomplished all that is necessary .
Moreover , the necessary measures of socialisation can be introduced gradually and without a break in the general traditions of society ( p. 378 ) .
This is why , in his preface to the German edition ( 1936 ) , he wrote that “ the theory of aggregated production , which is the point of the following book , nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state [ eines totalen Staates ] than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez - faire . ”
Keynes refused to accept the free market explanation of the Great Depression , that it had been created by central banks that had inflated , then ceased to inflate : the boom - bust cycle based on fractional reserve banking .
He rejected the idea that governments had created price floors to protect special interests , and therefore that did not allow the clearing of markets .
He blamed the free market for not balancing supply and demand through price competition .
He rejected Mises , Hayek , and Robbins ( p. 192 ) , never bothering to mention Robbins ’ The Great Depression ( 1934 ) , which is as clear as The General Theory is muddled .
It was published by his own publisher , Macmillan .
He completely ignored Chester Phillips ’ book , Bank Credit ( 1931 ) , published by the American branch of Macmillan .
To defend his theory , he relied on two deflationists whose theory rested on the inability of the free market to create money as part of the market - clearing process .
He argued that deflation was inescapable without government intervention : the managed economy .
CONCLUSION
Keynesians are deflationists , meaning “ the free market will produce permanent depression and deflation apart from government spending and central bank inflation . ”
They believe that , without government spending , huge deficits , and central bank inflation , the economy will go into a deflationary spiral and not recover .
They invoke the paradox of thrift and the liquidity trap as reasons .
Both rely on the same idea : “ money saved in a bank is not simultaneously money lent by the bank to increase production or consumption . ”
It is a fallacious idea .
It is “ currency under the mattress ” economics .
It is “ break in the flow of funds ” economics .
It is crackpottery .
These Keynesian arguments rely ultimately on the monetary theories of C. H. Douglas and Silvio Gesell .
These two crackpots provided the conceptual framework for Keynesian economics .
Keynes ’ disciples , deservedly embarrassed by this inconvenient fact , have done their best to conceal it for 70 years .
Whenever you hear about the need for a government stimulus - spending bill , think “ crackpot economics . ”
Whenever you hear that deficits do n’t matter , think “ crackpot economics . ”
Whenever you hear about the need for quantitative easing , think “ crackpot economics . ”
If you want to be inoculated against Keynes and the crackpots , read Henry Hazlitt ’s line - by - line refutation of The General Theory : The Failure of the ‘ New Economics ’ ( 1959 ) .
Then read Murray Rothbard ’s What Has Government Done to Our Money ? ( 1964 ) .

THE SUPREME COURT regularly has to choose between issuing narrow rulings and issuing broader ones .
Suppose , for instance , that an alleged enemy combatant , who is also an American citizen , argues that he has a right to a hearing before he can be held as a prisoner by the United States .
A minimalist court would be inclined to rule on the combatant ’s particular claim without saying a word about the president ’s general power to wage war on terror , and it would remain silent about the rights of foreigners .
Or suppose that an elderly cancer patient is challenging a state ban on physician - assisted suicide .
A minimalist court would focus on the specific facts of the case and the law in question and refuse to say anything about whether the Constitution provides a more general right to privacy that might encompass a right to commit suicide .
Or imagine that a rejected white applicant is challenging an affirmative - action program at a particular medical school .
A minimalist court might strike down the specific program for some narrow , perceived flaw in its structure without saying whether affirmative action is generally permissible .

Last week , when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered his first commencement address , at Georgetown University Law Center , he offered an original , substantive and unambiguous defense of narrow , minimalist rulings .
Roberts began by arguing in favor of unanimous or near - unanimous opinions , which , he said , serve the rule of law by ensuring that the court ’s message is not confused by its own internal divisions .
He went on to suggest that such a consensus on the part of the justices would , almost by necessity , lead to narrow rulings , limited in most situations to the particular issue at hand .
“ The broader the agreement among the justices , the more likely it is that the decision is on the narrowest possible ground , ” he said .
After all , the nine justices have highly diverse views , and if they are able to join a single opinion , that opinion is likely to be narrow .
This , in the chief justice ’s view , is entirely desirable .
“ If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case , in my view it is necessary not to decide more , ” he said .

Roberts made several approving references to Justice Felix Frankfurter , one of American history ’s great minimalist judges who consistently called for narrow rulings , especially on the issues that divide the nation most sharply .
Writing more than 50 years ago , Frankfurter said that the court has an obligation “ to avoid putting fetters upon the future by needless pronouncements today . ”
It was advice Frankfurter followed himself .
In his opinion voting to strike down President Truman ’s 1952 seizure of the nation ’s steel mills , Frankfurter refused to say much about presidential power in general .
He emphasized that “ rigorous adherence to the narrow scope of the judicial function ” is especially important when national security is at risk , notwithstanding the national “ eagerness to settle -- preferably forever -- a specific problem on the basis of the broadest possible constitutional pronouncement . ”
Roberts referred , with unmistakable enthusiasm , to Frankfurter ’s suggestion that courts should focus on the concrete issue and “ not embarrass the future too much . ”
What makes Roberts ’ argument noteworthy is that it takes a side in one of the deepest and most long - standing divisions in American jurisprudence -- a division that cuts across the standard ideological lines .

One strand of that jurisprudence , associated with justices Antonin Scalia and Hugo Black , prizes broad , ambitious rulings on the ground that they give the clearest signals to lower courts , potential litigants and the nation as a whole .
Scalia has long attacked minimalism on the ground that a court that resolves “ one case at a time ” leaves far too much doubt .
If the court focuses on particular facts , people wo n’t know , for example , when affirmative - action programs are permissible , when government can interfere with private choices and what , exactly , the president may or may not do to protect the nation .
The competing strand , associated with Frankfurter and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor , prizes narrow rulings .
O’Connor emphasized the need for humility , which would require the justices to acknowledge what they do not know and to leave many questions undecided .
In a period in which the court must answer many novel questions , there is a lot to be said for minimalism -- not least because it tries to avoid taking a stand on the most controversial questions and thus shows respect for people with reasonable competing views .
Indeed , narrow rulings help to promote a key goal of societies that are both diverse and free : to make agreement possible where agreement is necessary , while also making agreement unnecessary where agreement is not possible .

It remains to be seen whether the court as a whole might be willing and able to move in the direction of broader consensus and hence narrowness -- something Roberts can encourage in his role as chief justice .
If the court does move in that direction , its movement would have major consequences not only for privacy , free speech and the war on terror but for nearly every question that now divides both the court and the country .
