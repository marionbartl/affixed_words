In their joint interview with the CBS Evening News , John McCain and Sarah Palin described an issue question about Pakistan as gotcha journalism , which now goes to show that Palin and McCain now consider the issues gotcha questions .
Here is the video :

To her credit , Katie Couric defended the question as not a gotcha , but as a question from a voter , but McCain jumped in and tried to save his overmatched running mate by saying , “ No , she was in a conversation with a group of people and talking back and forth .
And … I ’ll let Gov. Palin speak for herself . ”
Notice that he realized that answering for Palin only made her look weaker so he stopped himself and decided to let Palin answer the question .
So if I understand this correctly , a question from a voter is a gotcha question that should be avoided .
The problem is that all the questions about issues appear to be tricky for Palin .
She has not displayed a single area of policy expertise or knowledge yet .
The campaign will never admit this , but Palin has become an anchor around their neck .
While Joe Biden is out there campaigning for Barack Obama alone , Sarah Palin ca n’t be trusted to do even the most basic of television interviews solo .
I do n’t think there is anything wrong with questions about the issues from anyone to a candidate , especially a candidate like Palin who is both widely unknown , and potentially only one 72 year old heartbeat away from the presidency .
If Palin ca n’t handle questions about the issues , then how is she qualified to be vice president ?
In the shorter term , if she can only talk about the issues in terms of talking points , how will she debate Joe Biden on Thursday ?
The McCain campaign looks to be sinking under the weight of its own poor decision making , and Sarah Palin is a walking monument to their mistakes .
Skeptics and believers alike , nothing gets people talking and debating like a good old urban legend or ghost story .
What ’s even better , is when there is no definitive answer as to whether the event happened or not , and why .
Updated 2/11/2020 –
Here at Backpackerverse , this is our modus operandi …to bring to you , our beloved reader the most interesting and sometimes ridiculous unexplained phenomena .
So without further ado , here is the first half of our favorite unexplained , mysterious and just plain weird happenings :
Backpackerverse’s Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena – Part 1
10 . The Klerksdorp Spheres
Much debate has arisen over the origin of these small , spherical or disc shaped objects found near Ottosdal , South Africa .
Alternative researchers and reporters claim these are “ anomalous , out of place artifacts ” and had to have been developed by intelligent beings , either human , or of alien origin .
Geologists rebut that these little nuggets of weirdness are a result of natural processes , coming from 3.0 billion year old pyrophyllite deposits .
Whatever the case may be , these grooved spheres are monumentally interesting artifacts .
9. Angel Hair
There are a number of accounts of this fiberous substance observed to have fallen from the sky , often believed to be a result of UFO phenomenon .
An interesting account reported by USA Today and the AP details twenty UFOs seen over Quirindi , New South Wales , Australia , dropping down Angel Hair on the ground as they passed .
It is said that any attempt at collecting it results in the material completely subliming and disappearing .
It should be noted that Angel Hair has also , according to respected psychics , appropriately been associated with sightings of angels .
8. The Dropa Stones
The Dropa , according to legend , are a race of dwarf - like extraterrestrials that purportedly inhabited the Baian - Kara - Ula mountains of China .
A 1938 archeological expedition led by Dr. Chi Pu
Tei into this region led to the discovery of a series of artificially carved caves containing the Dropa Stones .
Each stone , or disc rather , is said to be around 12,000 years old , roughly 9 inches in diameter , has a small whole cut in the center and is etched with a spiral pattern of hieroglyphics .
It gets weirder .
The hieroglyphics apparently tell a tale of the Dropa coming from outer space and crash landing in the mountains .
Allegedly , Dr. Chi Pu
Tei ’s team also found several neat rows of tombs with 4 ft 4 inch skeletons , big classic alien heads and all , buried inside them .
Historical evidence or hoax , the Dropa stones are of great interest to researchers and skeptics alike .
7 . The Miracle of the Sun
The Miracle of the Sun is an alleged miraculous event witnessed by 30,000 to 100,000 people in 1917 near Fatima , Portugal .
Many sources attempt to explain the event using known phenomena such as clouds , stratospheric dust , or a “ sundog “ , but it is most often associated with biblical “ endtime ” prophecies and UFO lore .
Here is a summary of events from Wikipedia :
“ According to many witness statements , after a downfall of rain , the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque , spinning disk in the sky .
It was said to be significantly less bright than normal , and cast multicolored lights across the landscape , the shadows on the landscape , the people , and the surrounding clouds .
The sun was then reported to have careened towards the earth in a zigzag pattern , frightening some of those present who thought it meant the end of the world .
Some witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became “ suddenly and completely dry . ”
Estimates of the number of witnesses range from 30,000 - 40,000 by Avelino de Almeida , writing for the Portuguese newspaper O Século , to 100,000 , estimated by Dr. Joseph Garrett , professor of natural sciences at the University of Coimbra , both of whom were present that day .
The miracle was attributed by believers to Our Lady of Fátima , an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three young shepherd children in 1917 , as having been predicted by the three children on 13 July , 19 August , and 13 September 1917 .
The children reported that the Lady had promised them that she would on 13 October reveal her identity to them and provide a miracle “ so that all may believe . ”
According to these reports , the miracle of the sun lasted approximately ten minutes .
The three children also reported seeing a panorama of visions , including those of Jesus , the Blessed Virgin Mary , and of Saint Joseph blessing the people . ”
6. Morgellons Disease
Morgellons Disease is an infectious condition where reported symptoms include crawling , biting , and stinging sensations ; finding multi-colored fibers on or under the skin and persistent skin rashes or open sores .
The scientific community has all but shunned Morgellons sufferers , stating that Morgellons is n’t a new disorder , but instead a combination of known medical conditions , including delusional parasitosis .
Members of the Morgellons Research Foundation and several Morgellons patients have successfully gotten the U.S. government ’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( the CDC ) to investigate their condition .
According to Wikipedia :
The CDC states that while it is not known at present whether the condition represents a new disease entity , or whether persons who identify themselves as having Morgellons have a common cause for their symptoms , share common risk factors , or are contagious , it has begun an epidemiological investigation of the “ Unexplained Dermopathy ” .
The CDC ’s Morgellons page can be found at : https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/4362
We hope that you ’ve enjoyed the first half of our list , “ Backpackerverse ’s Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena ” and make sure to check back next week for the final 5 !
The New York Times reports this evening that “ foreign banks , which were initially excluded from the [ Wall Street bailout ] plan , lobbied successfully over the weekend to be able to sell the toxic American mortgage debt owned by their American units to the Treasury , getting the same treatment as United States banks . ”
The Times further reports that two of the biggest foreign banks in need of such relief are Barclays and UBS .
In fact , my understanding is that UBS is more on the line here than any other foreign bank .
Let ’s add this up .
John McCain ’s top economics advisor , who is widely believed to be his choice for Treasury Secretary , should he win in November , is former Sen. Phil Gramm .
( Indeed , just last night his spokesman refused to say Gramm would n’t be McCain ’s choice for Treasury Secretary . )
Gramm is both vice chairman of UBS ’s US division and a lobbyist for UBS .
If UBS successfully lobbied over the weekend to get in on the bailout , what was Gramm ’s role in the lobbying ?
Do Half Of Americans Really Want The Gov't To Regulate The Internet ?
from the you - can - prove - anything - with - surveys dept
Before people act surprised about this , take a step back and recognize that if you did the same study in the US , asking if the government should be protecting children from " bad stuff " online , many Americans would naturally say yes .

You can prove almost anything you want with surveys if you word them correctly .
Remember a couple months ago , when we were discussing a study that suggested people in China were " happy " with the government 's regulation of the internet ?
At the time , I noted :
And , now it looks like a " public opinion " firm is proving that correct , leading to the publicity - generating headline suggesting that half of all Americans support regulating content online the same way content is regulated on TV or radio -- with 73 % of all people saying that it should be illegal to be a jerk online .
But is that really representative of what people think ?
Not really .
At least the firm also reveals the actual questions -- from which it 's easy to see why the answers came out as they did .
The survey starts out talking about the infamous Megan Meier - Lori Drew case , providing very little of the actual context of what happened , but instead suggesting that Drew sent cruel messages to a young girl to make her commit suicide .
That 's not accurate at all , according to most reports .
While Lori Drew did set up the fake MySpace page , she did it to keep tabs on what Meier was saying about her daughter , not to harass her .
And , the harassing " message " was sent by another young girl who thought it was a good way to get Megan to not want to speak to the fake profile again -- rather than to push her to commit suicide .
But , none of that context is explained .
Instead , survey takers are told that Drew set up a fake MySpace page with which to harass a girl , which resulted in the girl 's suicide .
They 're then asked if they think that should be a crime -- to which many people obviously respond yes .
Immediately following this , they ask people if the FCC should regulate content on the internet , like it does on TV and radio .
And , of course , since people are now in the mindset of thinking just how awful some content can be online , they 're much more prone to say yes .
In other words , the results are totally bogus .
If the opinion firm , instead , went in the other direction and opened with questions about internet censorship , and spoke about how aggressive regulation of content online was preventing people from getting all sorts of information that could be useful to them , and then asked how they felt about FCC regulation of online content , I 'd imagine a lot fewer would think it was okay .
And , just for contrast 's sake , we can point to another study from a few years ago that asked people about regulating content on TV .
In that study over 90 % said they did n't think content should be regulated on TV .
That study is obviously questionable too , but if you combine both , you 'd have 90 % of people saying that TV should n't be regulated , but 50 % saying that internet content should be .
Something does n't add up .

I think there are hundreds it not thousands of people just like the man in this post who know elections have been bought and paid for .
Check out the recent FISA vote .
2/3 of the bought and paid for dems .
voted with repubs .
Maybe instead of investigating .... we should all start going to bars in racist states where the worst election theft goes on .... just hang out .
Do n't forget to include NC , the deep south , Ohio and Fl .

Some Facts Related to the RTA Election 1 .
The RTA passed by a surprisingly large margin .
Polls taken before the election showed it losing .
Sales tax increases for roads had lost badly in four previous elections .
2. Election Division staff printed unauthorized vote total summary reports after the first day of RTA early ballot scanning .
3 . Before the second day of RTA early ballot scanning , Election Division staff erased the first day ’s database backup by over - writing it .
This required responding to two warning messages , one from GEMS and one from Windows .
4. Election systems expert Michael Shamos of Carnegie Mellon advised the AG investigator of possible RTA fraud to hand count ballots , echoing advice from local election activists .
5 . The AG Investigator lied to Shamos in an email , saying that “ local naysayers ” were onboard with not looking at ballots .
The opposite was true and the investigator knew it , because he had engaged in a shouting argument with local naysayers about this issue .
6. IBeta tests conducted under contract with the AG investigator of the RTA election should have included looking for possible swapping of yes and no votes , but did not .
7. County staff directed all aspects of the IBeta testing , and led the testers to look at irrelevant items and to disregard potentially important items .
8 . A whistleblower has come forward saying in a sworn affidavit that Bryan Crane told him privately that he had “ fixed ” the RTA election , under direction from his bosses .
9 . The County Treasurer has announced a plan to destroy the RTA ballots ASAP .
10 . A Microsoft Access manual was seen and photographed in the vote tabulation room on election night .
Use of MS Access on an election computer was and is illegal .
11 . Democratic Party observers were prevented from investigating cables connected to the tabulation computer after the RTA on the pretext that it was a non-partisan election .
12 . A tape of ballot layout held by the Secretary of State for use by the Attorney General in any fraud investigation was never examined during the RTA fraud investigation where it was potentially key evidence .
Instead it was returned to the suspects , who “ lost ” it .
13 . The Pima County Board of Supervisors , through their lawyers , claimed there was a substantial risk that all election employees handling the election computer would “ take the fifth ” and refuse to answer questions based on a fear of criminal prosecution .
14 . The Pima County Board of Supervisors has never requested an internal investigation of the Election Division .
15 . Neither Brad Nelson nor Bryan Crane nor any Election Division employee has been reprimanded for any violations of rules or procedures .
16 .
At the end of the RTA Election Day , the database was NOT backed up , as it has been in virtually every other election .
The database was not backed up until three days later , after all results had been published .
17 . The Pima County Election Division purchased a “ crop scanner ” computer - hacking tool ten months before the RTA election .
This tool had no other purpose in the Election Division than to illegally alter the programming of precinct voting machines .
18 . Jim Berry retired from his job as the County Administrator ’s assistant in early 2005 and was immediately hired by the County to do a precinct by precinct study of how Pima voters had voted in bond elections , and “ other duties ” as assigned .
Mr. Berry collected $ 75,000 from the County for this contract , while at the same time collecting $ 12,000 from a pro-RTA group for helping them with the RTA campaign .

Hi ,
If all early vote ballots are counted on election
day at their respective precincts only ...
If all absentee ballots are counted on election
day at their respective precincts only ...
If we rid ourselves of the provisional ballots and
alowing voters to vote with a regular ballot ...
If a post election 100 % " VERIFICATION COUNT " of
every position of every ballot by a manual
hand count is done ...
If the VERIFICATION COUNT is performed after every
election ( fed , state , county , local , , , etc . )
We will then ( and only then ) have our full voting
rights in reality .
And the County of Pima would
not be in this mess 2 years after an election .
We Voters want our FULL rights NOW !!!

The implications are even greater than the actual statement : " During that conversation Bryan Crane told me he " fixed " the RTA , or Regional Transportation Authority election on the instructions of his bosses and he did what he was told to do . "
" Did what he was told to do " ... IMPLIES ... that elections around the country are hacked " on command " of superiors , and it implies widespread knowledge of the ability to hack elections .

It also implies DIEBOLD trains election officials how to swing elections on their e-vote machines .
They might " train " them how to do it , how else would they know ?

Brad :
I agree that this is a potentially explosive story , but I have been unable to confirm that Osmolski is a former Pima County employee .
My reading of the affidavit is that he went to a bar and there met Crane who , according to Osmolski , admitted to rigging the Pima County election .
We need whistleblowers , but we need to ascertain the facts about the whistleblowers --- if you have information that Osmolski worked for Pima County , that would help with the plausibility evaluation .
If this was the first time Osmolski met Crane , it 's hard to understand why Crane would get to know his new buddy by confessing to a felony .
If they had known each other for a while , that 's another matter .
The smoking guns are all over the place on this story , and it is not acceptable to destroy the ballots .

Bev -
Ca n't speak specifically to the details , as this piece was edited by me but Guest Blogged by David Safier .
However , several of the local papers today reported Osmalski as a 16 - year former transportation employee with the county .
Also , when I spoke w/ John Brakey yesterday , he also confirmed that Osmalski was an employee , and a former one at that .
Have n't confirmed directly or personally however beyond that .
But , as mentioned , several local papers reported him as a former cty employee .

Zbigniew Osmolski blew the whistle on county road contract fixing scams -- as reported in the Star around Christmas of 2000 .
He had confirmed to the press all the allegations made by the Pima County Transportation Director at the time , Brooks Keenan .
The FBI came in and investigated .
Dan Eckstrom was implicated , however they were no indictments , but eventually Eckstrom stepped down from the board of Supervisors in mid-term , citing health reasons ( but he has been healthy enough to work as a lobbyist and consultant since ) .
Zbigniew was technically / officially fired for insubordination , after 16 years as a county employee with an excellent record .
In reality he was fired for backing up Keenan 's testimony .
Brooks Keenan would later quit and now works for the Tucson 's transportation department .
Later news reports showed the county 's messy procurement practices allowed some contracts , particularly those with campaign contributors , to balloon with little oversight .
Dan Eckstrom was the Chair of the Pima County Board and a big part of that over site .
Our attorney " Bill Risner " and I stand by Zbigniew Osmolski .
Soon more will be forth coming out to back up everything Zbig has stated and more .

Operation Brimstone ended only one week ago .
This was the joint US / UK / French naval war games in the Atlantic Ocean preparing for a naval blockade of Iran and the likely resulting war in the Persian Gulf area .
The massive war games included a US Navy supercarrier battle group , an US Navy expeditionary carrier battle group , a Royal Navy carrier battle group , a French nuclear hunter - killer submarine plus a large number of US Navy cruisers , destroyers and frigates playing the “ enemy force ” .
The lead American ship in these war games , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN71 ) and its Carrier Strike Group Two ( CCSG - 2 ) are now headed towards Iran along with the USS Ronald Reagon ( CVN76 ) and its Carrier Strike Group Seven ( CCSG - 7 ) coming from Japan .
They are joining two existing USN battle groups in the Gulf area : the USS Abraham Lincoln ( CVN72 ) with its Carrier Strike Group Nine ( CCSG - 9 ) ; and the USS Peleliu ( LHA - 5 ) with its expeditionary strike group .
Likely also under way towards the Persian Gulf is the USS Iwo Jima ( LHD - 7 ) and its expeditionary strike group , the UK Royal Navy HMS Ark Royal ( R07 ) carrier battle group , assorted French naval assets including the nuclear hunter - killer submarine Amethyste and French Naval Rafale fighter jets on - board the USS Theodore Roosevelt .
These ships took part in the just completed Operation Brimstone .
The build up of naval forces in the Gulf will be one of the largest multi-national naval armadas since the First and Second Gulf Wars .
The intent is to create a US / EU naval blockade ( which is an Act of War under international law ) around Iran ( with supporting air and land elements ) to prevent the shipment of benzene and certain other refined oil products headed to Iranian ports .
Iran has limited domestic oil refining capacity and imports 40 % of its benzene .
Cutting off benzene and other key products would cripple the Iranian economy .
The neo-cons are counting on such a blockade launching a war with Iran .
The US Naval forces being assembled include the following :
Carrier Strike Group Nine
USS Abraham Lincoln ( CVN72 ) nuclear powered supercarrier
with its Carrier Air Wing Two
Destroyer Squadron Nine :
USS Mobile Bay ( CG53 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Russell ( DDG59 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Momsen ( DDG92 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Shoup ( DDG86 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Ford ( FFG54 ) guided missile frigate
USS Ingraham ( FFG61 ) guided missile frigate
USS Rodney M. Davis ( FFG60 ) guided missile frigate
USS Curts ( FFG38 ) guided missile frigate
Plus one or more nuclear hunter - killer submarines
Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
USS Peleliu ( LHA - 5 ) a Tarawa - class amphibious assault carrier
USS Pearl Harbor ( LSD52 ) assult ship
USS Dubuque ( LPD8 ) assult ship / landing dock
USS Cape St. George ( CG71 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Halsey ( DDG97 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Benfold ( DDG65 ) guided missile destroyer
Carrier Strike Group Two
USS Theodore Roosevelt ( DVN71 ) nuclear powered supercarrier
with its Carrier Air Wing Eight
Destroyer Squadron 22
USS Monterey ( CG61 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Mason ( DDG87 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Nitze ( DDG94 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Sullivans ( DDG68 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Springfield ( SSN761 ) nuclear powered hunter - killer submarine
IWO ESG ~ Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group
USS Iwo Jima ( LHD7 ) amphibious assault carrier
with its Amphibious Squadron Four
and with its 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit
USS San Antonio ( LPD17 ) assault ship
USS Velia Gulf ( CG72 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Ramage ( DDG61 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Carter Hall ( LSD50 ) assault ship
USS Roosevelt ( DDG80 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Hartfore ( SSN768 ) nuclear powered hunter - killer submarine
Carrier Strike Group Seven
USS Ronald Reagan ( CVN76 ) nuclear powered supercarrier
with its Carrier Air Wing 14
Destroyer Squadron 7
USS Chancellorsville ( CG62 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Howard ( DDG83 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Gridley ( DDG101 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Decatur ( DDG73 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Thach ( FFG43 ) guided missile frigate
USNS Rainier ( T - AOE - 7 ) fast combat support ship
Also likely to join the battle armada :
UK Royal Navy HMS Ark Royal Carrier Strike Group with assorted guided missile destroyers and frigates , nuclear hunter - killer submarines and support ships
French Navy nuclear powered hunter - killer submarines ( likely the Amethyste and perhaps others ) , plus French Naval Rafale fighter jets operating off of the USS Theodore Roosevelt as the French Carrier Charles de Gaulle is in dry dock , and assorted surface warships
Various other US Navy warships and submarines and support ships .
The following USN ships took part ( as the “ enemy ” forces ) in Operation Brimstone and several may join in :
USS San Jacinto ( CG56 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Anzio ( CG68 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Normandy ( CG60 ) guided missile cruiser
USS Carney ( DDG64 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Oscar Austin ( DDG79 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Winston S. Churchill ( DDG81 ) guided missile destroyer
USS Carr ( FFG52 ) guided missile frigate
The USS Iwo Jima and USS Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Groups have USMC Harrier jump jets and an assortment of assault and attack helicopters .
The Expeditionary Strike Groups have powerful USMC Expeditionary Units with amphibious armor and ground forces trained for operating in shallow waters and in seizures of land assets , such as Qeshm Island ( a 50 mile long island off of Bandar Abbas in the Gulf of Hormuz and headquarters of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ) .
The large and very advanced nature of the US Naval warships is not only directed at Iran .
There is a great fear that Russia and China may oppose the naval and air / land blockade of Iran .
If Russian and perhaps Chinese naval warships escort commercial tankers to Iran in violation of the blockade it could be the most dangerous at - sea confrontation since the Cuban Missile Crisis .
The US and allied Navies , by front loading a Naval blockade force with very powerful guided missile warships and strike carriers is attempting to have a force so powerful that Russia and China will not be tempted to mess with .
This is a most serious game of military brinkmanship with major nuclear armed powers that have profound objections to the neo-con grand strategy and to western control of all of the Middle East ’s oil supply .
The Russian Navy this spring sent a major battle fleet into the Mediterranean headed by the modern aircraft carrier the Admiral Kuznetsov and the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet , the Guided Missile Heavy Cruiser Moskva .
This powerful fleet has at least 11 surface ships and unknown numbers of subs and can use the Russian naval facility at Syria ’s Tartous port for resupply .
The Admiral Kuznetsov carries approximately 47 warplanes and 10 helicopters .
The warplanes are mostly the powerful Su - 33 , a naval version ( with mid-air refueling capability ) of the Su - 27 family .
While the Su-33 is a very powerful warplane it lacks the power of the stealth USAF F - 22 .
However , the Russians insist that they have developed a plasma based system that allows them to stealth any aircraft and a recent incident where Russian fighters were able to appear unannounced over a US Navy carrier battle group tends to confirm their claims .
The Su-33 can be armed with the 3M82 Moskit sea-skimming missile ( NATO code name SS - N - 22 Sunburn ) and the even more powerful P - 800 Oniks ( also named Yakhonts ; NATO code name SS - N - 26 Onyx ) .
Both missiles are designed to kill US Navy supercarriers by getting past the cruiser / destroyer screen and the USN point - defense Phalanx system by using high supersonic speeds and violent end maneuvers .
Russian subs currently use the underwater rocket VA - 111 Shkval ( Squall ) , which is fired from standard 533 mm torpedo tubes and reaches a speed of 360 kph ( 230 m ph ) underwater .
There is no effective countermeasures to this system and no western counterpart .
A strategic diversion has been created for Russia .
The Republic of Georgia , with US backing , is actively preparing for war on South Ossetia .
The South Ossetia capital has been shelled and a large Georgian tank force has been heading towards the border .
Russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the Georgians to attack South Ossetia .
The Russians are great chess players and this game may not turn out so well for the neo-cons .
UPDATE 8 August 2008 ~ War has broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia .
At least 10 Russian troops have been killed and 30 wounded and 2 Russian fighter jets downed .
American Marines , a thousand of them , have recently been in Georgia training the Georgian military forces .
Several European nations stopped Bush and others from allowing Georgia into NATO .
Russia is moving a large military force with armor towards the area .
This could get bad , and remember it is just a strategic diversion …. but one that could have horrific effects .
Link to story “ Russia sends forces into Georgia rebel conflict ” .
FURTHER UPDATE ~ Russian military forces in active combat ; now total of four Russian fighter jets reported downed .
ADDITIONAL UPDATE ~ Georgia calls for US help ; Russian Air Force bombs Georgian air bases .
DEBKA , the Israeli strategy and military site , states that Israeli military officers are advising the Georgian armed forces in combat operations and that 1,000 Israelis are in - combat on the side of Georgia at this time .
Kuwait has activated its “ Emergency War Plan ” as it and other Gulf nations prepare for the likelihood of a major regional war in the Middle East involving weapons of mass destruction .
The two - ton elephant in the living room of the neo-con strategy is the advanced biowar ( ABW ) that Iran , and to a lessor extent Syria , has .
This places the motherlands of the major neo-con nations ( America , France , the United Kingdom ) , as well as Israel , in grave danger .
When the Soviet Union fell the Iranians hired as many out - of - work former Soviet advanced biowar experts as possible .
In the last 15 or so years they have helped to develop a truly world class ABW program utilizing recombination DNA genetic engineering technology to create a large number of man made killer viruses .
This form of weapon system does not require high tech military delivery systems .
The viruses are sub-microscopic and once seeded in a population use the population itself as vectors .
Seeding can be done without notice in shopping malls , churches , and other public places .
The only real defense to an advanced global strategic biowar attack is to lock down the population as rapidly as possible and let those infected die off .
Unless the public gets it act together and forces the neo-cons to stop the march to yet another war in the Middle East we are apt to see a truly horrific nightmare unfold in OUR COUNTRIES .

The film is scheduled to hit theaters on May 8th , 2009 .
I ’m a teenager so of course I live with my parents .
I have been raised in a very conservative Christian family .
I was taught from the age of four that Christianity is the Way and the only Way , Christians go to heaven and non-Christians go to hell , the works .
I did n’t see any other way nor did I know any other way .
The bulk of my indoctrination has come from my father .
He is very hardcore .
I ’ve tried all my life to be good enough for him .
I went on a mission trip and to various Christian camps because I wanted to be his perfect daughter .
But there is no pleasing my dad .
No matter what I did , I was n’t good enough .
I was always one to ask questions .
If there was a word said that I did n’t understand , I would ask what it meant .
Growing up , there were so many times I wanted to question the teachings of my Sunday school class or my father ’s after - dinner devotions .
I held my tongue because I knew I was n’t supposed to question the church and my dad most certainly would n’t approve .
But some things just did n’t make sense to me .
The Bible seemed to contradict itself so many times .
I could n’t stand it .
I used to care so much for animals and the environment when I was a kid .
I wanted to be a vegetarian and recycle and do whatever I could .
But the church teaches that God put us in charge of this earth , that animals are meant to be eaten , etc .
I was taught to grow out of it .
I began to make fun of those environmentalists .
I preached to my non-Christian friends .
I openly expressed my disapproval of homosexuals .
The questions I wanted to ask were slowly shoved from the tip of my tongue to the deepest area in the back of my mind , altogether forgotten .
I was a hardcore Christian .
The church was always right .
I was a servant of God .
And I still was n’t good enough for my dad .
Then , about eight months ago , my life was completely turned around .
I found out that I had a mental disorder .
I have missed this entire year of school to get medication and treatment .
It ’s been an absolute nightmare .
But I ’m so glad it happened because it made me remember those questions that were gathering cobwebs in the back of my mind .
I ’ve always been ‘ moody ’ .
I grew to think that everyone went through what I did , but they all just handled it better than me .
I had very low self - esteem .
Again , wanting to please my dad , I did my best to get control of my emotions .
I built a shell around myself that only allowed in what I ’m supposed to feel as a Christian , what I ’m supposed to be .
But in August of last year , I had what you may call a minor ‘ mental breakdown ’ .
I could n’t hide my emotions anymore and each hour seemed to present a new one .
( I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ) .
My protective shell had shattered .
I was open and raw and I could no longer make myself something I was n’t .
I had no control over what I felt or thought so I could no longer dismiss those questions and doubts that entered my mind .
I began to ask them .
I researched until my fingers were numb and my mind could hold no more .
At the beginning of March of this year , I finally came to the conclusion that I do n’t believe in God and that I want nothing to do with religion anymore .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself .
I stopped going to church January , much to my dad ’s dismay .
He tried many times to persuade me to go back and I always gave him a simple excuse .
Such as that I do n’t feel well or I ca n’t be around that many people .
At the time , I still was n’t sure what I believed .
I tried my best to find the answers I wanted , but it is impossible to find them all .
I knew I could n’t truly worship God in church anymore and I refused to pretend and be a hypocrite .
That is initially why I stopped going .
I eventually told my dad that .
He respected it for a few weeks and then began to try to persuade me again .
I told him again how I felt , this time with a little more conviction , and he left it alone for another few weeks .
He started to show that he was n’t pleased with me not going to church .
I was so scared .
My friend strongly advised me to talk to him before I go out of my mind ( no pun intended ) .
He was about to leave for his Monday night church group and I told him that we needed to talk .
He said we could when he got back .
It was about nine thirty by the time we sat down together .
My dad is very intimidating .
I rambled on for about half an hour before really getting to the church subject .
I pretty much chickened out .
I would n’t have said anything about my now being an atheist if he had n’t have brought God up .
He got his fake godly face on ( the one that makes you want to slap him ) and gave me a speech about how my journey with the Lord is n’t over .
How I ’ve been on mission trips and to camp , but there ’s more to it .
He told me that all he ’s asking me to do is to continue in the church until I ’m eighteen and then I can say , “ Dad , I ’m done . ”
- I ’m wondering what he expects to happen from now until I ’m eighteen that will convince me to stay with the church .
You have to know my dad , once you agree to one thing , you agree to everything .
He probably had various groups and trips planned for me so church would be my life twenty - four / seven . -
I seized this opportunity and said , “ Dad , what if I ’m done now ? ”
It took him a bit to fully understand what I was saying .
He started in on another speech , holding up his Bible and saying it is the Way , and all the religious statements you can imagine .
He then asked me what my reason for living was and where I got my morals from .
I went to answer but he interrupted me to compare my morals to that of Hitler and Stalin’s .
“ They made their own morals .
They thought they were doing right . ”
So he ’s comparing me to the slaughterer of the Jews and a totalitarian dictator ?
Thanks Dad .
He went on to say , “ This will not affect Henry . ”
His name is Henry .
Yes he used third person .
“ Henry will continue to believe in the truth . ”
He tends to take my issues and make them about him .
Other comments that were thrown in there were “ Your mind has been poisoned . ” and “ I ’m going to spend the rest of my days or yours being an example and showing you that you ’re wrong . ”
I listened to his speeches half tuning him out .
I stifled laughter .
It all seemed so ridiculous .
My dad ended telling me that he did not support my views and he will not respect them .
I told him that I was n’t trying to change anyone else ’s views .
I just want to make mine known .
I also said that I do n’t expect him to support or respect my views and that I do expect him to try and show me I ’m wrong , with which he interrupted , “ No .
It is not my job to show you you are wrong , and you are .
That is the Lord .
The Holy Spirit . ”
He contradicts himself all the time .
I then tried to end the conversation by saying that all I needed him to do was love me .
He said he does .
Then he said , “ Nothing you do will make me love you less , nothing you do will make me love you more . ”
For those of you who do n’t know , God says that in the Bible .
But he was n’t quoting it .
He actually said it for himself .
That seemed a little strange to me .
Well anyway , I told my mom the next morning that I do n’t believe in God .
She took it a lot better .
She and I are really close and she told me she does n’t want anything to come between us .
She has n’t treated me any differently .
I have n’t told my sister , a devout Christian , yet .
I ’m rather afraid to .
I ’m scared she , as well as others , will think less of me , like I ’m lesser of a person .
I ’m getting stronger and more confident , so eventually everyone will know .
My struggle now , besides avoiding what my dad may now throw at me , is to undo what I ’ve been taught as fact all my life .
When presented with a problem or situation that needs an answer , the Christian answer immediately pops into my head .
I want to decide for myself now .
I see these Go Green commercials and my first instinct is to roll my eyes , as my parents do .
I ’m starting to realize now that I think it ’s a good idea .
I want to be a vegan .
I want to care about the environment .
I want to be liberal .
I still do n’t know what I think about so many things .
It ’s very frustrating , especially being surrounded by Christian conservatives .
I know it takes time .
I ’m so excited to be able to think for myself .
I love the freedom .
Now that I ’m out of the cage that is the Christian church , it seems so small .
It once was my life .
It seems strange now .
The church talks about that wonderful feeling of peace , that you get when you trust fully in Him .
I experienced what they call the ‘ peace of God ’ in the church .
What ’s funny is , I ’ve experienced the same feeling , without the God part , many times since leaving the church .
It ’s that feeling when something finally makes sense , or you realize how amazing it is to think for yourself or even when you ace that exam you studied so hard for .
The church says you cannot be truly happy without God .
I say you most certainly can .
( OPRAH.com ) --
I swear on the " Thelma & Louise " video we watched into a scratchy oblivion : I did n't mean to be the worst friend ever .
When Lisa -- my roommate and boon companion of three years -- stepped into our apartment , sank to the floor , and clutched our cocker spaniel , I asked , " What 's wrong ? " with sympathy .
" I got fired , " Lisa told me .
" Wow . " I pulled her to her feet .
" You 'll have an amazing story for Jim 's party tonight ! "
Lisa 's eyes went round and wet as the dog's when we left her at the vet .
She said , " Come on , Maya " ( who gave me a reproachful glance before obeying ) , disappeared into her bedroom ( for three days ) , and never discussed career matters with me again .
Boy , was I annoyed .
At age 26 , I was a sublime friend .
Lisa , also 26 , was blessed to have an ally so honest about dates and hairstyles , so fiercely supportive of her dreams , and willing to defend her choices ( the dates , hairstyles , and dreams ) to her habitually nettling mom and dad .
Never once in our relationship , I was proud to think , had I ever even been tempted to commit a single mortal friendship sin : being competitive , gossiping , or backstabbing .
To me , Lisa 's job loss was no big deal .
She had complained about the position .
Her parents were rich and gave her money .
She had nothing to worry about .
I thought that reminding her we had something fun to do that night was an appropriate and kind response .
Psychologist Douglas LaBier , Ph.D. , director and founder of the Center for Adult Development in Washington , D.C. , disagrees .
He explained to me that my dearest friend was humiliated by receiving a pink slip , feared she might be incompetent at everything she tried , and , because of me , felt utterly alone .
I was , LaBier tells me , " catastrophically unempathetic " to Lisa .
At the heart of many problems
Today , 15 years later , I know why my attempt at consoling my friend was so ham - fisted .
As LaBier explains , virtually everyone learns the basics of empathy in childhood ( from our parents comforting us when we 're in distress ) , but my father died when I was 4 , and afterward my mother had to be very can - do , juggling three jobs , graduate school , and two kids .
When I was upset , she never said , " Oh , I 'm sorry .
It must be hard to have me away so much after losing your dad . "
Instead , on good days , she 'd say , " Why are you crying ?
Nothing is wrong . "
And on bad days : " You 'd better toughen up because life can get a lot worse . "
Looking back at my 20 - something self , I realize that if , as LaBier says , empathy is " the ability or the willingness to experience the world from someone else 's point of view , " I was n't brought up to be able to do that .
At least my lack of empathy was not unusual .
Having practiced as a psychotherapist for 35 years , LaBier believes that what he calls empathy deficit disorder ( EDD ) is rampant among Americans .
LaBier says we unlearn whatever empathy skills we 've picked up while coming of age in a culture that focuses on acquisition and status more than cooperation and values " moving on " over thoughtful reflection .
LaBier is convinced that EDD is at the heart of modernity 's most common problems , macro ( war ) and micro ( divorce ) .
When Lisa crept into her bedroom , I could n't have articulated any of this .
She might have felt abandoned , but all I knew was that I felt alone .
My roommate had her dog , and they were both shunning me , and my boyfriend of four years would n't rescue me from the loneliness I increasingly felt by agreeing to get married .
I went into psychotherapy .
Faking it a step to becoming empathetic
I thought my therapist would help me break up with my commitment - phobic lover , figure out how to choose less sensitive friends , and , of course , let me rant about my mother 's shortcomings .
I did get to rant -- about my mom , Lisa , and my boyfriend .
What surprised me was my therapist 's response to these tirades .
She never said , " Leave that rotten bastard . "
Or " Your roommate is a big baby . "
Instead she said , " Gosh , that sounds really hard . "
And , " That must have felt terrible . "
And , " How did you feel after that happened ? "
My reaction to those spectacularly bland comments was even more astonishing .
I loved them .
" These very simple responses make you feel understood , " says New York psychologist Frank M. Lachmann , Ph.D. , author of " Transforming Narcissism : Reflections on Empathy , Humor , and Expectations . "
He points out that many of the common responses -- " It could be worse " ; " You should do X " ; " Let 's talk about something else " -- appear to be kind and aimed at soothing .
But no matter how well intentioned , Lachmann says , these remarks are a rejection , a denial , of what the other person is going through .
" They are code for ' Do n't confront me with things that are unpleasant , ' " he says .
" Or ' Do n't bother me with your pain . ' "
About six months into psychotherapy , I started using what I thought of as my therapist 's " lines . "
When Lisa was offered a job at an organization she did not want to work at , I said , " Oh , that 's a tough spot to be in . "
When my boyfriend was invited to study abroad , I said , " How do you feel about that ? "
What I really felt was : " Lisa , that job pays a ton of money , but I guess you can turn it down because your parents are loaded . "
And , " You selfish bastard , I 'll kill you if you go to Europe without me . "
Still , Lachmann says , I had taken the first step to becoming empathetic -- which is faking it .
If you want to act more empathetic , you follow certain steps : Instead of telling people what they ought to do or becoming tyrannically optimistic , you offer sympathy , inquire about feelings , and validate those feelings .
You 'll be giving comfort to the other person , even if you yourself can't feel what they 're going through .
It 's true that for a long time , while I could say the appropriate thing , I could not relate to their struggles .
Still , I took satisfaction in the fact that my relationships were improving .
Then a year after starting therapy , I began feeling something intensely when comforting friends : terror .
This turned out to be a signal , Lachmann says , that I was actually feeling empathy .
Final insult
I did n't recognize it because I 'd always run from emotional discomfort -- and , at least in the beginning , I found trying to be empathetic profoundly uncomfortable .
Most of the time , I managed to avoid the impulse to blurt out unhelpful suggestions to my friends -- " Happy hour , anyone ? "
Or , " Here 's the number for a credit consolidator ! " -- and instead say the appropriate thing .
But for years and years , I could stand genuine empathy only five minutes at a time .
For those five minutes , though , I was not alone .
And once I had experienced the wonder of that , I was willing to stumble out of my comfort zone to try to be not alone again .
Virtually everything I have ever tried to improve about myself -- my weight , my sleep habits , my housecleaning -- has resulted in an endless seesaw of improvement .
But empathy , I 've learned , is not like dieting .
( Or , at least , how I diet , which involves ending up back at square one . )
Cultivating empathy has its own rewards :
The more you do it , the better your relationships are and the more you want to continue .
Feeling understood in that therapist 's office taught me that human beings are not doomed to be alone -- and empathy is life 's connective tissue .
If you have a romantic partner , he or she will someday believe that you are entirely wrong about something , and if you can see the problem from your partner 's point of view , you 'll be able to get through that conflict without smoldering in the corner or splitting up .
If you work with someone you despise ( and who despises you back ) , and you try to understand why that person dislikes you , then you stand a chance of not hating every minute with her at the office .
If you live in a world that you would like to see less divided by ethnic , economic , and religious strife , you 'll find that attempting to comprehend the needs of your sworn enemies is a prerequisite to any meaningful action you can take .
Empathy will also require you to get past rationalizations and admit wrongdoing .
For about a decade after I started working to be more empathetic , I told myself that I had n't hurt Lisa too badly because she never told me I had .
But Lachmann points out that the final insult of being treated with a lack of empathy is that the hurt person usually can't complain .
" If you say , ' That was such an unempathetic thing to say , ' it can easily be heard as , ' Feel sorry for me . '
And no one wants to be pathetic . "
So most people do n't say anything , Lachmann says , and relationships " are often ruptured and ruined . "
Lisa and I are no longer close .
We live on opposite coasts .
We have very different lives .
But still , I could n't bear the idea of us being " ruptured and ruined . "
I recently called her and said I was sorry for being selfish when she lost her job .
I said I had eventually learned that it must have been a terrible time for her and that I had made it worse by leaving her so alone with all her confusion .
Lisa was gracious ( " You did your best " ) , forgiving ( " Really , you were a wonderful friend to me overall " ) , and honest ( " It was 15 years ago , and I 'm over it now " ) .
She changed the subject , and we caught up on our summer plans .
Her family -- along with the cocker spaniel , Maya , who was still alive and giving reproachful looks -- was planning a camping trip .
Packing up , Lisa realized none of her jeans fit .
Her pregnancies had stripped every curve from her body .
She was skinny as a post .
I began to wail ,
" Oh my God , you lucky rat !
I gained 10 pounds ... "
But then I stopped myself .
" Um .
So how does it feel to have to buy new jeans ? " I asked .
There was a silence on the line .
Then Lisa started laughing .
" Wonderful , " she said .
" Absolutely wonderful . "

Last updated Jul 11 , 2015
Mascot by students of Christian Hafner See the FAQ | Download now | Support | Overview Sendmail introduced a new API beginning with version 8.10 - libmilter .
Sendmail 8.12 officially released libmilter .
Version 8.12 seems to be more robust , and includes new privilege separation features to enhance security .
Even better , sendmail 8.13 supports socket maps , which makes pysrs much more efficient and secure .
Sendmail 8.14 finally supports modifying MAIL FROM via the milter API , and a data callback allowing spam to be rejected before beginning the DATA phase ( even after accepting some recipients ) .
Pymilter provides a milter module for Python that implements a python interface to libmilter exploiting all its features .
Now Postfix also implements the milter protocol , and you can program SMTP time filters for Postfix in Python .
What 's New
pymilter 1.0 removes the start.sh glue script .
EL6 RPMs for packages using pymilter ( milter , pysrs , pygossip ) now use daemonize as a replacement .
ACCEPT is supported as an untrapped exception policy .
An optional dir for getaddrset and getaddrdict in Milter .config supports moving some clutter .
Untrapped exceptions now report the registered milter name .
An selinux subpackage is include for EL6 .
Provide sqlite support for greylisting , and Milter.greylist export and Milter.greysql import to migrate data .
pyspf 2.0.9 adds a new test suite and support for RFC 7208 , the official ( non-experimental ) RFC for SPF .
pyspf 2.0.8 adds much improved python3 support .
All test suites now pass with python3 and py3dns .
SPF records are restricted to 7 - bit ascii .
But some people try to use an extended set anyway , crashing pyspf .
We now return PermError for non-ascii SPF records .
IP address parsing and arithmetic is now handled by the ipaddr ( ipaddress in python3 ) module .
I fixed a bug caused by a null CNAME in cache .
milter 0.8.18 adds test cases and SMTP AUTH policies in sendmail access for spf-milter .
You can now also configure an untrapped exception policy for spf-milter , and it rejects numeric HELO .
For the bms milter , from words can be in a file , and you can use the BAN feature for configured public email providers like gmail and yahoo - it bans the mailbox rather than the entire domain .
pymilter 0.9.8 adds a test modules for unit testing milters .
It fixes a typo that prevented setsymlist from actually working all these years ( misspelled as setsmlist ) .
The untrapped exception message is changed to " pymilter : untrapped exception in milter app " .
milter 0.8.17 reports keysize of DKIM signatures , adds a simple DKIM milter , and DKIM policies in the sendmail access file .
It also broke spf-milter for people using SMTP AUTH - sorry guys !
milter 0.8.16 has dkim signing , and Authentication - Results header .
pymilter - 0.9.7 has several improved diagnostics for milter programming errors .
milter has dkim checking and logging in CVS .
Will use DKIM Pass for reputation tracking , and as an additional acceptable identity along with HELO , PTR , or SPF .
pymilter - 0.9.4 supports python-2.6
pymilter - 0.9.2 supports the negotiate , data , and unknown callbacks .
Protocol steps are automatically negotiated by the high - level Milter package by annotating callback methods with @nocallback or @noreply .
pymilter - 0.9.1 supports CHGFROM , introduced with sendmail - 8.14 , and also supported by postfix - 2.3 .

The pymilter package provides a robust toolkit for Python milters that wraps the C libmilter library .
There are also several pure Python milter libraries that implement the milter protocol in Python .
The milter package provides the beginnings of a general purpose mail filtering system written in Python .
It also includes a simple spfmilter that supports policy by domain and spf result via the sendmail access file .
The pysrs package provides an SRS library , SES library , a sendmail socketmap daemon implementing SRS , and ( Real Soon Now ) an srsmilter daemon implementing SRS , now that sendmail - 8.14 supports CHGFROM and this is supported in pymilter - 0.9 .

The pyspf package provides the spf module , a well tested implementation of the of the SPF protocol , which is useful for detecting email forgery .

The pygossip package provides the gossip library and server daemon for the GOSSiP protocol , which exchanges reputation of qualified domains .

The pydns package provides the low level DNS library for python DNS lookups .
It is much smaller and lighter than the more capable ( and bigger ) dnspython library .
Low level lookups are needed to find SPF and MX records for instance .

It is much smaller and lighter than the more capable ( and bigger ) dnspython library .
Low level lookups are needed to find SPF and MX records for instance .
The pydspam package wraps libdspam for python .
At the lowest level , the milter module provides a thin wrapper around the sendmail libmilter API .
This API lets you register callbacks for a number of events in the process of sendmail receiving a message via SMTP .
These events include the initial connection from a MTA , the envelope sender and recipients , the top level mail headers , and the message body .
There are options to mangle all of these components of the message as it passes through the milter .
At the next level , the Milter module ( note the case difference ) provides a Python friendly object oriented wrapper for the low level API .
To use the Milter module , an application registers a ' factory ' to create an object for each connection from a MTA to sendmail .
These connection objects must provide methods corresponding to the libmilter callback events .
Each event method returns a code to tell sendmail whether to proceed with processing the message .
This is a big advantage of milters over other mail filtering systems .
Unwanted mail can be stopped in its tracks at the earliest possible point .
The Milter .
Milter class provides default implementations for event methods that do nothing , and also provides wrappers for the libmilter methods to mutate the message .
The mime module provides a wrapper for the Python email package that fixes some bugs , and simplifies modifying selected parts of a MIME message .
Finally , the bms.py application is both a sample of how to use the Milter and spf modules , and the beginnings of a general purpose SPAM filtering , wiretapping , SPF checking , and Win32 virus protecting milter .
It can make use of the pysrs package when available for SRS / SES checking and the pydspam package for Bayesian content filtering .
SPF checking requires pydns .
Configuration documentation is currently included as comments in the sample config file for the bms.py milter .
See also the HOWTO and Milter Log Message Tags .
Python milter is under GPL .
The authors can probably be convinced to change this to LGPL if needed .
What is a milter ?
What can you do with a milter ?
A milter can DISCARD or REJECT spam based based on algorithms scripted in python rather than sendmail 's cryptic " cf " language .
A milter can alter or remove attachments from mail that are poisonous to Windows .
A milter can scan for viruses and clean them when detected .
A milter scans outgoing as well as incoming mail .
A milter can add and delete recipients to forward or secretly copy mail .
For more ideas , look at some of the milters linked at the PyMilter Main Page .
The Python milter package includes a sample milter that replaces dangerous attachments with a warning message , discards mail addressed to MAILER - DAEMON , and demonstrates several SPAM abatement strategies .
The MimeMessage class to do this used to be based on the mimetools and multifile standard python packages .
As of milter version 0.6.0 , it is based on the email standard python packages , which were derived from the mimelib project .
The MimeMessage class patches several bugs in the email package , and provides some backward compatibility .
The " defang " function of the sample milter was inspired by MIMEDefang , a Perl milter with flexible attachment processing options .
The latest version of MIMEDefang uses an apache style process pool to avoid reloading the Perl interpreter for each message .
This makes it fast enough for production without using Perl threading .
mailchecker is a Python project to provide flexible attachment processing for mail .
I will be looking at plugging mailchecker into a milter .
TMDA is a Python project to require confirmation the first time someone tries to send to your mailbox .
This would be a nice feature to have in a milter .
Is a milter written in python efficient ?
For example , the HTML parsing feature to remove scripts from HTML attachments is rather CPU intensive in pure python .
Using the C replacement for sgmllib greatly speeds things up .
Goals
Implement RRS - a backdoor for non-SRS forwarders .
User lists non-SRS forwarder accounts ( perhaps in ~/.forwarders ) , and a util provides a special local alias for the user to give to the forwarder .
Alias only works for mail from that forwarder .

WAG THE DOG :
HOW TO CONCEAL MASSIVE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE
� I�m in show business , why come to me ? �
� War is show business , that �s why we�re here . �
� � Wag the Dog� ( 1997 film )
Last week , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had just announced record losses , and so had most reporting corporations .
Unemployment was mounting , the foreclosure crisis was deepening , state budgets were in shambles , and massive bailouts were everywhere .
Investors had every reason to expect the dollar and the stock market to plummet , and gold and oil to shoot up .
Strangely , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 300 points , the dollar strengthened , and gold and oil were crushed .
What happened ?
It hardly took psychic powers to see that the Plunge Protection Team had come to the rescue .
Formally known as the President�s Working Group on Financial Markets , the PPT was once concealed and its very existence denied as if it were a matter of strict national security .
But the PPT has now come out of the closet .
What was once a legally questionable �manipulator� of markets has become a sanctioned stabilizer and protector of markets .
The new tone was set in January 2008 , when global markets took their worst tumble since September 11 , 2001 .
Senator Hillary Clinton said in a statement reported by the State News Service :
� I think it�s imperative that the following step be taken .
The President should have already and should do so very quickly , convene the President�s Working Group on Financial Markets .
That �s something that he can ask the Secretary of the Treasury to do .
. . .
This has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world .�
1
The mystery over what was going on with the dollar the first week in August was solved by James Turk , founder of GoldMoney , who wrote on August 7 :
� [ T ] he banking problems in the United States continue to mount , while the federal government�s deficit continues to soar out of control .
. . .
So what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks ?
In a word , intervention .
Central banks have propped up the dollar , and here�s the proof .
� When central banks intervene in the currency markets , they exchange their currency for dollars .
Central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy US government debt instruments so that they can earn interest on their money .
The debt instruments central banks acquire are held in custody for them at the Federal Reserve , which reports this amount weekly .
� On July 16 , 2008 . . . , the Federal Reserve reported holding $ 2,349 billion of US government paper in custody for central banks .
In its report released today , this amount had grown over the past three weeks to $ 2,401 billion , a 38.4 % annual rate of growth .
. . .
So central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the US trade deficit .
The logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets .
They were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up , to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally , which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others .�2
Just as central banks manipulate currencies in concert , so gold can be manipulated by massive selling of central bank reserves .
Oil and any other market can be manipulated as well .
But markets can be manipulated by only so much and for only so long without fixing the underlying problem .
There is more bad news coming down the pike , news of such magnitude that no amount of ordinary manipulation is liable to conceal it .
For one thing , roughly $ 400 billion in ARMs ( adjustable rate mortgages ) have or will reset between March and October of this year .
Assuming 3 to 6 months for strapped debtors to actually hit the wall with their payments , a huge wave of defaults is about to strike , continuing through March 2009 � just in time for the next huge wave of resets , in option ARMs.3
Option ARMs are loans with the option to pay even less than just the interest on the loan monthly , increasing the loan balance until the loan reaches a certain amount ( typically 110 % to 125 % of the original loan balance ) , when it resets .
The $ 800 billion credit line recently opened to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be not only tapped but tapped out , at taxpayer expense .
The underlying problem is little discussed but impossible to repair � a one quadrillion dollar derivatives scheme that is now imploding .
Banks everywhere are facing massive writeoffs , putting the whole banking system on the brink of collapse .
Only public bailouts will save it , but they could bankrupt the nation .
What to do ?
War and threats of war have been used historically to distract the population and deflect public scrutiny from economic calamity .
As the scheme was summed up in the trailer to the 1997 movie � Wag the Dog� --
� There�s a crisis in the White House , and to save the election , they�d have to fake a war . �
Perhaps that explains the sudden breakout of war in the Eurasian country of Georgia on August 8 , just 3 months before the November elections .
August 8 was the day the Olympic Games began in Beijing , a distraction that may have been timed to keep China from intervening on Russia�s behalf .
The mainstream media version of events is that Russia , the bully on the block , invaded its tiny neighbor Georgia ; but not all commentators agree .
Mikhail Gorbachev , writing in The Washington Post on August 12 , observed :
� What happened on the night of Aug. 7 is beyond comprehension .
The Georgian military attacked the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas .
Russia had to respond .
To accuse it of aggression against �small , defenseless Georgia� is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity .
. . .
The Georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force .�
4
Bruce Gagnon , coordinator of the Global Network against Weapons and Nuclear Power , commented in OpEdNews on August 11 :
� The U.S. has long been involved in supporting �freedom movements � throughout this region that have been attempting to replace Russian influence with U.S. corporate control .
The CIA , National Endowment for Democracy . . . , and Freedom House ( includes Zbigniew Brzezinski , former CIA director James Woolsey , and Obama foreign policy adviser Anthony Lake ) have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout Central Asia that would play ball with �our side� .
. . .
None of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys .
It is power bloc politics . . . .
Big money is at stake . . . .
[ B] oth parties ( Republican and Democrat ) share a bi-partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world .
Obama�s advisers , just like McCain�s ( one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in Georgia ) are thick in this stew .
�5
Brzezinski , who is now Obama�s adviser , was Jimmy Carter�s foreign policy adviser in the 1970s .
He also served in the 1970s as director of the Trilateral Commission , which he co-founded with David Rockefeller Sr. , considered by some to be the �master spider� of the Wall Street banking network .
6 Brzezinski , who wrote a book called The Grand Chessboard , later boasted of drawing Russia into war with Afghanistan in 1979 , �giving to the Soviet Union its Vietnam War . �7
Is the Georgia affair an attempted repeat of that coup ?
Mike Whitney , a popular Internet commentator , observed on August 11 :
� Washington�s bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of South Ossetia .
Georgia President Mikhail Saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
After all , Saakashvili owes his entire political career to American power - brokers and US intelligence agencies .
If he disobeyed them , he�d be gone in a fortnight .
Besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support ; especially if it�s perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the Olympic games .
( another petty neocon touch )
That means Pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with Georgian generals for months in advance .
Nothing was left to chance .�8
Part of that careful planning may have been the unprecedented propping up of the dollar and bombing of gold and oil the week before the curtain opened on the scene .
Gold and oil had to be pushed down hard to give them room to rise before anyone shouted �hyperinflation !�
As we watch the curtain rise on war in Eurasia , it is well to remember that things are not always as they seem .
Markets are manipulated and wars are staged by Grand Chessmen behind the scenes .
Ellen Brown , J.D. , developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles .
In Web of Debt , her latest book , she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and � the money trust .�
She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves and how we the people can get it back .

Advertising .
It ’s everywhere .
It ’s wasteful .
It encourages overconsumption .
It ’s a menace to society .
It sure makes a convenient scapegoat for many of society ’s ills , does n’t it ?
Well what if I were to tell you that there is now an eco friendly mode of advertising out there , that leaves the environment cleaner than before it was there ?
Yes .
It exists .
GreenGraffitti , a service of Netherlands based graphic design / marketing firm Hemshaven , creates ads using three ingredients : Dirty , high foot traffic urban sidewalks , a stencil , and a high pressure water sprayer .
Apply stencil to sidewalk , spray water , remove stencil , and you have a visually compelling , totally non polluting , long lasting ( up to 6 months they claim ) ad .
GreenGrafitti say it ’s , “ completely carbon neutral and contributes in a unique way to a healthier environment . ”
But the question comes to my mind , yes they ’re not using paper , ink , PVC , etc , but what about all that water that ’s used ?
They compensate for that using carbon offsets from Groenbalans The GreenGraffitti site says they offset , “ From our water use to the kilometers we travel . ”
Really ?
Carbon offsets covering water usage I ’ve not heard of .
However , moving beyond this one point , GreenGraffitti uses green web host Thinkhost , donate 5 % of their profits to local organizations , and encourage clients to have them come back a few weeks later to completely clean the sidewalk where their ads have been placed .
Due to the simplicity of execution and ubiquity of the equipment needed , GreenGraffitti is available throughout Europe and even in the US .

UPDATE : I ’ve just confirmed that Quentin Tarantino is talking to Brad Pitt to star …
And Harvey Weinstein will produce it with Lawrence Bender …
EXCLUSIVE : Quentin Tarantino has just gone out with his long - anticipated script about World War II .
I hear it ’s gone out to Universal , Warner Bros , Paramount , and Sony .
Not only is Lawrence Bender attached to produce Inglorious Bastards , but here ’s the weird thing sources are telling me : Harvey Weinstein also will be producing as well but not financing it though his The Weinstein Co wants to distribute it domestically to pocket the fee .
This certainly adds fuel to those rumors that The Weinstein Co is having movie money woes .
After all , one of the ways that The Weinstein Co attracted investors was by hyping its creative connection to the Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill 1 & 2 writer / director who has long made a lot of money for a lot of people .
But will Harv ’s investors profit from the connection ?
Let ’s not forget that The Weinstein Co produced and financed Quentin ’s last pic Grindhouse / Death Proof that tanked at the box office because of Weinstein ’s own admission that he erred in releasing it in the U.S. market as half of a too - long 3 - hour , 12 - minute double - feature .
( UPDATE : QT and Harvey Weinstein lunched very visibly at Ago on Melrose today .
Just in case anyone thought they were n’t working together … )
This latest Tarantino epic , originally for Miramax and originally set for 2001 , has been so long in the works that some people thought it might never see the light of day .
Tarantino himself has described it as a Spaghetti Western meets World II film that ’s an homage to 1967 ’s The Dirty Dozen and its derivative , the more extreme 1978 Italian movie Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato ( released in the U.S. under the title Inglorious Bastards ) about a group of soldiers on their way to be executed who get the chance of a reprieve .
Tarantino ’s script comes out just as the Enzo G. Castellari inspiration is heading to DVD .
In a BBC documentary done around the time of Pulp Fiction ‘s release , Tarantino said that he always wanted to do a “ guys on a mission ” film .
As usual , there ’s a lot of secrecy surrounding this Quentin project sent out by William Morris .

cop acquitted in police dog's hot - car death
CHANDLER , Ariz . â 
An officer whose police dog died after being left in a patrol car for 13 hours last summer in suburban Phoenix was acquitted Friday of animal cruelty .
Chandler police Sgt. Tom Lovejoy was negligent , but prosecutors did not prove he acted recklessly , a justice of the peace ruled .
Lovejoy could have been jailed for six months if he had been convicted of the misdemeanor count .
Lovejoy testified that on the morning of Aug. 11 , 2007 , after working an overnight shift , he parked his police SUV in his driveway and went inside .
He said he was exhausted and forgot the Belgian Malinois was sleeping in the back of the vehicle .
Also Friday , a San Diego police officer was charged with a misdemeanor in a nearly identical case .
Paul Hubka , a longtime dog handler , is accused of leaving a 5 - year - old Belgian Malinois in his car on June 20 , when the outside temperature reached 108 degrees .
Hubka had worked a double shift and was exhausted and distracted when he got home , according to an attorney who represented him on another matter .
If convicted of the misdemeanor , Hubka faces a six - month jail sentence , a fine and restitution .
The city also sued Hubka to recover the cost to replace the dog .
This is unbelievable :
The federal government is working on a sweeping series of programs that would represent perhaps the biggest intervention in financial markets since the 1930s , embracing the need for a comprehensive approach to the financial crisis after a series of ad hoc rescues .
At the center of the potential plan is a mechanism that would take bad assets off the balance sheets of financial companies , said people familiar with the matter , a device that echoes similar moves taken in past financial crises .
The size of the entity could reach hundreds of billions of dollars , one person said .
In other words , folks spent years making billions upon billions of dollars on risky transactions , more money on the stock of companies that was artificially high based on those transactions , more money bundling all those transactions into more transactions , and made a killing , and when it turns out the whole thing is a big pile of shit , you and I get the god damned bill .
I do not ever want to hear another damned word about the free market .
I do n’t want to hear another thing about letting the market regulate itself .
I do n’t want to hear about the free flow of capital .
I do n’t want to hear about government getting out of our lives .
None of it .
From superfunds to super - bailouts , I am tired of other people getting rich being irresponsible and then being told I have to pay to clean it up .
I did n’t read one punitive aspect of this new plan .
Not one punishment for the people who did this .
A team from the the University of California in Los Angeles ( UCLA ) found the new prime – meaning it can be divided only by itself and one - by connecting 75 computers and harnessing their power .
Researchers examine carbon capture and storage to combat global warming
Technique has the potential to reduce more than 90 percent of an individual plant ’s carbon emissions , Lynn Orr says
Statoil The Sleipner A project injects carbon dioxide into saltwater aquifers deep beneath the sea floor off the Norwegian coast .
The project turns a profit due to the presence of Norway ’s high carbon taxes , scientists say .

This map shows carbon dioxide storage potential around the world .
Estimates of worldwide storage capacity range from 2 trillion to 10 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in its report on carbon capture and storage .
Global emissions in 2004 totaled 27 billion tons , according to the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Energy Information Administration .
Anthony Kovscek Lynn Orr Mark Zoback Sally Benson
While solar power and hybrid cars have become popular symbols of green technology , Stanford researchers are exploring another path for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide , the leading greenhouse gas that causes global warming .
Carbon capture and storage , also called carbon sequestration , traps carbon dioxide after it is produced and injects it underground .
The gas never enters the atmosphere .
The practice could transform heavy carbon spewers , such as coal power plants , into relatively clean machines with regard to global warming .
" The notion is that the sooner we wean ourselves off fossil fuels , the sooner we 'll be able to tackle the climate problem , " said Sally Benson , executive director of the Global Climate and Energy Project ( GCEP ) and professor of energy resources engineering .
" But the idea that we can take fossil fuels out of the mix very quickly is unrealistic .
We 're reliant on fossil fuels , and a good pathway is to find ways to use them that do n't create a problem for the climate . "
Carbon capture has the potential to reduce more than 90 percent of an individual plant 's carbon emissions , said Lynn Orr , director of GCEP and professor of energy resources engineering .
Stationary facilities that burn fossil fuels — such as power plants or cement factories — would be candidates for the technology , he said .
Capturing carbon dioxide from small , mobile sources , such as cars , would be more difficult , Orr said .
But with power plants comprising 40 percent of the world 's fossil fuel - derived carbon emissions , he added , the potential for reductions is significant .
Not only can a lot of carbon dioxide be captured , but the Earth 's capacity to store it is also vast , he added .
Estimates of worldwide storage capacity range from 2 trillion to 10 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in its report on carbon capture and storage .
Global emissions in 2004 totaled 27 billion tons , according to the U.S. Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration .
If all human - induced emissions were sequestered , enough capacity would exist to accommodate more than 100 years ' worth of emissions , according to Benson , coordinating lead author of the IPCC chapter on underground geological storage .
With fossil fuels already comprising 85 percent of the world 's energy consumption , and their use rapidly increasing due to the growth of developing countries , such as China and India , the need to find solutions to curb carbon emissions becomes even more crucial , Benson said .
From the air to the earth
In the capture process , carbon dioxide is extracted from a mix of waste gases .
The most common method sends the exhaust through a chimney containing a three - dimensional mesh .
As the gas goes up , a chemical solvent drizzles down , soaking up the gas where the two substances meet .
The carbon dioxide is then extracted from the liquid and compressed , now ready for storage .
The best storage options today lie in geologic sequestration — storage in old oil fields , natural gas reservoirs , deep saline aquifers and unminable coal beds , hundreds to thousands of meters underground .
The carbon dioxide is pumped down through wells , like those used to extract oil , and dissolves or disperses in its reservoir .
Viable locations must have a caprock , or an impermeable layer above the reservoir shaped like an upside - down bowl , that traps the gas and keeps it from escaping , the researchers said .
Safety smarts
" The goal of carbon sequestration is to permanently store the carbon dioxide , " Benson said , " permanent meaning very , very long - term , geological time periods . "
The greatest concern surrounding carbon dioxide storage is the potential for it to leak , researchers said .
The most obvious worry , said Benson , is that leakage would lead to more global warming , defeating the purpose of storage in the first place .
" People think , it would have been sort of sad going through all this trouble , " said Tony Kovscek , associate professor of energy resources engineering and a researcher on a GCEP project on carbon sequestration in coal .
But studies have shown that leakage , if it happened at all , would be insignificant , Benson said .
The IPCC reported that 99 percent retention of the carbon dioxide that is stored would be " very likely " over 100 years and " likely " over 1,000 years , she said .
" If you do it right , if you select the site correctly and monitor , it can be near permanent , " Benson said .
Of greater concern to the researchers are the potential risks of carbon sequestration to human health , mainly through asphyxiation and groundwater contamination .
The threat of asphyxiation — or suffocation due to carbon dioxide displacing oxygen — is very low , the researchers said , because of the unlikelihood of a rapid leakage , which would have to occur to cause a problem .
Drinking water contamination , Benson said , is the more probable danger .
For example , if carbon dioxide enters the groundwater somehow , it can increase the water 's acidity , potentially leaching toxic chemicals , such as lead , from rocks into the water , she said .
To address these risks , scientists are studying reservoir geology to better understand what happens after injecting carbon dioxide underground .
" You need to carefully select places that wo n't leak , and do a good job of engineering the injection systems and paying attention to where the carbon dioxide is actually going , " Orr said .
While a thorough technical understanding of the risks will reveal best practices , the scientists also stressed the need for good management to see that proper procedures are followed .
Benson points to a familiar technology as a model for thinking about and tackling risk .
" People often ask , is geological storage safe ?
It 's a very difficult question to answer .
Is driving safe ? " she expounded .
" You might say yes or no , but what makes driving something we 're willing to do ?
You get automakers to build good cars , we have driver training , we do n't let children drive , we have laws against drunk driving — we implement a whole system to ensure that the activity is safe . "
Policy and progress
Engineers have more than three decades of experience putting carbon dioxide into oil reservoirs , where it increases oil production by making the oil expand and " thin out " such that it flows more easily , Benson said .
" That experience gives us confidence that we know how to drill the wells , push the [ carbon dioxide ] in and say something about what will happen when it gets down there , " said Orr .
Currently , three industrial - scale projects are pumping millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the ground every year .
Two of them represent the first efforts at storage in deep saline aquifers .
A Stanford team also has begun researching storage of carbon dioxide in deep coal beds .
In coal , chemical bonds form between the carbon dioxide and the coal , making the method potentially more secure than others , the researchers said .
Even better , the process can free natural gas that sits on the coal 's surface .
Natural gas is a relatively clean fossil fuel , which can then be burned in place of coal , said Mark Zoback , professor of geophysics and a researcher on the project on storage in coal .
The project , which is funded by GCEP and GEOSEQ — a partnership involving the Department of Energy , several national labs , government groups and industry partners — is still in its early stages , the researchers said .
Of all the projects , only one is turning a profit without recovering oil .
Sleipner , an industrial - scale project run by Norwegian oil company Statoil , injects carbon dioxide into a deep saline aquifer beneath the North Sea floor .
Its economic success , scientists say , is due to the presence of Norway 's high carbon taxes , which give green technologies an advantage by discouraging carbon emissions .
Carbon taxes are charged to a company for every ton of carbon dioxide it emits , so that it becomes increasingly costly to be dirty .
Thus the taxes encourage companies to be green .
When a clean technology is expensive — incorporating carbon capture and storage into a power plant costs $ 30 to $ 70 per ton of carbon dioxide — taxes on emissions level the playing field and help make it viable .
A policy framework , therefore , is essential for making carbon capture and storage economical , the Stanford researchers said .
" We need thousands of projects , " Benson said .
" That 's the kind of thing that will only happen if there are global policies to address these issues .
That 's the number one critical thing . "
With the proper development , Benson believes that carbon sequestration could be ripe for industry in the next 20 years .
' A family of solutions '
Critics of carbon sequestration argue that the technology will divert attention from research on long - term clean energy options , such as renewable power .
Worse , they fear it will prolong fossil fuel use , if fossil fuels from some stationary sources can be used more cleanly .
But the researchers continually emphasize the need to adopt other technologies in addition to carbon sequestration .
" Geological sequestration is going to be one of a family of solutions for addressing the greenhouse gas issue , " said Zoback .
Energy efficiency and renewable energy are already feasible today and also can define the long - term energy picture , he said .
" [ Carbon dioxide ] sequestration , on the other hand , is only a bridge technology , " he added .
" Maybe we have another hundred years of using fossil fuels , and then we 'll be on to better and smarter things , one hopes .
If we 're going to be creating greenhouse gases for another hundred years , it 's a huge problem right now , so you have to get on this point .
But nonetheless , our dependence on fossil fuels is not going to last forever . "

A Democratic National Convention that is supposed to showcase Barack Obama will devote a considerable amount of time to Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family , with the two campaigns announcing an agreement Thursday to formally enter her name into nomination .
The development means that during the state - by - state vote on a nominee for president , delegates will have the option of choosing Clinton rather than Obama -- giving supporters a chance to cheer her candidacy one last time .
Barring an unforeseen collapse on Obama ’s part , Clinton wo n’t win ; Obama wound up with 136 more delegates than needed to clinch the nomination , and there are no signs of any defections .
But the purpose of the exercise is to resolve a nagging political problem for the Obama campaign and the Democratic Party .
Since Obama locked down the nomination in June , some Clinton loyalists have been slow to embrace his candidacy .
The two campaigns believe that by setting aside time to acknowledge Clinton , the party stands a better chance of avoiding a fractious scene on the convention floor and of emerging from the convention united .

Aides to Clinton and Obama said the two sides had been working cooperatively and were both satisfied with the arrangement .
“ With every voice heard and the party strongly united , we will elect Sen. Obama president of the United States , ” Clinton said in a statement released by the two campaigns .
Clinton had pointed to the restiveness of her supporters in an appearance at a private home last month , saying they needed “ a catharsis ” before falling in line behind Obama .
A video of Clinton ’s remarks was posted on YouTube .
Now that the four - day convention schedule is taking shape , it is clear that the Clinton family will have a prominent role .

If past practice holds , Clinton will be the focus of nominating and seconding speeches by people she designates before the roll - call vote .
Clinton herself will address the delegates in prime time on the second night of the convention , Tuesday , Aug. 26 .
Her husband , former President Clinton , will speak the following night .
Discussions are also taking place about whether daughter Chelsea Clinton will get a speaking slot .
Bill Whalen , a research fellow at the Hoover Institution , a public policy research center at Stanford University , said : “ Obama ’s people know that they have not closed the deal with Hillary voters the way they would like , and they just ca n’t afford to do anything -- real or perceived -- that upsets Mrs. Clinton and her followers .
So they have more than bent over to accommodate her . ”
The Clinton family ’s role at the convention has been the subject of prolonged negotiations with the Obama campaign .
Two prominent lawyers have been representing the Clintons ’ interests -- Robert B. Barnett and Cheryl Mills , a White House counsel in Bill Clinton ’s administration .

Some aides to Hillary Clinton said she had been unsure about the wisdom of putting her name into nomination .
While the convention can offer a coveted place in the national spotlight , Clinton risks appearing politically weak if many of the delegates she won during the primaries and caucuses split off and vote instead for Obama , either in the name of party unity or because they want to side with the winner .
Asked how Clinton herself would vote , campaign aides noted that she had endorsed Obama and campaigned for him , and they strongly indicated that she would vote for him .
At the same time , Clinton has voiced worries about a poor showing in private conversations with staff , as have some of her advisors , one former aide said .
“ You do worry , and I think that was something that concerned her as well , ” said the former aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to be candid .
“ What is the turnout going to be ?
Is anyone coming to my party ? ”

But Clinton loyalists said they were pleased to know that she would be recognized in such fashion .
Larry Scanlon , political director of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , said : “ She sought to be the first woman nominated for president .
She came up a little short , but she made it easier for the next female candidate to get the brass ring .
Many in the Democratic Party would like to celebrate that .
I think that they should celebrate that . ”
Recent conventions have been scripted affairs , with all four days devoted to showcasing the nominee , among them John F. Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000 .
But there have been many instances in which unsuccessful primary challengers have had their names placed into nomination .
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown ’s name was entered into nomination in 1992 , after he lost in the primaries and caucuses to Bill Clinton .

And both the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart had their names entered into nomination in 1984 , after losing to Walter F. Mondale .

He capitulated and enshrined torture as the policy of the United States , by allowing the CIA to use techniques as bad as and worse than the torture inflicted on him in Vietnam .
He gave the war criminals in the White House retroactive immunity against the prosecution they so richly deserve .
The enormity of this moral betrayal , this betrayal of his country 's honor , has yet to sink in .
But for my part , it now makes much more sense .
He is not the man I thought he was .
And when he had the chance to engage in a real and substantive debate against the most talented politician of the next generation in a fall campaign where vital issues are at stake , what did McCain do ?
He began his general campaign with a series of grotesque , trivial and absurd MTV - style attacks on Obama 's virtues and implied disgusting things about his opponent 's patriotism .
And then , because he could see he was going to lose , ten days ago , he threw caution to the wind and with no vetting whatsoever , picked a woman who , by her decision to endure her own eight - month pregnancy of a Down Syndrome child in public , that he was going to reignite the culture war as a last stand against Obama .
That 's all that is happening right now : a massive bump in the enthusiasm of the Christianist base .
This is pure Rove .
Yes , McCain made a decision that revealed many appalling things about him .
In the end , his final concern is not national security .
No one who cares about national security would pick as vice - president someone who knows nothing about it as his replacement .
No one who cares about this country 's safety would gamble the security of the world on a total unknown because she polled well with the Christianist base .
No person who truly believed that the surge was integral to this country 's national security would pick as his veep candidate a woman who , so far as we can tell anything , opposed it at the time .
McCain has demonstrated in the last two months that he does not have the character to be president of the United States .
And that is why it is more important than ever to ensure that Barack Obama is the next president .
The alternative is now unthinkable .
And McCain - no one else - has proved it .

HARMAR TOWNSHIP , Pa. 
Like cars and homes , grocery stores are beginning to shrink .
After years of building bigger stores  many larger than a football field and carrying 60,000 items  retailers are experimenting with radically smaller grocery stores that emphasize prepared meals , fresh produce and grab - and - go drinks .
The idea is to lure time - starved shoppers who want to pick up a few items or a fast meal without wandering long grocery aisles or paying restaurant prices .
Safeway has opened a smaller - format store in Southern California , and Jewel - Osco is building one in Chicago .
Wal - Mart plans to open four “ Marketside ” stores in the Phoenix area this fall , and Whole Foods Market is considering opening smaller stores .
And here in the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh , the grocery chain Giant Eagle opened a Giant Eagle Express last year that is about one - sixth the size of its regular stores .
It has gas pumps , wireless Internet and flat - screen televisions in a small cafe , a drive - through pharmacy and an expansive delicatessen that offers sushi , rotisserie chickens and ready - to - heat dinners .

SET FOR ANDOVER , MASS . , SEPTEMBER 13-14
A two - day conference on obtaining prosecutions of high level American war criminals will open September 13th , in Andover , Mass .
The conference will explore the legal grounds for , and plan for , obtaining prosecutions of President Bush and top officials of his Administration for war crimes .
In the tradition of America ’s Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trials after World War II , Justice Robert Jackson , the Conference ’s purpose is “ to hold high U.S. officials accountable in courts of law and , if guilt is found , to obtain appropriate punishments .
Otherwise , ” said the Conference ’s convener , Lawrence Velvel , “ the future will be threatened by additional examples of Executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences ” for their actions , leading to “ the possibility of more Viet Nams , more Iraqs , and more repression . ”
Velvel emphasized , “ This is intended to be a planning conference , one at which plans will be laid , and necessary organizational structures will be set up , to seek prosecutions to determine guilt and , if guilt is found , appropriate punishments . ” 
Attendees will hear from prominent authorities on international law , criminal prosecutions , and constitutional rights who are determined to give meaning to Justice Jackson ’s words :
“ The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people .
It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched . ” 
Topics to be discussed , Velvel said , include :
What international and domestic crimes were committed , which facts show crimes under which laws , and what punishments are possible .
Which high level Executive officials — and Federal judges and legislators as well , if any — are chargeable with crimes .
Which international tribunals , foreign tribunals and domestic tribunals ( if any ) can be used and how to begin cases and / or obtain prosecutions before them .
The possibility of establishing a Chief Prosecutor ’s Office such as the one at Nuremburg .
An examination of cases already brought and their outcomes .
Creating an umbrella Coordinating Committee with representatives from the increasing number of organizations involved in war crimes cases .
Creating a Center to keep track of and organize compilations of relevant briefs , articles , books , opinions , and facts , etc. , on war crimes and prosecutions of war criminals .
Scheduled to address the Conference are :
Famed former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , author of the best - selling “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush For Murder ” ( Vanguard ) .

( Original Article )
Actress Joanna Lumley was among those campaigning for the Gurkhas A group of retired Gurkhas fighting for the right to settle in Britain have won their immigration test case at London 's High Court .
They were challenging immigration rules which said that those who retired from the British Army before 1997 did not have an automatic right to stay .
Prominent supporter actress Joanna Lumley said it was a " chance to right a great wrong " .
The government said it would now review all Gurkhas ' cases .
' Debt of honour '
The regiment moved its main base from Hong Kong to the UK in 1997 and the government had argued that Gurkhas discharged before that date were unlikely to have strong residential ties with the UK .
That meant those who wanted to settle in the UK had to apply for British residence and could be refused and deported .
The judgement could affect some 2,000 former Gurkhas who retired before 1997 .
The judge , Mr Justice Blake , said the Gurkhas ' long service , conspicuous acts of bravery and loyalty to the Crown all pointed to a " moral debt of honour " and gratitude felt by British people .
He ruled that instructions given by the Home Office to immigration officials were unlawful and needed urgent revision .
Lawyer Martin
Howe said : " Today we have seen a tremendous and historic victory for the gallant Gurkha veterans of Nepal .
" This is a victory that restores honour and dignity to deserving soldiers who faithfully served in Her Majesty 's armed forces .
" It is a victory for common sense ; a victory for fairness ; and a victory for the British sense of what is right . "

The five ex-Gurkhas involved in the test case were L / Cpl Gyanendra Rai , Deo Prakash Limbu , Cpl Chakra Limbu , L/ Cpl Birendra Shrestha and Bhim Gurung .
Gita Mukhiya also took part on behalf her deceased husband .
Gurkhas have been part of the British Army for almost 200 years and are hand picked from a fiercely contested recruitment contest in Nepal to win the right to join .
They have seen combat all over the world , with 200,000 fighting in the two world wars .
' Wonderful vindication '
Lumley , whose father served with the Gurkhas , was one of those leading the campaign .
How the Gurkhas are celebrating Outside court , she said : " This day is more important than I can tell you because it gives our country the chance to right a great wrong and to wipe out a national shame that has stained us all . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was a " wonderful vindication " for those who had campaigned for a change in the law .
" I 've always felt that if someone is prepared to die for this country , then they should have the right to live in this country , " he said .
" The key thing now is to look at the ruling in detail and to make sure that the government now translates that into action and does n't try and squirm out of it . "
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a statement that the Home Office would revise its guidance surrounding the 1997 cut - off date .
" I have always been clear that where there is a compelling case , soldiers and their families should be considered for settlement , " she said .
" We will honour our commitment to the Gurkhas by reviewing all cases by the end of the year . "

Brady Wiseman in Bozeman MT
writes to note , " Bailing out the banks is not socialism .
The government and the Fed are not becoming exactly the creditors of the banks .
Because the numbers are so large , they are now partners .
It 's not a bailout so much as a merger .
What do you call the merger of government and corporations ?
Mussolini called it fascism . "
Wiseman is quite right .
We let ourselves get caught in the rhetoric of the day in which you can call anything you do n't like socialism , but god forbid you use the term fascism .
In the past , however , we have addressed this matter :
Sam Smith , 2006
- One needs to look not at Hitler but at the founder of fascism , Mussolini .
What Mussolini founded was the estato corporativo - the corporative state or corporatism .
Writing in Economic Affairs in the mid 1970s , R.E. Pahl and J. T. Winkler described corporatism as a system under which government guides privately owned businesses towards order , unity , nationalism and success .
They were quite clear as to what this system amounted to : " Let us not mince words .
Corporatism is fascism with a human face .
. .
An acceptable face of fascism , indeed , a masked version of it , because so far the more repugnant political and social aspects of the German and Italian regimes are absent or only present in diluted forms . " . . . Adrian Lyttelton , describing the rise of Italian fascism in The Seizure of Power , writes : " A good example of Mussolini 's new views is provided by his inaugural speech to the National Exports Institute on 8 July 1926 . . .
Industry was ordered to form ' a common front ' in dealing with foreigners , to avoid ' ruinous competition , ' and to eliminate inefficient enterprises .
. .
The values of competition were to be replaced by those of organization : Italian industry would be reshaped and modernized by the cartel and trust .
. . There was a new philosophy here of state intervention for the technical modernization of the economy serving the ultimate political objectives of military strength and self - sufficiency ; it was a return to the authoritarian and interventionist war economy .
" Lyttelton writes that " fascism can be viewed as a product of the transition from the market capitalism of the independent producer to the organized capitalism of the oligopoly . "
It was a point that Orwell had noted when he described fascism as being but an extension of capitalism .
Lyttelton quoted Nationalist theorist Affredo Rocco : " The Fascist economy is . . . an organized economy .
It is organized by the producers themselves , under the supreme direction and control of the State . " . . . Article 48 of the constitution of the Weimar Republic stated , " In case public safety is seriously threatened or disturbed , the Reich President may take the measures necessary to reestablish law and order , if necessary using armed force .
In the pursuit of this aim , he may suspend the civil rights described in articles 114 , 115 , 117 , 118 , 123 , 124 and 153 , partially or entirely .
The Reich President must inform the Reichstag immediately about all measures undertaken . . .
The measures must be suspended immediately if the Reichstag so demands .
" It was this article that Hitler used to peacefully establish his dictatorship .
And why was it so peaceful and easy ?
Because , according to Childers , the ' democratic " Weimar Republic had already used it 57 times prior to Hitler 's ascendancy .
There are eerie similarities between Article 48 and George Bush 's approach .
When you add to this the remarkable incompetence of the current regime , the collapse of both traditional liberal and conservative politics , and the economic crises , it feels like a new Weimar Republic setting the stage for awful things we can not at this point even imagine .
It may be that history has something to tell us after all .
BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - A newborn baby abandoned outdoors in winter by her 14 - year - old mother was found safe in a dog pen with a mother dog and her brood of puppies near the city of La Plata , Argentine media reported on Friday .
Farmer Fabio
Anze found the naked baby girl on Thursday , being kept warm among his dog China ’s puppies , La Nacion newspaper said .
Anze called the police and the baby was taken to a hospital .
Egidio Melia , director of the Melchor Romero hospital , told television and newspaper reporters that the baby was just a few hours old when she was found , and was in good health although she had some bruises .
Nighttime temperatures are chilly but not freezing in the Southern Hemisphere winter in the rural area around La Plata , 40 miles south of Buenos Aires .
Police said they had located the 14 - year - old girl who gave birth to the baby outdoors during the night .
It was not clear whether the mother left her baby in the dog ’s pen or whether the dog found the baby outdoors and carried it in to join her puppies .
This is some pretty funny stuff .
Prominent Clinton backer and Dem donor to endorse McCain
Posted : 10:45 AM ET WASHINGTON ( CNN ) — Lynn Forester de Rothschild , a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter and member of the Democratic National Committee ’s Platform Committee , will endorse John McCain for president on Wednesday , her spokesman tells CNN .
But that ’s not the good part .
Check this :
In an interview with CNN this summer , Forester did not hide her distaste for eventual Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
“ This is a hard decision for me personally because frankly I do n’t like him , ” she said of Obama in an interview with CNN ’s Joe Johns .
“ I feel like he is an elitist .
I feel like he has not given me reason to trust him . ” [ emphasis added ]
The half - Kenyan kid whose father deserted him , leaving him to be raised by mom and grandparents in Kansas , he ’s elitist .
Check .
And de Rothschild ?
She ’s the wife of this guy – Sir Evelyn de Rothschild , knighted financier and descendant of the – excuse me , the – insanely wealthy Rothschild banking dynasty .
Sweet fancy ballroom dancing Jesus – is this the Supreme High Queen of the Mystical Land of Douchebagistan or what ?
Let ’s review her pedigree résumé , shall we ?
Here ’s her Forbes profile .
It ’s like she ’s a walking homage to the common man .
Now this piece is something of a journalistic marvel .
It attempts to paint a portrait of a hard - working , self - made woman .
I have no doubt that she worked hard when young and she seems to be a woman with a good measure of business acumen .
But note what the story omits .
At various points along the way she makes some smart decisions , but … where did the money come from ?
She made “ a small fortune ” reselling jeans she ’d bought for $ 10 a pair in Europe , but in order to make a “ fortune ” of any size , that means she needed a certain amount of cash in her pocket .
Quite a bit of cash , in fact .
Then she studied law at Columbia – on need - based scholarships , no doubt – then she “ got a job ” in telecom and persuaded Motorola to buy a stake , yadda yadda yadda .
This is a woman that fortune seems to seek out , would n’t you say ?
Now , ask yourself , what kind of person does money come looking for ?
Here we at least get the words “ dazzingly well connected , ” and that may go a ways toward explaining some of the missing pieces in the bullet above .
I ’ll wait here while you wander though the stories linked here .
Take your time and savor the richness of it all .
No hurry .
What were we talking about again ?
Oh , right – Barack Obama is an elitist .
Got it .
Up next : Fifty Cent disses Pat Boone for being black .
Film at 11 .
But I digress .
Surely , surely , this is the most ambitious episode of Punk ’d yet .
At any moment Ashton Kutcher is going to jump out from behind a plant and yell GOTCHA at America .
Right ?
Or maybe Christopher Guest is doing another movie , this one about political campaigns ?
( Although I ’m a little confused , because Lady Die has clearly poached the Jennifer Coolidge role . )
Or even better – maybe this is something that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton ( one of Rothschild ’s buds ) cooked up .
Seriously , once this story breaks , no Republican apologist will ever be able to use the word “ elitist ” in public again .
It ’s brilliant – BRILLIANT , I say .
Because nobody – nobody – on the face of the Earth could be this lacking in self - awareness .
You could n’t even build a good stand - up routine around this because in order for something to be funny it has to be at least mildly grounded in plausibility .
But – apparently it ’s actually really truly happening and not a joke or a campaign ploy .
This hyper - privileged barking loon is serious .
You may have noticed the repeated references to “ Lady ” Rothschild .
That ’s apparently what she likes being called ( and if you believe the rumors , insists on being called ) .
Lady Rothschild .
Not Lynn , but LADY .
Motive ?
Well , she was a big Hillary supporter and raised six figures for the campaign .
I ’ll let you do your own speculation here .
Then there ’s this : “ I think if history is our guide , we ’ve had stronger economies , more wealth creation , under Democratic presidents than we have under Republican presidents . ”
Hey , you make it fit .
I ’ve given up .
In a stupid world gone silly , we have now braved the final frontier .
Braved it , paved it and built a Chuck E. Cheese on every corner .
Because this is not only the dumbest fucking thing any human being has ever said – in a political campaign or otherwise – it is the dumbest fucking thing it would be possible to stay .
How much blacker could this album be , ponders Nigel in Spinal Tap .
“ None .
None more black . ”
How much stupider could a statement be ?
None .
None more stupider .
You have reached the end of the journey , America .
Ashton Kutcher or no , you been punk’d .
Maybe the folks at Harvard ( and Yale ) really are smarter than everyone else .
Harvard 's $ 35 billion endowment returned 7 - 9 % for the fiscal year ending in June , easily outperforming a down market and dozens of hedge funds .
Where was Harvard 's money ?
Commodities -- the university began the year with 17 % invested in commodities , including timber and farmland ( that 's a very high percentage for an endowment )
Treasuries
Hedge Funds ( including some strong performers )

Rigidity may be given when it comes to the appearance of books , but modern designers have seen to it that this does n’t dictate the shelves that house them .
More than ever , personal taste is the deciding factor as storage space is given free reign to interact with design , user and environment .
Go with the flow and put your book shelves on show .

Though it would seem logical to include logic in the making of a practical item like a book shelf , designer Luca Nichetto decided convention was beyond his idea of functionality .

Years ago , he had visited Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority houses at universities in Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia , an obsession growing out of a romance with a sorority sister in his own college days at the University of Cincinnati  although someone who knew him well said the last such visit was in 1981 .
What is more relevant , agents focused new attention on a 2002 Army investigation of a spill of anthrax the same year outside the secure laboratory that Dr. Ivins worked in , and his puzzling behavior in trying to clean the area with bleach while failing to report the contamination .
They studied his anthrax vaccine patents and considered whether the promise of royalties after a bioterrorism scare might have been a motive .
They noted that he had a lyophilizer , which could be used to dry wet anthrax into powder , a form not ordinarily used at Fort Detrick .
They had even intensively questioned his adopted children , Andrew and Amanda , now both 24 , with the authorities telling his son that he might be able to collect the $ 2.5 million reward for solving the case and buy a sports car , and showing his daughter gruesome photographs of victims of the anthrax letters and telling her , “ Your father did this , ” according to the account Dr. Ivins gave a close friend .
As the investigation wore on , some colleagues thought the F.B.I. ’s methods were increasingly coercive , as the agency tried to turn Army scientists against one another and reinterviewed family members .
One former colleague , Dr. W. Russell Byrne , said the agents pressed Dr. Ivins ’s daughter repeatedly to acknowledge that her father was involved in the attacks .
“ It was not an interview , ” Dr. Byrne said .
“ It was a frank attempt at intimidation . ”
Dr. Byrne said he believed Dr. Ivins was singled out partly because of his personal weaknesses .
“ They figured he was the weakest link , ” Dr. Byrne said .
“ If they had real evidence on him , why did they not just arrest him ? ”
Another former co-worker , Dr. Kenneth W. Hedlund , who collaborated on anthrax research with Dr. Ivins in the 1980s , had a similar theory .
Bailing out the rich while stealing from the working class
The way out ?
Hyperinflation of the currency
Who will bail out the U.S. government ?
How the U.S. government plans to steal every last dollar from you
( Natural News )
The dire financial situation unfolding in our world today directly impacts you .
The safety of your money affects your ability to afford organic foods , nutritional supplements and " alternative " health care services that you have to pay out of pocket .
There are also huge implications for Big Pharma and the continued drug industry due to cascading bankruptcies that are about to start impacting city , state and national governments .
That 's why we 're covering this financial topic so closely on NaturalNews.com .
Just today , the Fed scraped together a desperate , last - minute agreement to provide a jaw - dropping $ 85 billion in funding to save AIG ( the insurance firm ) .
Why did they do this ?
Because if they had n't stepped in to save AIG , the entire global financial system would have collapsed within days .
That 's no exaggeration .
The Fed was the bailout funder of last resort , and it has just barely averted a global financial disaster so large , nothing in the history of human civilization even compares .
This is what happens when $ 445 trillion in leveraged financial instruments start to unravel ...
But the rescue was done by creating money from nothing and injecting it into the system .
That $ 85 billion , it turns out , dilutes the existing money supply , making your dollars increasingly worthless , and in the months ahead , everything you buy is going to get more expensive :
Food , supplements , gasoline , rent , health care services and much more .
The Fed , in essence , is stealing billions of dollars from the American people and using it to bail out rich bankers and powerful CEOs of huge financial institutions .
That $ 85 billion is on top of another $ 70 billion the Fed created just two days ago .
It totals $ 155 billion , or over $ 500 for every man , woman and child in America .
Think about it :
The Fed just reached into your pocket and stole $ 500 worth of purchasing power from you , and if you have a family of four , they just stole $ 2,000 from you .
And yet that 's only how much they stole in the last two days !
Add in all the money creation cash injections in just the last few months , and you get a HUGE number ... $ 200 billion in March , $ 30 billion to bail our Bear Stearns , $ 70 billion to prevent a stock market plunge ... the numbers just keep mounting .
The Federal Reserve is literally printing its way to YOUR bankruptcy .
To prevent the failure of wealthy financial institutions , it has decided to decimate the life savings of the American people .
It 's no surprise , of course : Every nation throughout history has done the same .
When push comes to shove , governments always sacrifice their people to save their wealthy elite , and the U.S. is no different .
This is a " Once - in - a - century type of event , " says former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on ABC television .
" There 's no question that this is in the process of outstripping anything I 've seen , and it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go , " he added .
These words , remember , are from the king of understatement .
When the dot - com crash took place , he famously called it an era of " irrational exuberance . "
Now he 's calling this a once - in - a - century event .
That means this is bigger than the ' 87 " black Monday " crash , and possibly bigger than the Great Depression in ' 29 .
As banks are failing , the FDIC is bailing them out .
The FDIC , of course , insures banks against catastrophic loss .
Thanks to a string of recent bank failures , the FDIC is now down to its last $ 43 billion in reserves .
Sounds like a lot , right ?
Well consider this ... Washington Mutual looks to be headed towards outright bankruptcy .
It 's a huge bank , and if it fails , it will need $ 180 billion to cover its depositors .
That 's $ 137 billion MORE than the FDIC has .
In other words , if Washington Mutual fails , So what happens when the insurer itself goes bankrupt ?
The U.S. government steps in , of course .
Only there 's a problem here too :
It 's $ 9 trillion in debt right now , nearly double what it was four years ago .
That 's nine trillion with a " T " -- it 's a whole lot of money , even by global finance measures .
The government is so broke that it 's actually borrowing money from other countries every single day just to keep its doors open .
Day - to - day operations of the U.S. government , in other words , are not funded by U.S. taxpayers ... they 're funded by borrowing money from overseas investors !
And those investors are increasingly realizing they 're fools to loan yet more money to a nation that 's already $ 9 trillion in the hole .
The day is coming when foreign nations and central banks end their welfare support for the United States of America , and when that happens , all bets are off ... literally .
The U.S. government will be forced to shut down within days .
UNLESS , of course , it finds a way to steal money from the People and continue funding its own operations .
It just so happens there 's a very clever way for the U.S. government to transfer virtually all the wealth from the hands of its citizens into the pocket of the U.S. Treasury .
It requires no direct theft , no taxation and no new laws .
In fact , it can be done quietly , silently , and without any warning .
In fact , it 's already started to happen .
What is it ?
The runaway creation of new money .
Fire up the printing presses in Washington , Chief !
Here comes a trillion dollars in fiat currency !
Yes , ultimately , the United States government will havebut to print its way out of debt , and it will do it by creating so much new money out of thin air that your own money becomes virtually worthless .
Sure , you 'll still have your $ 5,000 in the bank ; it just wo n't be worth $ 5,000 anymore .
Today , you can use $ 5,000 to buy a motorcycle .
After the U.S. government hyperinflation bailout , you might be lucky to be able to buy a bicycle with the same $ 5,000 .
If things get really bad , you 'll be lucky to trade it for a skateboard .
So what can you do to protect yourself from all this ?
For one , do n't leave your dollars hanging around as dollars .
Right now , you can convert silly paper dollars into REAL things like land , gold , food or even shares in selected companies .

Charlie Rangel 's support for Clinton earns the congressman a place at the end of the line behind Obama ’s loyalists .
Payback ?
Obama snubs Rangel
The Obama campaign is denying House Ways and Means Chairman Charles B. Rangel a speaking role at this month ’s Democratic National Convention — a move those close to the powerhouse Harlem congressman view as a spiteful snub .
Rangel surrogates approached Obama staffers this week about the possibility of securing him a slot at the podium , making the case that it would showcase reconciliation between the nominee and Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s African - American supporters .
Advertisement
But they were told that the 78 - year - old congressman ’s support for Clinton earned him a place at the end of the line behind Barack Obama ’s loyalists — even if Rangel played a crucial part in prodding Clinton to abandon her presidential bid in June .
“ It ’s crazy . …
This man [ Rangel ] controls tax policy in the United States .
He ’s a lot bigger than just a regular member of Congress .
He deserves more respect than this , ” said a Rangel confidant .
“ Basically they have told us they can’t help us , that there are too many Obama supporters ahead of Charlie on the line . ”
Responding to questions posed to the Obama press office , convention spokesperson Natalie Wyeth said : " We have a wealth of talent within our party and very limited speaking roles . "
Rangel “ is a team player and will support ” Obama , the confidant said , but added “ I ca n’t imagine that Charlie is happy about this . ”
Another Rangel insider said the chairman — whose support is deemed essential if Obama wants to pass his tax reform agenda — is more aggravated than angry .
But the famously blunt Korean War veteran is “ way less than jazzed ” about attending the convention and plans to spend only a day or two in Denver , the person added .
“ This is n’t unexpected — Charlie is the New York face of Hillary Clinton , ” said Baruch College politics professor Doug Muzzio .
“ There ’s already an awful lot of Clinton in this convention and Charlie would have been a bit too much . ”
Obama ’s nearly unanimous support among blacks nationwide has made securing the support of elder statesmen like Rangel less important — and the New York Times ' recent investigation into Rangel ’s access to spacious apartments in Harlem at below - market rents has n’t gone unnoticed in Obama ’s Chicago headquarters .
A Rangel spokesman had no comment .
The dean of New York ’s congressional delegation sparred sporadically with Obama during the primaries — most notably describing Obama ’s comments about the historical roles played by Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon Baines Johnson as “ absolutely stupid . ”
But he also played a critical , perhaps decisive role , in convincing the former first lady to bow out gracefully during an early June conference call with House members .
And he ’s been glowing in his praise of the party ’s first African - American nominee after Clinton withdrew on June 7 .

My showoffy suburbanite friend converted his garage into a $ 20,000 home theater system with 5.1 surround , a rear - projector TV , the works .
I want to do the same thing , but I do n't have that kind of cash and I live in a studio apartment and can't put holes in my wall .
What do I do ?
-- Covetous in Chelsea
Dear Mr. Covetous :
You 're in luck !
Small rooms , like most studio apartments , make for great home theaters because you wo n't need a massive , costly sound system to adequately fill the space with theater - quality sound .
And with a halfway decent projector , you 'll be able to fill one of your walls with the magic of movies .
For just a couple grand , you 'll be able to have home screening nights -- the kind of luxury usually associated with Cribs episodes and Hollywood producer - douches .
Sure , two grand is still a chunk of change , but my inner salesman would like to point out that this investment pays for itself over time .
After all , it would cost four people roughly $ 45 to see a movie at the theater .
That 's $ 45 that can be plugged right back into gourmet Chinese takeout and a case of imports .
( Or , you know , you could also use it to pay off that two grand home theater system .
Your pick . )
There 's a dizzying array of home theater setups covering all kinds of price ranges and room sizes , but I 'm just going to share the equipment I like best for your problem , along with some pointers for converting your pad into a mini movie theater .
This week , we 'll cover the audio part -- you 'll want to figure this part out first to get the lay of the land , starting at the speakers and working towards the screen .
( Next week , we 'll handle the projector part of the equation . )
If you 've got a tiny 14 - foot - by - 14 - foot apartment , you can't clutter your place with an eight - speaker setup -- six is already making you feel like the walls are closing in .
Your best bet is the Cambridge SoundWorks SurroundWorks system .
This all - in - one solution has just three pieces -- a CD / DVD player , a central speaker , and a subwoofer .
In a small room , you wo n't need more -- the ingenious engineers at Cambridge have created a multidriver , multichamber main speaker that convincingly simulates a big , complex sound , while the subwoofer provides the warmth and deep , explosion - friendly bass you yearn for .
The Cambridge SoundWorks SurroundWorks ( $ 999 ) uses just three components -- a subwoofer ( at left ) , a main speaker ( top left ) , and a CD / DVD player -- to do the work of eight speakers .
Sometimes you do n't need eight speakers , just two really great , well - placed ones -- the trick is properly setting up those speakers .
You want to put the main speaker right below the projected image , firing it head - on into the seating area .
Then , aim the subwoofer at the wall behind the seating area -- the sound bounces off this wall , adding power to the bass and warmth to the soundscape .
If you want even more bass , point the subwoofer toward the corner of the room -- about two to three feet away -- since a corner is , at point of fact , two walls .
( One downside : the SurroundWorks CD / DVD player is n't Blu - Ray or HD compatible , so if you want to open that visually gorgeous , logistically vexing can of worms , you 're going to have to plug in your HD DVD player into the SurroundWorks device .
It 's a little awkward , but totally doable , which is good news for people who own an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 . )
In a bigger is better world , it can be hard accepting that less is more .
One of the counterintuitive truths of home theater audio is that the summer blockbuster explosion fests need less powerful sound systems to get their point across .
Their dum - dum sound design is really geared for crummy systems -- they 're already recorded at earsplitting volumes , the loud noises are mixed low , and the low noises are mixed high .
The result is that they 're incredibly loud in a bad way , sonically cluttered , oppressive , and relentless .
Point is , you could actually save money and go for cheaper audio if your cinematic predilections lean towards , the oeuvre of Messrs .
Ratner and Bay .
( If you 're more inclined towards , the subtle , overlapping dialogue of Altman or the oddly quiet films of Jarmusch , you 're gonna need more watts to lift and separate the complex layers of sound in those kinds of films . )
If you 've got speaker envy and can't bear to get by with two , you 've got a ton of options .
The $ 1,099 Onkyo HT - S907 has seven speakers , a subwoofer , a CD / DVD player , and an impressive 90 watts / channel receiver that will deliver the well - staged sound Altman deserves .
If you already have a receiver , the $ 1,099 JBL CS6100 is a five speaker - and - a - woofer set with insane clarity , ably providing a trippy stereo experience that can only come from six crisp speakers .
Happily , the JBLs also look good in your apartment -- the slick little black pods have that Wall Street , Sharper Image , ostentatiously high - end stereo look that will have your suburban friend swooning with jealousy .
Next week :
Why projectors are a cineaste 's best friend , and a magical can of paint .

Exclusive to STR
September 29 , 2008
The other day I went down to downtown Manhattan to check out a demonstration against Bush 's $ 700 billion economic bailout plan .
It was a fairly quiet and subdued affair ; no fire , no élan .
I saw plenty of placards advocating Communism as " a new way " , clever signs berating Bush and Cheney as socialists , pro-Obama buttons , etc. -- but not one trashing fiat money , imperial warfare or central banking ( which would 've stricken closer to the root of the problem ) .
As I walked around , I saw folks fiddling with their new iPods and iPhones , dressed to impress , clutching their oh - so - clever handmade anti-Bush signs .
A half - dozen tour buses slogged by and a precious few tourists were oh - so - kind enough to applaud the demonstration .
About eight cops suddenly pulled up in their cute little motor scooters and a number of , um , " well fed " office workers drifted in and out of my way as they hurried back from their lunch / coffee / smoke breaks .
A wave of futility splashed me .
Nothing would come of today 's rally .
If Congress and the White House intend to do their socialist corporate bailout , strings or no strings attached , it will happen .
If Treasury Secretary Paulson convinces enough officials to let him set up his dictatorial command - economy regime in some form , it will happen .
And I 'll tell you this : the demonstrators would be pissed , I would be pissed , you would be pissed , and not anyone would rise up to do a thing .
Especially not you .
Heavens no ... you 've too much to lose by daring to really struggle against this insanity .
You 're too eager to keep your precarious position in the precarious social , political , and economic pecking order .
Why , I too would hardly get off the couch unless I see that The People will rise up with me ( strength and solidarity in numbers ! ) .
And so the band - aid is applied , the Monopoly money flies off the Treasury presses , the pigs - in - suits in our dual capital cities of D.C. and Wall Street snort with glee , and you and me and our children go into political debt slavery .
But no matter , as long as you have your nice houses and nice cars and your all - inclusive vacation packages and your nice gadgets and your Whole Foods and your reasonable gas prices and your darling Wal - Mart trinkets and your bottled ( tap ) water , and so on ... you 're in good shape no matter what the price .
And if you feel some pious , passive - aggressive moral indignation once in a while , it 's even better ; you 're a model middle class citizen !
Witness the specimen of the well - fed , well - behaved lunch - break protester texting his bunk buddy on his new iPhone , sporting the cute $ 45 American Apparel blazer and a copy of the New York Times ( all the news that 's fit to print , eh ? ) , his bike parked nearby so that he can save the Earth from abnormally warm weather , hoping a little piece of paper called a ballot will change the world .
Here we have the exact reason why the ruling classes have nothing to fear and can act with impunity !
We have evolved into that pathetic creature , the neutered 21st Century Bourgeois -- perfectly passive prey for them .
Revolutions happen because people become sick and tired and fed - up with the current social , economic , and / or political situation , and like a rubber band that is stretched too much , they snap .
They 're conscious of being victimized in some way and they can't stand any more .
Snap !
Widespread poverty , misery , hunger , disease , secret police , mass murders , blatant and repeated acts of political violence , and a pervasive sense of desperation are all common historical revolution starters .
But we are all bourgeois now in 21st Century America .
There is no hunger , no misery , no rage , no desperation .
We can't even comprehend these things .
We certainly do n't feel , act , or live like victims of economic terrorism ; it would hurt us too much psychologically to admit that status .
We have too much invested in the political and financial system that spawned this crisis -- hopes , dreams , beliefs , actions -- and we feel cozy and safe in our familiar rut even if we 're occasionally unsatisfied with it .
It 's the fraudulent feeling that we shall never fall from our Olympus .
It 's the ultimate luxury , and you do n't want to lose it by revolting against this corrupt System .
Do n't even think about educating yourself on it !
For instance , regarding the Iraq War , Rob Rossmeissl writes , " Perhaps the apathy of young people today regarding U.S. policy is due to the world we live in rather than a diminished social conscience .
It is easy to romanticize about Vietnam - era political activism as the result of a generation full of concerned moralists , but in reality , a much more selfish cause -- the threat of conscription -- caused that generation to enter politics . "
That 's why I 've come to sincerely hope for an economic panic , as well as more extreme developments .
Yes indeed , I 'm brash enough to say , " let the house of cards tumble " .
A proverbial kick to the rear to the neutered bourgeois -- that 's the only thing that will force us , to really see and feel , in a tangible and personal way , just how badly we 've been screwed .
This economic situation is not akin to a worn - out car transmission that you can fix easy as you please ; it 's more like a series of bloated tumors enveloping the body , corrupting the organs , and sucking the life out of the patient .
Sometimes it 's better to just euthanize the patient -- a financial / economic system built on statist privilege , war profiteering , fractional - reserve banking , fiat money and economic manipulation on the part of the Fed , bankers and brokers gambling with people 's futures and passing the risks and costs to you .
Open Source and the Fall of VMware
by Ostatic Staff - Jul. 08 , 2008
The Net is abuzz today with the news of VMware 's president and CEO Diane Greene leaving which has also caused a huge plunge in VMware 's stock .
Our sister site has a good story on the possible reasons , which may be attributable to politics within the company .
VMware , of course , built a huge market capitalization on the back of its virtualization technology .
As ZDNet has suggested , I think the problems at VMware may have to do with increased competition from open source virtualization offerings -- and also from operating systems , especially Windows .
VMware is not a one - product company , but its huge market capitalization was largely built on efforts in one arena : virtualization .
Unfortunately , that red hot technology is increasingly being encroached on by open source offerings , and it is always a precarious proposition for tech companies to depend on one product category as heavily as VMware has .
Just ask the former employees of Netscape or Lotus about that .
As we 've covered , Red Hat is a new entrant to the virtualization space , Sun is offering free virtualization and bundling it with its OS , and Microsoft is adding virtualization to Windows Server , That 's not even mentioning XenSource and Xen - - focused on open source virtualization .
It 's the nature of software utilities for them to become free , and often wrapped into operating systems .
Countless purveyors of software utilities have learned that lesson , going back to the beginning of the personal computer industry .
Central Point Software and countless other early players in the utility space watched Windows wrap in utilities similar to theirs , decimating their businesses .
Even Symantec 's Norton line has had to step very nimbly to stay alive because of this phenomenon .
The primary competition for Norton Utilities , over the years , has come from Microsoft Windows .
Virtualization , is , at its core , headed for software utility status , and will likely be wrapped into operating systems , and increasingly adopted in open source form for free .
With fast multi-core processors , historically unprecedented low costs for memory and storage , and other favorable trends , running multiple operating systems on single systems makes lots of sense and is an under - the - hood necessity in today 's operating systems .
That spells big trouble for VMware -- with many historical precedents causing one to wonder about the company 's business .
As ZDNet noted in its story ( see the link above ) , Paul Maritz is being tapped to replace Diane Greene .
Maritz is a former long - time Microsoft executive .
He would understand the threat of virtualization appearing in Windows Server and Solaris .
He would understand the general path that software utilities take over time .
I think open source has much to do with this executive replacement and adjustment in stock price .
' Robin Hood ' bank manager stole £ 7 m from rich clients and gave it to needy customers
A bank manager behaved like a real - life Robin Hood by taking millions of pounds from rich clients and giving it to needy customers .
Benedict Hancock , a 39 - year - old father of two , channelled more than £ 7 million into the accounts of companies in trouble .
Astonishingly , the unassuming Royal Bank of Scotland senior relationship manager did so for ' an entirely altruistic motive ' , Blackfriars Crown Court has heard .
Robin Hood : Benedict Hancock plundered his rich clients ' accounts at the Royal Bank of Scotland
The court was told that Hancock carried out the bizarre fraud because 'he wanted the companies to do well , for their sake rather than his ' .
Hancock - who like his mythical counterpart is from Nottinghamshire - enjoyed good relationships with the 40 corporate clients whose money he looked after .
Accordingly , when some of the firms needed extra cash to see them through difficult times , he loaned them money from his better - off customers , setting up numerous false accounts to transfer millions from rich to poor .
In most cases the holders of the plundered accounts did not notice that the money was missing .
If they did , Hancock told them that the money had been invested in ultra-safe Bank of England bonds .
He even ensured that the raided accounts received the full interest they were due , despite the fact that the capital was missing .
Today Hancock 's barrister Andrew Lloyd - Eley told the court that Hancock , who had worked for RBS for 18 years and earned £ 49,000 a year , was of ' good character ' .
Mr Lloyd - Eley claimed his client received no personal gain from the fraud , saying : ' The only explanation he gave was that he wanted the companies to do well .
He got on well with them and he wanted to make sure that they succeeded for their sake rather than his .
' All of Mr Hancock 's customers - and the bank - spoke very highly of him .
He was dedicated to his job . '
Hancock 's unauthorised loans were discovered in November 2006 when one of his rich clients discovered that his account was £ 5 million short .
An internal investigation discovered that Hancock had lent the missing money - plus another £ 1.3 million - to a failing clothes manufacturer .
Hancock was found guilty of 14 counts of false accounting and one of abuse of position .
The charges related to unauthorised loans to three companies .
Two firms have arranged to pay back the money they received , but RBS has written off the £ 6.3 million owed by the clothes manufacturer .
Sentencing Hancock to 18 months in prison , Judge Ian Karsten QC said that although Hancock 's motives appeared to be good , he would have benefited indirectly through his annual bonus .
He said : ' I accept that you made no direct financial gain but I am satisfied that there was an element of indirect personal gain .
' The motivation was to ensure that you remained in good stead with your superiors so that you received your annual bonus . '
The court heard that the first Hancock 's wife Paula knew of his activities was when he was arrested .
The couple , who have two sons aged ten and six , have since split up .
Prior to being imprisoned today , Hancock was working for a debt - collecting company .
As Denver dignitaries gathered Tuesday for Mayor John Hickenlooper ’s State of the City address , City Council President Michael Hancock introduced singer Rene Marie to perform the national anthem .
But that ’s not what she did .
Instead , Marie performed the song “ Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing , ” which also is known as the “ black national anthem . ”
When she finished , the proceedings moved forward , and the “ Star - Spangled Banner ” was never performed .
Councilman Charlie Brown took to local talk radio Tuesday afternoon to blast the lack of the nation ’s anthem at the proceedings .
“ There ’s no replacement for the national anthem , ” Brown said .
“ They should have sung it . ”
“ I was surprised , ” said Hancock , who said he thought Marie should have cleared her plans with the mayor ’s office in advance .
By Tuesday afternoon he had received several telephone calls from citizens and the media .
“ But you go on with the show . ”
Hickenlooper said in a statement : “ We were as surprised as anyone that jazz singer René Marie did not sing our national anthem at Tuesday ’s State of the City ceremony , as our staff had requested .
As I listened to her sing , I assumed she would eventually move into the traditional Star Spangled Banner .
I called her personally this ( Tuesday ) afternoon to understand what happened .
She explained her song was an artistic expression of her love for her country .
She said she meant no disrespect of any kind and that her song was in no way intended to be a political statement .
She apologized for any problems she may have created .
“ I ’m disappointed that this matter has been a distraction from the great work and significant accomplishments of our City employees over the past year and the many important initiatives on tap for the coming year .

I think that the most ringing endorsement that I can give Strange Loop is that it has been a very long time since I experienced so much agony when trying to pick which talks to go to during any given block .
Emerging Languages Camp
This year Strange Loop hosted the Emerging Languages Camp ( ELC ) , which previously had been hosted at OSCON .
I liked the fact that it was its own event , not yet another track in the OSCON panoply .
That , coupled with a very PLT oriented audience this year , made Strange Loop a much better match for ELC than OSCON .
I definitely went into ELC interested in a particular set of talks .
There is a lot of buzz around big data , and some of the problems around big data and data management more generally .
Also I did my graduate work around implementing “ database programming languages ” , so there was some academic interest to go along with the practical necessity .
There were three talks that fell into that bucket : Bandicoot : code reuse for the relational model , The Reemergence of Datalog , and Julia : A Fast Dynamic Language for Technical Computing .
I found Bandicoot a little disappointing .
I think that the mid 90 ′ work of Buneman ’s group at UPenn on Structural Recursion as a Query Language and Comprehension Syntax would be a better basis for a modulary and reusable system for programming relations .
Logic Programming may be making a resurgence via the work on core.logic in Clojure and the influence of Datalog on Cascalog , Datomic and Bloom .
The Reemergence of Datalog was tutorial on Datalog for those who had never seen it before , as well as a survey of Datalog usage in those modern day systems .
Julia is a language that sits in the same conceptual space as R , SAS , SPSS , and so forth .
The problem with most of those systems is that they were designed by statisticians and not programmers .
So while they are great for statistical analysis , they are less good for statistical programming .
Julia aims to improve on this , while adding support for distributed compuation and a very high performance implementation .
There ’s no decisive winner in the technical computing space , and it seems like Julia might have a chance to shine .
There were , of course , some other interesting language talks at ELC .
Dave Herman from Mozilla talked about Rust for the first time ( at least to a large group ) .
Rust is being developed as a systems programming language .
There are some interesting ideas in it , particularly a very Erlang like concurrency model .
At the same time , there were some scary things .
Part of what Rust is trying to do is achieve performance , and part of how this happens is via explicit specification of memory / variable lifetimes .
Syntactically this is accomplished via punctuation prefixes , and I was wondering if the code was going to look very Perl-ish .
servo is browser engine that is being written in Rust , and looking at the source code of a real application will help me to see whether my Perlishness concern is valid .
Elixir : Modern Programming for the Erlang VM looks like a very nice way to program atop BEAM ( the Erlang VM ) .
Eliminating the prolog inspired syntax goes a long way , and it appears that Elixir also addresses some of the issues around using strings in Erlang .
It was n’t clear to me that all of the string issues have been addressed , but I was definitely impressed with what I saw .
Strange Loop Talks and Unsessions
I ’m going to cover these by themes .
I ’m not sure these are the actual themes of the conference , but they are the themes that emerged from the talks that I went to .
First , and unsurprisingly , a data theme .
The opening keynote , In Memory Databases : the Future is Now ! was by Mike Stonebraker .
It ’s been a long time since I saw Stonebraker speak – I think that the last time was when I was in graduate school .
He was basically making the case that transaction processing ( TP ) is not going away , and that there might be applications for a new generation of TP systems in some of the places where the various NoSQL systems are now being used .
Based on that hypothesis / assumption , he then went on to describe the trends in modern systems and how they would lead to different design , much of which is embodied in VoltDB .
This was a very controversial talk , at for some people .
I considered the trend / system analysis part to be reasonable in a TP setting .
I ’m not sure that I agree with his views on the applicability of TP , but I ’m fairly sure that time will sort all of that out .
I think that this is an important point for the NoSQL folks to keep in mind .
When the original work on RDBMS was done , it was mocked , called impractical , not useful and so forth .
It took many years of research and technology development .
I think that we should expect to see something similar with NoSQL , although I have no idea how long that timeline will be .
Nathan Marz ’s talk Runaway Complexity in Big Data … and a plan to stop it .
was basically making the case for , and explaining the hybrid / combined batch / realtime architecture that he pioneered at BackType , and which is now in production at Twitter .
That same architecture led to Cascading and Storm , which are pretty interesting systems .
Marz is working on a book with Manning that will go into the details of his approach .
The other interesting data talks revolved around Datomic .
Unfortunately , I was unable to attend Rich Hickey ’s The Database as a Value , so I did n’t get to hear him speak directly about Datomic .
There are several Datomic related videos floating around , so I ’ll be catching up on those .
I was able to attend the evening unsession Datomic Q&A / Hackfest .
This session was at 9 pm , and was standing room only .
I did n’t have quite enough background on Datomic to follow all of what was said , but I was very interested by what I saw : the time model , the immutability of data which leads to interesting scalability , the use of Datalog .
I ’m definitely going to be looking into it some more .
The one thing that troubles me is that it is not open source .
I have no problem with a paid supported version , but it ’s hard to make the argument for proprietary system or infrastructure software nowadays .
Another theme , which carried over from ELC was logic programming .
I had already heard Friedman and Byrd speak at last fall ’s Clojure / conj , and I was curious to see where they have taken miniKanren since then .
In their talk , Relational Programming in miniKanren , they demonstrated some of what they showed previously , and then they ran out of material .
So on the fly , they decided to implement a type inferencer for simple lambda terms live on stage .
Not only were they able to finish it , but since it was a logic program , they were also able to run it in reverse , which was pretty impressive .
I was hoping that they might have some additional work on constraints to talk about , but other than disequality constraints , they did n’t discuss anything .
Afterwards in Twitter , Alex Payne pointed out that there are some usability issues with miniKanren ’s API ’s .
I think that this is true , but it ’s also true that this is a research system .
You might look at something like Clojure ’s core.logic for a system that ’s being implemented for practitioners .
David Nolen did an unsession Core Logic : A Tutorial Reconstruction where he walked the audience through the operation of core.logic , and by extension , miniKanren , since the two systems are closely related .
He pointed out that he read parts of “ The Reasoned Schemer ” 8 times until he understood it enough to implement it , and then he found that he did n’t really understand it until after the implementation was done .
There was also a large crowd in this session , and Christopher Petrelli made a video recording on his phone , since InfoQ was n’t recording the unsessions .
The final talk in the logic programming them was Oleg Kiselyov ’s talk Guess lazily !
Making a program guess and guess well .
Kiselyov has been around for a long time and written or coauthored many important papers related to Scheme and continuations .
I ’ve be following ( off and on ) his work for a long time , but this is the first time I was at a conference where he was speaking .
I was shocked to find that the room was packed .
His talk was about how to defer making the inevitable choices required by non-determinism , especially in the context of logic type systems .
His examples were in OCaml , which I had some trouble following , but after Friedman and Byrd the day before , he apparently felt compelled to write a type inferencer that could be run backwards as well .
His code was a bit longer than the miniKanren version .
The next theme is what I ’d call effective use of functional programming .
The first talk was Stuart Sierra ’s Functional Design Patterns .
This was a very worthwhile talk , which I wo n’t attempt to summarize since the slides are available .
Needless to say , he found a number of examples that could be called design patterns .
This was one of the talks where I need to sit down and look at the patterns and think on them for a while .
That ’s hard to do during the talk ( and the conference , really ) .
Some things require pondering , and this is one of them .
The other talk in this category was Graph : composable production systems in Clojure , which described the Prismatic team ’s approach to composing systems in Clojure .
What they have is an abstraction that allows them to declaratively specify how the parts of the system are connected .
For a while it just looked to me like a way to encode a data flow graph in a Clojure abstraction .
The aha moment was when he showed how they use Clojure metadata to annotate the arguments or pipe connectors if you will .
The graphs can be compiled in a variety of ways including Clojure lazy maps , which present some interesting possibilities .
Unfortunately , I had to leave half way through the talk , so I missed the examples of how the apply this abstraction in their system .
Theme number four was programming environments .
I hesitate to use the term IDE , because it connotes a class of tools that is loved by some , reviled by others , and when you throw that term around , it seems to limit people ’s imagination .
I contributed to the Kickstarter for Light Table , so I definitely wanted to attend Chris Granger ’s talk Behind the Mirror : The birth of Light Table .
Chris gave a philosophical preamble before showing off the current version of Light Table .
He demonstrated adding support for Git in a short amount of code , and went on to demonstrate a mode for developing games .
He said that they are planning to release version 1 sometime in May , and that Light Table will be open source .
I also learned that Kickstarter money is counted as revenue , so they have lost a significant amount of the donations to taxes , which is part of the reason that Kodawa participated in Y Combinator , and is trying to raise some money to get a bigger team .
Not long after the Light Table kickstarter , this video by Bret Victor made the rounds .
It went really well with all the buzz about Light Table , and Alex Miller , the organizer of Strange Loop , went out and persuaded Bret to come and talk .
Bret ’s title was Taking off the Blindfold , and I found this to be a very well motivated talk .
In the talk , Bret talked about the kinds of proerties that our programming tools should have .
The talk was vey philosophical despite the appearance of a number of toy demos of environment features .
During both of these talks there was a lot of chatter .
Some was harking back to the Smalltalk ( but sadly , not the Lisp Machine ) environments , while some questioned the value of a more visual style of tools ( those emacs and vi graybeards ) .
When I first got into computers I read book called “ Interactive Programming Environments ” and ever since i’ve always been wishing for better tools .
I am glad to see some experimentation come back into this space .
Some old friends are busy making hay in the Node.js and Javascript communities , and it probably horrifies theme that I have ClojureScript as a theme , but so be it .
I went to two ClojureScript talks .
One was David Nolen ’s ClojureScript : Better Semantics at Low Prices ! , which was really state of the union of ClojureScript .
The second was Kevin Lynagh ’s Building visual data driven UI ’s with ClojureScript .
Visualization is becoming more and more important and ClojureScript ’s C2 library look really appealing .
It ’s fitting that the last them should be Javascript .
Well , maybe .
I went to two Javascript talks , and both of them were keynotes , so I did n’t actually choose them .
But Javascript is so important these days that it really is a theme .
In fact , it ’s so much of a theme , that I ’ve been going to Javascript conferences for the last 2 years .
It ’s been several years since I saw Lars Bak speak .
His talk on Pushing the Limits of Web Browsers was in two parts .
Or so I think .
I arrived just as he was finishing the first part which seemed like an account of the major things that the V8 team has learned during their amazing journey of speeding up Javascript .
The second part of his talk was about Dart .
I did n’t know that Bak was the lead of the Dart project , but that does n’t change how I feel about Dart .
I see the language , I understand the rationale , and I just ca n’t get excited about it .
I ’ve been to enough of those Javascript only talks to hear Brendan Eich talk about The State of Javascript .
Brendan opened by giving a brief history of how Javascript got to be the way it is , and then launched into a list of the improvement coming in EcmaScript 6 ( ES6 ) .
That was all well and good , and towards the end , after the ES6 stuff , he threw in some items that were new , like the sweet .js hygienic macro project , and the lljs typed JavaScript project .
It seemed like this was a good update for this audience , who seemed unaware of all the goings on over in JavaScript land .
From a PLT point of view , I guess that ’s understandable , but at the same time , JavaScript is too important to ignore .
Final Thoughts
Strange Loop has grown to over 1000 people , much larger than when I attended in 2010 ( I had to miss 2011 ) .
I think that Alex Miller is doing a great job of running the conference , and of finding interesting and timely speakers .
This was definitely the best conference that I attended this year , and probably the last 2 - 3 years as well .

THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A WAR ON CONSCIOUSNESS
By Carol Moore
I believe that a prime motivation of those waging the current " war on drugs " is to discredit and destroy any " counterculture " before it becomes the dominant culture .
Religious fundamentalists have not forgotten the religious upheavals of the 1960s when millions of young people , often after using marijuana and other psychedelics , reading Timothy Leary or Alan Watts , or listening to " psychedelic " music by the Beatles or the Jefferson Airplane , rejected Christianity and Judaism .
Even ministers , priests , nuns and rabbis abandoned their callings !
Consciousness , altered consciousness , and higher consciousness rather than obedience , duty , and sacrifice became the prime concern of the new spirituality .
The response of Catholic , conservative and fundamentalist religious groups was to feverishly expand their efforts to enforce more fundamentalist views among their members and to gain greater political influence .
While fundamentalists have lost many battles over abortion , prayer and pornography , they have found the government a willing ally in the " war on drugs " .
For just as drugs , the counterculture and " consciousness " undermine faith in hierarchical religious authority , so do they undermine faith in political authority .
John Lennon 's " IMAGINE " , an anthem of the counter culture , asks us to imagine " no religion " and " no countries " .
Lennon , a drug use advocate , was murdered by a fundamentalist Christian , a former fan , who knew how subversive and powerful this message is .
In 1990 , on Lennon 's 50th birthday radio stations worldwide played " IMAGINE " simultaneously to a billion people .
All heard Yoko Ono say , " The dream we dream alone is just a dream , but the dream we dream together is reality . "
The message is that we are not subjects of an authoritarian god or even natural law , but that we consciously co-create reality .
Implied is the possibility of a diversity of realities .
Despite the crackdown on drug use , the belief that consciousness is not only the purpose , but perhaps even the very nature , of reality has spread through writings and practices of " new physics " aficionados , humanistic psychologists , and the new age , eastern religion , wiccan , and eco-spirituality movements .
Their millions of advocates still lack a coherent and motivating philosophical synthesis or organizational focus .
And while many of these individuals have used drugs , and still do , decriminalization of drugs is not yet a major focus of their thought or action .
However , as the horrors of the drug war mount and the injustices spread to all of us , the uneasy feeling that there is some hidden agenda behind the " war on drugs " grows among more aware and conscious individuals .
Some of these agendas are scapegoating drug users for larger ills , excuses for racial repression and expanding government power , an outlet for militarism , and the desire of tobacco and liquor producers to squash potential competition .
However , a prime hidden agenda remains the suppression of an alternate religious view -- that consciousness is the nature and purpose of reality , that humans freely create their realities .
Because psychoactive drugs are a means of quickly and effectively initiating individuals into this view they must be suppressed -- even if it means punishment , incarceration and death for hundreds of thousands of people .
But such is the nature of all religious wars .
Excerpts from INTOXICATION THE " FOURTH DRIVE " by Dr. Ronald K. Siegel .
Article in the September / October 1990 HUMANIST magazine .
( Later made into a book . )
History shows that we have always used drugs .
In every age , in every part of this planet , people have pursued intoxication with plant drugs , alcohol , and other mind - altering substances ... Almost every species of animal has engaged in the natural pursuit of intoxicants .
This behavior has so much force and persistence that it functions like a drive , just like our drives of hunger , thirst and sex .
This " fourth drive " is a natural part of biology , creating the irrepressible demand for drugs .
In a sense , the war on drugs is a war against ourselves , a denial of our very nature ...
Legalization is a risky proposal that would cut the drug crime connection and reduce many social ills , yet it would invite more use and abuse ... Making some dangerous drugs illegal while keeping others ( like alcohol and cigarettes ) legal is not the solution .
Out - lawing drugs in order to solve drug problems is much like outlawing sex in order to win the war against AIDS .
In order to solve the drug problem , we must recognize that intoxicants are medicines , treatments for the human condition .
Then we must make them as safe and risk - free and , yes , as healthy as possible .
Dream with me for a moment .
What would be wrong if we had perfectly safe drugs ?
It mean drugs that delivered the same effects as our most popular ones but never caused dependency , disease , dysfunction , or death ?...
Such intoxicants are available right now that are far safer than the ones we currently use ... We must begin by recognizing that there is a legitimate place in our society for intoxication .
Excerpts from THE NATURAL MIND - An Investigation of Drugs and the Higher Consciousness by Dr. Andrew Weil , 1985 .
Human beings are born with a drive to experiment with ways of changing consciousness ...
The desire to alter consciousness periodically is an innate , normal drive analogous to hunger or the sexual drive ...
The root of the drug problem is the failure of our culture to provide for a basic human need .
Once we recognize the importance and value of other states of consciousness , we can begin to teach people , particularly the young , how to satisfy their needs without drugs .
The chief advantage of drugs is that they are quick and effective , producing desired results without requiring effort .
Their chief disadvantage is that they fail us over time ; used regularly and frequently , they do not maintain the experiences sought and , instead , limit our options and freedom ...
Altered states of consciousness ... appear to be the ways to more effective and fuller use of the nervous system , to development of creative and intellectual faculties , and to attainment of certain kinds of thought that have been deemed exalted by all who have experienced them ... ( They ) may even be a key factor in the present evolution of the human nervous system ... To try to thwart ( their ) expression in individuals and society might be psychologically crippling for people and evolutionarily suicidal for the species .
Excerpt from book FOOD OF THE GODS by Terence McKenna , 1992 .
The suppression of the natural human fascination with altered states of consciousness and the present perilous situation of all life on earth are intimately and causally connected .
When we suppress access to shamanic ecstasy , we close off the refreshing waters of emotion that flow from having a deeply bonded , almost symbiotic relationship to the earth .
As a consequence , the maladaptive social styles that encourage overpopulation , resource mismanagement , and environmental toxification develop and maintain themselves .

— A child support lawsuit for back child support against a Wayne County man who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit has been dropped .
Dwayne Dail said the suit , filed in November by his former girlfriend Lorraine Michaels for back child support while he was in prison , was dismissed Friday .
But he said he could not comment on the deal but was happy the matter was resolved .
" I am very happy and relieved to have this black cloud removed from me and my son 's bonding process , " Dail said .
" And I hope that there can begin some healing between me and Lori , too .
This has been extremely difficult for everyone involved . "
Michaels sued for a " reasonable sum " of a $ 360,000 compensatory payment Dail is due from the state for his wrongful imprisonment .
Earlier this month , a judge ruled Michaels should receive only a portion , if any , of the payment
Dail spent 18 years in prison for the rape of a 12 - year - old girl .
He was exonerated by DNA evidence in August .
He is expected to receive that by the end of January and said said he plans to use it to buy a house for him and his son and enroll them both in college .
Dail said he wants to pursue a career in criminal justice to help other innocent people in prison .
" I want to have that feeling of having helped someone who is desperately in need of help , " he said .

Plans for a robot that can crawl like a spider are ' well developed '
It may have seemed like just another improbable scene from a Hollywood sci- fi flick – Tom Cruise battling against an army of robotic spiders intent on hunting him down .
But the storyline from Minority Report may not be quite as far fetched as it sounds .
British defence giant BAE Systems is creating a series of tiny electronic spiders , insects and snakes that could become the eyes and ears of soldiers on the battlefield , helping to save thousands of lives .
Prototypes could be on the front line by the end of the year , scuttling into potential danger areas such as booby - trapped buildings or enemy hideouts to relay images back to troops safely positioned nearby .
Soldiers will carry the robots into combat and use a small tracked vehicle to transport them closer to their targets .
Then they would swarm into the building and relay images back to the soldiers ' hand - held or wrist - mounted computers , warning them of any threats inside .
BAE Systems has just signed a £ 19 million contract to develop the robots for the US Army .
Researchers hope they will eventually create machines that can fly like a butterfly
Plans for a creature that can crawl like a spider are said to be well developed , and researchers eventually hope to be able to create creatures that can slither like a snake or fly like a dragonfly .
While some of the creatures will be fitted with small cameras , others will be equipped with sensors that will be able to detect the presence of chemical , biological or radioactive weapons .
A computer - generated video from BAE Systems shows the tiny invaders being released by a soldier , before scouting out a suspect building , which is finally blown up by ground forces .
BAE Systems scientists from the UK and America plan an army of the electronic bugs , and have ambitions to equip every front - line soldier with them .
Programme manager Steve Scalera was inspired by the way creatures use their senses to detect danger .
Scroll down for more ...
Promotional video shows a ' bug ' being sent into a danger zone in a special vehicle
" What we are doing is providing an enhanced awareness for soldiers , basically an extension to their eyes and ears , " he said .
" The creatures have external sensors .
They can be tossed out into a building or a cave or even a pile of rubble and then send images back to the troops .
Scroll down for more ...
Pictures from the bug are beamed back to the operator , allowing the target to be blown up
" The idea is to get a number of these working together – some tiny , some maybe up to a foot in length , and all going into a building together carrying out different tasks .
Eventually we hope to have animals flying and slithering .
" The five - year programme has just started but we could have them with soldiers within six months , and then continue to develop the concept as the project goes along . "
Despite the high - tech gadgetry involved , BAE Systems insists once production is in full swing , each bug will cost no more than £ 100 to produce .
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment .
If you have grown up in a Christian home that believes in the Holy Bible , then most certainly , you have limited yourself to chaperoned dating until the age of 21 .
If you are truly saved , it is not until your 21st birthday , that the thought of dating someone without adult supervision would even enter your mind .
These tips are for Christian men , age 21 or older .
If you are truly saved , you are looking for a woman who will serve you and who loves the Lord as much as you do .
You are looking for a woman who has kept herself pure for her future husband and for the Lord Jesus Christ .
You are looking for a woman who knows how to cook and sew , a woman who can keep house .
You are looking for a woman who will not squander your income or lean toward gossip .
You are looking for a woman who will submit and obey , for there is no other way for a marriage to honor God without following the strict Biblical principles that God has laid out for us in the Bible .
If you have found such a creature and she is not bobbed of hair , nor wont for excess in make - up or lewd attire , then you must prepare yourself for a first date .
Here are a few tips to get you prepared for your first date .
GODLY SECRETS TO DATING SUCCESS
1. COMB YOUR HAIR
Head lice are very common among Christian men , especially Pentecostals .
Although it is a normal and natural blessing from God to have head lice , you should certainly wash your hair before your date if only for the reason to avoid the temptation of putting your arm around the young lady while lifting to scratch your head .
2 . PRAY
Spend the day before your date with at least 6 - hours of solitary prayer in a prayer - closet or a confined area .
Ask the Lord to guide your words and actions .
Ask Jesus to help you control your lust and pray that you will have a nightly emission before the date , thus making it easier for your carnal mind to operate on a level that is strictly spiritual .
Do not masturbate in your prayer - closet unless you are thinking about Jesus .
Click here for more detailed spiritual guidance on masturbation .
3 . PURCHASE A RING
Visit a jewelry store and purchase a diamond ring .
For the Christian man , every date is a potential mate .
If she is the right gal , you will want to pop the question as soon as possible .
It is always handy to have the engagement ring available .
4 . RECITE VERSES
When you are on the date , use awkward moments of silence to quote scripture , or sing a favorite hymn .
All women are impressed with such things .
If she is not woo'd by this , it is a sign that she might be possessed by a demon .
Take her to your church and drop her off by the back gate with a note to the pastor taped to her forehead .
Be sure to secure her to a tree or post using chains or rope so that she wo n't get away during the night .
5 . SPRUCE UP !
Wear Christian cologne .
The only Christian cologne available is " Betty Bowers ' The Essence Of Christian Men . "
If you do not have any Christian cologne , rub your face in a Bible until you smell like the pages .
6 . TAKE HER TO VISIT GOD
The best place for a first date is church .
Oh , how impressed your sweetheart will be when she finds out you are taking her to Sunday evening services !
Then , a romantic dinner at Denny's !
7 . GRILL HER FAITH
Use the time at the restaurant to find out if your sweetheart is really saved .
Question her salvation at least 15 times .
Make sure she knows the exact day and hour ( and preferably the exact minute ) she met Jesus .
8 . SQUELCH YOUR PASSION
If you have not had a nightly emission before your date , make certain that you take extra precaution .
Use an ace bandage or knitting yarn to tie your penis back against your stomach or underneath your hiney .
If you tuck instead of tie , make sure that the tip of your penis does not curl back far enough to enter the hole in your hiney where you go poopy out of - otherwise you might accidentally sodomize yourself and inadvertently become a homosexual .
9 . PRACTICE YOUR LINES
Some Christian phrases that will help you " woo " the lesser sex are , " I 'm almost as crazy about you as I am about Jesus , " " Your long hair is the glory of your humility ( I Corinthians 11 : 11 - 15 ) , " and " God broke the mold when he made your sweet face . "
10 . KEEP THE PASSION SUPPRESSED
If the bandage work on your penis fails in the slightest bit , excuse yourself for the men's room and re-adjust the harnessing .
11 . AVOID TOUCHING !
Make certain that there is no personal contact ( PC ) on this first date .
Even if she has said " yes " to marriage , it is highly recommended that you refrain from even holding hands for at least two years until the courtship is over and you are whisked away on your honeymoon !
Follow these dating tips for Christian men and you are sure to find a life partner that is suitable , submissive , and steadfast .

Yesterday , I told you that Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) is challenging AMD ( NYSE : AMD ) with a new product line .
As backward as it might sound , the underdog has been a technology leader for some time .
Today , the tables are turned sideways , because AMD is doing the same thing to NVIDIA ( NASDAQ : NVDA ) .
It 's a different market this time -- graphics processors rather than the x86 chips that form the core of most computers .
In that field , NVIDIA has been the clear leader for eons ( in the terms of this fast - moving market segment , anyway ) , whether you looked at pure performance , bang for your buck , or power efficiency .
But today 's new product release from AMD changes at least two of those equations , according to early reviews .
The ATI Radeon HD 4870 X2 is many things : a mouthful to say , a product of AMD 's troubled ATI acquisition , and a return to the dual - chip action that ATI first got into with the very , very angry Rage Fury Maxx eight years ago .
Hey , if the main processor race has moved to the number of cores you can fit on one chip , then why not slap more graphics chips on one card ?
This card is available today , and is the absolute fastest option available for most any game you 'd care to play .
Gaming freaks who want the best see the $ 549 price tag as an acceptable deal , and a scaled - down version with two mid-range 4850 processors will be available in a couple of weeks to take the price - to - performance crown in the intermediate segment .
On top of that , Activision Blizzard ( NASDAQ : ATVI ) just signed a deal to bundle " Blizzard 's best games , " like World of Warcraft and the upcoming Diablo III , with ATI / AMD video cards .
So the top - performance and bang - for - the - buck prizes go to AMD again .
As for power efficiency , you could use a system with two 4870 X2 cards as a space heater ( 750 watts of total system power under load ) or practically boil water on the heat sinks ( higher than 192 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
But two out of three ain't bad , and the word of mouth should imbue lower - end cards with a nice halo effect -- and that 's where most of the sales happen .
This flurry of high - quality releases could be the vitamin shot that AMD needs in order to prove that the ATI deal was worth the $ 5.4 billion purchase price .
The graphics - and - everything - else Fusion processor , due in 2009 , and its refreshed platform should reinforce that point .
It 's been a long time coming , but the payoff is on its way .
Further Foolishness :
あんま深く考えず valgrind を
Ruby の head のテストに適用してみたところ、結構もにょもにょ漏れてるもんだなぁと気付いたので、いくつか修正してみたりしたのですが、その時案外困るのが、リークする最小のコードが簡単に作れない、ってことでした。 valgrind は
C 言語的にどこで malloc を呼んだかは教えてくれるものの 、
Ruby コードでどこだったかは教えてくれないからです。修正はできたけど具体的にどこで漏れてるかはよくわからん、ということさえありました。
というわけで、 Ruby 的にどこで漏れたかを教えてくれる valgrind 用の tool 、 Rubygrind を作ってみました 。

TODO : 良い子のための valgrind tool 書き方講座、というか valgrind の基礎 。
“ Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition ! ”
With that Cardinal Ximinez spun on his well - shined heel and pulled the heavy , copper strapped cell door closed .
Laughter echoed in the tunnel as the meager light drifted away with the torch smoke .
I did n’t set out to commit heresy , I suppose noone really does .
Sprawled on a bug infested pallet , locked in a cell deep beneath the Abbey , remnants from my former life draped in ragged tatters from my bruised limbs , I wondered if my simple act of heresy was worth the heavy price I am doomed to pay .
I hold scant hope for my redemption , but you gentle reader , you have a chance to learn from my descent into dissent .
Back in April …
… after resolving the last couple of issues with transparent persistence , I turned towards the scalability and performance of Seaside and GLASS .
For focus I set a hypothetical goal of 100,000 requests / second – if you ’re going to aim for something you might as well aim high .
Since GLASS performs one commit per HTTP request I started out by tuning GemStone / S for maximum commit performance .
Before long I realized that I was barking up the wrong tree – if our commercial customers can do say 5,000 commits / second , then I ’d need to come up with a 20 x performance boost for commit processing to reach 100,000 requests ( commits ) / second – an admirable goal but not very realistic – we ’ve spent 20 years tuning commit performance .
For a 20 x performance improvement , I ’d just have to pack more bang into each commit or somehow avoid state changes altogether .
I ’d already explored the ‘ more bang per commit ’ option way back when I first ported Seaside to GemStone , so I knew that there was n’t going to be much gained by that route .
With regards to avoiding commits , the theory is that avoiding commits for 95 % of the pages could result in a 20 x gain in performance .
The more commits avoided the bigger the multiplier .
Now we ’re talking !
In May , I started exploring the reuse of session state .
By the end of July , I had a proof of concept demonstrating the reuse of 99 % of the session state , but I was n’t real happy with the extent of changes I had to make to Seaside .
Nor could I eliminate the decoration chain update used with # call : / #answer : the primary navigation scheme for Seaside .
We are n’t going to avoid commits on 95 % of the pages without being able to navigate statelessly .
I need a navigation scheme that does n’t require Seaside session state .
Last week ( end of July ) James Foster and I tossed around some ideas for doing navigation in Seaside without using # call : / #answer : and without using Seaside session state .
After playing around with a couple of approaches I settled on the following style of URL , which I ’ll call a navigation URL – it ’s sorta RESTful , but not too RESTful , it is bookmarkable and it was pretty easy write a component to render pages ( the most important – Ha , Ha ) :
http://example.com/sushi?_n&pg=Home
http://example.com/sushi?_n&pg=Sale
http://example.com/sushi?_n&pg=Catalog
http://example.com/sushi?_n&pg=CartPage
http://example.com/sushi?_n&pg=Item&id=26
I wrote an example Seaside application ( Sushi - Example ) using the navigation URLs .
It is available on GemSource in the GemStone Examples project .
As of this writing Sushi - Example - dkh.25 is the version that should be used .
The Sushi-Example package can be loaded into either GLASS or Squeak Seaside .
There is no styling in the example so do n’t expect anything pretty .
I encourage you to take a look at the example and give us feedback .
Last Sunday morning I was lying in bed mulling over the problem when it occured to me that if I dropped the ‘ _k ’ off a navigation URL and figured out how to render the page , I would n’t need to save a continuation for each page hit and most importantly I ’d avoid a commit for each of those pages as well !
After a little more thought , I figured it would be possible to avoid saving sesssions making it possible to drop the ‘ _s ’ , too .
By Monday afternoon , I had a prototype running .
I spent Tuesday doing some benchmarks to see if there were noticeable improvements in performance .
I knew that by avoiding commits I would greatly improve the scalability of Seaside , but I was also hoping to see some performance gains , too .
I have to admit that advocating the use of navigation URLs and proposing the ‘ _k ’ and ‘ _s ’ be optional URL parameters makes me feel like a Seaside heretic …
( JARRING CHORD .
The door flies open .
In come three evil types in red robes . )
Cardinal Ximinez : NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition !
Our chief weapon is surprise … surprise and fear … fear and surprise … .
Our two weapons are fear and surprise … and ruthless efficiency … .
Our three weapons are fear , surprise , and ruthless efficiency … and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope … .
Our four … no … Amongst our weapons …
Amongst our weaponry … are such elements as fear , surprise …
I ’ll come in again .
… but here goes , the rack be damned .
I have glossed over a couple of details in the following section , so you ’ll want to look at the code for the real skinny : )
In a normal Seaside application URLs are generated for links that look something like this : http://example.com/sushi?_s=68pqfS&_k=SW7A&_n.
To decode this URL Seaside uses the ‘ _s=68 pqfS ‘ to lookup a session , the ‘ _k=SW7A ‘ to look up a continuation in the session and the rootComponent associated with the continuation is rendered .
The ‘ _n ’ indicates to Seaside that no redirect is needed for the rendering pass .
Consider a navigation URL that looks like this : http://example.com/sushi?pg=Item&id=26.
To decode the navigation URL , Seaside creates a default session ( no ‘ _s ’ present ) and renders the rootComponent associated with a default rendering continuation ( no ‘ _k ’ present ) .
The rootComponent uses the ‘ pg=Item&id= 26 ′ to lookup and render the appropriate item .
When a navigation URL is used to reach a page , Seaside creates and saves a new instance of the session class .
If a customer is window shopping ( i.e. , navigating around the site without logging in or adding an item to a cart ) , the session state is uninteresting and does n’t really need to be saved .
If a request URL has no ‘ _s ’ and no state is changed while processing the URL , the ‘ _s ’ could be dropped from generated navigation URLs with no loss of information .
There ’d be a definite advantage for web sites with lots of window shoppers as only the interesting sessions would be saved .
If a customer logs in or adds an item to a cart , then the session becomes interesting and it makes sense to propogate the ‘ _s ’ to all generated navigation URLs .
Such an URL looks like this : http://example.com/sushi?pg=Item&id=26&_s=68pqfS&_n.
To decode this URL , I would expect Seaside to use the ‘ _s=68 pqfS ‘ to lookup a session and render the ‘ pg=Item&id= 26 ′ item .
The ‘ pg=Item&id=26 ′ is retained in the URL to make it possible to lookup and render the target page .
Essentially the ‘ pg=Item&id=26 ′ replaces the ‘ _k ’ , which ends up serving two useful purposes :
In a window shopping scenario , the customer will continue to navigate around the site .
The interesting session state is encoded in the ‘ _s ’ and without a ‘ _k ’ there is no need to create and save session state for each page rendered .
scenario , the customer will continue to navigate around the site .
The interesting session state is encoded in the ‘ _s ’ and without a ‘ _k ’ there is no need to create and save session state for page rendered .
such a navigation URL is natively bookmarkable .
If the session expires before the bookmarked URL is used , it still contains enough information to allow a valid navigation to the bookmarked page .
With navigation URLs , a ‘ _k ’ is needed only when a # callback : or #call : is associated with a rendered anchor or form .
( Torchlit dungeon .
We hear clanging footsteps .
Shadows on the grille .
The bootsteps stop and keys jangle .
The great door creaks open and Ximinez walks in and looks round approvingly .
Fang and Biggles enter behind pushing in the dear old lady .
They chain her to the wall . )
Ximinez : Ha !
Now , old woman !
You are accused of heresy on three counts .
Heresy by thought , heresy by word , heresy by deed , and heresy by action .
… Four counts .
Do you confess ?
Old Lady : I do n’t understand what I ’m accused of .
Ximinez : Ha !
Then we shall MAKE you understand !
Biggles !
Fetch … … THE CUSHIONS !
In the Sushi Example , you can use either the standard WASession or the SushiSession .
When you use WASession , you ’ll get ‘ _s ’ and ‘ _k ’ parameters generated for every link ( along with the associated session state ) , while using the SushiSession , the ‘ _s ’ and ‘ _k ’ parameters are only included in the URL when needed .
Since I wanted to measure the effect of the accumulation of session state ( or lack thereof ) , I decided to run the tests for 20 minutes ( double the default sessionExpory ) .
With a 20 minute test we ’ll generate a full complement of session state and presumably settle into a steady state as aged sessions expire .
For all of the tests ( except Run5 ) , I used the following siege invocation :
siege - b -d 0 -c 10 -t 20 M http://example.com/seaside/examples/sushi
The arguments tell siege to hit the URL as hard as possible simulating 10 concurrent users for 20 minutes .
For more on siege , see my post Scaling Seaside with GemStone /S .
For Run5 , I had to increase the -c argument in order consume both CPUs on the box .
Run5 was made with 300 concurrent sessions .
The Benchmark Results
The following table summarizes the results :
Run Req / Sec Core Gem VM Machine Session Class
1 11 1 1 S laptop WASession
2 14 1 3 G Foos WASession
3 67 1 1 S laptop SushiSession 4 129 1 3 G Foos SushiSession 5 335 2 3 G Foos SushiSession
Run1 ( Squeak ) and Run2 ( GemStone ) are baseline runs and if you look at the results from my benchmarks last fall , you ’ll see that the figures are comparable ( previous Squeak results and previous GemStone results ) .
Things get interesting when you look at Run3 ( Squeak ) .
Not saving session state results in a 6 x improvement in performance .
Since both runs ( Run1 and Run3 ) were made against the same Sushi-Example the difference in performance can be attributed to the reduced load on the memory management system .
While I did n’t measure the size of the VM , I am sure that it is a lot smaller in Run3 .
For GemStone Run4 the improvement is even more dramatic – a 9 x improvement .
For GemStone /S , the improvement is due to the fact that without saving session state , no commit processing overhead is incurred .
I should note that on the machine Foos , no effort was made to use raw tranlogs ( see Scaling Seaside with GemStone / S and GemStone 101 : Transactions for info about raw tranlogs and performance ) so the improvement is more dramatic than you ’d see on a system that was tuned for commit performance .
For Run5 ( GemStone ) I added an adidtional CPU allowing the stone and 3 gems to utilize both CPUs available on the machine .
This time the improvement was 2.5x .
You ’d expect a 2x , so the extra margin of performance is probably due to the fact that the there was very little context switching going on with 2 CPUs .
Conclusions
The quest for 100,000 pages / second does n’t look quite as quixotic now as it looked a week ago .
I think that using navigation URLs with Seaside is a valid technique especially if you are interested in a highly scalable Seaside application .
If you are using the Web Edition of GLASS , using navigation URLs will definitely make it possible to sustain rates in excess of 15 pages / second , since you will be able to avoid saving uninteresing session state in the repository .
For low traffic sites , I think navigation URLs hold promise for making it possible to get the most bang for your resource buck .
The prototype for making the ‘ _k ’ and ‘ _s ’ optional parameters is less than a week old and I know that there are some weak spots in the implementation , but I ’m sure that they can be resolved :
I do n’t like how navigationOnly is used in SushiSession .
I ’m sure that navigationOnly can be eliminated , but it might be necessary to change the logic for generating Form html , since I added navigationOnly so that Forms would work correctly .
I would like to be able to create Forms where an URL could be used as an alternative to using a # callback : .
I know I risk be boiled in oil for this , but I would have liked to include a search field on nearly every page , but that would have required a #callback : .
After spending bits and pieces of 3 months working part time towards the reuse of session state , it is pleasing to see how little code it took to make the ‘ _k ’ and ‘ _s ’ parameters optional .
As Google 's government - approved spycar fleet drives across the UK , doing its best to photograph every inch of the country , the search giant cum global menace has told the world that " even in today 's desert , complete privacy does not exist . "
Back in April , we told you the tale of Mr. and Mrs. Boring , a Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania couple that sued Google in federal court after pan-and - zoomable pics of their swimming pool turned up on Google Street View .
The Borings claim that a Google spycar appeared on their private road without proper authorization .
Insisting this private road is tagged with a " Private Road , No Trespassing " sign , they call Google 's behavior " an intentional and / or grossly reckless invasion of ... seclusion . "
Well , Google has now filed a motion to dismiss the complaint , and in defending Street View , it cites the Restatement of Torts , a legal guideline from the American Law Institute : " Complete privacy does not exist in this world except in a desert , and anyone who is not a hermit must expect and endure the ordinary incidents of the community life of which he is a part , " the Restatement says .
Then Google goes a step further : " Today 's satellite - image technology means that even in today 's desert , complete privacy does not exist . "
In any event , the Borings live far from the desert , Google says , and it has every right to photograph their home .
" Although they live on a privately maintained road , the road is shared by several neighbors and there is nothing around their home intended to prevent the occasional entry by a stranger onto their driveway , " the motion continues .
" There is no gate , no ' keep out ' sign , nor watch guard standing watch . "
Er , the Borings do claim a " Private Road , No Trespassing " sign .
But Google dismisses this too .
" Plaintiff 's allegation of a ' private road ' sign at the top of their street standing alone is insufficient to negate Google 's privileged and trivial entry upon Plaintiff 's property . "
The search giant also returns to the satellite argument .
" There is no fence surrounding the property , nor is it located where the yard that can not be seen by satellite or low - flying aircraft . "
So , if Google can put an aerial photo of your swimming pool on Google Earth , it can put a closeup on Google Street View . ®
I have n't been blogging much this summer .
Mostly it 's because all my free time has been spent engaged in an important research project called " What Would Niko Bellic Do ? "
I 've been enrolled in a high - quality Management Scenario Simulator with the unconventional name " Grand Theft Auto IV " , probably some sort of inside joke , and I 've been going through all its Developer Management training courses .
You know how these corporate training videos go , right ?
They set up some contrived scenario with actors you 're supposed to identify with , and the actors have inane discussions about sexual harrassment or bribing government officials or stealing company equipment , and then you 're asked to answer questions about whether it was OK for Bob to grab Sue 's ass in that particular edge - case scenario .
Seriously , I just took one of these courses at work .
You'd think they 're a joke , but no , they 're considered Important Employee Training .
Well , this Niko Bellic course is n't much different , just more fun .
I finished the final management training session a couple weeks ago .
And by truly amazing coincidence , right after I finished the final training mission , my blog made it into the Top 100 Blogs for Development Managers ( Q3 2008 ) I personally thought that was a little weird , seeing as I 've never written explicitly about software development management .
Unless of course you count that one time where I wrote about how you do n't need them .
BUT , now that I 've finished all the Niko Bellic Advanced Management Training courses , I 'm officially a Certified Expert Dev Manager , capable of not only handling unforseen tricky management situations , but also teaching others about them !
So now I think my blog being in that list is totally justified .
All the training in the simulator was top - notch .
A lot of it was ground I 'd covered before in my days as an actual dev manager .
I already knew how to react , for example , when my mafia boss told me he'd been betrayed by my previous manager , and I had to take him out .
I 'd already gone through stuff like that at Amazon dozens of times , so I breezed through those missions .
But even though a lot of the training was pretty obvious stuff , which you come to expect from these corporate training courses , I was pretty impressed by the final Management Training Mission , in which I had to make an Important Management Decision about an employee in my care .
I 'm sure many of you have also completed this course .
In the missions leading up to the finale mission , the " Grand Theft Auto " training software gradually unfolds a background story in which you and this other employee used to work together but had a disagreement that never fully reached closure .
You have some trouble arranging a meeting with the employee to discuss it .
But as luck would have it , after doing some especially fine work for one of your internal customers , they manage to convince the employee to meet with you , by gagging and handcuffing him and stuffing him on a plane in St. Petersburg and dropping him off at the docks in Liberty City .
I had to admit , the simulator really nailed the value of building strong relationships with internal customers .
You can imagine how hard it is to write an online corporate training seminar — I mean , you have to get all this material across but keep it entertaining so people actually remember the lessons .
The fine folks at the consulting firm " Rockstar " have done an admirable job of presenting the content .
They cover all of the HR - sensitive topics an aspiring manager needs to know about : conflicts of interest , employee drug abuse , bribery , sexual harassment , stealing company property , I mean the list goes on and on .
It 's amazingly thorough .
These guys clearly have real - world software industry experience .
And they managed to make it fun !
They did this by using certain metaphorical devices , purely for dramatic effect .
For instance , in the final mission , you 're given a choice : you can either let the employee walk away , allowing bygones to be bygones , or you can execute him by shooting him in the head as he begs for his life .
This playful enactment is obviously a metaphor for deciding whether to take the " next step " in dealing with a problem employee : whether or not to put him on a Performance Improvement Plan , or if that 's already failed , whether or not to terminate employment .
By generalizing it to a back - alley execution scenario , they 've given you a way to apply the lesson across many similar situations .
It 's actually quite brilliant , and I 'm sure other firms offering management training courses will take note .
As you know , in many management situations there 's no " right answer " : it 's a personal decision , and different managers will make different choices .
Hence , the final mission , unlike all the other missions , has no " success " outcome : you just pick a course of action and you have to live with it , just like in real life .
Regardless of whether you choose to forgive him for displaying a moment of weakness , showing that you understand he 's human like the rest of us , or you pop a cap in his motherfucking partner - betraying ass , you goddamn mother fucker * blam * * blam * * blam * * blam * * BLAM * * click * * click * * click * , the other actors will empathize with you and feel your pain , since no tough decision comes without a few regrets .
As it happens , the simulation software is remarkably open - ended .
When I did the mission , I decided to let the employee walk , but then I accidentally ran him over with an 18 - wheeler as I was driving out of the parking lot , killing him instantly .
Oopsie !
I confess I may not have been paying strict attention to some of the simulator 's more obscure traffic rules by the end of the training sessions .
Fortunately they were n't grading me on little driving slip - ups .
The game chose to interpret my accidental crushing of the employee beneath the wheels of my semi as intentional termination .
I like to think of it as modeling the " passive - aggressive " approach , in which you do n't fire the employee personally ; you have someone else do it , such as HR , or perhaps your boss .
Some managers prefer the passive - aggressive approach .
To illustrate why it 's popular , I 'll use an analogy from the restaurant industry .
Have you ever noticed that at restaurants , your waiter does n't bring your food ?
Other waiters always bring out your food , during which time your waiter is nowhere to be seen .
This is so that if you become infuriated because you specifically ordered tartar sauce on the side , and after a 45 - minute wait the chef seems to have emptied the entire bottle of tartar sauce on your fish sandwich in some sort of twisted artistico - culinary attempt to make it look like he threw up on it , then you do n't blame your waiter .
Instead , you unwittingly direct your anger at the person who brought your food , who makes sympathetic noises ( " Gosh , I 'm so sorry - I can't believe they messed that up ! " ) and runs away , never to be seen again .
After it 's eventually resolved ( by still other people bringing replacements out ) , your waiter finally rematerializes and apologizes for the kitchen screwup .
Studies have shown that this yields higher tipping on average .
That 's why your waiter does n't bring your food .
Now you know .
The passive - aggressive employee - discipline approach is a bit unusual , but some managers feel it 's better to have the employee mad at " the company " , since then the manager will then get better manager reviews from the employee .
I 'll write more about this technique in my upcoming " How to Be an Evil Manager " handbook .
Should be quite popular !
Maybe it'll even bump me up the Top 100 list .
Now that I 've finished those training courses , I have all these half - written blogs I need to finish up .
Tons of cool stuff to talk about .
Unfortunately they 're all stalled in various stages because I spent the summer playing video games and doing a lot of bike rides .
Sometimes you 've just gotta do that , you know .
GTA IV was a really good game , so after I finished it ( which required some time before I got tired of experimenting with 5 - and 6 - star warrant levels ) , I started looking around for an equally good game .
GTA IV was basically the best game I 'd played since Oblivion , which was two years ago .
I do n't play games that often ( just a few each year ) , so I figured there must be something good out there .
I looked and looked , and by golly , the best game out there was still Oblivion .
Not only that , but in the intervening 2 years it 's sprouted all sorts of mods and expansions like the " Knights of the Nine " and the " Shivering Isles " .
Neat .
So after lots of searching ( and not finding ) a good follow - up to GTA IV , I stumbled on a used copy of the Game of the Year edition .
Since nothing else out there today looked anywhere near as good , I started playing Oblivion again .
Remember how a few months ago I finally turned off my last Windows box ?
( I switched 100 % to using Mac clients and Linux servers : at home , at work , and on the road . )
Well , technically to restart Oblivion where I left off , I was going to have to turn my XBox 360 back on , which felt like cheating .
But the used Game of the Year edition I found was for the PS / 3.
Decisions , decisions ... Actually it was n't much of a decision at all .
I 'm on a low - Microsoft Diet , meaning I avoid Windows whenever I possibly can .
Given that I 'd gone for 3 or 4 months or so without interacting with a single Windows installation , I really did n't want to turn on my XBox .
Plus it 's summer and I do n't need a space heater yet .
So I went for it .
Even though my previous character had finished the main quest and was waiting for her imperial dragon armor , I decided to start from scratch and play the whole thing over again on the PS / 3 , but this time continue on to the expansions after finishing the main quest .
I tell ya : if Oblivion had come out today rather than 2 + years ago , it would still win the Game of the Year .
It 's just the best game , period .
To be honest , I kind of miss Morrowind ( the previous game in the series ) .
I find myself missing it even when I 'm playing Oblivion .
I think it may have actually had more personality than Oblivion .
But I 'm into the Shivering Isles expansion now , and it's way better than Oblivion on personality ; I 'm enjoying it even more than the main game .
I still find it weird that they do n't re-make classic games .
Do n't you ?
I mean , they re-make classic movies , so why not games ?
Sure , we 've got game franchises like Zelda and Mario and Donkey Kong — Nintendo is awesome at building character brands .
But even Nintendo does n't re-make great old games ; they just carry forward characters and ideas and themes .
But that just makes me miss the old games !
For instance , Zelda 64 : Ocarina of Time — my God , that was a fantastic game .
One of the best ever .
Ditto for Final Fantasy X . You could argue that was the best game ever , and I would n't try to pop a cap in your motherffffffffffff — sorry , sorry , management training getting the better of me .
Let 's just say I would n't try to argue with you .
It was a uniquely great game .
But both of those games , great as they were , could stand a make - over : updated graphics , updated game physics and mechanics , updated for newer platforms , etc .
They'd be playable and ( presumably ? ) popular today , and it would surely be a lot easier than trying to design a new game from scratch , so studios could release these remakes in " dry spells " between flagship game releases for extra revenue .
It seems like it'd be better than releasing crap games that they know suck .
Which is most of them .
I do n't know .
Maybe people just prefer new games , and that 's that .
Maybe I 'm different .
But nearly 40 years as a gamer has convinced me that truly great games only come along every few years , and the rest are all just filler .
I 'd rather go back and re-play a favorite game , and get that rush of nostalgia , than fill the void by playing crap .
Ultima IV — now there was a game .
Once or twice a decade a truly extraordinary , groundbreaking game comes along , and I remember when Ultima IV was that game .
I would love to play it again , except this time without having to swap the City Disk with the Wilderness Disk and listen to my Commodore 64 crunch away for minutes on end .
One of the really key elements to the overall atmosphere of a game is the music , and most great games were great — in large part , I think — due to their music .
Zelda 64 , Final Fantasy X , Kingdom Hearts , Ultima IV , they all had great music .
Sometimes the composer was limited by the sound system - in Ultima IV 's case , very limited .
But I have all of Ultima IV 's music on my iPhone , converted from MIDI files .
Dead serious .
I love those tunes .
They remind me of the old Quest for the Avatar days , back in the Navy when my 3 roommates and I manned the console 24 hours a day in shifts , trying to find mandrake root .
Someone please make an updated Ultima IV !
I want IV back , dammit .
The sequels never even came close .
Not likely , though .
Maybe in a generation or two .
It 's usually at least a few decades before they remake a classic movie , so maybe I 'm just not waiting long enough .
If they remake a classic game , I think it 's really important to have the same music .
This is where remakes ( if you can call 'em that — they 're usually either sequels or unrelated new games with similar elements ) tend to screw things up .
The music should be updated by a competent composer , but it should be the original themes .
The Mario franchise does a pretty good job of this , actually .
Zelda , not so much .
I have n't heard the " Gerudo Valley " theme in any Zelda game since Z64 , which came out ten years ago , and along with the title theme it's one of the two best Zelda themes ever .
Remember Metroid ?
It had really cool music all around .
I did n't play any of the Metroid franchise after that , until last year when I played Metroid : Prime on the Wii .
The music sucked !
Actually the game kinda sucked too .
The controls were phenomenal , and made me want to play all games like that , but the game was boring .
Sigh .
It 's also kind of important that remakes Not Suck .
I guess franchise sequels are n't really remakes , though , so apparently it 's OK if they suck .
That seems to be the standard .
There are exceptions .
Mario Galaxy 's music was Top 5 of all time .
But if you can't afford that Japanese guy , it 's OK to reuse old music !
I 'm serious !
I give you my explicit permission !
Anyway , I 'll probably keep playing Oblivion until New Castle Wolfenstein comes out .
I just do n't see anything else all that compelling on the horizon .
Just counting the weeks until Bethesday 's next Elder Scrolls release , I guess .
Morrowind to Oblivion was a 5 - year wait , so I 'm gonna have to find something to do for the next 3 years .
Excuses aside , I should really blog more often .
I was pretty amazed at how much email my last entry received .
To be perfectly on the up - and - up , I have n't read the comments .
I 'm sorry , but I 've been too busy trying to find a Daedric Katana to enchant .
Priorities first !
But I checked my GMail account on Friday and it was completely swamped with dozens and dozens of new emails , many more than usual .
People seemed to feel it made us buddies , which meant they could email me just to say " hi " , and ask if I wanted to " hook up . "
I do n't know if that 's good or not , but I tried to answer all their mail .
Oh wait , that was Niko 's account in the Corporate Email Training simulator .
My bad .
Anyway , today 's blog entry was just procrastination .
I 'm supposed to be getting some work done , so I 'll get back to it .
Maybe this bandit will have a katana .
Besides the terrible killings inflicted by the fanatics on those who refuse to pledge allegiance to them , Al - Qa'eda has lost credibility for enforcing a series of rules imposing their way of thought on the most mundane aspects of everyday life .
An Abominable Blood - Logged Plain
“ The war in Bosnia will look like a tea party if Serbian nationalism runs wild in Kosovo . ” U.S. Representative Eliot Engel
“ The whole world is a vast Kosovo , an abominable blood - logged plain . ” From Black Lamb and Gray Falcon by Rebecca West , 1941 .
Strange country , Kosovo .
It ’s European , but it is n’t Christian .
It ’s majority - Muslim , but it is not anti-American .
Foreign soldiers are hailed as liberators and protectors rather than occupiers .
Most Western countries recognize the majority - Muslim nation ’s recent declaration of independence from Serbia , but not a single Arab country has done so – partly , perhaps , because Israelis as well as Americans are thought of as allies and friends .
The United Nations is widely perceived as offensive , incompetent , corrupt , and deserving of banishment .
Ethnic Albanians – who make up 90 percent of Kosovo ’s population – suffered apartheid - like conditions and ethnic - cleansing by Serbian Nationalists in the 1990s .
They were history ’s winners , though , in 1999 when NATO finally had enough of Belgrade ’s tyrant Slobodan Milosevic .
He and his Serb allies kicked off four wars in the former Yugoslavia , and the final war in Kosovo threatened to overwhelm and destabilize the rest of Southeastern Europe .
Albanians in both Kosovo and Albania proper are well aware that the United States led the international effort to stop the chronic violence in what remained of Yugoslavia , and they ’re well aware that the United States led the international effort to roll back communism all over the world .
History has been as hard for them in the last half - century as it has been for their Arab co-religionists , but in dramatically different ways , and with dramatically different results .
I spent several weeks among them shortly after their declaration of independence to investigate the world ’s newest country .
The attacks on September 11 , 2001 , and the Terror War that followed pushed Europe ’s troubled Balkan Peninsula almost entirely off the media map .
But Kosovo is a brand - new Muslim - majority nation forged in violence and war with the help of American soldiers .
Most countries still have not recognized its independence .
Like Israel and Taiwan , its very right to exist is on trial .
It deserves more attention than it has been getting .

The capital , Prishtina , is hard to love at first sight .
Never before had I seen a European capital so thoroughly degraded by modern and communist architecture .
Very little of old Prishtina remains .
Prishtina , Kosovo
Old Prishtina , Kosovo
Brutal communist - era monstrosities proliferate across Eastern Europe , but in Prishtina you will find them even in the city center where more aesthetically pleasing traditional buildings should be .
Kosovo's National Library is a spectacular modernist failure .
Rumor has it that a communist apparatchik attended the building 's opening and asked why the scaffolding had n't been taken down yet .
Newer construction is a bit softer on the eyes , as it is almost everywhere in the world , but there is no urban planning and no formal or informal design code .
Houses , apartment buildings , and office towers are often built illegally , without permits , wherever they happen to fit .
New neighborhood , Prishtina , Kosovo
Property taxes on homes do n't kick in until construction is completed , so unfinished houses are literally everywhere .
Prishtina at first glance is a jarring assault on the senses , and a devastating rebuke to both communist and modernist architecture .
It would n't be fair , though , to judge Kosovars on their built environment .
The average person who lives in Prishtina is no more responsible for its botched condition than people who live anywhere else – and that was doubly true when Kosovo was ruled by a communist dictatorship that was foreign in all but name .
The only European country I ’ve seen with as much obvious physical evidence of decades of oppression and misrule is Albania .
The city of Prizren provides an interesting contrast .
Here is a city that still looks more or less like it did before the arrival of communists with their bulldozers , their clipboards , and their blueprints .
Prizren looks , as Prishtina once did , like the Eastern - Western hybrid that it is .
It looks vaguely Turkish , specifically Kosovar , and thoroughly European .
This is a city you 'll want to visit if you go there on holiday .
Hardly any tourists visit Kosovo , even though much of it is charming and the prices are lowest in Europe .
It is off almost everyone 's radar .
Most who think of Kosovo at all still assume it is hostile or dangerous .
It is neither .
Two short years before the ill - fated date of September 11 , 2001 , Kosovo still resembled the “ blood - logged plain ” Rebecca West famously described in Black Lamb and Gray Falcon , her famous pre-World War II travelogue about her journey across Yugoslavia .
Kosovo today reminded me of other countries that were blood - logged until recently .
In 2003 , New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman belatedly discovered Poland .
“ After two years of traveling almost exclusively to Western Europe and the Middle East , ” he wrote , “ Poland feels like a geopolitical spa .
I visited here for just three days and got two years of anti-American bruises massaged out of me . ”
That 's exactly how I felt when I traveled to Iraqi Kurdistan , and that 's exactly how I felt when I arrived in Kosovo .
American flags fly in front of private homes , private businesses , and public buildings .
They are sold at sidewalk kiosks all over the country , along with t- shirts thanking the United States in English .
I saw spray - painted graffiti on a wall in a village that said “ Thanks USA and Bush . ”
President George W. Bush is deeply admired in both Kosovo and Albania , but no U.S. president tops Bill Clinton in the public affection department .
A main street leading into Prishtina ’s downtown was renamed Bill Clinton Boulevard .
An enormous mural of the former president greets visitors on their way into the capital from the airport .
Small businesses are named after him , too .
A small business named after former U.S. President Bill Clinton , Prishtina , Kosovo
Vizier Mustafa is sculpting a statue of Clinton which will soon be erected somewhere on Bill Clinton Boulevard .
“ He is our savior , ” Mustafa told a Reuters reporter .
“ He saved us from extermination . ”

The Hotel Victory sports the world 's second largest replica of the Statue of Liberty on its roof .
A taxi company named Victory put the Statue of Liberty on its doors .
I found another replica on someone 's private property in the small ethnically mixed town of Vitina .
“ We are more pro-American than you are , ” one young Kosovar told me .
“ We really like Americans here , ” a waiter said when he learned where I ’m from .
“ Americans are our best friends in the world .
UK is second . ”
“ Thank you , ” I said .
“ We appreciate that .
Some people do n’t like us . ”
“ Bad people , ” he said .
Restaurants abound with American names : Memphis , Hemingway , Route 66 .
I even found a patisserie and disco bar named Hillary , after Hillary Clinton .
I stood in front of “ Hillary ” and snapped a couple of pictures .
A man rose from an outdoor table and said something to me in Albanian .
“ Do you speak English ? ” I said .
“ I asked you why you are taking pictures of my café , ” he said .
He sounded slightly annoyed and suspicious , but only slightly .
“ I'm American , ” I said .
“ And I like your sign . ”
“ You are from USA ? ” he said .
“ Please come in ! ”
I walked up the stairs and stepped inside .
“ Look , ” he said .
“ This is even better . ”
And he showed me enormous pictures of both Bill and Hillary Clinton on the wall .
“ What is your name ? ” he said .
“ Michael , ” I said .
“ I am Ilir , ” he said .
“ Ilir Durmishi .
It is Christian name . ”
“ Ah , ” I said .
“ So you 're Christian . ”
“ No , ” he said .
“ I am Muslim .
My father just wanted me to have a Christian name . ”
Ilir Durmishi , owner of the “ Hillary ” patisserie and disco bar , Prishtina , Kosovo
He gave me two shots of espresso and a cigarette .
We talked about American politics .
“ Do you think Hillary will win ? ” he said .
This was shortly before she lost the Democratic Party 's primary nomination to Barack Obama .
“ It ’s possible , ” I said , although I doubted she would .
“ I think she will win , ” he said .
“ I like Hillary , but I love Bill .
He is my guy .
You understand why ? ”
“ Of course , ” I said .
And I did .
His country would n’t exist if it were not for Bill Clinton .
“ Kosova good ? ” he said .
“ Kosova good , ” I said .
“ Serbia ? ” he said .
What was I supposed to say ?
I did n't want to say “ Serbia good ” and offend him , nor did I want to condemn an entire country just to appease him .
I split the difference and made a so - so motion with my hand while bracing myself for what he might say .
“ There are good people and bad people in Serbia , ” he said .
I relaxed .
He was reasonable .
“ Maybe the leadership is bad , but some Serbs are good .
I have Serb friends here .
They like to come and have coffee in my cafe . ”
After we chatted for a few more minutes , I fished into my pocket for some money to pay for the coffee .
“ No , ” he said . ”
It is from house .
God bless you . ”
Later I had coffee with a young Albanian man just around the corner from Ilir 's Hillary Clinton cafe .
“ Kosovo is a success because we wanted a change , ” he said .
“ We are not like Iraqis or Palestinians who do n’t want change and seem to enjoy living in poverty .
Here everyone is thinking about progress and the future . ”
The past , though , is always present in Kosovo .
Events leading up to the bitter separation from Serbia are n't discussed all that often , but it 's impossible to think about Kosovo 's independence without recalling the blood - logged events that led to it .

When the future of Yugoslavia looked dim and precarious , Slobodan Milosevic looked for a way to rise in power and keep it .
He found one when he transformed himself from a communist apparatchik to a Serbian Nationalist .
In 1989 he visited the Field of Blackbirds near Kosovo Polje where medieval Serbian ruler Tsar Lazar was defeated by the Turkish Ottoman Empire in 1389 .
The Battle at Kosovo Polje , 1389
“ No one has the right to beat you , ” he said to an enormous crowd of budding Serbian Nationalists .
“ No one will ever beat you again . ”
Milosevic , instead , beat ethnic Albanians – who make up the overwhelming majority of Kosovo 's population – once his power in Belgrade was secured .
Slobodan Milosevic
First he summarily revoked Kosovo 's political autonomy and purged thousands of Albanians from their jobs in Kosovo 's government sector – an enormous sector in a communist system – for no other reason than because they were not Serbs .
He replaced their police with his own .
As Yugoslavia came apart in Bosnia , Slovenia , and Croatia , Albanians formed their own parallel institutions and civil society entirely apart from Milosevic 's oppressive regime .
Ibrahim Rugova , the literary academic and pacifist , became the widely respected leader of this parallel state and presided over a movement committed to non-violent civil resistance .
Ibrahim Rugova , literary academic , pacifist , and Kosovo 's first president .
He is considered by many to be the Father of the Nation .
Milosevic ramped up the oppression , though , and sent tanks into Kosovo .
Massacres and brutality predictably followed .
Rugova ’s steadfast insistence on a pacifist response led to his temporary marginalization and the rise of the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) guerrilla movement .
Thousands were murdered , raped , ethnically - cleansed , tortured , and “ disappeared . ”
Neither side was angelic in this fight .
There are no innocents in the Balkans .
Milosevic , though , had the Yugoslav Army at his disposal , and well - trained and well - armed Serb paramilitary fighters that sometimes called themselves Chetniks .
The KLA had a small number of angry and badly - trained men with meager equipment .
Pictures of the missing are still on display in central Prishtina .
I swallowed hard while remembering scenes just like this one in New York City just after Al Qaeda ’s violent assault on Lower Manhattan .
It is extremely unlikely that any of these people are still alive .
Full - blown war broke out in 1999 between NATO and the largely ineffective KLA on one side , and the remnants of the Yugoslav Army and Serb paramilitaries on the other .
Milosevic ’s forces were eventually driven from Kosovo , NATO and Russian forces moved in on the ground , and the KLA was disbanded .
Rugova was elected the first president of a de-facto independent Kosovo once institutionalized pacifism was a safe and viable option again .
I interviewed entrepreneur Luan Berisha who experienced all this as a civilian .
My friend and traveling companion Sean LaFreniere joined me .
Sean and I visited Serbia , Bosnia , Croatia , Albania , and Montenegro together before he headed home and I settled in for a longer stay in Kosovo .
Before we had a chance to cover the war , Luan Berisha wanted to get a few things out of the way .
“ Listen , ” he said .
“ All Albanians , all Kosovars , they feel more close in all ways to the West that to the Arab world .
Why ?
Because still none of the Arab League countries have recognized Kosovo ’s independence .
The reason why is because Libya and many other countries are linked with Serbia .
Israel would have recognized us by now , but politically they can’t .
If they do , we are automatically doomed for another 59 countries not to recognize us .
I think very highly of Israel .
I like Jewish people a lot . ”
Luan Berisha ( Photo copyright Sean LaFreniere )
I knew before I traveled to Kosovo that Albanians think highly of Jews and of Israel , but I was frankly surprised by how often it came up in conversation .
Albanians differ radically from Arabs in almost every cultural and political respect you can think of , but nothing , I think , separates the two more than this .
“ We have very much in common with Israel , ” he said .
“ In Albania and Kosovo we are in support of Israel .
I would never side with the Muslim side to wipe Israel off the face of the world .
90 % of Kosovo feels this way .
The reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us .
We were Muslims even in the Second World War – stronger Muslims than we are now – but even then we protected them with our lives .
Our grandfathers protected the Jews wherever they were in the region . ”
A large percentage of Kosovars are atheists and agnostics , but Berisha described himself as a Muslim – not as a nominal Muslim by family heritage only , but as a practicing Muslim who prays and visits the mosque .
Yet he took us to one of Prishtina ’s finest restaurants and ordered bottles of red wine for the three of us to share .
He drank more alcohol than Sean and I did .
“ What was the war like in 1999 ? ” I said .
“ We watched it on TV . ”
“ The situation became more dangerous , ” Berisha said , “ because the Serbs became more aggressive .
They used more ruthless methods . ”
They certainly did .
90 percent of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were displaced , or “ cleansed . ”
Almost half were driven out of the country entirely .
These people would never have been able to return to their homes if it were n't for the U.S. and NATO .
That was the point of driving them out in the first place .
Milosevic did to Kosovo what Hamas would do to Israel if Palestinians had the military power to do so .
“ I sent food support and other needed supplies to the population affected by the war . , ” Berisha said “ That means I had the opportunity to visit the areas directly affected .
War zones .
In Prishtina , it was normal .
The lights were on .
Normal in the sense that we had gotten used to being beaten by Serb police and to being offended for the last 10 years .
It was daily common life , it was nothing new .
But in the countryside they were having very bad experiences .
I saw dead bodies on the road . ”
Village , Eastern Kosovo
Hardly anyone in Kosovo rode out the war without incident , including Berisha .
“ I was with my parents , ” he said , “ my whole family .
Fifteen of us were sent to a train station at gunpoint . ”
“ This actually happened to you ? ” I said .
“ In 1999 ? ”
“ Yes , ” he said , “ in 1999 .
We were expelled from Prishtina , central Prishtina .
Old town .
The Serbs came to my house .
For thirteen days I lived in my own home .
It was a close neighborhood , and we had to open walls that separated the houses , so in case the Serbs came we could run through the walls from house to house .
Now , after thirteen days , on the fourteenth day , a Serb neighbor came to my house and he said Luan , call your dad .
I called my dad .
My Serb neighbor said
For your well - being , as your neighbor , I am advising you to take minimal belongings and leave .
Because tomorrow they will come and kill everybody they find here .. ”
Prishtina , Kosovo
It 's worth underscoring the fact that Berisha 's Serb neighbor intervened on his family 's behalf .
Not everyone who gets caught up in violent conflicts like these behaves badly .
Not in the Middle East , and not in the Balkans .
I later met an Albanian man who ran into the burning house of his Serb neighbors and saved the lives of two people , at great risk to his own , during retaliatory attacks by an enraged Albanian mob .
“ Did you see your Serb neighbors again after you saved them ? ” I said .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ What did they say ? ” I said .
“ They said thank you . ”
Sometimes I have a hard time understanding why I ’m drawn to places like Kosovo and Iraq where human beings treat each other with such savagery .
I might not be able to do it if it were n’t for the stories of decency and heroism that I also uncover .
Often I go back to the words of Philip Gourevitch in his book about Rwanda that bears one of the most disturbing titles I have ever read .
We Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families “ Like Leontius , ” he wrote , “ the young Athenian in Plato , I presume that you are reading this because you desire a closer look , and that you , too , are properly disturbed by your curiosity .
Perhaps , in examining this extremity with me , you hope for some understanding , some insight , some flicker of self - knowledge – a moral , or a lesson , or a clue about how to behave in this world . ”
Perhaps it ’s just a conceit on my part – or maybe projection – but I like to believe books like his help prevent societies from becoming future subjects of books with titles like that one .
Maybe , though , that is n’t right .
Berisha himself gave me evidence to the contrary just a few moments later .
“ We had no option , ” he said .
“ We took only the clothes we had on .
My father could only walk a few meters at a time because of his heart problem .
He had had an operation in Belgrade the year before and could not walk .
I had my cousin suffering from drug withdrawal .
It was a mess .
We had to leave .
The whole neighborhood , about 200 of us , we went to the end of our neighborhood , and there were seven Serb soldiers with their rifles cocked .
With just a click they could shoot us .
They took everything of value from us .
Jewelry , money , anything of worth .
Then they said Get the fuck out to the train station .
There were rumors that the Prishtina football stadium was filled with Albanian citizens .
We were scared of that .
We reached the train station .
There were about 15,000 - 20,000 people on the field by the station .
The train was there .
We had seen Schindler ’s List .
Everything comes into your mind , you know ?
Then we got into the train .
Getting on the train was hell .
It was a fight for survival .
We had elderly , we had sick , we had kids .
You do n’t know if your sister is going to be left , if your father is going to make it .
You do n’t know what is going to happen .
“ Anyhow , we got into the train .
At the time , we did not know where the train was going .
A lot of rumors as we got into the train .
I got into the last wagon of the train with my family , and with the rest of the neighbors who had gotten out .
The train started , it stopped .
We got out of the train .
The last wagon , they take everybody out .
They said whoever they take out they are going to kill .
And it was our wagon .
When we got out of the train , my family , our neighbors , normally they would take the young girls and separate , they would take the males and separate , and they would leave the elderly or kill them .
When I stood out , I found Serbian paramilitary forces .
Chetniks .
Not with beards , but Chetniks , with Serbian flags and God knows what , like idiots .
Criminals .
In between them was an Albanian guy talking with the Serbs and telling them who is good and who is bad .
That guy is choosing who they are going to kill .
And they take people out .
“ I was scared they were going to take a member of my family .
My sister .
If they had taken my sister it would have been good to kill her .
But they would n’t kill her , they would rape her , they would ... God knows .
We went out , they took us to another wagon .
They stopped again in another city and , again , the military police entered the train wagon and took people out .
I do n’t even want to tell you what happened to them .
When we reached the border with Macedonia , we got out of the train .
The Serb police and paramilitaries were saying to people do n’t go off the fucking tracks because everything is mined .
Now you have kids , elderly , they were fucked up , they were not hearing it . ”
Albanian children , Prishtina , Kosovo
“ Why Macedonia ? ” Sean said .
“ They did n’t care where , ” Berisha said .
“ They expelled 800,000 Albanians in 3 months .
When we reached no - man ’s - land , there were about 100,000 people living in the open in cold weather .
Pregnant women were delivering .
People were dying .
The refugees were very ill - treated by the Macedonians .
I was there three days .
And now I think it is not human to screw up this bad .
Believe me , at that time , when you watched Schindler ’s List , you sympathize with the Jews .
But without going through that situation yourself , it is impossible .
Now when I watch Schindler ’s List , goose bumps go all over my body .
Before that , it never happened because we had never suffered like the Jewish people , thanks God .
But it was the same process .
Mentally , it destroyed us .
We suffered a lot .
If we had the chance then , we would have killed them .
But after that ...
Are we killing Serbs anymore ?
No , Serbs are living here .
We are not slaughtering anybody .
We are not on a witch hunt anymore . ”
He mentioned Schindler 's List .
He and his family saw the movie before they were loaded onto trains during an ethnic - cleansing campaign in Europe .
What Milosevic did to Albanians was less severe than Hitler 's industrial - scale extermination of human beings at death camps like Auschwitz , but I recall seeing the movie myself and feeling relieved that nothing remotely like that happens in Europe anymore .
It seemed appropriate , at the time , that Steven Spielberg shot the film mostly in black and white .
The dramatized events took place long ago , after all .
Mass ethnic warfare was supposed to be a thing of the past .
At least in Europe .
But it was n’t , and maybe it still is n’t .
“ In one city , ” Berisha continued , “ they took a family and put them in the basement .
The soldiers went and pissed on them .
When they left they threw grenades on them .
It killed them all except for one kid who survived .
This is what I can never explain to myself , and I cannot justify , what human beings can do .
Even beaten , on drugs , you can not do that .
I do n’t know how it is to experience killing children .
For nothing .
Why ?
Because they are Bosnians , because they are Albanians , because they are Serbs .
Because they are bloody Croatians !
As I said , it is difficult to forget about it .
The more you think about it , the more you get different thoughts in your head .
So it is best , right now , we ignore that , and try to move forward , and hopefully , in a better life , we will really forgive one hundred percent .
We forgave them for what they have done in a sense , but not truly from our hearts .
Because they have never accepted it , what they have done .
To this day they say that we are the villains , that we are the monkeys with tails .
Today . ”
He visits Belgrade once in a while .
One night , he said , he went out drinking with Serbs who did n’t know he was Albanian .
He kept his identity secret for hours .
Eventually , he said , a well - known writer dredged up the hoary old notion that Albanians live in trees and have tails .
Berisha could no longer resist , so he told them .
“ Then I stood up from my chair , ” he said , “ and said I am sorry , I can not sit in this chair any longer .
They said Why .
I said There is no hole for my tail !
Then they started laughing .
As much as I was offended by this , I was very happy for them to see that , for fuck 's sake , you guys , you have been burned with propaganda .
You live 400 kilometers away , and you know nothing about us .
You jackholes . ”
I spoke to several Albanians who traveled to Serbia recently , and the worst they encountered was rudeness .
According to Albanians , it 's the same for Serbs who travel to Kosovo .
“ Let Serbs come to Prishtina from Belgrade , ” Berisha said , “ with BG license plates on their cars .
Let them come .
Nothing will happen .
People may not like them , but nothing will happen to them , because 2004 cost us a lot .
It cost Kosovo our earlier independence and recognition by the UN .
We had to wait another 4 years . ”
He is referring to the explosion of violence in 2004 following rumors that Serbs chased Albanian children into the Ibar River where they drowned .
Serb and Albanian gunmen fired shots at each other from their respective sides of the river .
Mobs of enraged Albanians burned Serb churches and houses for three days .
According to U.N. spokeswoman Isabella Karlowitz , 16 churches and 110 houses were destroyed .
Dozens were killed .
Hundreds were wounded .
Kosovo was hardly in a position to declare independence after all that .
“ Was the international community worried you would do something crazy ? ” I said .
“ Mistreat Serbs ? ”
“ Indeed , ” he said .
“ If you ask anyone about 2004 , they will say what a fucking mistake .
It screwed us up . ”
Kosovo has been de-facto independent from Serbia since the war ended , but even now the country is not fully sovereign .
The United Nations administers much of the country , and NATO 's Kosovo Force ( KFOR ) provides most of the security and is the closest thing Kosovo has to a real army .
American military officers believe the war will start up again if KFOR were to withdraw its soldiers .
I did n't meet a single person who believes otherwise .
Serbs think so , Albanians think so , and Americans think so .
It would be naïve and foolhardy to believe soldiers can be withdrawn from a war zone just because the fighting has stopped .
Sometimes that 's possible , but that 's rarely true shortly after an ethnic war .
“ The most important thing is for KFOR to be in Kosovo , ” Berisha said , as did so many others .
“ KFOR is the ultimate thing that has to be here . ”
American soldiers , Vitina , Kosovo
“ What do you think would happen if KFOR left ? ” I said .
“ A big war , ” he said .
“ Definitely . ”
“ With Serbia ? ” Sean said .
“ With Serbia , ” Berisha said .
“ Not just with the Serbs in Kosovo , ” I said , “ but with Belgrade ? ”
“ With all of Serbia , ” he said .
When I briefly visited Bosnia I was told by a long - time resident British consultant that the U.N. and NATO have scaled back their presence dramatically during the past couple of years .
Bosnia is troubled , politically deadlocked , and has an uncertain future , but I did n't get the sense that international soldiers are required to prevent an apocalyptic disintegration .
Kosovo is n't like that .
Not yet .
The war in Bosnia was much more destructive and violent than Kosovo's , but only because NATO intervened seriously in Kosovo after impotently dithering in Bosnia for many years .
Serbian Nationalists always wanted Kosovo more than they wanted “ cleansed ” land in Bosnia .
Kosovo is tranquil today for the most part , but that could change if the perfect storm of bad decisions were made .
It 's hard to imagine Kosovo exploding worse than Bosnia did , but many people who live there or have spent more time there than me think it could happen , at least theoretically , and are determined to ensure it does n't .
Destroyed house , Prishtina , Kosovo
“ If you go to Krusha e Vogel in Kosova , " Berisha said , " you will find most of the households without males .
You find most of the women , if not old , raped .
That means some of them were pregnant .
This ill fate , Bosnia suffered even more .
Many women in Bosnia were left pregnant .
Today , their kids are considered bastards in Bosnia .
They do n’t have a future .
They are ill treated by Serbs , they are ill treated by their parents , they are ill treated by the whole bloody country . ”
“ They are ill treated by the parents ? ” Sean said .
“ Yes , definitely , ” Berisha said , “ even the mother .
I have watched a lot of documentaries about it , they are having horrible problems .
Horrible problems .
I went to Belgrade , and I am still trying to say to myself that not all Serbs are bad .
And I hope I am right .
“ You are right , ” I said .
I met a handful of terrific Serbs in Belgrade – in particular the well - known and respected writers Filip David and Predrag Delibasic – who know very well that Albanians do n't have tails , did not deserve to be ethnically - cleansed , and should not be shackled to Serbia against their will .
“ Because what they have done , ” Berisha said , “ is they have destroyed that woman ’s life , and they have destroyed the new life that comes to be born .
And they have created a mess – in Bosnia , in Croatia , in Kosovo , whatever they have touched .
Bosnians and Croatians , they defended themselves .
Croatians , when they took action to take the Serbs out , they committed atrocities beyond imagination .
But they had to take the bloody Serbs out of the country .
They had to fight .
When you fight for your own house , your own family , believe me , you do n’t see in black and white .
You see only black .
There is no gray or white .
Only black . ”

Should More Employers Subsidize Open Source Development ?
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 29 , 2008
In a post today , Matt Asay considers whether governments could effectively subsidize open source development .
I agree with his point that enterprises may " come to recognize that their failure to replenish open source communities with either cash or code may come to harm the code commons from which they derive increasing amounts of value . "
We 've also had several people say in OStatic interviews , including Sam Ramji--Microsoft 's open source chief -- that open source needs better monetization models .
In our latest interview , with FreeNAS ' founder , he says that " one of the best things for open source would be for our employers to give us time to work on our open source projects . "
Perhaps more employers should go beyond that .
Take a look at the chart below , from this post , showing companies that make the most contributions to the Linux kernel :
You 're probably not surprised to see Red Hat and Novell up top , but some people may be surprised to see IBM , Intel and SGI contributing so much .
The data in the chart comes from a survey done by the Linux Foundation , and includes an explanatory quote :
" Companies like IBM , Intel , SGI , MIPS , Freescale , HP , etc. are all working to ensure that Linux runs well on their hardware .
That , in turn , makes their offerings more attractive to Linux users , resulting in increased sales . "
The point is that whether the motivation is self - serving or not , big companies with deep pockets that have relatively small parts of their businesses in the Linux arena make big contributions to Linux .
Linux is hardly the only example of this phenomenon .
Google is well known for its 80/20 rule , which allows its employees to spend 20 percent of their time on projects not directly related to their work at Google .
This has been a huge part of how Google employees have delivered so many open tools and so much open code .
The rule serves Google , too .
They want you out at the Google Code site and using Google Gears .
While I do n't think we 'll ever see companies everywhere subsidizing employee development of open source tools , many tech and non-tech companies alike could benefit from subsidizing open source development from employees with talent .
If more companies woke up to this idea , we 'd see more purpose - driven , mission - critical open source software shared by firms in the same industries .
That , ultimately , would benefit the companies providing the subsidies .
IOS 11 has been released for almost a month and it managed to become one of the most popular OS update .
Recent reports showed that over 40 % of the Apple users have upgraded to iOS 11 .
However , this does not mean that this version is flawless .
In fact , Apple had to launch two updates already , both for various bugs .
Now it appears that a third update has been released , iOS 11.0.3 .
The past updates were very controversial
Both iOS 11.0.1 and iOS 11.0.2 were supposed to fix some bugs .
Instead , many users complained that those updates managed to drain their battery life even faster .
Worse than that , some even said that their device froze after installing the update .
Therefore , users are probably wondering if iOS 11.0.3 will do the same things .
What does iOS 11.0.3 include ?
According to the Apple description , the new update comes with bug fixes .
iOS 11.0.3 is supposed to fix the “ issue where touch input was unresponsive on some i Phone 6s ” .
Also , it should address the issue “ where audio and haptic feedback would not work on some iPhone 7 and 7 Plus device ” .
Should you upgrade to iOS 11.0.3 ?
Just like the previous versions , it appears that iOS 11.0.3 has its crashes and issues as well .
Therefore , it might not be the best idea to upgrade to this version right now .
However , you should update your iOS if you have experienced one of the bugs that iOS 11.0.3 promises to fix .
If your device works just fine you might want to wait more .
Apple is supposed to release iOS 11.1 in the close future , and that update should be more stable .
Therefore , unless you suffer one of the issues solved by iOS 11.0.2 , you can skip this upgrade .
It 's time to update my view of Ubuntu with my most recent set of feelings .
Well , with why I feel my most recent set of feelings , which is that Ubuntu LTS is significantly inferior to Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
Ubuntu's LTS releases ( Ubuntu 6.06 and Ubuntu 8.04 ) promise five years of support ( hence the ' Long Term Support ' label ) .
This support is why we 're able to consider them , since we need more than 18 months of support that you get with regular Ubuntu releases ; we 're simply not in a position to update our servers that frequently .
( There are two reasons .
First , moving operating systems in a production environment requires a fairly large amount of careful testing ( and a certain amount of dealing with changes ) .
Second , we run login servers and our users do not want to have to do migration work that frequently either ; they have better things to do with their time , like complete their PhDs or do research . )
The problem is that in practice Ubuntu 's ' long term support ' is actually only ' long term security fixes ' .
I have almost never seen Ubuntu fix a problem that was not a security problem , even when the problems are reported in Ubuntu 's bug report system ( and in one case , even when the problem let an ordinary user crash the kernel ) .
The inevitable result is that we have an ever - growing catalog of bugs in 6.06 that will never be fixed .
( I think that Ubuntu does fix bugs under some limited circumstances ; what they really do n't seem to do is fix bugs when the fix would require backporting things into the old 6.06 version of packages . )
By contrast , something like Red Hat Enterprise Linux does provide real long term support , where even non-security bugs will be fixed ( at least for a while ) .
This is not just theoretical , in that I have seen actual RHEL packages released to backport fixes for mere bugs .
( I am also relatively certain that Red Hat would consider ' user can crash the kernel ' to be a security bug . )
Ubuntu , LTS releases included , still has an unmatched selection of packages ( and is what users have heard of , which matters more than you might think ) .
But there is less and less enthusiasm here for running it on ' backend ' machines , machines that users do n't log in to or run programs on , and I can't say that we 're very enthused about it even on the login servers .

NESS CITY , Kansas ( AP ) 
A man whose girlfriend sat on a toilet for so long that the seat adhered to her body will spend six months on probation .
Kory McFarren pleaded no contest last month to a misdemeanor count of mistreatment of a dependent adult .
A judge sentenced him Tuesday to six months in jail but granted the probation after the victim , Pam Babcock , asked for leniency .
" She did n't believe that her circumstances were his fault , " Ness County Attorney Craig Crosswhite said .
Babcock 's plight became known in February when McFarren called the Ness County sheriff , expressing concern about his live - in girlfriend .
When authorities arrived , they found Babcock physically stuck to the toilet .
McFarren told police Babcock had refused to come out of the bathroom for two years .
Medical personnel estimated she had been sitting on the toilet for at least a month and said the seat had adhered to sores on her body .
She is now under the protection of a guardian who was appointed through the legal department at the hospital where she received treatment .
Also Tuesday , McFarren was sentenced to six months in jail for an unrelated charge of lewd and lascivious behavior for exposing himself to a teenage neighbor in March .

While Congress was debating what to do with the Wall Street bailouts this week , they took the time to vote on one other piece of legislation dealing with money .
Amidst the largest financial crisis in our nation ’s history , our senators unanimously passed a bill yesterday supporting an organization that discriminates against atheists and gays .
Yesterday , the Senate approved the “ Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act ” ( S. 3070 ) :
The bill mandates that the U.S. Mint create and sell as many as 350,000 one dollar coins commemorating the Scouts ’ centennial in the year 2010 .
A ten dollar surcharge on each coin goes directly to the Boy Scouts of America , who will net as much as $ 3.5 million in the deal .
The Secular Coalition for America is n’t happy about this :
“ It is outrageous that Congress took time out to fill the coffers of a private and discriminatory group with our tax dollars when they clearly have more pressing issues to deal with , ” said Lori Lipman Brown , director of the Secular Coalition for America .
The legislation , a version of which passed the House in May , was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate , so no individual Senator is on record as supporting or opposing it .
In fact , the House bill ( H.R. 5872 ) passed 403 – 8 .
Who had the courage to vote against the bill ?
Lynn Woolsey [ D – CA ]
Barbara Lee [ D – CA ]
Pete Stark [ D – CA ]
Luis Gutierrez [ D – IL ]
Barney Frank [ D – MA ]
Dennis Kucinich [ D – OH ]
James McDermott [ D – WA ]
Tammy Baldwin [ D – WI ]
Shame on the other members of Congress for supporting a discriminatory organization that so many of us would not be allowed to join .
The open - source database market is continuing its upswing , and shows no signs of slowing down .
A market update by Forrester Research puts the value of the open - source database market at $ 850 million , which includes software licensing , technical support and services .
By 2010 , the authors of the report estimate that figure will jump to $ 1.2 billion as enterprises look to open - source databases to support Web 2.0 applications and other workloads .
Most interestingly , this growth is happening despite the fact that enterprises are generally not in a hurry to rip out proprietary databases and replace them with open - source technology .
Partly , this is due to enterprises being slow to use open - source databases for mission - critical applications .
Recent research by The 451 Group , for example , found that enterprises were generally using open source to avoid paying for additional database licenses from proprietary vendors for new projects in specific application areas , such as development and testing environments .
But there are also other reasons , such as the cost of a migration and the amount of work involved , said Noel Yuhanna , one of the authors of the Forrester report .
" Enterprises would like to rip and replace commercial DBMS [ es ] in favor of open source , but it 's a technology challenge — it 's not straightforward , " the Forrester analyst said .
" Every DBMS has proprietary things such as SQL extensions , integration and APIs , which makes migrating very complex .
Even today , there have been some solutions that can help automate the migration of one DBMS with another , but it's not 100 percent , it 's like 80 to 85 percent , which leaves the remaining work to be done manually . "
Back in April , Zack Urlocker , vice president of products for Sun Microsystems ' Database Group , told eWEEK that the company was more focused on ensuring that MySQL is the No. 1 database for online applications than replacing the traditional client / server database .
" We continue to focus on large - scale Web applications , enterprise 2.0 applications that leverage Web infrastructure , telecommunications and other growth areas , " Urlocker said via e-mail .
Given how rare replacement projects are , it 's not surprising open - source vendors are investing more in targeting new deployments than in improving their migration capabilities , said Matt Aslett , an analyst with The 451 Group .
" Even EnterpriseDB , which offers proprietary Oracle - compatible functionality on top of PostgreSQL , is pitched more at Oracle avoidance projects than Oracle replacement projects , " Aslett said .
One of the most commonly heard knocks on open source is a lack of support .
But when Sun purchased MySQL earlier in 2008 , many observers said they expected enterprises to step up open - source database adoption now that MySQL had such a big backer .
Sun also packages , distributes and supports a version of the PostgreSQL database .
Time will tell however , just how much ground open source will gain in the face of competition from Oracle , Microsoft and IBM , which remain the top three database vendors .
" I do n't see major changes in the market concentration among commercial DBMS vendors , especially among Microsoft and Oracle — and especially on Windows and Unix / Linux , respectively , " said Peter O'Kelly , an analyst with the Burton Group .
" IBM is still a major player as well , but less so on Lintel and Wintel than on IBM mainframes and midrange boxes , where DB2 essentially has a DBMS market monopoly at this point .
MySQL will continue as part of the LAMP [ Linux , Apache , MySQL and PHP / Python / Perl ] stack and will continue to do well for high - end , federated content , and both EnterpriseDB and Ingres will have some market penetration , but the mainstream commercial DBMS is dominated by Oracle , Microsoft and IBM , and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future .

The German - speaking world of Kafka scholars hit out yesterday over a British academic 's claims that the writer had a penchant for hard porn .
James Hawes , a Kafka expert and novelist , claims in his book Excavating Kafka , published in Britain yesterday , that the writer was a subscriber to upmarket pornography .
Furious German academics reacted by accusing Hawes of prudishness , sensationalism and even antisemitism .
" Hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a Kafka with his trousers down ... but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn , is like comparing a poem by Heinrich Heine with an advertising slogan for McDonald's , " wrote Anjana Shrivastava , a Kafka researcher on Spiegel Online , calling Hawes a " prude " .
She said he had made himself a " preacher of hate " in the world of Kafka scholars .
Critics also dismissed Hawes ' claim that Kafka kept his pornography under lock and key in a safe on his bookshelf , saying it contained instead a savings book he did not want his family to know about .
The legendary German Kafka critic Klaus Wagenbach , who has published numerous coffee - table books on the Prague - born writer and made mention of the pornographic images in a book he published in 1958 , told the Frankfurter Allgemeine : " This is some idiot ... who knows nothing about Kafka , but writes about him as if he did . "
Rainer Stach , a Kafka biographer , said the furore surrounding the book was an " unbelievable marketing ploy " .
No one had ever said Kafka was pure and chaste , but the " pornographic " pictures were " playful representations , some styled like caricatures " .
At the focus of Hawes ' investigation are pictures he stumbled across in the British Library in London and the Bodleian in Oxford of the pornography to which Kafka subscribed while in his twenties .
They include images of a hedgehog - style creature performing fellatio , golem - like male creatures grasping women 's breasts with their claw - like hands and a picture of a baby emerging from a sliced - open leg .
But Hawes , an Oxford graduate who teaches creative writing at Oxford Brookes University hit back at his critics , claiming that none of them had read his book and accusing them of operating a " conspiracy of censorship " .
He said he had made no claims to have discovered Kafka 's penchant for pornography and brothel visits , but had explored why Kafka scholars had chosen to virtually ignore the topic .
" We 're talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher .
They have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote , every insurance report he ever compiled , looking for clues .
Yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff , " he told the Guardian .
" I do n't remotely claim it 's a discovery of mine , but I was genuinely shocked when I first saw it , because I had never seen it in any academic biography of Kafka .
The experts ' conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious . "
The angry response to Hawes ' book has extended to accusations of antisemitism .
Shrivastava said Hawes was more interested in " speculating about whether or not Kafka masturbated " than exploring theories that the Jewish writer , who died before the Holocaust , had foreseen it .
Hawes said the antisemitic claims were " outrageous and extraordinary ...
The Holocaust happened after his death , so it 's ridiculous to talk of his works in that light , " he said .
But one German critic at least , welcomed Hawes ' book .
" We are devastated and furious , but at the same time happy , " wrote Ulrich Weinzierl in Die Welt .
" Finally the literary stylite has fallen from his pedestal ... and is as much a sinner as you or I . "
You already know that if you exercise outside on hot and humid days , you should drink plenty of water .
And you are probably well aware of the risk of heat stroke given the countless reports about the warning signs .
But if you ’re going to be out exercising anyway , you may have different questions :
How long does it take to acclimate to the heat and humidity , and what is the best way to do it ?
How much does your performance time slow when it is sweltering and humid , and why ?
Does it help to douse your head with water ?
Should you go out in the morning , when it is cooler but the relative humidity is higher , or at night , when it tends to be hotter but less humid ?
The answers , some exercise physiologists say , are not always what you might expect .
There is no question that heat can take a toll on performance .
Look , for example , at results from races in June 2008 when a heat wave gripped the Northeast .
What if it 's a Wealth Shock ?
By Arnold Kling
For a different and important perspective on the financial crisis , I want to draw your attention to Robert Merton ’s remarks at Thursday ’s Harvard forum , linked to here .
The Nobel Laureate begins with a back - of - the - envelope calculation .
Data suggest that between June of 2007 and June of 2008 , average home prices in the U.S. fell by 16 to 18 percent .
Near the peak of the housing market , total housing wealth was between $ 20 and $ 23 trillion .
Simple multiplication says that we have lost somewhere around $ 3.5 to $ 4 trillion .
As Merton says ,
When you have this wealth loss , nothing that ’s done here will resurrect it .
On top of that , not mentioned by Merton but alluded to by Rogoff , there is the drop in wealth represented by the decline in the dollar .
Marking our assets to world prices , a lower dollar lowers our wealth .
Furthermore , Rogoff and other economists believe that the dollar decline has further to go .
As an aside , for those of you who think that the Fed can solve the problem by “ defending the dollar , ” that is simply wrong .
The Fed can defend the nominal value of the dollar , but not its real value .
The only thing that the Fed can defend is the rate at which dollars exchange for euros .
It cannot defend the rate at which dollars exchange for French wine or Italian shoes .
The view of Rogoff and others is that our trade deficit represents a subsidy to American consumption from foreign savers , and eventually that has to be reversed .
When it does , the cost of foreign goods will rise , regardless of what the Fed does .
We will experience that as a decline in wealth .
So , we have these two big wealth shocks underway–a decline in our purchasing power on world markets and a decline in home values .
This is in addition to the increase in liquidity preference that is what we are calling the “ financial crisis . ”
Now , let ’s turn to the bailout .
If we focus on the liquidity preference shock , the bailout can be viewed as an attempt to counteract the flight to the safety of Treasury bills .
In the alternative narrative of a wealth shock , all of us have suffered a loss of wealth , but the financial sector is feeling it first .
In part , this is because the financial sector is particularly sensitive , because folks in that industry recalculate their net worth daily , if not hourly or by the minute .
In part , this is because they are just smarter than the average American .
Of the $ 3.5 to $ 4.0 trillion in wealth that has been lost , only a small fraction is reflected in losses on mortgage securities .
The rest of the loss has been incurred by home owners .
On top of that , ordinary Americans face the ongoing loss of wealth from the likely rise of foreign goods prices .
But the bailout is a transfer from ordinary Americans to the holders of mortgage securities .
That is like giving rich people priority access to lifeboats on the Titanic .
At some point , ordinary Americans are going to figure that out , and there will be hell to pay .
If we implement the Paulson plan , we will make the wealth shock more painful for ordinary Americans .
The Democrats ’ approach for offsetting that is to try socialism ( government taking equity in financial firms , etc. )
Socialism will destroy even more wealth .
I do not deny that we are experiencing a liquidity preference shock .
But we must reject the bailout as an inefficient and inequitable attempt for addressing it .
The down side of rejecting all variations on the Paulson plan is that the Paulson plan is a “ focal point . ”
If we start from scratch , it will take time to forge a consensus .
But I strongly believe that the risks of delay are less serious than the risks of doing something as awful as what has been proposed .
The Bush Administration has made such a bad opening proposal that it should not serve as a focal point .
My preference would be to keep doing ad hoc crisis management until the next Administration .
Meanwhile , let various experts develop and evaluate alternative proposals .
George Clooney Taking On The Role As The Lone Ranger
George Clooney is reportedly set to star as The Lone Ranger in the upcoming film .
Clooney is now rumored to join Johnny Depp in the big screen adaptation of the long - running 1950s TV show .
A source tells The Sun newspaper :
“ George is very keen – he ’s been trying to do a movie with Johnny for a long time .
“ He thinks they ’ll make the perfect on - screen partnership . ”
Depp ’s involvement , as sidekick Tonto , was recently confirmed by Disney Studios bosses .
The screenplay will be penned by Pirates of the Caribbean writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio .
Reformers
John McCain , via MSNBC :
“ The crisis on Wall Street , my friends , started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence pedaling and he was right square in the middle of it , ” McCain said , painting Obama as a Washington insider .
“ My friends , this is the problem in Washington .
People like Sen . Obama have been too busy gaming the system and have n’t ever done a thing to actually challenge the system .
That ’s not country first , that ’s Obama first . ”
Since I do n’t feel like engaging with McCain ’s Norma Desmond moments just now , I wo n’t say anything about his saying “ that ’s not country first , that ’s Obama first ” , beyond agreeing with Steve Benen : no one who puts Sarah Palin on his ticket has any right to lecture anyone about putting country before ambition .
And Steve and others have already noted the absurdity of McCain , of all people , railing against “ the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling ” .
I do want to make on points about the rest of this , though .
The heart of McCain ’s argument is that he is a reformer who tried to take on the corruption in the mortgage and banking system , while Obama stood on the sidelines doing nothing .
This is not true .
The NYT :
“ [ McCain ’s ] record on the issue , and the views of those he has always cited as his most influential advisers , suggest that he has never departed in any major way from his party ’s embrace of deregulation and relying more on market forces than on the government to exert discipline .
While Mr. McCain has cited the need for additional oversight when it comes to specific situations , like the mortgage problems behind the current shocks on Wall Street , he has consistently characterized himself as fundamentally a deregulator and he has no history prior to the presidential campaign of advocating steps to tighten standards on investment firms . ”
The Washington Post :
“ A decade ago , Sen . John McCain embraced legislation to broadly deregulate the banking and insurance industries , helping to sweep aside a thicket of rules established over decades in favor of a less restricted financial marketplace that proponents said would result in greater economic growth .
Now , as the Bush administration scrambles to prevent the collapse of the American International Group ( AIG ) , the nation ’s largest insurance company , and stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street , the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end “ reckless conduct , corruption and unbridled greed ” on Wall Street .
(…) McCain has not always opposed government regulation .
He supported efforts to allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco .
And he pushed to strengthen the Sarbanes - Oxley Act requirements , which were put in place after the accounting scandals involving Enron and other major firms .
But he has usually reverted to the role of an unabashed deregulator .
In 2007 , he told a group of bloggers on a conference call that he regretted his vote on the Sarbanes - Oxley bill , which has been castigated by many executives as too heavy - handed .
In the 1990s , he backed an unsuccessful effort to create a moratorium on all new government regulation .
And in 1996 , he was one of only five senators to oppose a comprehensive telecommunications act , saying it did not go far enough in deregulating the industry .
As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee for more than a decade , McCain did not have direct oversight of the financial sector .
But he sat at the center of arguments between telephone , cable and satellite companies , almost always pressing for more competition .
“ I ’m always for less regulation , ” he told the Wall Street Journal in March .
He added : “ I ’d like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated . ” ”
In making his case , McCain relies on his 2005 co-sponsorship of S. 190 , which would have improved oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
While I think McCain is wrong to say that “ the lobbyists , politicians , and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ” were “ at the center of the problem ” , McCain was right to try to get stronger oversight in place .
However , that bill died .
According to Mike Oxley , the Republican Congressman who wrote it :
“ Mr Oxley reached out to Barney Frank , then the ranking Democrat on the committee and now its chairman , to secure support on the other side of the aisle .
But after winning bipartisan support in the House , where the bill passed by 331 to 90 votes , the legislation lacked a champion in the Senate and faced hostility from the Bush administration . ”
( Emphasis added . )
There ’s a reason McCain relies so heavily on his co-sponsorship of this bill : it ’s the only bill he has sponsored or co-sponsored during the last two Congresses that has anything to do with mortgage or banking reform .
You can gauge the depth of his concern for this issue by the fact that in 2008 , when a bill establishing tougher oversight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did make it to the floor of the Senate , John McCain did n’t bother to show up for the vote .
( Neither did Barack Obama . )
During those same four years , Obama introduced legislation to prevent mortgage fraud .
He also co-sponsored a number of bills directed at abusive mortgage practices , including one that would , among a lot of other things , have required subprime lenders to document borrowers ’ ability to pay , thereby making “ liar loans ” illegal , and another that called for licensing of mortgage originators .
I ’ve put the full list of bills related to banking and mortgage reform sponsored or co-sponsored by Obama and McCain during the last two Congresses below the fold , so that you can judge the two candidates ’ records for yourselves .

MARK SPENCER | Hartford Courant | August 12 , 2008
The city council staked its ground Monday in the immigration debate , unanimously approving an ordinance that bars police from inquiring about immigration status .
The ordinance , if signed by Mayor Eddie Perez , would prevent police from arresting or detaining anyone solely because immigration authorities had issued an administrative warrant for them , which is a civil matter .
The ordinance also prohibits other city employees from asking anyone seeking services about their immigration status .
Councilman Pedro E. Segarra called the decision “ bold and courageous ” and said he was impressed by the dozens of people in the city who spoke in favor of the proposal at a public hearing last month .
There was no opposition .
Segarra said he did not support illegal immigration , but had to respond to the needs of people living in the city .
He said that opponents who contacted him since the proposal received media attention lived in the suburbs or as far away as Texas .
“ My responsibility as a council person is to the residents of Hartford , ” he said .
“ I ’m not responsible for securing our borders .
I ’m not responsible for issuing visas . ”
Although Perez has said he supports the concept behind the ordinance , it is not clear whether he will sign it .
He has maintained that an order issued by Police Chief Daryl K. Roberts in March that said city police would not make immigration arrests unless there was also a criminal investigation was adequate .
In a letter to the council Monday , Perez expressed concern about “ codifying standards for internal police matters in the city code . ”

Links to funny online videos , pictures and the like pepper our in - boxes like so many temptations of the devil : “ Cat Plays Piano ! ” “ If Celebrities Were Fat ! ” or “ MySpace : The Movie ! ” Sometimes ignored but often indulged , such viral ( person - to - person ) content 
“ Check out this bear asleep on a hammock ! ”  offers a four - minute vacation from work spreadsheets or school term papers .
But for me it ’s serious work , all those videos of wedding bloopers , photos of innuendo - laden billboards and articles about Indiana Jones ’s lesser villains .
As an editor of CollegeHumor.com , which attracts six million visitors a month , I know firsthand just how much work goes into wasting your time .
Well , not your time , exactly .
Typical New York
Times readers are over 45 and own their own homes , which is not really our target demographic .
Now , the kid you ’d like to kick out of the house  a son aged 18 to 24 who , say , rises for Pop - Tarts at the crack of noon , or wails on Guitar Hero III  his is the spare time we ’re after .
Since 1999 , we ’ve posted thousands of videos , pictures and articles to ensnare the wandering eyes of bored young men , and made it easy for them to pass the stuff on .
That ’s not to say we do n’t attract the occasional female user , but traditional male comedy  the Stooge - ian variety ( with fewer restraints now )  translates better online , which , in turn , attracts more male users .
And all those users send us a lot  a lot  of content .
Each day we wade through an ocean of submitted items , selecting only 30 or so to publish .
In an age when Web sites increasingly rely on complicated algorithms to rank content , we pick our stuff by hand .
This very newspaper said of us in 2007 , “ No one can accuse this site of not understanding Web video . ”
So we sure seem to know what we ’re doing , huh ?
To be honest , though , we do n’t .
Nobody in the online content business truly does .
The taste of the Internet user is as idiosyncratic as it is fickle .
What is popular and funny one day could be clichéd and boring the next .
( “ Chuck Norris is so tough ” jokes , anyone ? )
There are certain common traits of viral content that loosely guide our selections  it should be short , easily understood , universal , nostalgic  but for every hit sharing those qualities there are millions of similar failures , not to mention stuff that simply defies explanation .
A 36 - second video on YouTube of a doe- eyed Japanese girl silently staring into the camera before giving the peace sign has a baffling 2.9 million views .
The Internet is a strange place .
And so my co-workers and I find ourselves paid to waste time based partly on our ability to guess what will be popular .
( I say partly because the other half of the job is content creation . )
Is n’t this a fun economy , aside from all the layoffs and foreclosures ?
It ’s true :
Without the benefit of a trusted formula , much of the work of picking content for the site boils down to instinct ( read : guessing ) mixed with analysis and a healthy dose of argument .
To find oneself in a heated debate over what a young Jesus ’s Facebook page would look like is odd .
Odder still is to find yourself getting paid to argue over such things .
Perhaps oddest of all is the degree to which arguments like this are taken very seriously .
But with good reason .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I agree with those such as Glenn Greenwald who are criticizing Obama over this issue .
But my argument against those who have been disillusioned by this is several - fold :
If you thought Obama was not a pragmatist who “ attempts to find a rational common ground on controversial issues ” , then you were n’t paying attention .
Obama is not and has never been an ideologue – he is a mainstream politician .
Obama promised to filibuster one provision which he still opposes , and voted against .
He only changed the extent to which he would support opposition against it .
The rhetoric about the “ shredding of the Constitution ” is over - the - top .
The FISA bill – which Obama saw as flawed but better than the status quo , and which he never said he would oppose – strikes a balance between liberty and security .
You can disagree with the balance – but to paint the issue as black - and - white is to misunderstand the issues in a basic sense .
There are quite a number of issues which many of these same Obama supporters agree with that also would seem to violate core freedoms and the Constitution .
For example , Obama supports gun control despite the right to bear arms ; Obama supports campaign finance legislation despite it ’s burdens on free speech ; Obama supports a national education policy despite the tenth amendment .
All of these require a balance between liberty and the Constitution on one hand and progressive goals on the other .
In a similar way , the FISA debate is the balance between the fourth amendment on one hand and national security on the other .
We can disagree where that line should be drawn – but the rhetoric of both the right and left ignores the FACT that neither side is taking a pure stand .
Both are arguing for a particular balance .
Much of the disillusionment stems from a hope that many people had that Obama would somehow make things right and undo the Bush years .
But Obama is not some messiah – he is a politician , a cautious and pragmatic one .
The hope that I have is not that Obama will fix things himself – but that he will take steps to allow those concerned to engage with power .
Obama will not himself be able to accomplish what a strong movement will – but he will be able to magnify the power of the movement as he takes steps to ensure government accountability .
We are the change we are waiting for .
Obama is just another politician .
But he is an uncommonly good one , an uncommonly thoughtful one , and an unusually astute one .
He is a candidate worth supporting – and one who can achieve some real change with our support .

Over at Rethink , the blog of Accordion City - based development shop Unspace , Pete Forde shares his thoughts on the RubyFringe conference in an articles titled RubyFringe was Profitable , People are Happy , and the Sky Did n’t Fall .
What Now ? ” .
The article covers all kinds of things including :
A loving poke at RailsConf ( “ A 400 person conference does n’t become better with 1600 people , but if you ’ve already done the hard work , why not scale up ? ” ) .
That ’s a reference to RailsConf 2006 and 2007 .
The number of attendees ( something that I ’m going to cover in an article very soon )
Why they might not do another RubyFringe ( think of all the movie sequels you ’ve ever seen )
Women and tech conferences
You can hold a conference without sponsors ( well , Engine Yard helped foot the bill for a party )
Consider going with just a single track
Just as Obie said that you should n’t undercharge for your services , you should n’t undercharge for a conference .
Charge what it costs , and deliver real value
“ Great food is important , because nobody can focus for fifteen hours on cold boxed lunches . ”
And RubyFringe had great food .
Care about the details !
“ This can not be overstated , and the key word here is care . ”
Pete said it in his article , and I feel it bears repeating : Meghann did an amazing job herding cats for RubyFringe , and if you attended RubyFringe and have a little cash to spare , it might be a nice idea to send her some flowers ( or an Amazon gift certificate ) for all the work she put in .
I owe her big - time for thinking of me when she was looking for a host for the Friday night opening events as well as an emergency host when FAILCamp needed one .
Thank you , Meghann !
I salute you with a filet mignon on a flaming sword !
As for Pete thanking me for the RubyFringe guides and notes from the conference : it was my pleasure .
I believed in the event from the get - go and was only too happy to apply the Burning Man ethos to this event ( “ There are no spectators , only participants ” ) .
Besides , that ’s what we in the Accordion City tech community do !
If you ’re thinking about putting together a tech conference , you should steal as many ideas as you can from RubyFringe , and Pete ’s article is a good starting - off point .
" There were several explosions in several places in the county seat of Kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital , " said a woman on duty at the hospital , who would only give her last name , Tian .
The economy is in a recession .
The bugaboo word , “ depression , ” is at last being used by high - level officials , economists , and talking heads on TV .
This is the first time in my lifetime that people of influence have used the word , except in this sentence : “ A depression is no longer possible because of central bank policy and government regulation . ”
Secretary of the Treasury Paulson followed the Keynesian and Chicago School party lines on this issue until September 18 , 2008 .
Then , out of the blue , he announced the need for a $ 700 billion bailout .
The implication was clear : depression is knocking at the door .
Like the Big Bad Wolf in the ancient Disney cartoon , the depression threatened to huff and puff and blow our house in .
Congress is now debating whether or not to pass legislation that will enable Paulson to write checks to American banks and financial institutions to enable them to fulfill the highly leveraged contracts that they voluntarily agreed to .
Well , this is not quite true .
Congress is not debating whether or not to pass the legislation .
It is debating about how many new restrictions will be placed on the capital markets , and how much pork can be squeezed out of the Bush Administration as a quid pro quo .
Obama is pushing for a new Section 8 housing subsidy : letting people who cannot pay their mortgages remain in their homes at taxpayers ’ expense .
This entire charade is really about this issue : contracts .
How much will it cost taxpayers to enable people who made binding legal contracts to now escape their obligations ?
Some of these people are legal fictions : corporations .
Others are real people : families .
They have made contracts with each other , and now they all seek to escape the terms of these contracts , yet also be allowed to get the benefits .
Corporations will stay in business , and homeowners will stay in their homes .
I do n’t think most homeowners who cannot pay will be allowed to stay in their homes .
But large financial corporations who cannot pay will be allowed to stay in business .
THE GREAT DEBATE
I am glad that Congress is debating this issue .
It reminds the public about just how bad the mess is .
But I do not think that Congress will send Bernanke and Paulson packing .
From what I can see from the brief televised snippets of the cross-examination of Bernanke and Paulson , the Senate is ready to capitulate .
But , in an election year , the Senators are going through the motions in order to persuade the voters that the Senate has done due diligence in examining the claims of Paulson and Bernanke .
It is a charade , but what is n’t in Washington ?
Congress insists that all future transactions of the banks be transparent and open and fair and low risk and just good for everyone .
It does this every time there is a crisis to bail out .
Then there is another wave of profits followed by a crisis .
We have had the Federal Reserve System since 1914 .
We have had extensive Federal regulation of the securities markets since 1933 .
The result ?
We now need to bail out the financial system by $ 700 billion , in addition to the $ 85 billion AIG bailout that was announced two days before Paulson made his announcement about the need for $ 700 billion more .
This was two weeks after Paulson , on his own authority , announced that the Federal government would absorb $ 5 trillion worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt .
Yet we are assured , “ this is the last time .
Congress is making sure that this is the last time . ”
It is all a charade .
The voters really do not care .
The voters do not understand the complexity of these issues .
Why should they ?
The bankers and the largest insurance company did not understand the complexity of these issues , and they put their firms in the hole by at least $ 800 billion .
The economists who created the mathematical models that made possible these preposterous , money - losing contracts clearly did not understand the complexity of these issues .
The two Nobel prize - winning economists who created the sophisticated mathematical models that bankrupted Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 did not understand the complexity of these issues .
The reason why bankers do this is that they want short - term profits .
They believe that they are masters of the universe .
They believe that mathematics will save them .
They believe they can use highly sophisticated mathematical models , which all of their competitors use , and still extract billions of dollars of profit from these models , despite the competition .
Why were they able to extract these enormous profits ?
Because they ignored the economic effects of a reduction in the rate of monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve System .
None of them understood the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
So , they loaded up on enormous quantities of highly leveraged debt , and they skimmed off the profits from the front end of the contracts .
Now these contracts have gone the other way .
The entire financial structure is dependent upon the fulfillment of these contracts , but these contracts cannot be fulfilled by the people who wrote them .
So , the people who wrote them went to Secretary of the Treasury Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and moaned and groaned and screamed and begged and pleaded : “ Give us the money we need to fulfill our contracts . ”
That is exactly what Paulson and Bernanke are doing with Congress .
They are acting as the representatives of the profit - seeking , bonehead bankers who loaded up on debt , skimmed off the front - end commissions , and have now gone away , with tens of millions of dollars in their pockets .
Now the taxpayers will be saddled with the obligations to the tune of almost $ 2 trillion .
It is always this way .
This is what Federal regulation means .
Federal regulation creates rules that can be circumvented by any banker , lawyer , and accountant who want to get really creative .
When they get creative , they load up on massive debt , and then they stick the taxpayers with the bill , either indirectly through Federal Reserve inflation or directly through the Treasury .
It has been this way ever since 1933 .
As the regulatory structure has increased its control over the financial markets , the financial markets have found ways of beating the system .
But they all depend on one assumption : the United States government will intervene in a crisis and load up on massive debt in the name of the People in order to bail out financial institutions that say they are going bankrupt .
The entire system depends on the fact that the government will take over the obligations of big - time losers .
This is called “ moral hazard , ” and it has been a well - known phenomenon since the middle of the 19th century .
The phrase is not recent .
It is over 150 years old .
Now the politicians are going to flex their muscles .
They stand in front of the cameras and tell the voters next time it will be different .
Next time , we will impose restrictions on these greedy capitalists .
“ We will make certain that they do n’t get lots of profits . ”
It is all a charade .
Yes , they will pass legislation .
This legislation will create careers for high - paid Wall Street lawyers and well - paid government agency lawyers .
The lawyers will figure out ways to get around the regulations , just as they always have since 1933 .
There is no question that these regulations will hamper the free market economy .
It will transfer oligopoly status to large firms that can afford to hire lawyers that get paid $ 500 an hour to identify loopholes in the regulatory system .
Small businesses will be penalized .
Small businesses are where most of the economic growth originates .
It will become more difficult for small businesses to raise capital .
Congress is insisting that senior managers will no longer be paid high salaries .
Well , most senior managers were not paid high salaries .
They were given stock options .
So , they ran up the value of the stock options by using corporate money to buy shares of stock in the open market .
Instead of developing new , creative ways of serving the consumer , they did what any self - respecting , self - interested official would do .
They saw their opportunities and they took them .
They have now gone away , with tens of millions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars in their various financial accounts .
This is why it is so important the government intervene to bail out the financial system .
If the government did not do this , the former heads of these corporations , who took their money and left , might lose a lot of money .
They do n’t want to lose money .
So , Congress will intervene to make certain that they do n’t lose any money .
Congress will do this in the name of the People .
This is called locking the barn door after the horses have escaped .
The horses left behind a massive pile of droppings .
Congress is going to use taxpayers ’ money to clean out the Augean stables .
Meanwhile , the guys who got rich are gone , and the guys who replaced them will find it more difficult to get rich .
But they will find ways to do this eventually .
Their lawyers will find ways .
Then , once again , Congress will be facing the need to bail out the financial markets .
THE FEDERAL RESERVE
This is inescapable , because the Federal Reserve System has the power to inflate at any time , for any reason .
The Federal Reserve System controls the money supply .
The chairman of the Federal Reserve System always believes that he can outsmart the financial markets .
He believes that he and his staff know what is good for the economy .
So , they regulate short - term interest rates by creating money at varying rates of expansion .
The Federal Reserve System is at the heart of the American economy , and it is a government - protected monopoly .
The people inside the FED do not get rich , but they gain enormous power .
People who possess power like to use power .
This is why they manipulate the American economy .
They get their jollies by directing the economy in ways they think the economy should go .
Recently , the economy went over a cliff .
Anyway , this is what the Secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve System are telling Congress .
Whether it is true or not , no one knows .
The reason no one knows is because the complexity of the system is so great that no one can possibly know .
This is why we have free markets : to distribute risk and to decentralize information .
The problem is , in the field of monetary policy , we do not have a free market .
We have a government - created , government - protected cartel .
From time to time , the cartel of commercial banks loses money , and it goes to the Federal Reserve System and to the United States Treasury to tap into the taxpayers ’ accounts .
Congress debates , and then it capitulates .
The failure of the financial markets is being blamed on free enterprise .
Almost nobody blames it on Alan Greenspan .
Nobody blames it on the Federal Reserve System itself .
Nobody blames the regulatory structure that has created this monster .
No , they blame the free market .
They blame de-regulation under Reagan .
There was de-regulation under Clinton , too .
His Secretary of the Treasury had been CEO at Goldman Sachs , just as Bush ’s is .
No matter .
The critics blame greedy capitalists .
Capitalists are indeed greedy .
They are always greedy .
The question then is this :
Why does their greed lead to financial disasters during one period of time ?
The answer is monetary policy .
This is the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
But hardly anybody believes it , because if they did believe it , they would have to abolish the Federal Reserve System and the entire regulatory structure of the Federal Government over the financial markets .
They would have to revert to a system in which contracts are in force .
Nobody wants to live in that system who is in a position to milk the existing system by violating contracts .
We are going to see the banks come back again for another round of bailouts .
The recession is going to intensify .
There will be more bankruptcies .
There will be more unexpected crises .
The Treasury will come back again , hat in hand , begging for more money , and insisting that the worst is over , that this time it will be different .
The worst is not over , and next time will be no different .
The voters never figure it out .
The regulatory system and central banking system are deliberately complex , which keeps the voters from figuring it all out .
The problem , above all , is the Federal Reserve System .
Yet this institution is considered sacrosanct .
Congress is listening to Bernanke as though Bernanke and his predecessor were not the primary cause of the disaster which Congress is now expected to bail out with taxpayers ’ money .
Paulson assured us that the financial system had no major problem .
He insisted that it was safe and sound .
Yet , somehow , in just one weekend , the system bordered on collapse , according to Paulson .
Paulson and Bernanke were clueless , yet Congress is listening to them , praising them as great leaders , and vowing that this will never happen again .
Paulson and Bernanke say they want more regulatory power .
Surprise , surprise .
Everybody in Washington wants more regulatory power .
This time , the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department will get what they want .
Why will they get it ?
Because they have jointly overseen the collapse of the financial structure .
Anybody who oversees a collapse of the financial structure , who then goes before Congress saying capitalism has failed , is going to be granted more regulatory power .
REDUCED GROWTH
The free market will be less free as a result of the shenanigans of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department .
The voters will capitulate because the politicians insist there is no other alternative .
The politicians will insist this because they have been told that this is the case by the boneheads who created the crisis .
And so it goes .
It will not be different .
Economic growth will be slower because money will flow into Treasury debt rather than businesses .
The recession will last longer because of this intervention .
The bad investments will stay on the books .
Huge liabilities will remain .
The projects that should not have been begun will be completed .
They will lose money .
When the government intervenes to set the terms of exchange rather than enforce contracts , economic growth is reduced .
Responsibility is transferred to regulators , who then go to the politicians and insist on more taxpayer money to bail out the system and more regulatory power .
The politicians comply .
There is no organized opposition to this expansion of power .
Even free market economists come around .
“ One last time ! ” “ This time , it ’s necessary . ”
Why ?
Because on one issue , they are agreed : the need for a government - licensed central bank .
They all believe that the free market is not capable of developing a monetary system based on consumer choice and the enforcement of contracts .
Well , not quite all .
The Austrian School does n’t .
But this is a fringe group in the profession .
Nobody pays attention to it .
CONCLUSION
We are witnessing the re-regulation of American capital .
There was a brief loosening of the strings attached , but investment banks ( R.I.P. ) and financial institutions misused the system , knowing that Uncle Sugar would bail them out .
A few did not get out in time .
Bear Stearns did n’t .
Merrill Lynch did n’t .
Lehman Brothers Holdings did n’t .
But Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley got the government to allow them to switch from investment banks ( less regulation ) to commercial banks ( regulation and bailout money ) on Friday , September 19 .
This let them survive .
We have moved away from somewhat freer markets .
In the process , critics of capitalism have been handed a great weapon : “ See what the free market did .
We must save capitalism from itself . ”
It is the same old refrain .
It goes back to Franklin Roosevelt ’s first term .
The noose will tighten .

A nation that endorses torture deserves to receive no better than they give .
That is the law of return and it is one that I firmly believe in .
We as citizens of this nation must make it clear that we do not accept the use of torture by our government .
If it means that we are more vulnerable to terrorist or criminals I submit that torture is a form of terrorism itself and if we stand by and say nothing about it we defacto endorse it as well .
That is one of the reasons for this article .
It was prompted by the recent taser torture of a critically injured child by police officers in Ozark Missouri .
I am sure you have all read this but it will help frame my article .

Tasers a form of torture , says UN
Australia Daily Telegraph
Sunday November 25 , 2007
TASER electronic stun guns are a form of torture that can kill , a UN committee has declared after several recent deaths in North America .
“ The use of these weapons causes acute pain , constituting a form of torture , '' the UN's Committee against Torture said .
“ In certain cases , they can even cause death , as has been shown by reliable studies and recent real - life events , '' the committee of 10 experts said .
Three men , all in their early 20s , were reported to have died in the United States this week , days after a Polish man died at Vancouver airport after being Tasered by Canadian police .
The man , Robert Dziekanski , 40 , fell to the ground and died after the police officers piled on top of him .
There have been three deaths in Canada after the use of Tasers over the past five weeks .
The company that makes the weapons has said that similar deaths have been shown by “ medical science and forensic analysis ' ' to be “ attributable to other factors and not the low - energy electrical discharge of the Taser ” .
The UN committee made its comments in recommendations to Portugal , which has bought the newest Taser X26 stun gun for use by police .
Portugal “ should consider giving up the use of the Taser X26 , '' as its use can have a grave physical and mental impact on those targeted , which violates the UN's Convention against Torture , the experts said .

{ Author 's Note : “ Perhaps it is time that the USA should consider giving up the use of the Taser as well . ” }
There are many good sites out there that are tracking these abusive incidents of police cruelty and torture .
Their victims are not all criminals that somehow deserve to be tortured as many believe .
Many are like this 16 year old boy that did nothing to deserve to suffer this outragous abuse of authority .

We need to bring public shame and attention to bear on these offenders of human dignity .
They should suffer the most harsh light of critical awareness the public can bring to bear on them .
I am so disgusted with this situation .
If we do not start to act to stamp out this cruelty it could be any of our children or friends next .
This abuse must stop .
People of conscious need to stand up and act not sit like docile dogs waiting to be kicked by their cruel masters .
Enough is enough .
Tasers are torture plain and simple when they are used in this manner .
Comply or Fry .
This is not a situation I can sit by any longer and say nothing about it .

Notes from a great article from 2005 by Jenny Brown Tasers : police torture weapons
In March , Orange County police used a taser electrical shock gun on an 18 year old Orlando man who was tied to a hospital bed .
The reason given was that the man refused to give a urine sample .
According to an exhaustively documented November 30 , 2004 report by Amnesty International on taser use in the U.S. and Canada , electro - shock weapons are now used by police departments to enforce compliance with police orders , to retaliate against handcuffed suspects who are talking back or refusing to follow police instructions , and as punishment in prisons .
Amnesty has also identified over 70 deaths associated with tasers , and called for a complete suspension of their use until objective studies of their effects have been done .
Amnesty 's full report is available
A lawsuit filed on behalf of a Washington woman shows how quickly tasers have become the weapons of choice for any situation .
An officer with the Washougal , Washington police department went to the house of Russian immigrant Olga Rybak with a dog citation because her dog had allegedly bitten another officer the day before .
Amnesty reports on the lawsuit :
Rybak , who spoke little English , at first refused to sign [ the citation ] , asking for a translator .
While attempting to arrest her , the officer shocked her at least 12 times in 91 seconds in front of her two young sons – first using the weapon as a stun gun , then stepping back to insert a cartridge and twice firing darts at Rybak who was writhing around on the front porch .
When the boys ( aged 11 and 12 ) tried to help their mother , the officer reportedly threatened to taser them as well .
Rybak 's attorney has informed Amnesty International that the boys have been receiving psychiatric treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the incident .
The officer was the Taser Training officer for the department .

Police officers who train with tasers and their taser torture victims may be brain damaged according to a recent study .
Here is the article .
Stun guns may cause brain injury
New research finds that stun guns — also known as Tasers and used by two - thirds of the nation 's law enforcement agencies — may impair people 's cognitive functioning .
In a study of 62 police officers , researchers at Rosalind Franklin University of Medical Science in Chicago and the University of Illinois found that police officers who had been “ tased ” during training drills fared worse than a control group in attention , processing speed and memory .
The results , though preliminary , suggest that law enforcement agencies should reconsider their use of Tasers in training exercises and that researchers need to further investigate the potential long - term effects , says study co-author Neil Pliskin , PhD , a University of Illinois psychology professor .
“ It 's a provocative finding because the kinds of difficulties that were observed … are the same kinds of changes we see in people who have suffered electrical shocks from accidents involving domestic power sources , ” Pliskin says .

IN THE early years of this decade , when banks did quaint things like making money , the mantra on Wall Street was : “ Be more like Goldman Sachs ” .
Bank bosses peered enviously at the profits and risk - taking prowess of the venerable investment bank .
No longer .
“ Be less like Goldman Sachs ” is the imperative today .
Of the five independent investment banks open for business at the start of the year , only Goldman and Morgan Stanley remain .
Doubts about the sustainability of the model are rife .
In earnings conference calls on September 16th , the chief financial officers of both firms had to bat away analysts ' questions about their ability to survive on their own .
Spreads on their credit - default swaps , which protect against the risk of default , soared as investors digested the implications of Lehman Brothers ' demise ( see chart ) .
Universal banks , which marry investment banking and deposit - taking , are in the ascendant .
Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch found shelter in the arms of two big universal banks , JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America .
Barclays , a British universal bank , is picking at the carrion of Lehman Brothers .
The mood at Citigroup , seen until now as one of the biggest losers from the crisis , is suddenly bullish : insiders talk up the stability of its earnings and the advantages of deposit funding .
Regulatory antipathy to universal banks has also eased .
Although the 1933 Glass - Steagall act , which separated investment banks and commercial banks , was repealed in 1999 , the universal model is still viewed with suspicion in America .
Among measures announced on September 14th , the Federal Reserve temporarily suspended rules restricting the amount of money that banks can lend to their investment - banking affiliates .
Many are sceptical that this rule makes much practical difference .
Even if the investment - banking arms of universal banks nominally have to raise money separately , their parents ' ratings still make their funding cheaper .
By the same token , if they get into trouble , the effects ripple through the entire balance - sheet .
Even so the suspension , and the dramatic reshaping of Wall Street , represents the final repeal of Glass - Steagall .
Can Goldman and Morgan Stanley survive as independents ?
In normal times , the question would seem ludicrous .
Both banks had profitable third quarters , with Morgan Stanley beating expectations comfortably .
Rivals ' disappearance should allow them to grab new business and has already helped to increase pricing power : Morgan Stanley hauled in record revenues in its prime - brokerage business .
Both have reduced their most troubling exposures ; both can call on decent amounts of capital and strong pools of liquidity .
And both can marshal strong arguments that they are better managed than their erstwhile peers .
The problem , of course , is that these are not normal times .
Although the firms condemn the rumour - mongering , stories that Morgan Stanley was looking for a partner continued to swirl .
As The Economist went to press , Wachovia , an American bank , and Citic of China were among the names in the frame .
Three doubts hang over the independent model .
The first concerns the risk of insolvency .
Investment banks have higher leverage than other banks ( in America at least ) , which worsens the impact of falling asset values .
They do not have the safety - valve of banking books , where souring assets can escape the rigours of mark - to - market accounting .
And they lack the stable earnings streams of commercial and retail banking .
In other words , they have less room for error .
Goldman 's reputation for risk management is excellent , Morgan Stanley 's a bit patchier .
But asking investors to take valuations and hedging processes on trust is getting harder by the day .
The second , related doubt concerns their funding profile .
As a group , the pure - play investment banks have relied heavily on short - term funding , particularly repo transactions in which counterparties take collateral as security against the cash they lend .
Both survivors say they are nowhere near as exposed to the risk of a sudden dearth of liquidity as Bear Stearns was .
They could also argue that retail deposits can be as flighty as the wholesale markets : just ask Northern Rock and IndyMac , both of which suffered rapid withdrawals .
Even so , a further shift towards longer - term unsecured financing will be the price of survival for Morgan Stanley in particular .
That would increase costs , which in turn raises the third doubt , profitability .
As well as dearer funding and lower leverage , the investment banks face the prospect of weakened demand for their services .
As and when the market for structured finance revives , it will be smaller and less rewarding than before .
Demand for many services will not go away , but in a world of scarcer credit , universal banks will be tempted to use their lending capacity to win juicier investment - banking business from companies .
“ Do n't give me the bone , ” says one European bank boss .
“ Leave some meat on it . ”
By these lights , universal banks appear to offer clear advantages to both shareholders and regulators .
Yet some of those advantages are illusory .
For regulators , larger , diversified institutions may be more stable than investment banks but they pose an even greater systemic risk .
“ The universal bank is the regulatory equivalent of the super - senior mortgage - backed bond , ” says one analyst .
“ The risks may look lower but they do not go away . ”
And deposit funding is cheaper than wholesale funding in part because those deposits are insured .
Measures to protect customers may end up allowing banks to take on risks that endanger customers .
For shareholders , too , the universal bank may offer false comfort .
A model that looks appealing in part because assets are not valued at market prices ought to ring alarm bells .
Sprawling conglomerates are just as hard to manage as turbo - charged investment banks .
And shareholders at UBS and Citi will derive little comfort from the notion that the model has been proven because their institutions are still standing .
If the independent investment banks survive , they will clearly need to change .
But they are not the only ones .
A recent Manchester University study on gold farming pegs it as a $ 500 million global market , where some 400,000 workers -- 80 percent of which are based in China -- earn an average of $ 145 per month .
Speaking with the BBC News , Manchester University 's Richard Heeks compared the gold farming industry 's size to India 's outsourcing industry .
" The Indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400,000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900,000 , " he said .
" Nonetheless , the two are still comparable in employment size , yet not at all in terms of profile .
"
The study , titled " Current Analysis and Future Research Agenda on ' Gold Farming ' : Real - World Production in Developing Countries for the Virtual Economies of Online Games , " describes its " $ 500 million per year " prediction as a " best guess , " taking into account subscription and employment data .
According to Heeks , the somewhat criminal nature of gold farming made it difficult to predict a definite number for the industry .
" It seems unlikely to be less than $ 200 million per year , and it could well be more than $ 1 billion per year , " he said .
The continued expansion of oil palm plantations will worsen the dual environmental crises of climate change and biodiversity loss , unless rainforests are better protected , warn scientists in the most comprehensive review of the subject to date .
Lead author , Emily Fitzherbert from the Zoological Society of London and University of East Anglia said : " There has been much debate over the role of palm oil production in tropical deforestation and its impacts on biodiversity .
We wanted to put the discussion on a firm scientific footing . "
Palm oil , used in food , cosmetics , biofuels and other products , is now the world 's leading vegetable oil .
It is derived from the fruit of the oil palm , grown on more than 50,000 - square miles of moist , tropical lowland areas , mostly in Malaysia and Indonesia .
These areas , once covered in tropical rainforest , the globe 's richest wildlife habitat on land , are also home to some of the most threatened species on earth .
The review , published September 15 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution , singles out deforestation associated with plantation development as by far the biggest ecological impact , but finds that the links between the two are often much more complex than portrayed in the popular press .
Co-author Matt Struebig , from Queen Mary , University of London , explains : " Most land - cover statistics do not allow us to distinguish where oil palm has actually driven forest clearance .
Oil palm certainly has directly replaced tropical forest in some areas , but oil palm companies also often have close links with timber or paper pulp companies , giving additional motives for deforestation . "
Within countries , oil palm is usually grown in a few productive areas , but it looks set to spread further .
Demand is increasing rapidly and 'its potential as a future agent of deforestation is enormous ' , the study says .

Most of the suitable land left is within the last remaining large areas of tropical rainforest in Central Africa , Latin America and Southeast Asia .
Where oil palm has replaced tropical forest the impact on wildlife depends on what species survive in the new oil palm habitat .
The study confirmed that oil palm is a poor substitute habitat for the majority of tropical forest species , particularly forest specialists and those of conservation concern .
Emily Fitzherbert continues : " By compiling scientific studies of birds , bats , ants and other species , we were able to show that on average , fewer than one - sixth of the species recorded in primary forest were found in oil palm .
Degraded forest , and even alternative crops such as rubber and cocoa , supported higher numbers of species than oil palm plantations . "
Even this estimate is likely to be optimistic , because forest habitats are more difficult to survey and some species inhabit plantations briefly before going extinct .
There is little potential to help wildlife within plantations , so ensuring that new plantations do not replace forest and protecting what is left of native forest in and around plantations are the only real options for protecting the majority of species , the researchers say .

International policies demanding evidence of environmental responsibility , in particular that land of high conservation value is not converted to oil palm , can help .
" There is enough non-forested land suitable for plantation development to allow large increases in production without further deforestation , " said co-author Ben Phalan , from the University of Cambridge .
However , in identifying these areas , there needs to be a careful distinction between degraded land that is of low conservation value , such as imperata grasslands , and partially logged or degraded forest areas which can still harbour relatively high levels of biodiversity and bring greater wildlife and carbon storage benefits if restored .
" Unless governments in producer countries show stronger leadership in controlling logging , protecting forests and ensuring that crops are planted only in appropriate areas , the impacts of oil palm expansion on biodiversity will be substantial , " adds Phalan .
This study is released as pressure mounts on UK and EU officials to rethink targets for biofuel sales .
The UK's Renewable Fuels Agency revealed that more than 80 per cent of UK biofuels were not meeting even very basic environmental standards and has urged the UK government to slow the introduction of biofuels until more is known about their negative impacts .
While increases in biofuel use will almost certainly add to pressure on tropical forests , the study highlights how those pressures might be reduced .
A recent initiative , the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , has encouraged 40 per cent of the palm oil industry to commit to saving wildlife on and around plantations .
The scientists hope that the Roundtable will continue to attract many of the remaining 60 per cent .
In Indonesia , local organisations are using satellite technology and the internet to investigate illegal forest clearance by oil palm companies and to put public pressure on them to improve .
These initiatives will help , but the study warns that unless they are scaled up and better supported by stronger government action against deforestation , damage to rainforests and their unique wildlife will continue .
IN THE STREETS of Bangkok , mobs of middle class
Thais who would normally hit the city 's massive shopping malls have been hitting the pavement instead .
For days , hundreds of thousands of protesters have massed in the streets , demanding the resignation of the prime minister , shutting down airports with their protests , and even laying siege to the main government building .

Caterpillar , the world 's largest manufacturer of construction equipment , is starting to support research on the " Contour Crafting " automated construction system that its creator believes will one day be able to build full - scale houses in hours .
Behrokh Khoshnevis , a professor in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering , says the system is a scale - up of the rapid prototyping machines now widely used in industry to " print out " three - dimensional objects designed with CAD / CAM software , usually by building up successive layers of plastic .
" Instead of plastic , Contour Crafting will use concrete , " said Khoshnevis .
More specifically , the material is a special concrete formulation provided by USG , the multi-national construction materials company that has been contributing to Khoshnevis ' research for some years as a member of an industry coalition backing the USC Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies ( CRAFT ) , home of the initiative .
The feasibility of the Contour Crafting process has been established by a recent research effort which has resulted in automated fabrication of six - foot concrete walls .
Caterpillar will be a major contributor to upcoming work on the project , according to Everett Brandt , an engineer in Caterpillar 's Technology & Solutions Division , who will work with Khoshnevis .
Another Caterpillar engineer , Brian Howson , will also participate in the effort .
Goals for this phase of the project are process and material engineering research to relate various process parameters and material characteristics to the performance of the specimens to be produced .
Various experimental and analytical methods will be employed in the course of the research .
Future phases of the project are expected to include geometric design issues , research in deployable robotics and material delivery methods , automated plumbing and electrical network installation , and automated inspection and quality control .

This is the second part in an endless series of tutorials dealing with Multi-Touch Development in Python .
If you have not read the first one yet , it can be found here .
In the last tutorial we made a really useless example , where every time each TUIO event happened , it would print out “ Something left the table ” , “ Something moved on the table ” , or “ Something was placed on the table ” .
We are going to further extend this program to print out where it happened .
So , get started by firing up your editor and opening hellomt .
py .
If you are particularly fond of your first program , you can copy it and name it hellomt2.py , or whatever you want for that matter .
No explanation of this program is needed , because you wrote it : )
If you noticed , common between all three callbacks is an argument that gets passed call blobID .
blobID itself in an integer , which contains the blobID of the blob the callback is referring too .
On every print line you wrote in the last tutorial , add this to the end :
+ str(blobID )
Now cd into the directory where the program lies , and run the program :
python ./hellomt.py
Now when you touch the surface it should print “ Something was placed on the surface 1 ” .
And every time you touch that number should increase .
The blobID is the index of a list called blobs .
You access blobs through the Observer .
In this program the Observer is instantiated as ‘ t ’ , so you would access it as t.blobs .
t.blobs is a list of TUIO2DCursor Objects .
If you were to print t.blobs , each entry would look something like this :
< touch .Tuio2DCursor object at 0x823f36 c >
If we poke around Touch Py a bit ( or just pass t.blobs [ blobID ] through the dir ( ) function , we can figure out that it has the following attributes :
[‘ Height ’ , ‘ Width ’ , ‘ __class__ ’ , ‘ __delattr__ ’ , ‘ __dict__ ’ , ‘ __doc__ ’ , ‘ __getattribute__ ’ , ‘ __hash__ ’ , ‘ __init__ ’ , ‘ __module__ ’ , ‘ __new__ ’ , ‘ __reduce__ ’ , ‘ __reduce_ex__ ’ , ‘ __repr__ ’ , ‘ __setattr__ ’ , ‘ __str__ ’ , ‘ __weakref__ ’ , ‘ _event_stack ’ , ‘ _get_handlers ’ , ‘ _raise_dispatch_exception ’ , ‘ blobID ’ , ‘ dispatch_event ’ , ‘ event ’ , ‘ mot_accel ’ , ‘ move ’ , ‘ oxpos ’ , ‘ oypos ’ , ‘ pop_handlers ’ , ‘ push_handlers ’ , ‘ register_event_type ’ , ‘ remove_handler ’ , ‘ remove_handlers ’ , ‘ set_handler ’ , ‘ set_handlers ’ , ‘ xmot ’ , ‘ xpos ’ , ‘ ymot ’ , ‘ ypos ’ ]
The only ones we really care about right now are xpos and ypos .
In other tutorials we will get to more of them , such as Height , Width , xmot , ymot , and probably others as well .
So , how do we get the x and y position of a blob ?
Like this :
x = t.blobs[blobID].xpos
y = t.blobs[blobID ].ypos
If you understand this line then skip this paragraph .
Otherwise , if you are still unclear ( like I always was when I started Python ) , read on .
This line accesses the List “ blobs ” ( which is a list of TUIO2DCursor Objects , or pretty much its a list of blobs ) , that is inside the observer ( named ‘ t ’ ) .
Because its a list , it has an index , and the index of the blob we want is blobID .
That returns a TUIO2DCursor Object , which we take the xpos attribute of .
So , to print the x and y position of each blob , lets do this :
Replace your print line in touch_up with :
x = t.blobs[blobID].xpos
y = t.blobs[blobID ].ypos
print ‘ Touch Up at ‘ + str(x ) + ‘ , ‘ + str(y )
Replace the print line in touch_move with :
x = t.blobs[blobID].xpos
y = t.blobs[blobID ].ypos
print ‘ Touch Up at ‘ + str(x ) + ‘ , ‘ + str(y )
You should be able to figure out how to do the last one ( touch_down ) .
When you run this program , each line should look like this , substituting Touch Up for the right event :
Touch Up at 0.478175550699 , 0.86176776886
If you look at those coordinates , evidently they are not pixel locations .
To get decimal coordinates , multiply each x coordinate by the width of the screen , and each y coordinate by the height of the screen .
Because I am anticipating people reading this guide will be running many different Operating Systems , I will not show any specific way to get the screen resolution , and have people hard code their screen resolution into the program .
Make a global constant - tuple at the top of your program ( anywhere before the callbacks is fine ) with your screen dimensions .
Mine looks like this :
screen_dimensions = ( 1280 , 800 )
Then in your callbacks on the lines that you calculate the X value , add this to the end :
* screen_dimensions [ 0 ]
Which is simply , multiply by the screens X dimensions .
Do the same for the Y calculations , except multiply by the Height of the screen .
Run your program , and observe the output .
Each line should look like this , substituting the correct event :
Touch Up at 832.000045776 , 49.9999940395
Now you have More accurate pixel coordinates , but you ca n’t really put a dot half - way through a Pixel .
Solve this by int-rounding each calculation .
int-rounding is the name I made up for the process of rounding to the nearest whole floating number , then making this an integer .
You do this by passing your calculation through int( round ( ) ) .
The X calculation would look like this :
x = int( round(t.blobs[blobID].xpos*screen_dimensions [ 0 ] ) )
Do this to all of the calculations , both x and y .
Now running your program should yield results similar to these , substituting the correct event :
Touch Up at 922 , 492
Congratulations !
You can now get X and Y position of events !
In the next tutorial we will write a small program using Clutter to draw circles over all the blobs .
The DEMO conference is filled with innovative , socially conscious , and inspiring products and companies .
It 's also filled with quirky ideas that make you scratch your head and say ... really ?
Enter Avego , a new product by Mapflow , a Dublin and Palo Alto - based location intelligent solutions company .
Mapflow 's
Avego is a mobile phone - based service that allows you to save gas and time by using the empty seats of your car as public transportation .
The Avego application , available for the iPhone , " automatically apportions the cost of the commute , providing a key financial incentive to commuters frustrated by high gasoline prices . "
According to Avego , the problem is that most people are far away from easy public transportation locations near their homes and workplaces .
Because it can be a hassle and time - drainer to use the public transportation systems of most major cities , Avego connects you to willing Avego members who have similar routes and , using GPS and a secure PIN system , calculates and manages the entire transaction .
Sounds a lot like a taxi service , right ?
At least they admit it in the YouTube introduction that greets you on their homepage .
Avego lays out some great arguments for using their product , including :
- 85 % of cars travel with just one driver in a five seat car .
That 's simply an inefficient use of our resources - It saves gas and reduces the cost of rides - No more public transportation - related stress - Your commute becomes faster - It 's environmental - You make money by splitting the cost of the ride
These are all great reasons , and the environment angle is especially pleasing to hear , but in the end , the success of a product is entirely dependent on whether people buy into the product .
So answer this simple question : Would you take the time and risk to drive strangers around to work ?
Most of us are comfortable in our own cars and can handle the commute , even if we do not like it .
Many more of us have figured out routes that get us to work and back .
One of the most difficult barriers startups face is changing people 's current habits .
Avego is asking people to do that in a BIG way .
Would you drive strangers to work everyday ?
Would you wait around for a stranger that was running late ?
Would you be willing to drive an extra 15 , 20 , or 30 minutes to drop off these people ?
Can you handle possibly annoying commuters ?
Are you willing to figure out where everyone lives to pick them up ?
Are you willing to become a glorified taxi service ?
Not only does Avego face a huge chicken and egg issue ( it ca n't be effective without having critical mass , but people wo n't join without critical mass ) , but it faces grave safety issues .
Say that Avego begins to gain traction , but suddenly all of the cable channels pick up a story about how an Avego driver kidnapped a passenger .
Do you really think Avego could survive that ?
With cab drivers , you have a great deal of checks and balances against that type of situation .
They are certified professionals with authorities to check in often .
Even then , though , it happens .
And the drivers are not out of danger 's way either .
Avego will always have less preventative measures than a taxi cab company , making it a greater risk .
Avego is replacing one headache with another .
Avego sounds great in theory , but the logistics , risks , and commitment are simply too much for the average person .
It requires you to place too much trust in total strangers and assumes that people are willing to keep this headache in exchange for a minor amount of cash .
I 'm sorry , but I cannot envision people changing their habits for Avego .
Avego may become a more popular service with public transportation - minded European commuters , but I have serious doubts about its feasibility in the U.S .

Advertisement A senior separatist and four others have been killed after police in Indian - administered Kashmir fired shots to disperse stone - throwing Muslims .
Sheikh Abdul Aziz was among thousands of protesters who marched towards the Line of Control ( LoC ) dividing the region .
Dozens of others were hurt .
They were supporting a move by fruit growers in the mainly Muslim Kashmir valley to take produce across the LoC .
Tensions are rising and threaten peace hopes after years of relative calm .
The BBC's Chris Morris in Delhi says the Indian government was slow to realise how volatile the situation had become - and opposition parties were quick to try to use the situation to their own advantage .
He says the result is that Kashmir has reached a very dangerous point - more divided along communal lines than it has been for years .
Rotting fruit Thousands of fruit growers and other protesters began their march on Monday from Sopore , 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of Srinagar , the summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir .
Sheikh Abdul Aziz was a prominent leader of the All Party Hurriyat Conference , which opposes Indian rule .
He and four others were killed when local police opened fire on the demonstrators , reports said .
An indefinite curfew has now been imposed in Srinagar .
If the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us
Mohammad Yousuf ,
Kashmir Fruit Growers ' Association
Violence threatens Kashmir peace Police say several of their personnel were injured by stones thrown by those at the protest .
The demonstrators were attempting to march to the de facto border with Pakistani - controlled Kashmir to protest at a blockade by Hindus in the Jammu region of a key highway that links the Kashmir Valley with the rest of India .
Hindus have protested for weeks since plans were scrapped to give land to a Hindu trust to build facilities for pilgrims near an important shrine in the region .
With the highway blocked for days , the Muslim fruit growers have complained that their produce is rotting .
Dozens of protesters were injured , some after being beaten by police " We have suffered a loss of at least 20 m rupees [ about $ 475,000 ] since this agitation began , " Mohammad Yousuf , president of the Kashmir Fruit Growers ' Association , told the Reuters news agency .
" And if the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us . "
In the Qamarwari area of Srinagar , police also fired rubber bullets to break up a demonstration of thousands of people .
Senior separatist leaders have been placed under house arrest .
The Indian Home Minister , Shivraj Patil , has appealed to the fruit growers to call off their protests .
He has offered to buy all their fruit and also to pay compensation to those whose fruit has perished .
Riots
The row started when the state government said it would grant 99 acres ( 40 hectares ) of forest land to the Amarnath Shrine Board .
Muslims launched violent protests , saying the allocation of land was aimed at altering the demographic balance in the area .
The state government said the shrine board needed the land to erect huts and toilets for visiting pilgrims .
But following days of protests , the government rescinded the order , prompting Hindu groups to mount violent protests of their own .
About 20 people - Muslims and Hindus - have been killed and hundreds wounded in clashes with police since the unrest began .

What are these ?
WHEN the tobacco industry was feeling the heat from scientists who showed that smoking caused cancer , it took decisive action .
It engaged in a decades - long public relations campaign to undermine the medical research and discredit the scientists .
The aim was not to prove tobacco harmless but to cast doubt on the science .
In May this year , the multibillion - dollar oil giant Exxon - Mobil acknowledged that it had been doing something similar .
It announced that it would cease funding nine groups that had fuelled a global campaign to deny climate change .
Exxon 's decision comes after a shareholder revolt by members of the Rockefeller family and big superannuation funds to get the oil giant to take climate change more seriously .
Exxon ( once Standard Oil ) was founded by the legendary John D. Rockefeller .
Last year , the chairman of the US House of Representatives oversight committee on science and technology , Brad Miller , said Exxon 's support for sceptics " appears to be an effort to distort public discussion " .
The funding of an array of think tanks and institutes that house climate sceptics and deniers also worried Britain 's premier scientific body , the Royal Society .
It found that in 2005 Exxon distributed nearly $ 3 million to 39 groups that " misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence that greenhouse gases are driving climate change " .
It asked Exxon to stop the funding and its protests helped force Exxon 's recent retreat .

Anyone who peruses the top mainstream economics journals will quickly realize that economic theory has been crowded out by mathematical formalism .
The neoclassical economists ' uncompromising quest for precision in their models has been achieved at the expense of the accuracy of their predictions .
The old joke of the drunk searching for his keys near the streetlight is an appropriate metaphor .
In this article we 'll discuss two classic illustrations of this habit , where the mainstream economist must abandon common sense because his favored mathematical tools demand total loyalty .
The first example comes from a recent challenge to Austrian economics from its frequent foe , Bryan Caplan .
The second example involves economics professor and Slate columnist Steven Landsburg 's criticism of people who donate to multiple charities .
As we shall see , both Caplan and Landsburg go wrong because they desperately want to deploy their mathematical models to capture economic realities .
They provide two more examples of why the Austrian approach — often derided as " unscientific " and " verbal " — is an excellent foil to guard against such neoclassical slips .
Bryan Caplan Asks Austrians an Impossible Question
At the popular blog EconLib , Bryan Caplan poses a challenge to Austrians in " The Trojan Horse Example " :
Austrian economists often attack the mainstream for ignoring something they call " radical uncertainty , " " sheer ignorance , " or sometimes " Knightian uncertainty . "
A common Austrian slogan is that " Neoclassical economists study only cases where people know that they do n't know ; we study cases where people do n't know that they do n't know . "
All of this sounds plausible until you press the Austrian to do one of two things : Explain his point using standard probability language .
What probability does " do n't know that you do n't know " correspond to ?
Zero ?
But if people really assigned p=0 to an event , than the arrival of counter - evidence should make them think that they are delusional , not [ that ] a p=0 event has [ occurred ] .
Give a good concrete example .
I 've heard Israel Kirzner give examples involving library books , pay phones , and bumps on the head , but none of them [ makes ] any sense to me .
( Emphasis original )
Before pointing out the absurdity in Caplan 's request , we should provide some background .
In the early and mid-20th century , standard mainstream models assumed that agents in the economy had perfect information .
In such a setting , it was easy enough to " prove " that advertising was wasteful , that cleverly designed mechanisms could allow central planners to replicate the outcomes of a market , and that economic theorists could safely neglect entrepreneurship .
Naturally , more and more critics lambasted such an unrealistic approach .
In response , the top mainstream economists incorporated " uncertainty " into their models , but only in a very limited way .
Now , instead of knowing ( say ) the spot price of oil at every hour , from now until the year 2050 , the cutting - edge general - equilibrium models would instead assume that agents only know the probability distribution of spot oil prices at each moment in time for the rest of eternity .
Thus , the modelers thought they had adequately dealt with the objection , for now the agent in the model really does n't know what the price of oil will be tomorrow .
Now we can understand the debate to which Caplan alludes .
Austrian economists , most notably Israel Kirzner , have stressed that this is n't really incorporating genuine uncertainty — versus actuarial risk — into the mainstream approach .
Agents still know the structure of the world with certainty ; there is no possibility , say , that an agent mistakenly thinks oil prices are distributed normally with a mean of $ 120 , when in reality the true mean is $ 121 .
This type of situation is ruled out as impossible in a mainstream model .
In a mainstream model — even one that nominally includes " uncertainty " —
Jim the Speculator can't outperform Joe the Speculator in the oil futures markets because of his better foresight .
Nobody can ever make a true mistake .
Yes , investors might later regret their actions , once the random variables have been realized , but they would only do so the way a blackjack player might " regret " doubling down on an 11 against a dealer 's 6 .
Even after losing , the blackjack player would rightly say , " I did n't really make a mistake , because my move was optimal given the information I had at the time of my decision . "
This immunity to actual error and surprise is still true of all formal mainstream models , because it 's very difficult to formally ( but nonarbitrarily ) model mistakes .
The Austrians , on the other hand , are perfectly free to explain that some entrepreneurs do better than others in the real world , because they adapted to changing conditions more quickly than their peers , and hence earned economic profits .
Austrians can do this because they are n't wed to formal mathematical models .
This freedom in their verbal explanation is n't a sign of sloppiness but rather a more accurate description of what 's really going on in the world .
So let 's sum up the debate : Austrians say that standard probability tools are inapplicable in a world of open - ended uncertainty , where it is impossible to assign a numerical probability to all possible future outcomes .
If for no other reason than limited mental powers of computation , real people simply do not act this way .
Recall now Caplan 's request : he wants the Austrian to paraphrase this insight " using standard probability language " !
It reminds me of an episode in grad school , when I was working on a paper explaining that " radical uncertainty " posed serious problems for the neoclassical approach to interest .
One of my advisors listened to me explain the problems for five minutes in the hall and then said , " Hmm , put all of that into a simple two - period model . "
Landsburg Thinks Most People Giving to Charity Are Selfish
Let 's leave Bryan Caplan alone and switch to University of Rochester economist , and Slate columnist , Steven Landsburg .
In " Giving Your All , " Landsburg argues that if they were truly motivated by altruism for the recipients , then people should concentrate their charitable giving on a single target :
People constantly ignore my good advice by contributing to the American Heart Association , the American Cancer Society , CARE , and public radio all in the same year — as if they were thinking , " OK , I think I 've pretty much wrapped up the problem of heart disease ; now let 's see what I can do about cancer . "
But such delusions of grandeur can't be very common .
So there has to be some other reason why people diversify their giving .
I think I know what that reason is .
You give to charity because you care about the recipients , or you give to charity because it makes you feel good to give .
If you care about the recipients , you 'll pick the worthiest and " bullet " ( concentrate ) your efforts .
But if you care about your own sense of satisfaction , you 'll enjoy pointing to 10 different charities and saying , " I gave to all those ! "
In the first place , I want to point out that even on his own terms , Landsburg 's criticism does n't make much sense .
Even if people are really donating merely in order to feel good about themselves , why would they care about something irrelevant , such as the number of organizations to which they donated ?
For example , if a person pats himself on the back for sending $ 500 each to four different charities , why would n't that person feel equally smug by sending $ 2000 to one charity ?
( Or for that matter , why not $ 2 each to one thousand different charities ? )
As so often happens in these matters , the problem is that Landsburg needs to model the situation using formal mathematical tools , and once he goes down this path , out pops the " optimal " answer that a person should concentrate all of his giving into the single charity that he considers most important .
I 'm not putting words in his mouth ; here is Landsburg himself :
Early in this century , the eminent economist Alfred Marshall offered this advice to his colleagues :
When confronted with an economic problem , first translate into mathematics , then solve the problem , then translate back into English and burn the mathematics .
I am a devotee of Marshall 's and frequently follow his advice .
But in this instance , I want to experiment with a slight deviation :
Rather than burn the mathematics , I will make it available as a link .
I propose to establish the following proposition :
If your charitable contributions are small relative to the size of the charities , and if you care only about the recipients ( as opposed to caring , say , about how many accolades you receive ) , then you will bullet all your contributions on a single charity .
That 's basically a mathematical proposition , which I have translated into English in this column .
Now there are all sorts of motivations that could acquit philanthropists of Lansburg 's charge , namely that they are either irrational or secretly donating to charity just to win public approval .
For example , someone might want to build up a level of trust with an organization over time , and see how it spends smaller donations before ramping up the contributions .
Or , someone might think that an organization can only maintain its independence if it relies on numerous small contributions , rather than a few large donations from wealthy individuals .
The point here is not to offer a rival theory .
Rather , my point is that people do not approach charitable giving the way Landsburg assumes in his model .
Since he is wrong at step 1 , it should n't surprise us that he reaches a conclusion that strikes most people as counterintuitive .
Conclusion
The Misesian approach to economics does not rely on unrealistic formal models .
Rather , praxeology — the science of human action — deduces necessarily true conclusions from the fact that people act .
It 's true , the Misesian can often present his entire analysis in purely verbal terms , and he can't make any guaranteed quantitative predictions about the economy .
But as the joke about the drunk looking for his keys illustrates so well , scientists need to look for answers where they actually may lie , rather than redefining the problem into one that our favorite tools can handle .

On Sunday , September 7 , 2008 , the US government seized control of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
According to the government 's statement , the financial health of both Fannie and Freddie ( FF ) had deteriorated to such an extent that it could have posed a serious threat to the US economy .
Congress established the FF in order to provide support for the housing market by keeping money flowing in the mortgage market .
( Fannie Mae was established in 1938 as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's New Deal ; Freddie Mac was established in 1970 . )
The FF market share of all new mortgages reached over 80 % early this year .
From this one can infer that a deterioration in FF financial health , which undermines their ability to keep the flow of money going to the mortgage market , is likely to hurt the housing market and the economy .
Hence most experts have concluded that the seizure of the FF by the government was a responsible act , one which could restart the flow of money to the mortgage market , reviving the housing market and in turn the rest of the economy .
How Fannie and Freddie Keep the Mortgage Market Going
The key to FF operations is the buying of home loans from mortgage originators such as banks .
The FF then bundle the loans they purchase into mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , which are sold , with a guarantee of payment to investors .
( The FF guarantee that the principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid back regardless of whether the borrower actually repays . )
The FF makes money by charging a guarantee fee on loans that it has purchased and securitized into MBS .
By buying mortgages and repackaging the loans for resale via MBS , or by owning mortgages outright , the FF have provided banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new home loans .
Due to an implied government guarantee , the FF were able to raise funds relatively cheaply by selling their debt to investors .
This in turn enabled them to pay higher prices to the originators of mortgages than potential competitors could pay .
On average , between January 2000 and August 2008 , the yield on the 10 - year Fannie Mae debt was 0.589 % above the yield on the 10 - year Treasury debt .
In contrast , the yield spread between AAA corporate debt and the 10 - year Treasury debt stood at 1.446 % .
This means that on average , from January 2000 to August 2008 , the Fannie cost of funding was below the AAA corporate by 0.857 % .
Given the fact that the debt issued by FF was considered almost as good as Treasury debt , they could attract money from around the world .
In 2007 , foreign holdings of US Government Sponsored Enterprise debt ( the FF are part of the GSE ) stood at $ 1.304 trillion — an increase of 33 % from the previous year and an increase of 165 % from 2002 .
( Note that in 2007 , China 's investment in the GSE debt comprised 29 % , Japan 's 17.5 % and Russia 's 5.8 % . )
As a result , the FF have become the dominant force in the housing market .
The combined assets of the FF jumped from $ 160.2 billion in Q1 1990 to $ 1.77 trillion by Q2 2008 .
The two companies own or guarantee $ 5.4 trillion in outstanding home - mortgage debt .
The Real - Estate - Market Crisis and the Demise of Fannie and Freddie
In response to a fall in home prices , coupled with a growing number of home foreclosures , the FF have been required to write off some of the MBS held on their balance sheets .
They also had to pay out on guaranteed mortgages that defaulted .
As a result the FF have reported nearly $ 14 billion in losses in the last four quarters .
The yearly rate of growth of the FF net worth fell to negative 17.3 % in Q2 from negative 23.2 % in the previous quarter .
Net worth as percentage of assets fell to 3.1 % in Q2 from 3.4 % in Q1 .
As the housing market continued to deteriorate , it started to put pressure on FF stock prices .
After increasing to 35.8 % in June 2007 , the yearly rate of growth of the Fannie stock price fell to negative 89.6 % by the end of August this year .
Year on year , the price of Freddie 's stock fell by 92.7 % in August after falling by 85.7 % in July .
( Note that in May last year , the yearly rate of growth stood at 11.2 % . )
This made it difficult for the FF to raise capital .
The deterioration in their solvency raised the risk that the FF would not be able to secure funding through selling their debt to large buyers such as various central banks .
As a result , the prospects for the FF to buy mortgages from lenders and supply fresh funds to the mortgage market were severely hampered .
Will the US Treasury Plan Cause Banks to Lift Mortgage Lending ?
So how then can the government seizure of FF fix the problem ?
According to the plan , the government will inject up to $ 200 billion over time into the FF and it will also engage in the active buying of MBS from various financial institutions that are currently trying to get rid of these assets .
By buying MBS , the Treasury aims at pushing their prices higher and arresting the asset - price deflation .
Also , by injecting money into the FF , government officials hope to restart the flow of money to the mortgage market and bring things to normality .
By " normality , " they mean that the FF can start buying mortgages from the banks and , after bundling them into the MBS , sell them to the market as before .
Treasury officials and various experts are hoping that this will lift home prices and , in turn , lay the foundation for the improvement in consumers ' wealth .
Subsequently , this will revive the pace of economic activity , so it is held .
( Remember that the increase in mortgage lending results in more money being directed to the housing market .
This means more money per house , i.e. , higher house prices . )
But why should banks consider lifting the pace of mortgage lending ?
According to a Federal Reserve July survey of loan officers , in excess of 80 % of banks have reported that they have tightened their lending standards on residential mortgages .
In the previous survey , this figure stood at 72 % .
Observe that in the July survey last year , the figure stood at 37 % .
In August , the yearly rate of growth of commercial bank home loans stood at negative 2.2 % after being negative at 1.6 % in July .
This was the third consecutive monthly decline in home loans by commercial banks .
At present , the major concern of most US banks is to improve their net worth , i.e. , to strengthen their solvency .
This means that the volume of lending is not going to increase if the quality of borrowers does not meet the more stringent standards .
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , commercial banks ' and savings institutions ' net worth fell by $ 10 billion from Q1 to Q2 .
This was the first decline since the data were made available in Q2 2000 .
Also , it is questionable that various investors who are at present trying to dispose of MBS would all of a sudden welcome them back into their investment portfolios .
We suggest that the FF will have difficulty finding willing buyers of MBS .
However , one could argue here that , since the US government guarantees MBS , investors might find them attractive — after all , it is held , the US government cannot default on their debts .
From this perspective , one may conclude that the US government plan to take over Fannie and Freddie is a great idea and might work .
( Most experts , including the Fed Chairman , are of the view that this is a great plan . )
Confusing Capital with Money
It seems that most experts are confusing capital with money .
Treasury officials and Fed policy makers give the impression that they have a hidden pool of resources that can be employed in emergency cases .
This is not the case .
Neither the Treasury nor the Fed has any real resources as such .
All that they can do is redistribute the existent wealth by means of taxes or by means of printing money .
( Remember that it is real savings that makes real economic growth possible and not money . )
The act of real wealth redistribution can only weaken wealth generators and make things much worse .
Pushing more money into the FF cannot set in motion an increase in lending if the pool of real savings is under pressure .
After all , the essence of credit is not lending money as such but lending real stuff .
Lending amounts to a transfer of real savings from a lender to a borrower by means of the medium of exchange , i.e. , money .
The existence of banks enhances the use of real savings .
By fulfilling the role of middleman , banks make it easier for a lender to find a borrower .
When a bank lends money , it in fact provides the borrower with the medium of exchange that can be employed to secure real stuff that is required to maintain people 's lives and well - being .
It is therefore futile to urge banks to lend more if real savings are not there .
Likewise , it does n't make much sense to suggest that the Treasury or the Fed could somehow replace nonexistent real savings .
Again all that such actions will produce is the depletion of the existent pool of real savings .
The guarantee that the Treasury is going to assume for the mortgages could be very costly to the taxpayer if the housing - market slump continues .
We suggest that if the pool of real savings is declining , then the real economy will follow suit irrespective of various plans by the Treasury and the Fed .
In these conditions , even if banks follow the Treasury plan and renew lending , this would be an exercise in futility .
A falling economy and decreasing real incomes will reduce individuals ' ability to service their debt .
Consequently , the government ( i.e. , the taxpayer ) will have to foot the bill .
However , we suggest that , if the pool of real savings is falling , the banks are likely to curtail their lending as a result of a diminished number of viable borrowers .
Now , if the pool of real savings is still OK then there is no need for the Treasury plan .
The growing pool of real savings will fix the problem .
The Fallacy of " Too Big to Fail "
Most experts are in total agreement that the government seizure of the FF was a necessary act since it has most likely averted a massive economic disaster not only in the United States but worldwide .
It is held that , if the FF were allowed to go belly up , this could have inflicted heavy losses on foreign investors in FF debt , which , it is held , could also have eroded foreigners ' willingness to invest in US government debt .
The view that some institutions are far too big to be allowed to go under is another fallacy .
According to the popular way of thinking , if a large institution is allowed to go under , this could cause severe damage to the economy , since the failure of a large institution would generate large disruptive shocks .
Since everything in an economy is interrelated , this means that a major shock could end up in a massive disaster .
In a market economy , a business that reaches the state of bankruptcy is most likely pursuing activities that do not contribute to real wealth but rather squander wealth , i.e. , activities that make losses .
Since such activities cannot support themselves , it means that real savings must be taken away from activities that do generate real wealth .
The longer a losing activity is allowed to stay alive , the more damage is being inflicted on real wealth generators .
So , on the contrary , the liquidation of a losing activity cannot cause more damage ; rather , it is going to arrest the damage inflicted on wealth generators .
Once the losing activity is gone , the wealth generators with more real savings at their disposal can start expanding wealth - generating activities and lay the foundation for healthy economic growth .
The proponents of the " too large to fail " argument maintain that allowing a large institution to fail will lead to a sharp increase in unemployment and unacceptable human suffering .
This is true .
However , the reason for the hardship is not a loss of jobs as such but the erosion of the pool of real savings .
The erosion of the pool means that there is not enough funding to support various economically nonviable activities .
Allowing such activities to stay alive only weakens the pool of real savings further and leads to the further erosion of people 's real incomes and makes things much worse .
Furthermore , activities of a large entity absorb in absolute terms more scarce savings than a smaller entity , both directly and indirectly .
We can infer from this that a large misallocated business is too big to be kept alive rather than too big to be allowed to fail , as the popular thinking has it .
The argument that the government seizure of the FF prevented the downgrading of US Treasury debt by foreigners is suspect .
The key factor that has been providing the high rating to US government debt is the perception that the US economy is still very wealthy .
Every investor implicitly or explicitly holds that , without support from private - sector wealth , US Treasury debt would have been worthless .
As long as the economy still generates wealth , the government debt will be considered safe .
Once the pool of wealth starts to shrink , foreign buyers of US government debt are likely to abandon the sinking ship , irrespective of government " rescue " plans .
If the US pool of real savings is falling and the housing market remains depressed , then this will result in the US Treasury incurring large losses in order to maintain so - called credibility , i.e. , by not allowing the FF to go under .
Needless to say , this is likely to further undermine the pool of real savings and the process of wealth formation .
We suggest that a less wealthy US economy is going to hurt all other economies through the channel of international trade .
Allow the Market to Fix the Current Credit - Market Crisis
An alternative solution is to allow the FF to go belly up and allow the market to allocate in the best way scarce real savings .
The free market will eliminate nonproductive , wealth - consuming activities and promote wealth - generating activities .
The fact that Fannie and Freddie have reached the stage of bankruptcy is the manifestation of a severe misallocation of scarce savings .
( In addition to being able to secure cheap money , the FF was given a boost by the extreme loose - interest - rate stance of the Fed between January 2001 and June 2004 . )
Allowing the FF access to cheap money has resulted in far too many houses being built , relative to peoples ' ability to fund them .
This misallocation has robbed the wealth producers of real savings and has impaired their ability to generate real wealth and promote true real economic growth ( please do n't confuse it with the GDP rate of growth ) .
Again , allowing various misallocated structures to go under will stop the bleeding of wealth generators .
( Note again that the misallocated structures must be funded all the time .
This means that wealth generators will have less real funding than they could have had at their disposal as long as these structures are allowed to exist . )
The US government and the Fed could learn from the Japanese experience : schemes to fix the economy do n't work if the pool of real savings is not there .
In order to lift banks ' lending between 2001 and 2003 , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) had been aggressively pumping money into the financial system .
The average rate of growth of monetary pumping , as depicted by the bank holdings of balances at the BOJ , had increased by 93 % during that period .
In April 2002 , the yearly rate of growth stood at 293 % .
Yet bank loans had continued to fall .
The average yearly rate of growth of loans from 2001 to 2003 stood at negative 4.5 % .
Conclusion
We suggest that the seizure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( FF ) by the government cannot help the housing market or the economy .
Most people hold the mistaken view that the government has extra real resources that can be used in emergencies .
This is erroneous .
The government is not a wealth generator ; it can only consume and redistribute real wealth .
What is needed to revive the economy is a growing pool of real savings .
Neither the US Treasury nor the US central bank can create real savings .
In order to keep the failing FF going , the taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill .
This means a further squandering of the already depleted pool of real savings .
Only wealth generators can revive the economy by accumulating enough real capital .
In this regard , no government or central - bank policies can replace wealth generators .
The only way wealth generators can act effectively is when they are not disturbed , i.e. , in a free - market environment .
The sooner the government allows them to move ahead , the sooner we will have economic improvement .
Any government or central - bank policies that are intended to improve on the free market — in particular during difficult economic times — are likely to make things much worse and prolong the economic crisis .
By Rick Reilly
Yankee Stadium is our Roman Coliseum , our sports Louvre , our Delphi .
So why are people planning to steal from it ?
Because they should .
They must !
The cathedral of baseball has a date with bulldozers at the end of this season before the new Yankee Stadium ( ugh ) opens in 2009 .
That means next week 's All - Star game sets up as a kind of Final Viewing , and , like any good funeral , grievers will be trying to slide a wristwatch or a set of cufflinks off the corpse on the way by .
This might turn into a pickpocket convention : armrests , pieces of façade , maybe even turnstiles will go missing .
Even normally upright citizen Derek Jeter says he 's going to steal something before this season ends .
" When it 's gone , " Jeter says , " they 're going to come after me . "
So here 's the question :
What will it be ?
Where do you start in a place that has more history than Barbara Walters ' closet ?
This is the joint that saw three popes serve Mass , heard the " Win one for the Gipper ! " speech , watched the first sudden death NFL game ever played .
Will Jeter take the Babe Ruth monument ?
The bronze Gehrig bat rumored to be on top of the flagpole ?
The sign on George Steinbrenner 's desk : " Lead , follow or get the hell out the way ! " ?
Bob Sheppard 's mike ?
Eddie Layton 's Hammond ?
Mel Allen 's hat ?
" Me , I 'd steal some dirt , " says Mariano Rivera .
" Just from around the mound , where I work .
I do n't steal , but that would be nice .
I 'd display it somewhere special in the house . "
Not bad , but how about the dirt at second base , where Sam Huff decleated running backs , where Pelé roamed for the Cosmos , where the boxing ring was set up for more than 30 championship bouts , from Louis over Schmeling to Ali over Norton ?
Or maybe dirt from around third ?
Where Graig Nettles magical glove made the Dodgers disappear ?
Where John Philip Sousa conducted the Seventh Regiment Band ?
Where A - Rod kept an office on his way to what may become the greatest home - run hitting career in baseball history ?
Hideki Matsui would be quite pleased just to take the left side of the batter 's box , thank you .
" It 's the amazing history of the players who stood on that side of the plate , " he said through an interpreter .
" I do n't have a backyard right now , but if I did , I 'd dig out the dirt and haul it back in a truck . "
Jeter says the thing he 's taking is " bigger than a breadbox . "
The mind swims .
Thurman Munson 's empty locker ?
The old , rusty scale trainers have been weighing Yankees on since 1950 ?
The " I thank the Good Lord for making me a Yankee " Joe DiMaggio sign ?
Not near enough for some guys .
" I 'd take the whole clubhouse , " says Joba Chamberlain .
" Piece by piece .
Hopefully , they wo n't notice they 're missing a roof and later , a bench .
I 'd add onto my house . "
There 's plenty of stuff you would n't want , of course : Jason Giambi 's thong , the 138 - foot tall bat out front or Brian McNamee 's needle - and - cotton - puff box .
And plenty of stuff you 'd love to have but is long gone : Wally Pipp 's aspirin bottle , Billy Martin 's four pink slips , Bernie Williams ' purple sunglasses , the ones he wore while playing " Purple Rain " on his guitar before games .
It 's a tough choice , taking this one last thing , because so many of Yankee Stadium 's firsts were so big .
This is where fans first saw numbers on baseball players ' backs , where Giants ' fans started the first - ever " DEE - fense ! " chant , where the World Series was first televised and brought into American homes .
Wait a minute , why not steal home itself ?
Where Don Larsen smoked the only perfecto in Series history , where Yogi Berra found out , " You can observe a lot just by watching , " and where Gehrig gave his luckiest ( luckiest ) man ( man ) on the face ( face ) of the earth ( earth ) speech 69 years ago last week ?
Or maybe we should just simplify .
" I 'd take Alex Rodriguez 's wallet , " says Yankees fan Dave Villegas , an Ithaca College student .
" I 'd spend $ 4 million after the game because he 'd cancel the card .
I 'd buy property — a nice Manhattan apartment — and probably a Shelby Cobra .
And I 'd still have his ID .
I 'd show that at bars . "
Sorry , pal , A - Rod 's wallet is already spoken for — by C - Rod .
Personally , I think it 's crucial that Jeter take something .
Because here 's what 's going to happen :
He 's going to play in the opener of that new Yankee Stadium next year , with its 50 soulless luxury boxes and its 416 " party suites " and all the quiet they 'll bring , and he 's going to see a Hard Rock Cafe and a pair of electronic hands on the new high - def scoreboard telling fans to " CLAP !!! "
And he 'll go home after that game , weep softly , and hug what he stole very , very tightly .
Love the column , hate the column , got a better idea ?

Then check out the archive .
Reports say Mark Kotsay is headed to the Sawx .
If he lands there , he ’ll start over Coco Crisp and will have some slight fantasy value .
Think AL - Only leagues .
More importantly , this would free up the Braves outfield for Brandon Jones to start then Jordan Schafer , the ( HGH - aided ) five - tooler , to get the call come September 1st .
Jordan Schafer is the most interesting name here , which is n’t that hard when you ’re surrounded by schmohawks .
Schafer was the top 13 - year - old in the country according to Baseball America and Teen Beat .
He could be patrolling centerfield for the Braves on a regular basis as soon as ’09 and , if so , he will be an early Rookie of the Year candidate , so those in keeper leagues should make sure he ’s on their team .
Anyway , here ’s what else I saw yesterday in fantasy baseball :
Brian Fuentes –
On bereavement leave , will be gone for up to 7 days .
If you ’re desperate for saves , grab Corpas and pray Fuentes ’s bereaved gets better , but hope it ’s touch and go for a week .
Also , the Rockies are still trying to move Fuentes , so it ’s not a bad idea to grab Corpas anyway .
Jimmy Rollins – 3 steals , HR and 8 - for - 10 in the last two games .
About time .
Brandon Morrow –
Set to make season debut as a starter on September 5th vs. the Yankees .
In almost 13 innings in Tacoma , he ’s struckout 18 and carries a decent WHIP , but he ’s given up 7 runs .
I ’m going to let him stretch himself out on someone else ’s team .
Jorge De La Rosa – 6 IP , 2 ER .
In a few deeper leagues , I spotted him in for this start and I will for his next start when he gets the Giants again .
Vladimir Guerrero – Was announced he ’d be sitting out some games to recharge .
Presumably for the Angels playoff games , or maybe Vlad ’s signed on to Dancing With The Stars .
Fingers crossed !
Dioner Navarro – Left the game with leg cramps .
Aw , must be that time of the month .
Wandy Rodriguez – Almost two weeks ago , I told you to pickup Wandy with absolutely no reason given .
You want a reason ?
Yesterday ’s line , 7 IP , 3 hits , 1 ER , 10 Ks .
That ’s magic , Wandy !
Zach Greinke – 6 IP , 5 Ks , 0 ER .
I dropped him about month or so ago so I guess I was Greinke ’d by this start .
Then again , prior to last night ’s start he had over a 5.00 ERA since the All - Star break .
Then Again , Part 2 : He has been solid for the last three starts .
Then Again , The Reckoning :
His innings are high for the year and the Royals provide little opportunity for wins .
Let ’s just say , I ’m not picking him back up .
Carlos Zambrano – 4.1 IP , 6 ER to outfunk Ian Snell .
Luis Ayala – Blown save yesterday .
Was n’t fully his fault and he could bounce back to get the next five saves or Manuel might look elsewhere .
The Mets bullpen aka “ As The Turd Turns … ”
Jair Jurrjens – 3 IP , 6 ER .
Mesa tinks yousa drop me .
I agree , Jar -Jar .
Cody Ross – 3 - for - 5 with a HR .
When this sumbitch gets hot , he gets real hot .
You ’ve been served ( with info ) !
Bronson Arroyo – CG , 5 hits , 1 ER .
If you had him in your lineup , you got balls .
If you think you should hold him , you ’re nuts .
Geovany Soto – 3 - for - 5 , HR and 7 RBIs .
Making a case for the first catcher off the board next year .
I wo n’t be taking him , but someone will .
Cliff Lee – 19th win as he heads towards the Cy Young .
Will be real interesting to see where he ’s drafted next year .
Again , wo n’t be by me .
The Indians fan , who just woke up from a season long slumber , is met by a 30/30 Sizemore and the eventual Cy Young , Cliff Lee .
So we ’re winning the division ?
Wild Card ?
You ’ve been Pronk’d !
Ben Francisco – 2 HRs yesterday .
Instant replay showed he actually grabbed the pitches and threw both balls over the fence .
Not everyone has the stomach for disturbing literature , but there is such a large amount of writing in the genre that everyone should give it at least one try .
This list will help to introduce you to the darker side of novels – the disturbing , macabre , and oftentimes downright sick .
The only rule to this list is that the book must be a work of fiction .
If you think something has been left off the list , be sure to tell us in the comments .
10 Misery Stephen King
Anyone who has read this book will appreciate its inclusion here ; if for no other reason than the axe scene ( in which the protagonist chops off one of his feet with an axe – this is the hobbling scene in the movie ) .
That scene aside , the pages upon pages of descriptions of the pain suffered by the bedridden main character , coupled with the psychological torment as he tries to move through the house unnoticed , make this a much deserved entry .

9 Perfume Patrick Suskind
In 18th century France , Jean - Baptiste Grenouille , born with no scent of his own , but with with a supernatural ability to detect the scent of others is driven to murder in order to create the perfect perfume .
The book is a bizarre tale , but it is also lyrical and hypnotic–almost a fairy tale of terror .
The ending is utterly vile and if you like disturbing literature , that alone makes this book worth a read .
You wo n’t be disappointed , I promise you .

8 Justine Marquis de Sade
Upon anonymous publication , this book so scandalized France that Napoleon ordered the arrest of the author , stating that the book was “ the most abominable book ever engendered by the most depraved imagination ” .
The plot concerns Justine , who is presented with vice and abuse everywhere she turns .
For example , she seeks refuge and confession in a monastery , but is forced to become a sex - slave to the monks , who subject her to countless orgies , rapes and other abuses .
This is a must - read for anyone interested in French literature , the history of sadism , or disturbing literature .

7 American Psycho Brett Easton Ellis
This is one of the only books that I have not finished reading .
I was so horrified by a scene early in the book ( involving a dog , a bum , and a very sharp knife ) that I could not go on .
It was my first introduction to truly disturbing writing .
I have since learnt to cope better and will , eventually , give this book another go .
In the novel , people are sawed in half , gutted , sliced , diced and quartered in every imaginable form .
What is striking about this novel ’s violence is how emotionally unattached the protagonist is to it all , he has lost all feeling for anything but the thrill of the taboo .
This book will change you .

6 The Painted Bird Jerzy Kosi?ski
The ‘ Painted Bird ’ is a holocaust novel that mentions the concentration camps only in passing , and rarely details the Nazis and their terrible work .
This is the story of a young boy who gets separated from his parents when they send him to the ( perceived ) safety of the countryside when World War II breaks out in Eastern Europe .
What happens to the boy – the things that are done to him , the things he sees and endures – is staggering .
It ’s a shocking description of hell on Earth .
This book is a carnival of torture .

5 Geek Love Katherine Dunn
Straddling the borderlands between realism , fantasy and horror , “ Geek Love ” deals with the remarkable Binewski carnival family : Arturo the Aqua - Boy , born with flippers but no limbs ; the musical Siamese twins Electra and Iphigenia ; the telekinetic boy - wonder Chick ; and the long - suffering Olympia , our narrator , who is a bald hump - backed albino dwarf .
The story progresses through the family ’s relatively innocent conception into much darker territory , primarily concerning Oly ’s megalomaniac brother , Arty , and eventually culminates in a catastrophic event which claims the lives of all but a few Binewskis .

4 We Need To Talk About Kevin Lionel Shriver
Kevin is a 15 year old mass murderer ; a child who ’s been emotionally unstable all his life .
This book is written from the perspective of his mother , Eva .
She , too , is emotionally disturbed .
Shriver does do a creepily good job of highlighting all of the real school shootings that have taken place in America in the last few years , making We Need to Talk About Kevin not just disturbing in the far - off sense , but in the sense that although this particular story is n’t real , Eva could be any number of mothers in this country whose children have done the unthinkable .

3 The Wasp Factory Iain Banks
The book is told entirely by Frank , a 17 year old who manages to sound perfectly sane and rational as he explains how he killed 3 people while he was still just a child or as he performs the rituals of the Wasp Factory ( bizarre rituals that need to be read to be believed ) .
The casualnes with which violent and unpleasant events are described is possibly more horrible than the events themselves and the irony that Frank considers himself the sanest person he knows is understated throughout .
“ I had been making the rounds of the Sacrifice Poles the day we heard my brother had escaped .
I already knew something was going to happen ; the Factory told me . ”

2 Glamorama Brett Easton Ellis
I normally restrict these lists to one book per author .
Today I am breaking that rule .
Glamorama definitely needs to be on this list ( along with the other Easton Ellis book , American Psycho ) because of the gut churning violence depicted throughout the entire second half of the novel .
There is a poisoning scene which you will never forget , a scene involving dismemberment ( and described in every detail as is always the case with this author ) , and a plane crash .
The book does have many elements of humor ( for example , the main character , a male model , thinks that Global Warming is a type of shampoo ) and I found it to be an enjoyable read , but it is definitely up there as one of the most disturbing books I have ever read .

1 Haunted Chuck Palahniuk
Haunted is truly one disturbing but entertaining book of short stories .
The first story is about a guy who loses some of his organs – it is the perfect example of “ disturbing ” literature .
This is possibly the most blatantly twisted of Palahniuk ’s novels ;
Haunted pushes the borders of what is considered socially acceptable .
The book tells the story of 18 or so struggling writers who sign up for a “ workshop ” that involves being locked inside a dilapidated mansion for several days to develop story ideas .
The chapters are the consequences of their brainstorming .
One review sums up the gruesomeness of this book ( and illustrates why it is item 1 ) : “ I thought that if I made it through story # 1 ( eating your way through your own prolapsed rectum ) that I could get through anything , but I was wrong . ”

A new population of rare leopard has been found living in thick forests on the Indonesian half of Borneo island , a researcher has said .
Camera traps in Sebangau National Park in Central Kalimantan province have snapped pictures of two adult male Bornean clouded leopards in an area once decimated by logging , British zoologist Susan Cheyne said .
The discovery by researchers from Oxford University ’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit and Indonesia ’s Pangkalan Raya University is the first confirmation the clouded leopard , which is classified as vulnerable , lives in the park .
The discovery holds out new hope for the little - understood species , which numbers less than 10,000 individuals and is the top predator on Borneo island , Cheyne said .
“ This elusive species is a good indicator of forest health .
Large cats need prey and the prey — deer , macaques and bearded pigs — need the forest , ” she said .
“ The clouded leopard is the largest predator on Borneo , there are no tigers .
Having the island ’s top predator surviving in an ex-logging concession hopefully means that the species is resilient . ”
However , the discovery still only provides a small amount of information about the behaviour and distribution of the big cats .
“ With more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats , look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range , and possible range overlap with the smaller cats , ” Cheyne said .
The forests on Indonesia ’s half of Borneo island are home to some of the world ’s most diverse wildlife , but are under threat from plantations and logging , much of it illegal .

Surpassing “ The Flintstones ” more than 13 years ago as the longest animated sitcoms and the longest running animated program , “ The Simpsons ” has also become a hallmark for American television .
In the nearly 20 seasons , “ The Simpsons ” has created a few of its own hallmarks such as the couch gag , the chalkboard gag and guest stars .
“ Simpsons ” fans have become almost cultish , and it is not surprising that some of the most notable guest stars are famous with their own cultish followings .
To be included on this list , the guest star or stars had to have been notably famous for a significant amount of time and / or be known as the best among their peers .
Higher recognition was given to those celebrities who would not normally guest star vocally .
10 . Dustin Hoffman
Arguably one of the best actors of his generation , Dustin Hoffman has always brought a quirk and a smile to his performances .
As a Mr. Bergstrom , substitute teacher for Lisa , she adores the only adult and certainly only teacher to challenge and respect her .
Hoffman ’s performance , coincidentally , was credited under the pseudonym Sam Etic .
9. Aerosmith & The Who
Both of these rock ‘ n ’ roll bands are legendary in their own right .
Both of these bands ’ members played themselves as they came to Springfield .
In Aerosmith ’s case , they name Moe ’s as their official hangout because of the Flaming Moe , which had a secret ingredient of cough syrup .
And The Who were scheduled to perform in one of the two Springfields in “ A Tale of Two Springfields ” in which they help bring New Springfield and Olde Springfield back together by playing “ Wo n’t be Fooled Again . ”
8. George Takei & Leonard Nimoy
Mr. Sulu and Mr. Spock as they are known to their own cult followings have both been guest stars multiple times on “ The Simpsons . ”
Leonard Nimoy has acted as a resident in “ Marge vs. the Monorail ” and a commentator in “ The Springfield Files ; ” George Takei played Akira , the Japanese owner of The Happy Sumo , and Mr. Wink , a Japanese game show host .
Meanwhile , many “ Star Trek ” fans are probably wondering why the ever funny William Shatner has n’t made a guest appearance .
7. Elton John
Flamboyant piano man and one of the best selling artists of all times , Elton John played himself when he had to make an emergency landing because his chandelier was not working in his plane .
He is one of two Englishmen and famous singers to visit Apu .
6. Stephen King & J.K. Rowling
Both Stephen King and J.K.
Rowling are world - renowned authors .
Though King has dabbled in acting before it was a first for Rowling .
Rowling was just one of many English notables that the Simpsons meet in a vacation to London .
King also played himself in the episode “ Insane Clown Poppy . ”
5. Michael Jackson
Jacko will forever be famous or infamous depending on the era .
And his appearance on “ The Simpsons ” was nothing less .
Like Dustin Hoffman , Michael ’s appearance was under a pseudonym .
Jackson played a white mental institution inmate who believed that he was Michael Jackson .
An interesting sidenote : while Jackson could do his own voice , he was unable contractually to sing any of his songs on the show .
4. Bob Hope
The venerable showman Bob Hope played himself in the “ Lisa the Beauty Queen ” episode .
As the acting Miss Little Springfield , Lisa is expected to go on a USO tour with Bob Hope , which of course , Hope is well known for .
3. James Earl Jones
Known to millions as the voice of Darth Vader from “ Star Wars ” or the voice of CNN , James Earl Jones has lent his voice talents to “ The Simpsons ” many times over the last 19 years .
Perhaps as one of his funniest voice roles was as Maggie in an alternate universe during a Treehouse of Horror episode , while he has also play the narrator as well , notably reading “ The Raven ” on the first “ Treehouse of Horror ” .
Jones shares the voice of Maggie with our No. two guest star .
2. Elizabeth Taylor
Elizabeth Taylor only uttered one word in her debut on “ The Simpsons . ”
But it was a word that everyone was waiting for as we heard Maggie speak for the first time and not in an alternate universe .
Of course , it ’s the one word that every father including Homer wants to hear , “ Daddy . ”
She has also made an appearance as herself .
1. Paul McCartney , George Harrison & Ringo Star
While many bands have been featured with their full cast on the show , George Harrison , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared as themselves .
Part of the most well - known rock band of all time , the former Beatles appeared early on in “ The Simpsons ” run .
Paul and Linda played themselves while visiting Apu , the resident vegetarian while Ringo finally replies to Marge ’s decades - old fan mail praising her painting of him .
George Harrision made his appearance during the Barber Shop Quartet episode when Homer was part of the B Sharps .
And who knows , had “ The Simpsons ” been around when John Lennon was alive , he might have been a guest star as well .
Honorable Mentions :
Mickey Rooney , Michelle Pfeiffer , Meryl Streep , David Duchovny , Gillian Anderson , Metallica , Smashing Pumpkins , Green Day , and of course , Kelsey Grammer

Yossi Ravitz , 22 , has n’t had a class in math , science , civics or English since he was a boy .
But he believes the rigor of his religious studies equips him for any subject he might need to tackle later in life .
“ I do n’t feel I ’m missing anything here , ” he said during a midday break at the spacious campus of the Hebron Yeshiva , one of Israel ’s most prominent religious academies .
Ravitz is one of tens of thousands of Israeli boys and young men studying to master the Torah and the Talmud , cloistered at ultra-Orthodox schools that shield them from secular teachings that might shake their faith .
In a defining battle over the Jewish state ’s identity , the yeshivas are resisting pressure from secular politicians and educators to teach the basic subjects required at all Israeli secondary schools .
Advertisement
“ They want to turn us into what they see as ‘ enlightened people of the world , ’ who will integrate into Israeli society , ” he said .
“ But we do not want to integrate into that society , because of its many temptations . ”
Haredi Jews , as the ultra-Orthodox are known here , won the latest skirmish .
Parliament last month legalized state funding for high school - age boys ’ yeshivas while reclassifying them as “ culturally unique ” schools , exempt from the obligation to add on a basic secular curriculum .
The new law undermined a Supreme Court ruling that by Sept. 1 would have cut off the back - channel financing the yeshivas have received for decades .
The law preserves the autonomy and financial health of schools that , their socially conservative supporters say , safeguard Israel ’s spiritual survival .
“ Blessed is he who performed this miracle for us ! ” exclaimed Eli Yishai , the ultra-Orthodox deputy prime minister , after helping engineer the bill ’s passage .
Advertisement
For its foes , the measure legalizes “ publicly funded ignorance , ” as the newspaper Haaretz railed in an editorial .
The Supreme Court , calling the law “ inexplicable , ” predicted it would be struck down if challenged .
“ What was fitting for the 18th century does not fit in the 21st , ” said Avshalom Vilan , a member of parliament from the leftist Meretz party .
“ It is unacceptable that a high school graduate will enter the work force with fourth - grade math . ”
The debate is part of a broader struggle often obscured by Israel ’s armed conflicts with Arab neighbors .
Secular Israelis , who rule the nation , see in the ultra-Orthodox an assault on the rational , modern and democratic world they embrace .
Haredi Jews believe secular Israelis have undergone a dangerous assimilation -- a separation of Jews from Judaism -- that threatens to contaminate religious children .
In the years after Israel ’s establishment in 1948 , Europe ’s haredi community was so diminished by the Holocaust that no one objected to its protected status and state subsidies here .
Advertisement
As the community thrived , however , many secular Israelis came to resent it as a burden .
Yeshiva students are exempt from the military draft , and tens of thousands of haredi men spend a lifetime of religious study on the public dole , even as they condemn the moral corruption of the society that pays the bill .
Religious and secular Jews have skirmished over gay pride rallies , gender - segregated buses , divorce law , standards of sartorial modesty , Sabbath street closings and the sale of non-kosher meat .
One thing is beyond dispute :
The ultra-Orthodox , who make up 7 % of Israel ’s population , wield disproportionate political clout .
By trading legislative favors , Yishai ’s Shas party secured fast - track approval for the yeshiva - funding bill a day before parliament began its summer recess .
Advertisement
The law guarantees yeshivas 60 % of the funding secular schools get from the national treasury and allows municipal allocations to bridge the gap .
About 90,000 haredi Jews study in Israeli yeshivas .
Girls , expected to work as adults and bear the children of perpetual religious scholars , take secular subjects along with religious ones until they graduate .
What little secular education haredi boys get ends in primary school .
The Supreme Court calls this a violation of a universal education law that requires students 18 and younger to be taught “ basic knowledge , proficiency and values ” needed “ to function in a pluralistic society . ”
Defenders of the yeshivas bristle at this argument .
They note that yeshiva graduates aspiring to enter secular universities score higher than the national average on entrance exams after taking one - year catch - up courses .
The Hebron Yeshiva ’s vast study hall , often crowded at 2 a.m. , is a picture of academic discipline ; men who have hit the books there include a former president , poets , judges and bank chairmen , as well as rabbis and religious scholars .
Advertisement
Talmud study involves rigorous debates over interpretation of Jewish law , meant to give students a highly developed ability to reason .
And yet the yeshivas also produce their share of dropouts who feel cheated .
Yossi David , who abandoned his haredi community when he was 18 , said his yeshiva education in southern Israel was so poor that he failed to qualify for specialized training in the army and later struggled through adult courses toward a high school diploma .
Now 26 , he has finished his freshman year as a sociology and communications major at Hebrew University in Jerusalem , but he looks back in anger .
“ I had no social studies , no history , and certainly no English at the yeshiva ; it was considered the language of the goyim , ” he said .
“ I ’m still catching up .
Almost every day I come across things that are general knowledge but new and alien to me .
Advertisement
“ You have to understand , ” he added .
“ Ultra - Orthodox education is driven by a fear that people empowered by knowledge will leave the community .
The leaders keep the people incapable , disadvantaged , dependent and poor in spirit and knowledge . ”
Such criticism of the yeshivas , however , is tempered by demographic and political realities .
Haredi couples produce more children than other Israelis do , and as the proportion of Israelis in yeshivas grows , so does the power of haredi politicians to secure state funding on their terms .
Michael Melchior , a modern Orthodox rabbi who heads parliament ’s Education Committee and voted for the bill , is concerned about what might happen if the yeshivas are deprived of government support .

“ Taking away all their funding , ” he said , “ would only further distance the haredim from the state . ”

Batsheva Sobelman of The Times ’ Jerusalem Bureau contributed to this report .
The primary goal of the Paulson Plan is to get the banks to lend again - or " unclog the system " as Secretary Paulson put it .
Secondary goals are to " protect the taxpayer " and hopefully minimize moral hazard .
Will the plan achieve the primary goal ?
I think the answer is yes .
By removing these troubled assets from the balance sheets of the financial institutions , the banks will able to lend again without lingering doubts about their solvency and viability .
At first glance , the size of the plan seems sufficient .
UPDATE : This assumes some sort of recapitalization of the banks while they deleverage too .
Something that is n't in the plan ...
It is almost guaranteed that there will be unintended and unanticipated consequences , but the plan will probably achieve the primary goal .
And making sure the banks continue to lend will minimize the impact of the credit crisis on the general economy .
Unfortunately the Plan fails to address the secondary goals .
By definition the Government will pay more for these troubled assets than private investors ( or the banks would just sell the assets to investors ) .
The question is : will the government pay more than the intrinsic value of these assets ?
( intrinsic value in this sense would be the amount the government eventually receives for these assets ) .
This intrinsic value is unknown right now because we do n't know how far house prices will decline ( and the value of MBS is related to house prices ) , and we do n't know how much the Government will pay for these assets .
Under an optimistic scenario perhaps the government might pay close to the intrinsic value for the MBS , and the taxpayers would lose little or nothing .
A more pessimistic scenario would suggest that the government would lose something on every transaction - and because of the structure of the plan , this might cost the taxpayers $ 700 billion .
Note :
This does n't imply each asset is worthless .
Imagine you start with $ 100 .
You buy an asset for $ 100 , and sell it for 30 % less - you lost $ 30 .
Now you invest the $ 70 and lose 30 % again , and on and on .
Even though you only lost 30 % on each transaction , you eventually lose the entire $ 100 - this is possible with the structure of this plan .
So the plan does nothing to protect taxpayers or minimize moral hazard .
This is fixable by adding some sort of options or warrants for preferred shares and / or senior debt that could be tied to the losses for each institution .
If the government loses money buying MBS from a particular institution , then - after several years - that institution could reimburse the taxpayers or the shareholders suffer significant dilution .
And a final suggestion :
In an effort for transparency , I 'd like to see a website that listed each transaction purchased by the government .
This could list the details of the asset , the PAR value , the selling institution , the underlying characteristics , the originators of the loans , the price the government paid ( and eventual sold the asset for ) and any other relevant detail .
One speaker says of the Jews : " Their time will come , like every other evil person 's time will come . "
Another speech , this time by Sheikh Khalid Yasin , who learned Arabic in Saudi Arabia , praised the deterrent effect of sharia law : " Then people can see , people without hands , people can see in public heads rolling down the street , people got [ sic ] their hands and feet from opposite sides chopped off and they see them crucified … they see people put up against the pole and see them get lashed in public they see it , and because they see it , it acts as a deterrent for them because they say I do n't want that to happen to me . "
The Problem
Imagine for a moment that you ’re building a web application based nearly 100 % percent on AJAX .
And imagine that you ’ll likely need to send bursts of multiple AJAX requests to your server , and you also need all of these requests to be processed in order when they hit your server .
You want a near continuous AJAX connection – every action , every edit , every keystroke the user makes – all of these need to be sent to your server for processing .
You are building Listotron .
This is exactly the problem I ’ve created for myself by working on the Listotron project with Buck .
Listotron is [ will be ] a simple web app that lets users easily create and edit lists and collaborate on them in real time .
Simple put , it ’ll be a web based OmniOutliner with a much smaller feature set and multi-user realtime editing .
I ’m particularly excited to use it as a research playground for optimizing web - apps .
( As we build , we ’ll be sharing our ideas , plans , code , prototypes , and much more – so check out the Listotron blog for more ) .
Since we ’re designing Listotron to be a 100 % AJAX based application , every edit the user makes will need to be AJAX ’d to the server .
What ’s more , we want users to be able collaboratively edit the same list at the same time – Google Spreadsheets style .
This means that every edit , every tab , every indent , everything needs to be AJAX ’d quickly and efficiently to our server so we can update any collaborators that might also be working on the list .
Most importantly , all of the edits need to happen in order , since most edits to the list will depend on previous edits to the list .
My goals for speed are to make the real - time editing even faster than Google ’s collaborative spreadsheet editing .
A large part of the perceived speed of collaboration is the frequency of AJAX calls ( the more calls per second the faster the app can update collaborators ) – so I ’ll need both an incredibly streamlined server - side and an incredibly optimized AJAX front - end in JavaScript .
This article will talk about the JavaScript strategy .
Asynchronous AJAX
The problem with relying on plain ole ’ asynchronous AJAX is that it ’s , well , asynchronous .
We ’re not guaranteed that all of our AJAX calls will be received by the sever in the correct order , and we ’re certainly not guaranteed that we ’ll receive the responses in the correct order .
Imagine sending off 4 + edits to the sever , only to find out in the last response that the 2nd request failed .
What if edits 3 and 4 relied on edit 2 ?
How do I roll back the UI ?
How do I maintain data integrity on the server ? on the client ?
It ’d be hell to build , hell to debug , and hell to maintain .
No thanks !
Synchronous AJAX
Since I need to send all my AJAX requests to the server in order , why not just use synchronous ajax calls ?
Problem solved , right ?
Unfortunately , it ’s not that simple – from the YUI blog :
XMLHttpRequest can operate synchronously or asynchronously .
Many people prefer to use it synchronously .
When used this way , the JavaScript engine is blocked until the interaction with the server is complete …
Temporal complexity is abstracted away , leaving a very familiar and comfortable programming pattern .
So far so good , but here ’s the zinger ( emphasis added ) …
Because the JavaScript engine is blocked until the request completes , the browser will be frozen .
The user cannot cancel the request , cannot click away , cannot go to another tab .
This is extremely bad behavior .
That ’s very bad news indeed .
Synchronous AJAX ends up looking something like this :
Clearly this is not the way to go .
It ’s simply not acceptable to freeze the entire browser – ( even in Chrome ‘s case : the entire tab ) – for every single tiny edit .
A different approach needs to be made .
The Solution
The solution we ’ll be using with Listotron is to manually enforce synchronization into what would otherwise be asynchronous AJAX calls .
The idea is this : after an AJAX request is made , queue up any other requests that need to be made until a response comes back – then send a single bundled AJAX request that contains all of the requests currently in the queue .
The server decodes this bundled AJAX call , processes each request , and sends back a bundled response .
All this ends up looking something like :
Since we need to maintain the call - order of our AJAX calls , we can queue them up in - order and then send off multiple requests to our server in one go .
The benefits are : ( 1 ) fewer http connections hitting the server , and ( 2 ) the order of the AJAX calls is maintained , ( 3 ) and UI is still very responsive .
And , since the server sees multiple edits at the same time , further optimization can be done that would otherwise be impossible .
For instance , the server receives 2 commands in a bundle : an indent command followed by an outdent command .
The net result to the list is to do nothing !
This optimization comes at a price , of course , and it ’s that the server needs some custom code to handle these bundled AJAX requests , so this solution is n’t as easy as dropping in a new JavaScript framework or function .
Bringing It To Life
I ’ve set up a basic demo and tutorial that bundles up asynchronous AJAX calls to maintain their order .
I ’ve implemented everything as a jQuery plugin with a lightweight PHP / MySQL server - side .

Wind - Powered Tall Ships Are Once Again Important As Oil Prices Hurt Trade
July 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Sometimes it takes an energy crisis to make us realize the value of old technology .
As oil prices soar , tall wind - powered ships are looking like an increasingly viable alternative .
The first commercial cargo of French wine to be transported by sailboat in the modern era is due to arrive in Dublin this week after a six - day trip .
The 108 year - old British boat , chartered by French shipping company Compagnie de Transport Maritime a la Voile ( CMTV ) , is carrying 30,000 bottles of wine .
Though the ship travels at a top speed of eight knots — half the speed of a modern cargo vessel — it is completely pollution - free .
The 50,000 other merchant ships traveling the world emit 800 million tons of carbon dioxide each year .
The Kathleen & May spent most of its life transporting coal and clay .
It was taken out of commercial service in 1960 .
Now it ’s once again hard at work , as CMTV has contracted for 80 vineyard owners from southern France to carry their wine bottles to Ireland on the ship .
The company is also working on another deal to bring Irish whiskey and scotch to France using the boat , and it eventually plans on building its own tall ships for transport .
CMTV may be on to something ; according to the French Association of Shipowners , wind - powered boats could capture .5 % of the commercial shipping market .
This may not sound like much — until you consider that 90 % of the world ’s traded goods are transported via boat .
Tall ships may move a bit slower than fossil - fuel powered ships , but their minimal environmental impact could make them sea trade ’s best hope for the future .

Everyone is " Crying " out for a decent first person shooter ( sorry about the pun ) to compete and beat the Call of Duty experience , especially when it comes to online gaming .
What multiplayer features are going to make people buy this game more than any other FPS out there ?
A %
Louis - Pierre Pharand : Call of Duty is a great game , I love it .
Far Cry is a completely different shooter experience .
You 're not stuck in a corridor or in a confined space .
We take full of advantage of the open feeling of Africa .
On the MP side in more details , we take all the SP features and integrate them in MP .
Propagation of fire , destructibility , dynamism of vegetation , dynamic lighting systems , day - night cycles .
We also made sure to have the ability to use the vehicles ( land and water ) .
Plus all the tools and ingredients are there to allow gamers to be extremely creative in their approaches .
I missed the Map Editor .
That just a crazy mad tool for everyone to create their own maps , to share them and to brag about how good they are !
I ’m about to reread A Farewell to Alms , by Gregory Clark .
The book challenges the conventional wisdom of economists about how and why economies grow .
Ask a typical economist for an economic growth recipe and he or she will say “ low taxes , property rights , security and stability . ”
Clark has assembled amazing quantities of data on wages , prices , and rents going back to the year 1200 in England .
He demonstrates that England circa 1300 had all of the things that a modern economist says are sufficient to guarantee economic growth and yet its economy stagnated for centuries .
Clark starts with a defense of Malthus .
In most societies at most times in human history , Malthus was right .
The population expanded until everyone was living at a subsistence level .
Given an improvement in technology or health care the long - term result was not that people on average had an improved standard of living , but rather a population of increased size living at an even lower material standard .
You had to be robust in filthy Europe to survive infections , but even an underfed weakling was relatively safe from disease in hygienic Japan and China .
The consequence was that China and Japan were more densely populated and strikingly poor by European standards right up to the Industrial Revolution .
If Malthus and Clark are right , foreign aid is the ultimate career path for a young person .
Western donors are motivated by images of people living in poverty .
Money flows in .
Even after subtracting for the overhead of running all of the NGOs , a certain amount of food and health care aid reaches the unfortunates .
You might expect the NGOs to suffer a reduction in demand and a reduction in donations as the unfortunates begin to look less unfortunate .
Malthus would predict that the former unfortunates will have a lot of children and eventually the larger population will be worse off than before , which will result in more dramatic TV images of starving people , more donations , and more job opportunities for our young NGO careerist .
Population growth combined with personal income growth is an anomaly , according to Malthus and Clark .
The U.S. population has been growing steadily in recent years and our average inhabitant is no better educated than before .
Politicians stand up and angrily ask why average personal income has n’t grown .
The real question is why average personal income has n’t shrunk .
How To Launch Software
37signals recommends that software developers pursue what they call the Hollywood Launch .
They do n’t give any argument for this method , except perhaps the title ( as if Hollywood was a business you should try to imitate ? ) —
I guess the idea is that you ’re supposed to do it since 37 signals says to .
The basic idea behind the Hollywood Launch is simple : you release a few hints about your product to build buzz , slowly revealing more and more until the big day , when you throw open the doors and people flood your site , sent there by all the blog coverage and email alerts .
This may work well for Hollywood — if your movie is a big hit at the box - office on opening weekend , then the movie theaters are more likely to keep showing it in the weeks to come and you get credit for being “ one of the weekend ’s biggest films ” .
But for software developers , it ’s moronic .
Your software is n’t being released in theaters , it ’s available over the Web .
You do n’t have to worry about the theater no longer showing after week one ; you can keep pushing it for years , growing your userbase .
Instead what happens when software developers try the Hollywood Launch , and I ’ve seen this many times , is that users indeed do flood to your site on launch day but …
They bring the site down from the load .
You scramble to get it back up and succeed by coding like a mad man , only to find …
They discover some big bug that you never quite noticed before , which makes the whole thing look like embarrassing hackwork .
( What ?
You forgot to test that last - minute JavaScript change in IE6 1/2 ? )
So you ’re desperately rushing to fix the bug before the traffic dies down , rush - patching things and restarting the server when …
You bring the site down for everyone because there was a syntax error in your patch that keeps the server from coming back up .
You fix it while cursing yourself madly .
Finally everything seems to work .
You take a breath and decide to see what people are saying about you on the Web , only to discover …
Everyone misunderstood what your product does because your front page was n’t clear enough .
Now they all think it ’s stupid and wonder aloud how you even know how to breathe .
So you reply in all the comment threads and fix your front page to ensure no one could possibly misunderstand what it is you ’re doing just in time to find …
All the traffic is gone .
Tomorrow , hardly any of those users come back .
Your traffic graphs look like the sharpest mountain you ’ve ever seen : a huge climb up and then , almost immediately , a similarly - sized crash back down .
So what do you do then ?
Well , you do what you should have done all along : you grow the site .
I ’ll call this technique the Gmail Launch , since it ’s based on what Gmail did .
Gmail is probably one of the biggest Web 2.0 success stories , so there ’s an argument in its favor right there .
Here ’s how it works :
Have users from day one .
Obviously at the very beginning it ’ll just be yourself and your co-workers , but as soon as you have something that you do n’t cringe while using , you give it to your friends and family .
Keep improving it based on their feedback and once you have something that ’s tolerable , let them invite their friends to use it too .
Try to get lots of feedback from these new invitees , figuring out what does n’t make sense , what needs to be fixed , and what things do n’t work on their bizarre use case combination .
Once these are all straightened out , and they ’re using it happily , you let them invite their friends .
Repeat until things get big enough that you need to …
Automate the process , giving everyone some invite codes to share .
By requiring codes , you protect against a premature slashdotting and force your users to think carefully about who actually would want to use it ( getting them to do your marketing for you ) .
Plus , you make everyone feel special for using your product .
( You can also start ( slowly ! ) sending invite codes to any email lists you might have . )
Iterate : give out invite codes , fix bugs , make sure things are stable .
Stay in this phase until the number of users you ’re willing to invite is about the same as the number you expect will initially sign up if you make the site public .
For Gmail , this was a long time , since a lot of people wanted invites .
You can probably safely do it sooner .
Take off the invite code requirement , so that people can use the product just by visiting its front page .
Soon enough , random people will come across it from Google or various blogs and become real users .
If all this works — if random people are actually happy with your product and you ’re ready to grow even larger — then you can start building buzz and getting press and blog attention .
The best way to do this is to have some kind of news hook — some gimmick or controversial thing that everyone will want to talk about .
( With reddit , the big thing was that we switched from Lisp to Python , which was discussed endlessly in the Lisp and Python communities and gave us our first big userbase . )
Start marketing .
Once you start using up all the growth you can get by word - of - mouth ( and this can take a while — Google is only getting to this stage now ) , you can start doing advertising and other marketing - type things to provide the next big boost in growth .
The result will be a graph that just keeps accelerating and climbing up .
That ’s the graph that everyone loves to see : solid growth , not a one - day wonder .
Good luck .
Since 37signals quotes from people who followed their advice , I thought I might as well do the same .
mojombo :
I find this to be excellent advice .
This is exactly the approach we took at GitHub almost down to the letter .
It took about 2 months until the site was good enough to use to host the GitHub source , another month until we started private beta with invites , and three more months until public launch .
Artificial scarcity is a great technique to generate excitement for a product while also limiting growth to a rate that wo n’t melt your servers .
We worked through a huge number of problems and early users gave us some of the ideas that have defined GitHub .
By doing a Hollywood launch , things would have been very different and I am convinced , very much worse .
Do not , I repeat , DO NOT underestimate how much your users will help you to define your product .
If you launch without having significant user feedback time , you ’ve essentially thrown away a massive ( and free ) focus group study .
Let me also say that when we finally did our public launch , there was plenty of buzz , and all of it was the RIGHT kind of buzz .
The buzz that attracts real , lasting customers ( and no , we were n’t on TechCrunch , that traffic is garbage ) .

Ohio inmate says he 's too fat for execution
COLUMBUS , Ohio -
A death row inmate scheduled for execution says he 's too fat to be put to death , claiming executioners would have trouble finding his veins and that his weight could diminish the effectiveness of one of the lethal injection drugs .
Lawyers for Richard Cooey argue in a federal lawsuit that Cooey  5 - feet - 7 and 267 pounds  had poor veins when he faced execution five years ago and the problem has been worsened by weight gain .
The lawsuit , filed Friday in federal court , also says prison officials have had difficulty drawing blood from Cooey for medical procedures .
Cooey , 41 , is sentenced to die for raping and murdering two young women in 1986 .
His execution is scheduled for Oct. 14 .
His attorneys say a drug he is taking for migraine headaches could affect the execution process .
The drug Topamax , a type of seizure medication , may have created a resistance to thiopental , the drug used to put inmates to sleep before two other lethal drugs are administered , Dr. Mark Heath , a physician hired by the Ohio Public Defender 's Office , said in documents filed with the court .
Heath says Cooey 's weight , combined with the potential drug resistance , increases the risk he would not be properly anesthetized .
" All of the experts agree if the first drug does n't work , the execution is going to be excruciating , " Cooey 's public defender , Kelly Culshaw Schneider , said Monday .
Prison system spokeswoman Andrea Carson and Jim Gravelle , a spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General 's Office , both said Monday they had n't seen the lawsuit and could n't comment .
Last year , Carson cited the obesity of condemned inmate Christopher Newton as one of the reasons prison officials had difficulty accessing his veins before his execution .
Newton was 6 feet tall and weighed 265 pounds .
Two years ago , convicted killer Jeffrey Lundgren was put to death after a federal appeals court rejected his claim that he was at greater risk of experiencing pain and suffering because he was overweight and diabetic .
Thanks to the best wireless security cameras building a home security system has never been easier , here are the best options you should look at .

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) smiles before his meeting with Israel 's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ( not pictured ) in Jerusalem July 23 , 2008 .
Obama pledged staunch support for Israel on Wednesday in Jerusalem , describing the Jewish state as a miracle and holding only a low - profile meeting with Palestinian leaders .
REUTERS / Ronen Zvulun
SDEROT , Israel ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Wednesday a nuclear Iran would pose a “ grave threat ” and that the world must stop Tehran from obtaining an atomic weapon .
Obama told reporters during a visit to Israel that if elected , he would take “ no options off the table ” in dealing with the Iran issue and said tougher sanctions could be imposed .
“ A nuclear Iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , ” Obama told reporters after visiting the Israeli town of Sderot , which lies close to the border with the Hamas - run Gaza Strip .
He said the international community should immediately offer “ big sticks and big carrots ” to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear program .
The West suspects Iran wants to build atom bombs but the Islamic Republic says its aims are peaceful .
“ Iranians need to understand that whether it ’s the Bush administration or the Obama administration , this is a paramount concern to the United States , ” he said in Sderot , which has been hit by cross - border rockets fired by Gaza - based militants .
Israel says Iran provides funds and weapons to Hamas .
“ I think there are opportunities for us to mobilize a much more serious regime of sanctions on Iran , but also to offer them the possibility of improved relations to the international community if they stand down on these nuclear weapons . ”
While debate continues over the effects of post - traumatic stress disorder , a new study indicates traumatic events and PTSD symptoms may be followed in some cases by a size reduction in a part of the brain called the hippocampus .
Though most attention surrounding PTSD focuses on war veterans , the advance by Brigham Young University researchers involved a larger population at risk : abused children .
“ The size reduction in the hippocampus seems to occur sometime after the initial exposure to stress or trauma in childhood , strengthening the argument that it has something to do with PTSD itself or the stress exposure , ” said Dawson Hedges , a BYU neuroscientist and an author on the study .
The study appears in the August issue of the neuroscience journal Hippocampus , providing further evidence of a neurological component for this mental disorder .
“ Most people exposed to traumatic events do not develop PTSD , ” Hedges said .
“ However , those that do may show certain changes in their brains . ”
The hippocampus is involved with learning and memory .
More than a decade ago , neuroscientists saw the first signs that it could be smaller in some people with post - traumatic stress disorder .

Since then scientists have puzzled over which came first , the small hippocampus or the traumatic events leading to PTSD .
The question is not easily answered because brain scans are costly and usually only performed after the fact .
That ’s why Hedges and grad student Martin Woon combined analyses of two groups : abused children with PTSD and adults with PTSD stemming from childhood abuse .
The BYU researchers pooled data from 19 previously published studies where MRIs were obtained from people who had experienced childhood trauma .
“ The big question about which came first , much like the chicken and the egg , has persisted , ” said Woon , the lead author on the paper .
“ We found children ’s hippocampi were intact after the onset of abuse , but somehow there was shrinkage in the group that had reached adulthood . ”
The federal government reported 905,000 children were victims of abuse or neglect in 2006 .
That figure is considered lower than the actual total because it does not include unreported cases of abuse .
“ The prevalence of abuse in this country is staggering , ” Hedges said .
“ With what we have found , the effects of childhood abuse may have neurological ramifications well into adult life .
Boiling it down , people should be nice to their children . ”
The extent to which the lost brain matter affects brain functioning is still unknown .
Hedges plans to examine whether PTSD relates to learning and memory deficits in a follow - up study .
While Hedges sees the potential for intervention to lessen the consequences of PTSD , other priorities include prevention and early identification .
The accepted timeframe for the beginnings of life on Earth is now being questioned by a Curtin University of Technology led team of scientists , after finding a key indicator to the earliest life forms in diamonds from Jack Hills in Western Australia .
The 4.2 - billion - year - old diamonds found trapped inside the Jack Hills zircon crystals are the oldest - known samples of Earth ’s carbon .
The Curtin led team ’s discovery of very high concentrations of carbon 12 , or “ light carbon ” within these crystals is remarkable as it is a feature usually associated with organic life .
Dr Alexander Nemchin from Curtin ’s Department of Applied Geology and the project leader believes the latest research will revive debate on the early evolution of life on Earth .
“ We believe this find to be the oldest terrestrial light carbon reservoir discovered so far , ” Dr Nemchin said .
Evidence for ancient life stretches back in time to at least 3.5 billion years ago , in the form of single - celled organisms that did not require oxygen .
The discovery of light carbon in the Jack Hills crystals raises the question – did a simple life form exist on Earth 700 million years earlier than previously thought ?
“ We interpret the range of light carbon values observed in these inclusions as a unique chemical marker that opens up the possibility of biological activity during the period not long after the Earth ’s formation , ” Dr Nemchin said .
advertisement
The researchers report the composition of 22 diamond and graphite inclusions from 18 Jack Hills zircon grains in the journal Nature .
“ The discovery challenges our fundamental understanding of processes active in the early history of the Earth .
It suggests that life may well have appeared on Earth long before the period of heavy - meteorite bombardment believed by some to have initiated the emergence of life on Earth , ” Dr Nemchin said .
“ Alternatively , it requires some other process to create the light carbon values , which would then question the widely held assumption that light carbon means life . ”
The discovery will assist mankind in our understanding of the development of the planet and help us to better assess the conditions of the Earth up to 4.5 billion years ago .
Background
In 1983 , a Curtin project team discovered extremely old zircon crystals in a collection of rocks located between Meekathara and Carnarvon .
Twenty years later , the oldest diamonds were unexpectedly discovered in these rocks by many of the original team .
The recent paper in Nature is written by a team of people made up of Curtin University academic and Project Leader , Dr Alexander Nemchin , Martin Whitehouse from the Swedish Museum of Natural History , Martina Menneken and Dr Thorston Geisler a Masters student and her supervisor from the University of Munster ’s Institute of Mineralogy , and Professors Pidgeon and Wilde from Curtin University ’s Applied Geology Department , who originally identified the old zircons .
How to Ruin Six Books with a Single Comic Strip

Sadly , studies show that nearly 30 percent of health care workers do n’t comply .
I can understand why such measures are hard to enforce , because isolation precautions create a barrier between patients and their caregivers .
At times , patients in isolation reach out to shake or hold my hand before I ’ve put my gloves on .
Sometimes I allow myself to touch patients without gloves , partly because the separation makes me feel I am shunning them , as if the hospital were an ancient leper colony .
And isolation barriers can be dangerous for patients .
Two studies showed that doctors and nurses were half as likely to enter the rooms of or to examine patients on contact precautions .
One study has even shown that patients in isolation have significantly more preventable adverse events , get less care and are more dissatisfied with their treatment than other patients .
Unlike other treatment , contact isolation does not benefit the patient in isolation ; rather , it benefits other hospitalized patients and the community .
Our goal is to contain the spread of the resistant organism from one patient to another , through health care workers .
But family members , who are also subject to the same glove - and - gown requirements , are not nearly as likely to spread the organisms to other patients .
In fact , there are no formal , enforceable recommendations for family members .
In the end , I believe , it is contact precaution and prudent use of antibiotics  and not new antibiotics or advanced technologies  that will save us from multidrug - resistant organisms .
So the best I can do is to provide a long explanation to the patient and family , and hope they will comply , within reason .
This is exactly what I did .
“ Last night , ” I told my patient , “ the lab had called and said that your urine culture was showing a resistant organism .
To make sure the organism does not spread to other patients through health care workers , we need to have people wear gloves and gown . ”
But in this case , I also took some liberty with hospital policy ; after all , the isolation recommendations are murky when it comes to family members .
I said , “ It is O.K. for him to kiss you . ”
“ Now you can kiss me , ” my patient told her husband .
With me standing just a few feet away , he hesitated for a second .
And as his yellow gown draped over her and his green gloves held her shoulders , he gave her a long wedding kiss .
I felt like a yellow - gowned chaplain who had just remarried a couple .
Andrei brought up the idea of encoding the sharing of an object between threads in the type of the object .
After months of discussions we are still not sure how far we want to go with it .
One thing is for sure , letting the programmer mark objects for sharing can help the compiler prevent a lot of concurrency bugs .
One of the common concurrency errors is accidental sharing .
Some data structures are designed for multi- threaded access , e.g. , objects with synchronized methods ; and they usually work just fine ( except for deadlocks ) .
The problem is when a chunk of data that was not designed for sharing is accessed by multiple threads .
There is no easy way to detect this error since , in general , concurrency bugs are hard to reproduce .
The proposal is to make accidental sharing impossible .
This requires that all objects , by default , be thread local .
For instance , if you declare a global object and initialize it in one thread , another thread will see a different version of this object .
In most cases it will see a null pointer or an unitialized object handle , and you ’ll get an easy to reproduce null - reference error .
If you consciously want to share an object , you have to declare it “ shared ” .
This type modifier is transitive ( just like const and invariant in the D programming language ) , so you ca n’t have references to non-shared object inside a shared object .
It simply wo n’t compile .
A function may declare its ( reference ) parameter as “ shared ” , in which case the compiler wo n’t let you pass a non-shared object to it .
Conversely , if the parameter is declared as non-shared ( the default ) , no shared argument may be passed in its place .
There is a guarantee that it will be thread - local .
( See however “ unsharing ” . )
Let me discuss potential objections to this scheme .
The first is performance –not for shared objects , mind you , but for the non -shared ones .
Walter tells us that accessing a thread - local static variable adds between 1 to 3 instructions of overhead .
That seems quite reasonable .
Especially considering that in multi- threaded environment the use of global non-shared variables is rarely correct .
There is also a performance penalty when starting a new thread–all static variables it has access to have to be default - initialized , plus all module constructors have to be called .
This might amount to quite a bit .
We will recommend not to overuse global variables and module constructors .
The way to amortize this cost is to create thread pools .
What about invariant objects ( ones that are never modified ) ?
Those can be safely shared , so they must be allocated as not thread - local .
It is okay for a shared object to contain references to invariant objects .
Can a shared object be “ unshared ” ?
This is a tricky one .
There are situations when threads hand over objects to each other .
The object is only shared during the handover , but otherwise is accessed by one thread at a time .
The currently owning thread should be able to call regular library functions ( that do n’t expect sharing ) with such objects .
So we need some kind of share / unshare cast .
On the other hand , such cast creates a wormhole into accidental sharing .
There is an interesting SharC paper that discusses runtime techniques to make “ unsharing ” safe .
Safe casting from temporarily non-shared to shared is even more tricky .
I ’ll talk more about it in my next post .
Finally , there is an unexpected bonus from this scheme for the garbage collector .
We will be able to use a separate shared heap ( which will also store invariant objects ) , and separate per -thread heaps for non-shared objects .
Since there ca n’t be any references going from the shared / invariant heap to non-shared ones , per - thread garbage collection will be easy .
Only occasional collection of the shared heap would require the cooperation of all threads , and even that could be done without stopping the world .
On July 31 , I introduced H.R. 6690 , the “ Sound Dollar and Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ” .
It is vital that this bill become law .
The U.S. dollar affects every American citizen and every American business .
Our economy is totally dependent upon the dollar .
To have a stable economy , we must have a stable dollar .
Unfortunately , for many years we have not had a stable dollar .
Today , people are angry and afraid .
The crumbling , gyrating dollar has created an economic crisis .
I was a judge for 25 years .
I believe in law and order .
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land .
Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution provides that : “ The Congress shall have Power … To coin Money , regulate the Value thereof , and of foreign Coin , and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures … ”
So , what has Congress been doing about the dollar ?
Nothing .
Since 2001 , Congress has stood idly by while the dollar has lost almost 70 % of its value , whether measured against gold or retail gasoline .
When a currency begins to lose value , the effects show up first in the price of gold , followed quickly by other commodities , such as oil .
However , eventually the inflation works its way through the entire economy , raising prices across the board .
In the process , the hard - earned savings of Americans are devalued — or , the way I look at it , stolen .
Inflation creates turbulence in financial markets and provokes conflict between economic groups .
People become angry because they feel that they are being robbed .
They become afraid because they know that unchecked inflation can lead to economic collapse .
In 1913 , Congress delegated its power over money to the Federal Reserve .
Unfortunately , the Fed has been preoccupied with manipulating interest rates .
Since 2001 , the Fed has lowered its Fed Funds rate from 5.00 % to 1.00 % , raised it to 5.25 % and then lowered it to 2.00 % .
Meanwhile , the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 70 % .
Trying to regulate the value of the dollar by manipulating the Fed Funds rate makes no sense .
The Fed Funds rate is the price of one type of capital .
Because the Fed cannot supply capital ( real resources ) to the economy , it is not clear why it should be in the business of setting interest rates .
Logically , interest rates should be set by the market — by the supply and demand for capital .
Unlike capital , the amount of money in the economy should not be limited by anything physical .
It should be determined by the demand for money , which depends upon the transactions people want to do and how much money they want to hold .
What matters about money is not its quantity but its value .
In this , dollars are no different than foot rulers .
No one cares how many foot rulers there are in the world .
What matters is that each one is the length prescribed by the U.S. Bureau of Standards .
My bill directs the Federal Reserve to bring the price of gold down to $ 500 / oz and then to keep it there .
The Fed would do this by announcing that its Open Market Desk was prepared to sell government bonds and contract the monetary base until the price of gold falls to $ 500 / oz .
At last measure , the monetary base was about $ 872 billion .
In December , 2005 , which is the last time the price of gold was at $ 500 , it was $ 827 billion .
So , it is possible that the Fed might have to sell as much as $ 45 billion worth of bonds to implement the new policy .
Because this is only about 0.8 % of the total amount of bonds currently outstanding , this should not be a problem .
However , I believe that the demand for the newly - stable dollar will be so great that the Fed will actually have to expand the monetary base to keep the gold price from falling below $ 500 / oz .
Once the Fed implements its new directive from Congress , every dollar in the world will have the same market value as one five - hundredth of an ounce of gold .
From then on , the monetary base will expand and contract automatically in response to market demand .
Why gold ?
My bill defines the value of the dollar in terms of gold because the financial markets want , and the American people deserve , a dollar that is “ as good as gold ” .
Why $ 500 / oz ?
At $ 804 / oz , the current market price of gold reflects the expectation ( and fear ) of future inflation .
I believe that fixing the value of the dollar now in terms of gold at $ 500 / oz will stop the current inflation without causing deflation .
However , my bill also provides a powerful supply - side stimulus , in the form of first - year expensing of all capital investment , to ensure that economic growth accelerates at the same time that inflation is being stopped .
Bringing the dollar price of gold down to $ 500 will bring the price of gasoline down from its current $ 3.50 / gallon to less than $ 2.50 / gallon .
It will strengthen the dollar against foreign currencies .
Most important , it will prevent Americans ’ incomes and savings from being stolen by inflation .
My bill will not put America on the gold standard , like we had in the early part of the 20th Century .
Under the old gold standard , gold was money .
Limiting the supply of money to the supply of gold was a huge mistake .
It was the basic error that caused the Great Depression .
Under my bill , our money will be the same “ legal tender ” currency that we have now .
There will be no limit on the number of dollars except market demand .
The big difference will be that every dollar will always be worth the same as one five - hundredth of an ounce of gold .
When I became a Congressman , I took an oath to uphold the Constitution .
The Constitution commands Congress to regulate the value of our money .
My bill will do this .
This is why it is essential that it become law .
Representative Poe , a former judge , is a member of Congress serving the 2nd district of Texas .
BP operates the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which transports one per cent of the world 's oil needs , or one million barrels a day from Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean .
A spokesman played down the impact of the strike , pointing out that pumping was suspended last week because of a terrorist attack in Turkey .
There are still people alive in the United States who support the continued occupation of Iraq , and in many cases the same people are open to supporting an aggressive attack on Iran .
While they inhabit a very different worldview from my own , they are able to recognize basic facts if made aware of them .
If you should meet one of these war supporters , I would recommend making them aware of the two most jarring facts least likely to fit with their preconceptions .
One of these facts became known to a certain segment of the population in February 2006 , but remains unknown to most consumers of American news media .
The other fact was just revealed this month and is certain to remain equally unknown .
FACT # 1 Bush wanted to provoke Saddam Hussein into attacking Americans
On January 31 , 2003 , prior to the full - scale invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , President George W. Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the White House .
After their meeting , they spoke to the media and claimed not to have decided on war , to be working hard to achieve peace , and to be worried about the imminent threat from Iraq to the American people .
They claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to al Qaeda and -- Bush implied but avoided explicitly stating -- to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
They also claimed to already have UN authorization for launching an attack on Iraq .
Here 's the video .
Behind closed doors , however , other words were spoken .
Blair advisor David Manning took notes that day .
Here is what he wrote down .
It has never been challenged by Bush or Blair .
Bush proposed to Blair a number of possible ways in which they might be able to create an excuse to launch a war against Iraq .
One of Bush 's proposals was " flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in UN colours .
If Saddam fired on them , " Bush argued , " he would be in breach " of UN resolutions .
In other words , Bush wanted to falsely paint US planes with UN colors and try to get them shot at .
This is how he really thought about the horrible evil threat of Saddam Hussein : he wanted to provoke him .
Bush understood that the United Nations had not passed a resolution that would have legalized an attack on Iraq .
He told Blair that " the US would put its full weight behind efforts to get another resolution and would ' twist arms ' and ' even threaten ' .
But he had to say that if ultimately we failed , military action would follow anyway . ''
In other words , going to the United Nations was not actually an attempt to avoid war , but an attempt to gain legal cover for a war that would be launched regardless of whether that project succeeded .
Knowing this might open a few minds to the overwhelming evidence that each of the specific claims Bush and Cheney made about particular weapons was known by them at the time to be false .
FACT # 2 Cheney and Gang Want to Manufacture an Excuse to Attack Iran
Journalist Seymour Hersh reports that at a meeting this year in the Vice President 's office , soon after the incident in the Strait of Hormuz in which a U.S. carrier almost shot at a few small Iranian speedboats ...
" There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war .
The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up .
Might cost some lives .
And it was rejected because you ca n’t have Americans killing Americans .
That ’s the kind of — that ’s the level of stuff we ’re talking about .
Provocation .
But that was rejected . "
Here 's video of Hersh .
Now , that idea may have been rejected , but which ideas were not rejected ?
Some pretty bad ones according to Scott Ritter 's recent report on what the United States is already doing in Iran .
So , both Bush and Cheney ( or at least the people Cheney meets with ) treat wars not as last resorts but as desired outcomes of closed - door plotting and scheming of crazy keystone cops scenarios that would be laughable if not so potentially deadly .
And these two facts reveal a whole different perspective on the motivations of the people controlling the largest imperial military force the world has ever known .

Russia : Poland risks attack due to U.S. missiles Associated Press
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This WARSAW , Poland -
An agreement that will allow the United States to install a missile defense battery in Poland exposes the ex-communist nation to an attack , a Russian general said Friday .
Poland and the United States struck a deal on Thursday to deepen military ties and place a missile interceptor base in Poland .
Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of the Russian general staff told reporters Friday that the agreement exacerbates U.S. - Russian relations that are already tense because of fighting between Georgian and Russian forces .
He said the deal cannot go unpunished .
And in the strongest threat Russia has issued in reaction to plans to put elements of a missile defense system in former Soviet satellite nations , the Interfax news agency quoted Nogovitsyn as saying Poland was risking attack .
 Poland , by deploying ( the system ) is exposing itself to a strike  100 percent ,  Interfax quoted Nogovitsyn as saying .
Moscow had previously threatened to redirect missiles toward Poland if the country agreed to host elements of the missile shield .
Washington says the planned system , which is not yet operational , is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from possible attacks by missile - armed rogue states  like Iran .
The Kremlin , however , feels it is aimed at weakening Russias missile force .
' Mutual commitment '
On Thursday , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk  speaking in an interview televised on news channel TVN24  said the United States had agreed to help augment Poland 's defenses with Patriot missiles in exchange for placing 10 missile defense interceptors in the Eastern European country .
Tusk said the deal includes a " mutual commitment " between the two nations to come to each other 's assistance " in case of trouble . "
The clause appeared to be a reference to potential challenges from Russia .
The recent Russian military incursion into Georgia , along with its bombing of Georgian military outposts and airfields , has rattled former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe .
Poland said the conflict in Georgia underlined Poland 's need for U.S. military assistance if it were to cooperate on the U.S. missile defense shield .
Czech agreement
The United States has also reached an agreement with the Czech government to place a radar component of the shield in that country .
That deal still needs approval from Czech parliament .
The Polish premier said Thursday 's agreement for the countries to come to one another 's defense was " a step toward real security for Poland , " as it would take too long for NATO to respond if Poland were threatened .
It would take " days , weeks to start that machinery , " Tusk said .
" It is not a good situation when rescue comes to dead people .
We must ensure our security from the very first hours of a possible ... conflict , " he said .
Tusk said the United States met the Polish demands for a permanent presence of Patriot missiles , which " will be able to effectively protect our territory . "
The deal was reached after more than 18 months of back - and - forth , often terse , negotiations between the two countries .
At the Royal Sonesta Hotel in downtown New Orleans later this month , the U.S. government is offering for lease , as part of a regularly scheduled sale , 18 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico that are open for oil and natural gas drilling .
The tracts could potentially yield as much as 400 million barrels of oil .
The lease auction is just one example of how much oil exploration is currently occurring in the Gulf of Mexico .
But the sale also reveals the limits of new drilling , as 400 million barrels is barely enough to meet the nation 's oil needs for 19 days .
Listening to the debate swirling in Washington over offshore oil , however , it would be easy to conclude that nothing much is happening in the Gulf of Mexico today .
GOP lawmakers , engaging in some old - fashioned political thea - ter during the first part of Congress 's August recess , occupied the dimmed Capitol to call for an end to the congressional moratorium on opening up new coastal areas to drilling and to decry Democratic opposition to the idea .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain has been trumpeting the cause almost daily on the campaign trail .
And even presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama , as part of his new energy plan , has modified his earlier opposition to expanded drilling .
Their motivation is simple .
Two thirds of Americans say they favor more drilling , mainly out of hope that gas prices will fall as a result .
But in reality , the country 's oil situation is far more complex and dynamic than the Washington debate lets on .
New drilling activities , either planned or already underway , are being largely overlooked .
At the same time , there are major obstacles to boosting production in a timely and sizable manner , particularly shortages of complex drilling equipment .
Perhaps most important , the Department of Energy estimates that , even if Congress removed all restrictions on offshore drilling , the impact on global oil prices would be " insignificant . "
Bidding war .
Today , the Gulf of Mexico , which produces more than a quarter of the country 's domestic crude oil , is actually in the midst of a resurgence .
New technology is allowing companies to push farther into deeper water , and oil production there is up .
A bidding war for rights to millions of acres in the Gulf is quietly building .
In 2007 , the number of leases issued to oil companies there jumped by about 25 percent , and the average bid price for a single tract has soared this year by 50 percent to nearly $ 6 million , according to GOMExplorer , which gathers data on the Gulf 's oil and gas industry .
This is partly a matter of timing .
Earlier this decade , many oil companies let leases idle because the price of oil was too low to make a profit or they were pursuing other projects .
Some unused leases terminate after 10 years , and in the past two years , many expired leases became available again .
Another factor is the expansion of deep - water drilling , which has become more profitable with new technology and rising oil prices .
A government report , released in May , found that 72 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 came from deep - water drilling , and the number of deep - water projects has doubled since 2002 .
Despite all this activity , oil experts say the fruits of these projects wo n't come close to reversing the downward spiral in U.S. oil production .
Fields have aged , and many reserves have been depleted .
These trends have prompted oil executives to push for opening up more land .
" What you have is a scarcity of resources , " says Dory Stiles , investor relations manager for Murphy Oil Corp. , an oil and gas exploration firm .
" Companies are looking for more opportunities to explore . "
For a while now we have been close to being able to release a playable demo and I ’ve been itching to get something online that shows the gameplay coming together since its really fun to play Franky here in the studio and videos do n’t cut it anymore for an open , interactive project .

If a Millimeter Were a Year / Light - Year
Various intuitive methods have been used to present cosmological distances , or cosmological and geological time .
Carl Sagan's " cosmic year " was one way :
We take the entire history of the universe to consist of one year , which leaves all of human history to some fraction of the last second .
The following table does this a different way .
If a millimeter is taken to represent a light - year , and if the Hubble Constant is 50 km/s / MPC , making the Hubble Time 19.5 billion years ( Gy ) , the entire universe would fit on the surface of the earth : the semi-circumference of a great circle , started at Los Angeles , is 20,002 km , or 20 billion millimeters .
Similarly , if a millimeter is taken to represent a year , the history of the universe fits on the surface of the earth , the history of the earth reaches out to about Nome , Alaska or to Haiti , and recorded human history would not get outside the classroom that I use .
This device gives us a comprehensible scale to relate human history , even a single lifetime , to the age and size of the entire universe .
A millimeter is a small but familiar unit of distance .
As a year , it means that moving across the room gets out out of human history , down the street , outside the existence of homo sapiens , and not too far down the freeway to the Jurassic .
We can go all the way back to the beginning of the Paleozoic without leaving California .
As a light year , a millimeter gives us the entire Milky Way Galaxy on about the same scale as the Campus Center building at Valley College .
The Local Group is easily contained in the area of Sherman Oaks , while the Virgo Cluster is little more than the distance to Palmdale .
The closest bright quasar , 3C 273 , is then about as far away as Nashville , Tennessee .
The truly distant quasars are nearly as far as Mauritius .
A millimeter as a year enables us to relate the scale of our own lives ( a few inches ) to historical ( the room ) , anthropological ( across campus ) , geological ( down the road ) , and cosmological ( across the continent ) time .
A millimeter as a light year gives us a corresponding astronomical scale , but a light year as a unit of distance is really larger , in a sense , than a year as a unit of time .
Light takes a year to go a light year , but even travelling at the speed of sound , it would take us a million years to go the same distance .
Four millimeters as the distance to the closest star is good for a map of the galaxy , but it gives us no sense of how much further that is than the distance from the earth to the moon , the sun , or Jupiter .
If a millimeter were an astronomical unit , the mean distance from the earth to the sun , then the closest star ( Alpha Centauri , at 4.24 light years ) , would be 268 meters away ( across campus ) .
There are 63,240 astronomical units to a light year .
Unfortunately this scale then puts even the Andromeda Galaxy ( 2.38 million light years ) at 150,512 kilometers away , almost halfway to the moon .
This is well outside of what we can intuitively relate to .
A millimeter as a light year thus keeps the universe with reach , even if we lose the finest detail .
All distances are calculated starting with the classroom , in the Campus Center building of Los Angeles Valley College , in Van Nuys , California .
To those unfamiliar with the Los Angeles area , distances starting at about 300 m will become mysterious with references to local streets and nearby communities and cities .
At about 200 km we start getting to major cities in California and beyond .
Entries that merely note distances and times on the geological or cosmological scale , are indented slightly .
Basic information on galaxies for this list is derived from the Nearby Galaxies Catalog , by R. Brent Tully , Cambridge University Press , 1988 .
This uses 75 km/s/ MPC for the Hubble Constant .
The distances of the most distant galaxies and quasars that follow have been calculated on the basis of a Hubble Constant of 50 km/s/ MPC .
However , the distances for many nearer galaxies have not yet been recalculated from Tully 's Constant of 75 .
Such distances are therefore liable to be too small by up to several million light - years .
Some duplicate entries occur , so the differences can be compared .
Although it is not important for the purpose of this demonstration , this inconsistency should be kept in mind ; and the following figures should not be used as an independent source for galactic distances .
I must say that I prefer 50 km/s/ MPC for this exercise , since it makes the universe fill the surface of the earth so neatly .
However , estimates of Hubble Constant have been growing steadily larger since the 70's .
I am informed by astronomers at UCLA that their best estimate for the Constant now is 71 km/s/MPC .
If it is as large as 75 km/s / MPC , then the Hubble Radius is only as far as 13040 km , which on this chart gets us as far as the open universes -- the distance to Chad or St. Helena .
Within the galaxy , the best source found was The Guide to the Galaxy , by Nigel Henbest and Heather Couper , Cambridge University Press , 1994 .
It is hard to keep track of where all the stellar and deep space distances came from , but the Sky Catalogue 2000.0 , Vols. 1 & 2 , edited by Alan Hirshfeld and Roger W. Sinnott , Sky Publishing Corporation and Cambridge University Press , 1982 , was used extensively .
Some Quasar distances were just plucked out of Sky & Telescope at different times , often as they were discovered .
Most of the terrestrial distances listed were calculated with a program called " BEARINGS , " 1982 , 1986 , Zephyr Services , 1900 Murray Ave. , Pittsburgh , PA 15217 .
Many other distances in the United States , especially the local ones , were determined by using the CD - ROM " MapExpert , " Version 2.0 for Windows , 1993 , DeLorme Mapping , Lower Main Street , P.O. Box 298 , Freeport , Maine 04032 .
Sometimes different results for the distances were obtained , since measuring the distance to a city or a country depends on where you pick to measure to .
So occasionally alternate distances are given .

Ford is really throwing down the guantlet by showing how dedicated it is to the new EcoDriving initiative we talked about the other day .
I really liked it because it validates a lot of what we ’re trying to do on the forums in terms of improving fuel economy on an individual level , but also showed that automakers were willing to commit ( at least in name ) to supporting fuel efficient driving .
However , it seems
Ford has really stepped up to the plate by offering ecodriving lessons over the course of several days to see how effective it really is .
Ford takes on ecodriving
Recently , Ford and a group called Pro Formance decided to take on ecodriving in the form of a 4 - day long seminar with 48 different drivers taking part .
Using the ecodriving tips taught by Pro Formance , the participants increased their fuel economy between 6 - 50 % , with and average increase of 24 % .
With the gas crunch hitting people hard , it ’s good to see a company like Ford stepping up and showing consumers that there ’s more than just air up your tires and cleaning out the trunk .
Here ’s their take on ecodriving :
â€ œBy working with Pro Formance to conduct validation testing , Ford is proving that eco-driving techniques are teachable and work across a broad spectrum of vehicles and drivers , â€ said Drew DeGrassi , president and CEO of Pro Formance Group .
â€ œItâ€™s a great initiative for Ford to lead in this country .
Itâ€™s not the end - all solution for America to obtain energy independence , but it is an important part of it.â€ 
I would love to see what the training program is like , but for the rest of us Ford give us 10 ecodriving tips .
Sure , they pale in comparison to EcoModder ’s ecodriving tips list , but most drivers are n’t interested in getting really involved , and Ford ’s hands - on approach is a good way to get results without asking too much of people .
Evidently they have been doing this since the 1990s in Germany , where gas mileage has been an issue for longer than it has in the US .
Hopefully , this will encourage other manufacturers to bring their most efficient vehicles and programs to a ready - and - willing US market .

President Bush at the White House
NEW YORK – Two new directives signed by President Bush establish sweeping authority for federal executive departments and agencies to establish a coordinated " framework " to collect and retain biometric data on U.S. citizens identified as " known and suspected terrorists , " without requiring public or congressional disclosure of the procedures .
Although the directives run over 1,700 words in length , Congress is not mentioned once , nor is there any specification of how the coordinated " framework " will be disclosed to the public .
WND contacted the White House press office for comment but received no return call .
The directives also do not specify any procedures for citizens to challenge their inclusion in the biometric database or any resulting consequences , such as restricted travel or additional government surveillance .

Biometric technologies use electronic means to capture individual - specific data on physical characteristics , including fingerprints , eye retina scanning , face recognition mapping and body imaging .
The contextual data that accompanies biometric data includes information on date and place of birth , citizenship , current address and address history , current employment and employment history , current phone numbers and phone number history , use of government services and tax filings .
Other contextual data may include bank account and credit card histories , plus criminal database records on a local , state and federal level .
The database also could include legal judgments or other public records documenting involvement in legal disputes , child custody records and marriage or divorce records .
The new orders , issued Thursday , are identified as National Security Presidential Directive 59 , or NSPD 59 , and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 , or HSPD 24 , and titled " Biometrics for Identification and Screening to Enhance National Security . "
They instruct federal executive departments and agencies to use " mutually compatible methods and procedures in the collection , storage , use , analysis and sharing of biometric and associated biometric and contextual information " of individuals considered a national security risk .
In similar language , the presidential directives repeatedly stress that the coordinated data collection and storage procedures mandated across a wide range of federal bureaucratic structures will respect information privacy and other legal rights under United States law .
The directives , however , do not require the federal agencies collecting , sharing and storing biometric information on citizens to disclose to the American people or Congress their criteria for identifying targeted individuals or their data procedures .
The directives require the attorney general to provide legal policy guidance in coordination with the secretaries of state , defense , homeland security and the director of national intelligence , without reporting to Congress or the American people .
The directives also require the attorney general and the agency heads to " develop and implement mutually compatible guidelines for each respective agency for the collection , storage , use , analysis , and sharing of biometric and associated biographic and contextual information , to the fullest extent practicable , lawful , and necessary to protect national security . "
The attorney general is given one year to implement the directives and report to the president through the assistant to the president for national security affairs , a position currently held by Stephen J. Hadley , and to the assistant to the president for homeland security and counter - terrorism , currently Frances Townsend .
WND previously reported President Bush signed NSPD - 51 and HSPD - 20 on May 9 , 2007 , allowing the president to declare a " national emergency " and take over the direction of all federal state , local , territorial and tribal governments , as well as private sector organizations , to continue functioning under the president 's directives , without specifically requiring the approval of Congress .

As an Israeli ambassador , Tsuriel Raphael was accomplished at putting a gloss on delicate subjects , be it Tel Aviv 's nuclear programme , the treatment of Palestinians or the invasion of Lebanon .
When San Salvador police discovered him in his official embassy residence yard in the capital San Salvador , however , smooth talk was not really an option .
For starters there was the gag and the rubber ball in his mouth .
There was also the matter of being drunk .
And naked .
And bound .
And surrounded by sex toys .
Once he was untied and the gag and ball were removed Mr Raphael identified himself as the ambassador but for perhaps the first time in his diplomatic career , this was a crisis he could not explain away .
" The ministry sees his behaviour as unbecoming of a diplomat , " Zehavit Ben-Hillel , an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman , said yesterday .
It was , she added , an unprecedented embarrassment .
Mr Raphael was recalled home two weeks ago when the ministry first learned of the incident but the news became public only yesterday , when reports surfaced in the Israeli media .
" He is going to remain in Israel , " said the spokeswoman .
The ambassador did not break any law so for the Salvadorean police the case is closed .
The Israeli government must wish it could say the same ; the incident raises questions not just about Mr Raphael but about the foreign ministry 's system of appointments .
Before being sent to El Salvador six months ago , the veteran diplomat had served in several other countries , including the US , and as director of the Israel Information Centre in Jerusalem .
He was a polished media performer and gave talks on Middle East geopolitics to thinktanks , universities and lobby groups .
However , his adventure in San Salvador revived last year 's criticism from a public service watchdog that the ministry lacked transparency in recruitment and promotion procedures .
It ’s a rare day when finance officials , leftist intellectuals and ordinary salespeople can agree on something .
But the economic meltdown that wrought its wrath from Rome to Madrid to Berlin this week brought Europeans together in a harsh chorus of condemnation of the excess and disarray on Wall Street .
The finance minister of Italy ’s conservative and pro-U.S. government warned of nothing less than a systemic breakdown .
Giulio Tremonti excoriated the “ voracious selfishness ” of speculators and “ stupid sluggishness ” of regulators .
And he singled out Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve , with startling scorn .
“ Greenspan was considered a master , ” Tremonti declared .
“ Now we must ask ourselves whether he is not , after [ Osama ] bin Laden , the man who hurt America the most .
. . .
It is clear that what is happening is a disease .
It is not the failure of a bank , but the failure of a system .
Until a few days ago , very few were willing to realize the intensity and the dramatic nature of the crisis . ”
In an interview Thursday in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera , Tremonti drew a comparison to corruption - ridden Albania in 1997 , when a nationwide pyramid scheme cost hundreds of thousands of people their savings and ignited anarchic civil conflict .

“ The system is collapsing , exactly like the Albanian pyramids collapsed , ” Tremonti said .
“ The idea is gaining ground that the way out of the crisis is mainly with large public investments .
. . .
The return of rules is accompanied by a return of the public sector . ”
On the other end of the political spectrum , among leftists who have long predicted calamity for what they call the “ savage neoliberal capitalism ” of Wall Street , there were gleeful allusions to the stock market crash of 1929 .
“ Between the dread of a world in the midst of collapsing and the shiver of pleasure that finally something serious is happening to the kingdom of liberalism , how to orient oneself ? ” Eric Aeschimann wrote Thursday in the newspaper Liberation , a voice of French intellectuals whose disdain for capitalism persists in the 21st century .
Expressing nostalgia for “ the good old days when bankers jumped out of windows , ” Aeschimann condemned as “ extortion ” the rescue of U.S. corporate giants by the very state that free - marketeers resent .

But fear accompanied gloating .
The crisis threatens to worsen woes -- inflation , unemployment , weak growth -- of regional powerhouses including Britain , Spain and Italy .
Joaquin Almunia , an ideologically moderate Spanish Socialist who is the European Union ’s economic commissioner , offered a simple analysis .
“ It has been a problem of greed , ” he told El Pais newspaper .
“ In Europe it ca n’t be said that we did nothing , European banks bought toxic products .
. . .
Nobody knows when this will end . ”
Anxiety was acute here in London .
Britain ’s FTSE 100 stock index swung wildly this week , dropping about 8 % between Monday and Thursday , then rocketing nearly 9 % on Friday .
Among the European economies , it is Britain ’s that most resembles America ’s in its vulnerability .
The big news of the week drove that home : an announced $ 22 - billion rescue - takeover of the wobbling HBOS bank by Lloyd ’s TSB .

In ordinary times , regulators would have opposed the merger of the giants as anti-competitive .
But beleaguered Prime Minister Gordon Brown , whose economic expertise is one of the last arrows in his political quiver , pushed for the deal .
“ The financial tsunami that has engulfed Wall Street since the weekend hit these shores yesterday , ” the Daily Telegraph declared in an editorial Thursday .
“ It swept away the country ’s biggest mortgage provider -- and with it , much of the [ financial sector ’s ] regulatory machinery .
. . .
The government has prevented a banking collapse that would have had unimaginable consequences for the economy . ”
But a more optimistic school of thought saw the week ’s events as an inevitable period of reconfiguration from which the markets -- and U.S. economic dominance -- will emerge reasonably unscathed .
This analysis gained ground with the strong recovery of European markets Friday .

In addition to the FTSE , France ’s CAC 40 rose more than 9 % and Russia ’s RTS index jumped 22 % after trading resumed after a two - day suspension .
“ This time next year we ’ll be seeing things back to normal , ” said Eamonn Butler , director of the Adam Smith Institute , a think tank here .
“ The last thing we need is to slap more rules on the system .
. . .
From time to time , businesses fail and the worst thing a government can do is to bail them out because that just passes the cost on to the taxpayer and creates a moral hazard . ”
The spectacle across the ocean has left a lasting impression on many Europeans .
Hanna Evers of Berlin , a cellphone retailer interviewed in the shopping district of Wilmersdorfer Street , said she was angry about the amount of money that had been “ burned ” in recent days .
“ And I ’m furious when I see the pictures of Americans who thought they were on the sunny side of life and now have lost their homes and have to live in their cars , ” Evers said .
“ I definitely do not feel sorry for the bankers who lost their jobs in the last couple of days .
I ca n’t believe that a country like the U.S.A. could have been so careless on a money issue ! ”

“ I was taught that the U.S.A. is the motherland of moneymaking , ” she added .
“ And now all I can see is a herd of headless chickens running around on Wall Street . ”

No Associated Press content was harmed in the writing of this post
Over the weekend I watched a clip of Real Time with Bill Maher and was astonished by a comment from Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund ( transcript below ) .
The panel was discussing Sarah Palin 's apparent ignorance of the Bush Doctrine , and the subject turned to how knowledgeable Palin was in general .
Maher brings up the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ( Sarbox ) as an example .
Fund rejects even asking her about it , saying " Do you want to run a trivia contest or do you want to run a campaign ? "
This was a remarkable thing to say for several reasons .
First and foremost , Fund writes for one of the premier financial media outlets in the world !
Is n't legislation that puts noteworthy new regulations on business - itself a real novelty over the last generation - somewhere beyond Jeopardy territory ?
Furthermore , Sarbox is not just squarely in the wheelhouse of his supposed area of expertise ; it is one of the best known pieces of legislation in the past ten years .
I know I tend to be in the " political junkie " category , but I think a member of a major party ticket should know at least as much about major legislation as I do .
The same is true of the Bush Doctrine .
It has been much discussed in the last week ; the hastily developed party line is that it actually is some kind of fascinating , multifaceted , unknowable metaphysical construct .
( If true it would be the first evidence of foreign policy complexity from the Administration . )
But even before all the renewed attention , I think expecting a candidate to have at least an interested observer 's level of knowledge of it is reasonable .
To get a sense of roughly what kind of knowledge " reasonable observer " level implied , I decided to give myself an impromptu civics quiz .
Since Sarbox has not been in the news recently ( just like the Bush Doctrine had n't )
I challenged myself to give an extemporaneous explanation of it from only my existing understanding of it - no news reports , Googling , Wikipedia , etc .
Here 's what I came up with :
Sarbanes - Oxley is the law passed in the wake of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s .
Designed to tighten reporting requirements and insure accountability via CEO signatures on SEC filings , it was intended to prevent the kind of creative accounting that led to the meltdown of Enron , WorldCom and other high profile companies .
But John Fund and many others on the right are not engaging in these debates in good faith .
Maher even points that out later in the show , telling Fund to his face that he thinks he is lying because he is too smart to believe his own dissembling .
The dominant conservative philosophy of our time is a belief in a ruling class of elites .
In practice it prefers for citizens to be ignorant of the most basic elements of policy and nonparticipants in the process of governing .
On the heels of the different tactics I highlighted last week to keep voters from actually voting Fund 's comments was a revelation .
He represents those who have shaped our bellicose foreign policy and forcefully pushed for an unregulated , laissez faire economic state of nature .
They prefer undemocratic forms and seek to discourage the diffusion of knowledge .
They want for us to be incurious about disastrous policies or abdications of responsibility , to dismiss our most important policies as trivia .
They want for us to not ask questions , even when thousands of our fellow citizens are sent to die in a faraway land , or when the financial industry melts down as it has this week .
They want for us to not pay attention , or to not care .
They do n't want high information voters or low information voters .
They want no information , and no voting .
They resent our attempts to influence our nation 's direction .
They want to be left alone to shape the country as it best suits them , for us to take our lumps and theirs as well .
They want for us to not bother .
Bother .

BILL MAHER
Let 's ask Sarah Palin about Sarbanes - Oxley .
What would she say about that ?
" I shot one the other day .
It had horns . "
Do you think she knows what Sarbanes - Oxley is ?
JOHN FUND
Do you want to run a trivia contest or do you want to run a campaign ?
BM
Is that trivia ?
Wait a second .
When you 're running to live in the White House is it trivia ?
That 's what I mean - this bothers me .
This " I'm a snob because I want to judge the intelligence level of someone who seeks the White House " ?
That makes me a snob ?
This is not American Idol .
It 's not a beauty pageant , even though her answer sounded like a beauty pageant .
JF
I went back and watched the tapes from the primaries .
When something like Sarbanes - Oxley or the Bush Doctrine was introduced in those debates , they were given in context and the candidates were told what they were in reference to .
Because this is not something that you 're supposed to remember off the top of your head .
JANEANE GAROFALO
That is such unbelievable bullshit !
That 's the phrase Obama chief David Plouffe used this morning on a conference call with reporters in response to McCain 's repeated claims last night that his colleague and rival " does n't understand . "
" It 's kind of fitting that Sen. McCain did his debate prep in the high school gym in Oxford yesterday , because it was kind of a sophomoric approach , this litany of ' do not understand , ' " Plouffe said .
Speaking of the same , my able colleagues Kim Kingsley , Sara D'Angelo and Meagan Bond compiled some great video of this McCain tactic

From Raoul de Roussy de Sales 1939 article :
An Englishman may have doubts regarding the British Empire , a Frenchman may be discouraged concerning the future of France .
There are Germans who are not sure that they represent a superior race .
All of them , however , remain thoroughly English , French , or German in spite of everything .
The type of American who does not accept America as it is and has misgivings about itsuch as Henry James , Edith Wharton , T. S. Eliot , and some othersbelongs to a past generation .
Today one seldom meets an American skeptic , for the reason that nothing is more assuredly unAmerican than to entertain any doubt concerning the fact that somehow or other this country will come out all right .
There are many who will find such a statement too sweeping , and say , for instance , that President Roosevelt is destroying the national ideal , that he is leading the country to ruin , decadence , anarchy , and so forth .
But even those objectors are not skeptical about the future of their country .
Even they feel that faith in America is what makes them Americans .
All their irritation would be assuaged if Mr. Roosevelt were removed , all their confidence restored .
This kind of skepticism is skin - deep .
It does not affect the soul of Americanism .
This faith , like all faiths , does not engender a passive attitude towards the rest of the world .
Americans are tolerant to all creeds and to all convictions , but few people express their distrust and indignation with more vigor whenever some of their beliefs are offended .
Few people are more conscious that ideas may be more destructive than guns .
And rightly so , because if any unorthodox creed really implanted itself in Americaif the day came when an American citizen could really feel that his country was not following the right course and that a change was duethe political disunion thus produced would have unforetold consequences .
The one serious crisis of this kind that America has known , the Civil War , showed the frightful results of a real political conflict .
It nearly made two nations out of one .
But this experiment in dissension seems to have served as a lasting lesson .
It is difficult to believe that it would be repeated .
Unity on the fundamental principles of politics is indispensable to the life of this country .
The presence of even a small minority who would question the validity of Americanism would attack at the very core the concept of American nationality itself .
Projects on which the boss applied no schedule pressure whatsoever ( " Just wake me up when you 're done . " ) had the highest productivity of all .
Of course , none of this proves that Parkinson 's Law does n't apply to development workers .
But does n't it make you wonder ?
The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child :
If your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent , then it can help .
If you do it all the time , it 's just a sign that you 've got troubles of your own .
Right now the Olympics are in full swing , with athletes sacrificing body and mind in hopes of winning highly collectible medals .

squid jerky presents this stunning highlight from the " Douchebag Games "
It s quite a week for news about cops smelling pot .
The Washington State Supreme Court ruled this morning that an officer was unjustified when he arrested a car passenger after smelling marijuana .
On behalf of the unanimous court , Justice Charles W. Johnson wrote :
Each individual possesses the right to privacy , meaning that person has the right to be left alone by police unless there is probable cause based on objective facts that the person is committing a crime .
This probable cause requirement is derived from the language of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which provides , “ [t ] he right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause … . ”
Our state constitution similarly protects our right to privacy in article I , section 7 , stating , “ [ n ] o person shall be disturbed in his private affairs , or his home invaded , without authority of law . ”
We hold that the smell of marijuana in the general area where an individual is located is insufficient , without more , to support probable cause for arrest .

Geoscientists have long presumed that , like today , the tropics remained warm throughout Earth 's last major glaciation 300 million years ago .
New evidence , however , indicates that cold temperatures in fact episodically gripped these equatorial latitudes at that time .
Geologist Gerilyn Soreghan of Oklahoma University found evidence for this conclusion in the preservation of an ancient glacial landscape in the Rocky Mountains of western Colorado .
Three hundred million years ago , the region was part of the tropics .
The continents then were assembled into the supercontinent Pangaea .
Soreghan and colleagues published their results in the August 2008 , issue of the journal Geology .
Climate model simulations are unable to replicate such cold tropical conditions for this time period , said Soreghan .
" We are left with the prospect that what has been termed our ' best - known ' analogue to Earth 's modern glaciation is in fact poorly known . "
" This study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in Earth 's ' deep time ' geologic record millions of years ago , " said H. Richard Lane , program director in NSF 's Division of Earth Sciences , which funded the research .
" These kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change . "
As a result of the close proximity of the ancient tropical glaciers to the sea , the toes of the glaciers were likely less than 500 meters above sea level - - much lower than the tropical glaciers of Earth 's recent glacial times .
" The Late Paleozoic tropical climate was not buffered against cold from the high latitudes , as everyone had thought , " said Soreghan .
" The evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time , even in tropical latitudes .
This calls into question traditional assumptions of long - lasting equatorial warmth in the Late Paleozoic , and raises the possibility of large - scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time . "

In the world of corruption , not - so - nice people , and evil empires , its heartwarming to hear stories of friendship and love that exists in the animal kingdom .
Shirley , an Asian elephant , was adopted by a small Louisiana Zoo from a Circus when she was 30 .
After 22 years of care at the Zoo , with no contact with any other elephants , the Zoo decided to let her go to a nearby elephant sanctuary so she can socialize with other elephants .
The tearful goodbye between the trainer and Shirley tugs at your heartstrings .
But even more so , Shirley reunites with an old elephant friend , Jenny .
Almost 23 years prior , Shirley and another elephant , Jenny , had worked together for only a few weeks in the circus and Shirley had been like a surrogate mother to the then baby Jenny .
In their reunion at the sanctuary , its apparent they remember each other and their bond is reestablished .
Sadly , a 10 years later , Jenny became ill and passed :
When she grew too weak to roam the hills and hollows , Jenny trundled toward a shady valley , found some soft , beaten - down underbrush , and lay down .
Shirley stood vigil night and day , using her trunk to help her friend to rise and even shift her weight .
Also by Jenny ’s side were two other sanctuary friends , Tarra and Bunny .
At one point , the four spent three hours vocalizing and trumpeting — the vibrations felt by every living being in the sanctuary .
In all her years of working with animals , Buckley had never seen anything like this joy - filled celebration of Jenny ’s life .
The next day , October 17 , 2006 , the great animals continued their vocalizing .
There was nothing urgent in their song .
It was soothing .
Still , it was too much for Shirley .
About to lose Jenny for the second time , she retreated to a nearby hill to grieve alone .
In her absence , Bunny and Tarra comforted Jenny by stroking her .
They rested like that for some time , Bunny calmly answering each of Jenny ’s rumbles with a crescendo trumpet , while Tarra accompanied the duo with high - pitched chirps .
That evening , at the age of 36 — young for an elephant — Jenny died .
Tarra and Bunny stayed at her side through the night .
But whereas Jenny ’s suffering had ended , Shirley ’s began .
Elephants wear their hearts on their trunks , as it were , so it was easy to tell that Shirley was not coping well with Jenny ’s death — her shoulders slumped , her eyes were half shut and her trunk dragged on the ground .
She was n’t eating or vocalizing .
She was depressed .
Bunny followed her to the hill , where the two stayed for days before finally returning to the barn .
There , a new arrival had made her presence felt .
Another circus outcast , Misty is a gregarious bundle of energy who literally jumps for joy .
Even Shirley could n’t ignore her raucous spinning and loud , jubilant trumpeting .
With her spirits restored , Shirley , the oldest and largest elephant at the sanctuary , began to eat and play , and even picked her trunk off the ground .
She was backwith the herd , where she belonged - Readers Digest
Shirley still lives happily at the sanctuary with her other surrogate elephant family members .
The future of Google search might look a lot like the current set up on sites like Reddit where users can submit , comment on , and vote for links they like .
A limited number of Google users have begun to see up and down arrows next to all links on a search result page , and a place to leave comments about a website that appears in said search results .
Of course , Google ’s current search results are based on a protected , private algorithm that somehow uses the number of incoming links , the relevancy of the pages linking to each other , and the organization of text and anchor text on the pages .
Specifics are n’t completely known , but SEOs are always picking away at anomalies and establishing patterns that help explain the visible search results .
I ’ve had my own first run-in with an obvious penalty that knocks me down relative to what had been ever - increasing positions , so obviously there is a little more subtlety than just counting everything up and taking the highest pagerank .
A lot of this business could simply “ go away ” if Google moves forward with a new version of search that has been tested and tweaked for the last few years :
The Industry Standard is reporting that “ Google is considering allowing users of its search engine to tinker with query results by re-ranking them and commenting on them ”
For now , Google is only trying this out with a few people ’s accounts , and even then each search result profile is stored as a personalized result .
But obviously , this opens up a bigger arena of whats possible from letting users edit search results .
Google is almost certainly learning how sites like Digg and Reddit use surfers decide on how to rank links in a democratic fashion .
As long as Google was able to reign in abuses of people using bots to automatically vote links to the top of the search results , a democratic system of web rankings could be beneficially as a means of knocking out made for advertising and other spammy websites that do n’t deliver what they claim to promise .
So what becomes of the backlink - building school of SEO workers ?
Perhaps , back to journalism , photpgraphy , art , and programming school – because the new internet search version 2.0 would be ruled by the value of content first .
Of course , links will always be important even if its just for the direct traffic they bring in .
Yet we can already see that they do n’t carry quite what they used to in terms of SERPs and the adoption of this new democratic ranking technology will only further dilute their importance in gaining search engine traffic .
Here is what it looks like in action , courtesy of Justin Hileman ’s site .
Parts of B&B are set to be sold on to another bank by the Treasury Troubled bank Bradford & Bingley is to be nationalised , the BBC has learned .
Officials from the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) have been in talks with executives from the bank in a bid to secure its future .
BBC business editor Robert Peston says the Treasury will then speedily sell B&B 's 200 branches and its savings business to a bank or number of banks .
B&B told savers deposits were safe and Treasury minister Yvette Cooper said they would be " properly protected " .
Ms Cooper told the BBC One Politics
Show that negotiations were still ongoing , but the chancellor would make a statement before the markets opened on Monday .
" We 've been very clear that the priority is to make sure that depositors , that ordinary savers , are properly protected , but also that we can support the financial stability of the banking system as a whole . "
B&B 's share price plummeted to a record low last week .

Bank spokesman Tony McGarahan said : " We can assure customers that their deposits are safe with Bradford and Bingley . "
The British Bankers Association is unhappy at some aspects of the plan .
Association chief executive Angela Knight told BBC Five Live she was not happy the taxpayer was having to take on the liability of B&B as well as Northern Rock .
" The financial services industry underpins , not just the UK economy , but indeed all of us individually , and there can be times where authorities have to step in , " she said .
She said it was a " very great shame that it 's got to this place " .

But our business editor said B&B was getting " perilously close to a funding crisis ... there had to be a solution " .
Conservative leader David Cameron said nationalisation should be a last resort .
He told the BBC the Tories would not sign " blank cheques " for the taxpayer to bail out failing institutions .
But John McFall , chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee , told the BBC : " We have to make a decision - do we take it [ B & B ] into the state , or do we play Russian roulette with people 's jobs and homes ?
" I know what I 'd prefer . "
Loans nationalised B&B 's share price has plummeted and it has announced plans to cut 370 jobs due to a downturn in the mortgage market .
A year ago its share price was 300 pence , but has now sunk to 20 pence .

Why do n't they have the sense to nationalise the things that matter - Water , Electricity , Gas , Railways etc , etc

The bank will be nationalised using special legislation the Treasury put through when it took Northern Rock into public ownership earlier this year .
Possible buyers interested in acquiring parts of B&B could include Santander of Spain , HSBC and Barclays .
Santander , which already owns Abbey and Alliance & Leicester , has been looking at B &B for some time .
The nationalisation and break up of Bradford & Bingley will represent a momentous event in the history of British banking

Town reacts to bank news B &B 's £ 50bn of loans , including £ 41bn of home mortgages , will not be sold and will be nationalised on a long - term basis .
The mortgages may be given to the nationalised Northern Rock to manage .
" The Bradford and Bingley mortgage book is a lower quality book of mortgages , it is a worse asset than Northern Rock , " said Charlie Parker , of Citywire .
" It has experienced double the arrears rates of other lenders . "
The bank experienced significant withdrawals of cash from its branches and online bank on Saturday amid customer concerns about its situation .

He said there was a class of bank that had relied heavily on the mortgage market - Northern Rock , HBOS , and B&B - and which had now either been nationalised or taken over .
" The remaining banks have much broader bases , they are less vulnerable , " he added .
However , B&B 's shareholders and holders of its subordinated debt may lose out .
Alistair Milne , a banking expert at Cass Business School in London , said an independent adjudicator might be appointed to decide what the outcome for shareholders should be .
However , one year after Northern Rock collapsed small shareholders there are waiting to see if their shares are worth anything at all .
A team of accountants appointed by the Treasury is making calculations to determine what shareholders in the now - nationalised Rock should receive .
Rating downgraded
Our business editor says the nationalisation and break - up of B&B represents a momentous event in British banking .
We can assure customers that their deposits are safe with Bradford & Bingley
Tony McGarahan
Bradford & Bingley spokesman
He said : " It will mean that every building society that floated on the stock market in the wave of demutualisations of the past two decades will either have collapsed or been sold to a conventional bank . "
B&B was close to seeing a demand from depositors for the return of billions of pounds , which it would have been unable to find .
Credit rating agencies had been downgrading the rating of its covered bonds , a form of funding which involves packaging up mortgages for sale to investors .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Burning incense may create a sweet scent , but regularly inhaling the smoke could put people at risk of cancers of the respiratory tract , researchers reported Monday .

In a study of more than 61,000 ethnic Chinese living in Singapore who were followed for up to 12 years , the investigators found a link between heavy incense use and various respiratory cancers .
The findings are published in the medical journal Cancer .
Incense has been used for millennia in many cultures ’ religious and spiritual ceremonies .
In Asia , people commonly burn incense in their homes -- a practice that is becoming more popular in Western countries as well .
Incense is usually derived from fragrant plant materials , like tree bark , resins , roots , flowers and essential oils .
Past research has found that burning these materials can produce potentially cancer - causing substances , including benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons .
However , no studies until now had linked the practice of burning incense to an increased cancer risk over time , according to the researchers , led by Dr. Jeppe T. Friborg of the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen .
For their study , the researchers followed 61,320 Singapore Chinese men and women between the ages of 45 and 74 from the Hokkien or Cantonese dialect group .
All of the subjects were cancer - free at the outset .
Participants reported on their typical incense use , including how often they burned it in their homes and for how long -- only at night , for instance , or all day and night .
Over the next 12 years , 325 men and women developed cancer of the upper respiratory tract , such as nasal , oral or throat cancer .
Another 821 developed lung cancer .
The researchers found that incense use was associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract , with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer .
However , they observed no overall effect on lung cancer risk .
Those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma , which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body .
The risk was seen in smokers and nonsmokers .
Study participants who used incense in their homes all day or throughout the day and night were 80 percent more likely than non-users to develop squamous cell carcinoma of the entire respiratory tract .
The link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors , including cigarette smoking , diet and drinking habits .
“ This association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke , ” Friborg ’s team writes , “ and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense , these findings carry significant public health implications . ”
They say further studies are needed to see whether different types of incense are associated with different degrees of cancer risk .
In Singapore , the researchers note , most people burn long sticks or coils of incense that burn slowly over an extended period .

The younger of two brothers who survived a Christmas Day tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo has been sentenced to 16 months in state prison for violating his probation in a felony reckless driving case where he led police on a 140 mph chase through San Jose in April 2007 .
Paul Dhaliwal , 20 , was sentenced in December to 30 days in the Santa Clara County jail and three years of probation in that case , but three days after sentencing he was cited for marijuana possession when he was found with about 1.8 grams in his pocket while in the parking lot of a Milpitas hotel , court records show .
He was also arrested in March on suspicion of shoplifting video - game controllers at East Bay Target stores .
Dhaliwal was sentenced last week in Santa Clara County Superior Court to 16 months in prison for violating probation in the chase case , Deputy District Attorney Stuart Scott said .
Dhaliwal also pleaded guilty Wednesday to misdemeanor battery on a police officer , resisting arrest and public intoxication stemming from a drunken scuffle with San Jose police in September , Scott said .
Prosecutors sought additional jail time for Paul Dhaliwal in that case , but Judge Michele McKay McCoy ran his sentence concurrent with the 16 months he had already received for violating probation .
" We really thought it was egregious behavior and this guy really needed some penalty consistent with that behavior , " Scott said .
Dhaliwal 's attorney , Roger Hecht , could not be reached for comment .
Dhaliwal 's older brother , Kulbir Dhaliwal , 27 , who also survived the tiger attack and is charged in that September altercation with San Jose police , has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial on Monday .
The younger Dhaliwal may still face more prison time if convicted in a separate case in Alameda County , where he is accused of shoplifting video game equipment from three Target stores .
" What happened in Santa Clara County does not control what happens in the case here , " said Ann Diem , an Alameda County assistant district attorney .
Paul Dhaliwal faces three counts of commercial burglary and two counts of grand theft for allegedly stealing Nintendo Wii controllers and similar equipment , authorities said .
He is scheduled to be transferred to an Alameda County jail shortly and must deal with his case there before beginning his prison term , Scott said .
The sentencing comes as the two brothers are preparing the sue San Francisco and the zoo , saying they suffered serious injuries and emotional harm during the attack , which killed Paul Dhaliwal 's close friend Carlos Sousa Jr. , 17 , before police shot and killed the 243 - pound Siberian tiger .
The brothers also contend the zoo orchestrated a smear campaign against them .
Sousa 's family members are preparing to sue the city and the zoo as well , their attorney said .

Relatives of an Irishman killed by police in the US state of Oregon have said he was shot at least seven times .
Andrew James Hanlon 's brother - in - law said the 20 - year - old had two gunshot wounds to his left arm , three wounds to his abdomen , one on his thigh and one in the back of his shoulder .
Viewing the body ' offered some closure to the ongoing grieving process , but it was definitely very upsetting to both of us , ' said Nathan Heise , who is married to Mr Hanlon 's sister .
Melanie Heise said her brother had arrived in Oregon several months ago and stayed with her and her husband before moving out to live on his own .
She said it was at this point that she noticed he had psychological problems and had organised psychiatric treatment for him .
She added that people who had seen him before the shooting said he appeared fine .
Ms Heise said her brother was not the kind of individual to keep a gun .
While Mozilla is preparing to launch some radical changes to tab switching with tab thumbnails displayed when you press Ctrl +
Tab , Roi M. has already taken it a few steps further with five eye - pleasing views packaged in his FoxTab extension .
It provides five preview styles : circle , row , grid , wall , and stack , which resembles Vista ’s application switching style .
Since it is very resource demanding , FoxTab has options to set the size of the preview window from full screen to about one quarter .
You can also set the number of thumbnails and change the hotkey for tab switching .
The thumbnails are not of very high quality and I really miss an option to search the tabs by title , or even better by contents .
FoxTab is still an experimental extension in Mozilla Add-ons , so you will need an account there to install it .
You ’ve no doubt heard me rant against premature optimization in the past , but Eric Gunnerson points out another “ Premature ” action to be avoided , “ Premature Generalization ” .
His discussion centers around a very specific question of whether to use private properties to access private fields , or just allow access to the field .
Note this discussion pertains to fields that are not publicly accessible via property nor direct access .
The place you ’ll often see premature generalization is when inexperienced developers start applying Design Patterns everywhere .
If you need to instantiate a factory , implement an adapter class and use a bridge to the toilet just to take a dump , then you probably live with a developer with a premature generalization problem .
Like optimization , generalization is good when it is applied judiciously in the right places .
With optimization , one should measure measure measure before applying optimizations .
With generalization , I typically suggest that a developer must feel the pain first before generalizing .
That simply means that the lack of generalization is starting to cause more work than it saves .
In my experience , this often boils down to the rule of threes .
If you have to implement something a third time , refactor it .
For example , suppose you have an import tool for some system and as far as you know , you ’ll only have to support one import client .
By all means write an importer specific to that client .
Now your boss tells you to implement an importer for another client .
Write that one specific to that client .
Once again your boss tells you to implement an importer for yet another client .
At this point a pattern has been established .
Your boss is a liar and you ’ll probably need to implement importers for many clients .
Now is the time to refactor the code and generalize the concept of importers .
Maybe create a plug - in model or an Import Provider .

My old friend is hopping mad these days , and I have to say it looks good on him .
I read the most recent to - and - fro while I was on vacation and have a few thoughts .
The first is that Joe may well have supported the Iraq war reluctantly on Tim Russert 's show five years ago , as Pete Wehner will not let him forget .
But I remember the period in question quite well and recall very vividly Joe 's prescient and passionate worries about the war - in particular a dinner we had in Provincetown around this time five years ago when he took me to task for my then - optimism and enthusiasm for the project .
Like all of us , he has been buffeted this way and that by events in Mesopotamia , but using his intellectual honesty as a bludgeon against him strikes me as cheap .
Joe is a patriot incensed by the glibness and callowness of so many Bushies who appear as indifferent to the immense costs of their war as to their own moral responsibility for its failures .
I share his frustration and anger .
Reading Charles Krauthammer accusing someone else of arrogance is really quite something .
But the latest attack on Joe is about Israel .
Was this war in Iraq , in the minds of Kristol , Krauthammer , Kagan , Libby , Pohoretz et al , really , fundamentally about Israel 's interests rather than America's ?
I have no idea what 's in the recesses of all these people 's minds and hearts , and merely take them at their word ( in a way they do n't with others , I might add ) that their stated and open obsession with the Israel question does not imply any preference for Israel 's interests over America 's as such .
But the real trouble with asking this question is that in the neocon mind , there is almost no area in which it is even possible to conceive of America 's interest being different from Israel's .
Moreover , for most of the past few years , the question has been largely moot .
Disarming Saddam Hussein , for example , was obviously in everyone 's interests , Israel 's and America's , and even his Sunni Arab neighbors ' and Iran's .
Trying to foster democracy in the Arab Middle East is likewise a good thing for any number of reasons , although not without short - term risks .
It therefore never occurred to me that the debate over the Iraq liberation was a case for the divided loyalties question because the case stood or fell independently of any concern with Israel - and most smart Israelis actually opposed the Iraq war in any case as absurdly utopian .
“ Happiness is a habit – cultivate it . ” ~ Elbert Hubbard
Happiness is one aspiration all people share .
No one wants to be sad and depressed .
We ’ve all seen people who are always happy – even amidst agonizing life trials .
I ’m not saying happy people do n’t feel grief , sorrow or sadness ; they just do n’t let it overtake their life .
The following are 21 things happy people make a habit of doing :
1. Appreciate Life
Be thankful that you woke up alive each morning .
Develop a childlike sense of wonder towards life .
Focus on the beauty of every living thing .
Make the most of each day .
Do n’t take anything for granted .
Do n’t sweat the small stuff .
2. Choose Friends Wisely
Surround yourself with happy , positive people who share your values and goals .
Friends that have the same ethics as you will encourage you to achieve your dreams .
They help you to feel good about yourself .
They are there to lend a helping hand when needed .
3. Be Considerate
Accept others for who they are as well as where they are in life .
Respect them for who they are .
Touch them with a kind and generous spirit .
Help when you are able , without trying to change the other person .
Try to brighten the day of everyone you come into contact with .
4. Learn Continuously
Keep up to date with the latest news regarding your career and hobbies .
Try new and daring things that has sparked your interest – such as dancing , skiing , surfing or sky - diving .
5. Creative Problem Solving
Do n’t wallow in self - pity .
As soon as you face a challenge get busy finding a solution .
Do n’t let the set backs affect your mood , instead see each new obstacle you face as an opportunity to make a positive change .
Learn to trust your gut instincts – it ’s almost always right .
6. Do What They Love
Some statistics show that 80{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of people dislike their jobs !
No wonder there ’s so many unhappy people running around .
We spend a great deal of our life working .
Choose a career that you enjoy – the extra money of a job you detest is n’t worth it .
Make time to enjoy your hobbies and pursue special interests .
7. Enjoy Life
Take the time to see the beauty around you .
There ’s more to life than work .
Take time to smell the roses , watch a sunset or sunrise with a loved one , take a walk along the seashore , hike in the woods etc .
Learn to live in the present moment and cherish it .
Do n’t live in the past or the future .
8. Laugh
Do n’t take yourself – or life to seriously .
You can find humor in just about any situation .
Laugh at yourself – no one ’s perfect .
When appropriate laugh and make light of the circumstances .
( Naturally there are times that you should be serious as it would be improper to laugh . )
9. Forgive
Holding a grudge will hurt no one but you .
Forgive others for your own peace of mind .
When you make a mistake – own up to it – learn from it – and FORGIVE yourself .
10 . Gratitude
Develop an attitude of gratitude .
Count your blessings ;
All of them – even the things that seem trivial .
Be grateful for your home , your work and most importantly your family and friends .
Take the time to tell them that you are happy they are in your life .

Be supportive .
12 . Keep Their Word
Honesty is the best policy .
Every action and decision you make should be based on honesty .
Be honest with yourself and with your loved ones .
13 . Meditate
Meditation gives your very active brain a rest .
When it ’s rested you will have more energy and function at a higher level .
Types of meditation include yoga , hypnosis , relaxation tapes , affirmations , visualization or just sitting in complete silence .
Find something you enjoy and make the time to practice daily .
14 . Mind Their Own Business
Concentrate on creating your life the way you want it .
Take care of you and your family .
Do n’t get overly concerned with what other people are doing or saying .

Everyone has a right to live their own life the way they want to – including you .
15 . Optimism
See the glass as half full .
Find the positive side of any given situation .
It ’s there – even though it may be hard to find .
Know that everything happens for a reason , even though you may never know what the reason is .
Steer clear of negative thoughts .
If a negative thought creeps in – replace it with a positive thought .
16 . Love Unconditionally
Accept others for who they are .
You do n’t put limitations on your love .
Even though you may not always like the actions of your loved ones – you continue to love them .
17 . Persistence
Never give up .
Face each new challenge with the attitude that it will bring you one step closer to your goal .
You will never fail , as long as you never give up .
Focus on what you want , learn the required skills , make a plan to succeed and take action .
We are always happiest while pursuing something of value to us .
18 . Be Proactive
Accept what can not be changed .
Happy people do n’t waste energy on circumstances beyond their control .
Accept your limitations as a human being .
Determine how you can take control by creating the outcome you desire – rather than waiting to respond .
19 . Self Care
Take care of your mind , body and health .
Get regular medical check ups .
Eat healthy and work out .
Get plenty of rest .
Drink lots of water .
Exercise your mind by continually energizing it with interesting and exciting challenges .
20 . Self Confidence
Do n’t try to be someone that you ’re not .
After all no one likes a phony .
Determine who you are in the inside – your own personal likes and dislikes .
Be confident in who you are .
Do the best you can and do n’t second guess yourself .
21 . Take Responsibility
Happy people know and understand that they are 100{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} responsible for their life .
They take responsibility for their moods , attitude , thoughts , feelings , actions and words .
They are the first to admit when they ’ve made a mistake .
Begin today by taking responsibility for your happiness .
Work on developing these habits as you own .
The more you incorporate the above habits into your daily lifestyle – the happier you will be .
Most of all : BE TRUE TO YOURSELF .

The University of Minnesota student who offered to sell his vote for president on eBay has been sentenced to 50 hours of community service .
The charge against 19 - year - old Max Sanders of Edina will be dismissed if he completes the service within six months , the Hennepin County attorney 's office said Tuesday .
Sanders was undecided in the upcoming election .
So for a minimum of $ 10 , he said he'd vote for whomever you liked , or , if you so chose , for no one at all .
On May 28 , he put his vote up for bid .
Sanders told investigators the posting was a joke , but that did n't stop the filing of a felony charge .
He declined to comment on his case .
His attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment .
Sanders was charged with bribery , treating and soliciting , a felony under an 1893 Minnesota law that makes it a crime to offer to buy or sell a vote .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Western nations and organizations Tuesday condemned Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , two breakaway regions in Georgia .
A Tskhinvali resident celebrates Russia 's recognition of South Ossetia 's independence .
" This is not an easy choice to make , but it represents the only possibility to save human lives , " Medvedev said Tuesday in a televised address .
He called on other countries to follow Russia 's lead , which comes in the wake of the Russian - Georgian conflict which erupted earlier this month .
U.S. President George W. Bush led the condemnation with a strongly worded statement said : " The United States condemns the decision by the Russian president to recognize as independent states the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . " .
Bush said Russia 's move was " inconsistent " with the French - brokered cease - fire agreement that ended the fighting and called on Russia to " reconsider this irresponsible decision . "
Bush added : " The territorial integrity and borders of Georgia must be respected , just as those of Russia or any other country .
Russia 's action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations . "
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the decision was " unjustifiable and unacceptable . "
" It will also not work .
It is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement , which Russia recently agreed ... [ it ] further inflames an already tense situation in the region , " Miliband said .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the decision was in " direct violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Georgia 's territorial integrity . "
The European Union also urged a political solutions to the tensions in Georgia .
Speaking to CNN's Matthew Chance , Medvedev said the move was in line with international law .
" It is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these [ U.N. ] provisions express their will to have an independent existence ... any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not , " the Russian president said .
Watch Medvedev defend recognizing the breakaway regions »
The stand - off has exacerbated already frayed relations between Russia and the West .

Moscow has been infuriated by U.S. plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe .
It said an agreement signed last week to base missiles in Poland would open that country up to an attack in the event of conflict .
Medvedev said : " The most important thing for us is that our American colleagues be pragmatic , that they defend the genuine interests of the American people , as opposed to defending made - up ideological schemes .
" If everything will be fine in that regard , I am convinced that we 'll be able to agree on a very broad range of issues .
We do n't want any complications , we do n't need another Cold War or its modern - day remake . "
He signed the order a day after it was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Russia 's parliament .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said it was " clear around the world that Russia is acting as an aggressor state . "

" My appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject Russia 's dangerous and irrational decision -- not only for Georgia 's sake -- but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order .
" In the days and weeks ahead we will work with the international community to prevent this decision from having any effect on the sovereignty of my country and from further undermining the international order . "
Western nations have expressed support for Georgia , which aspires to NATO and European Union membership , with the U.S. dispatching a major humanitarian aid mission .
South Ossetia and Abkhazia broke away from Georgia during civil wars in the 1990s .
Russia strengthened ties with them after the U.S. and much of Europe recognized the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo earlier this year , a move that Moscow had warned against .
Georgian troops attacked pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia on August 7 , triggering a Russian invasion of Georgia .
Russian tanks , troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia the following day , advancing into Georgian cities .
Each side offered conflicting figures on how many people died in the fighting .
The Bush administration has insisted that both Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain part of Georgia , a U.S. ally that is seeking NATO membership , and says resolving the disputes between the Georgian government and the regions " should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties .

“ It is hard for us , without being flippant , to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions . ”
— Joseph J. Cassano , a former A.I.G. executive , August 2007
Two weeks ago , the nation ’s most powerful regulators and bankers huddled in the Lower Manhattan fortress that is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , desperately trying to stave off disaster .
As the group , led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , pondered the collapse of one of America ’s oldest investment banks , Lehman Brothers , a more dangerous threat emerged : American International Group , the world ’s largest insurer , was teetering .
A.I.G. needed billions of dollars to right itself and had suddenly begged for help .
One of the Wall Street chief executives participating in the meeting was Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , Mr. Paulson ’s former firm .
Mr. Blankfein had particular reason for concern .

The same vitamins and supplements that mothers - to - be take to protect their kids from birth defects could predispose children and even grandchildren to asthma .
If mice studies are confirmed by studies in humans , expectant mums may need to strike a balance between amounts of supplements such as folate , which reduces the risk of spina bifida , and those that bring on asthma , says John Hollingsworth , a doctor who specialises in diseases of the respiratory system – pulmonology – at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina .
“ A little could be helpful and a lot could be harmful , ” he says .
He and his colleagues fed pregnant mice supplements including folate , vitamin B12 and zinc in doses roughly equivalent to those recommended for pregnant women .
These chemicals turn down the expression of certain genes and mark the DNA of a developing embryo so that the effect is passed from generation to generation , a process known as epigenetics .
Advertisement
Mice who ate the supplement - rich diet delivered pups with some signs of asthma .
Their lungs contained high levels of immune cells and proteins that predict asthma in humans compared with mice that ate a supplement - poor diet .
To future generations
When Hollingsworth ’s team bred these pups on a normal diet , their offspring still showed some signs of asthma – an indication of epigenetics in action .
Indeed in a genome - wide search for genes epigenetically marked for lowered expression in the first generation of mice pups , the researchers turned up several genes important for harnessing the immune system .
Mice completely lacking one such gene , called Runx3 , develop spontaneous asthma , and the researchers suspect epigenetically reduced expression of the gene could have the same effect .
“ It ’s a nice mouse model , but it ’s a mouse model , ” says Rachel Miller , an allergist and pulmonologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital .
She says that to prove that maternal supplements could predispose kids to asthma , researchers would need to closely track the diets of expectant mothers , as well as any asthma that develops in their children .
“ I think it needs to be tied back with human disease , ” agrees Hollingsworth .
But if confirmed by such human studies , the link between dietary supplements and asthma might explain the mysterious rise of the disease in developed countries , where pregnant women are advised to take folate supplements .
However foods such as leafy greens , broccoli and nuts , also contain folate and can silence genes .
Cigarette smoke makes the same epigenetic changes , and one retrospective study found that grandmothers who smoked while pregnant are more likely to have asthmatic grandchildren than non-smoking grannies .
“ You are what you eat – or you are what your grandma eats , ” Hollingsworth says .

We 're blowing our whistles on the top turncoats in history and giving away all their dirty little secrets .

1. Anna Sage : Dillinger 's Deadly Date
The Tale : Anna Sage was a Romanian immigrant who came to America in 1909 and found work in a brothel in East Chicago , Ind .
Although she was successful in this venerable and established field ( she opened several of her own houses of ill repute in Indiana and Illinois ) , the Department of Labor sought to deport her as an " alien of low moral character . " 
But when famed bank robber John Dillinger — whom she met through mutual gal pal Polly Hamilton — asked her to a movie , Sage thought she 'd found a way to stamp her Green Card .
Dillinger was wanted in five states , and Sage hoped that if she turned him in , the good karma would translate into an invitation to stay in the U.S .
The Tattle : To stage the arrest , Sage called her ex-boyfriend , Martin Zarkovich , at the East Chicago Police Department , and was put in contact with agent Melvin Purvis , who was working the Dillinger case for the FBI .
Sage told Purvis about her upcoming date with Dillinger at the Biograph Theater on July 22 , 1934 .
( O.k. , maybe she did n't specify the year " ¦ )
In order to be identified in the crowd , Sage agreed to wear a white blouse and orange skirt that night , even though history would later dub her the " Lady in Red . " 
( Historians believe the lights of the marquee made her outfit appear red , spawning the moniker . )
As she , Dillinger , and Polly Hamilton exited the theater , Purvis confronted the group .
Dillinger tried to run , which worked pretty well until four FBI bullets put a hitch in his stride .
He died at the scene .
The Aftermath : Sage collected $ 5,000 for information leading to Dillinger 's " capture , "  but was soon sent back to Romania .
According to most sources , agents at the FBI told Sage they could n't prevent her deportation because of the organization 's lack of influence over the Department of Labor , but recent research suggests a more devious motive .
In Jay Robert Nash 's book Dillinger : Dead or Alive , the author suggests the whole episode was a setup .
Because the FBI 's failure to capture the elusive Public Enemy No.1 was a source of considerable consternation , Nash believes the scene outside the theater that night was the shooting of an innocent man staged by Sage , Zarkovich , and the FBI .
The goal ?
Alleviate pressure on the FBI and help keep the " Lady in Red "  in the country .
Nash claims
Sage 's hasty deportation was part of the cover - up , and also points to discrepancies between the body of the dead man and Dillinger .
John Dillinger was widely known for his blue eyes and missing upper tooth .
The body from the scene , however , had brown eyes and a full set of teeth .
Adding further credence to Nash 's theory is the disappearance of local criminal John Lawrence the night of the shooting .
2. Aldrich Ames : Soviet Mole and CIA Rat
The Tale : Aldrich Hazen Ames was pretty much born a CIA agent .
His father spied for the CIA in Burma during the 1950's , and at age 16 , Aldrich went to " The Farm , "  a CIA training facility , to learn the ropes himself .
Despite his pedigree , it seems unlikely that Ames will win CIA Employee of the Year .
Not now .
Not tomorrow .
Not ever .
Why ?
Because Ames was the most damaging mole in CIA history .
Beginning in 1985 , he sold out every spy the CIA and FBI had in the then - USSR , and we doubt a " my bad "  will cover that .
The Tattle : Ironically , Ames started out at the CIA recruiting Soviets to spy on their government , but he soon discovered he was n't very good at convincing people to snitch .
Luckily for him ( and his career ) , his next assignment was with a Soviet Diplomat to Colombia named Aleksandr Dmitrievich Ogorodnik .
Ogorodnik had already been convinced to spy for the U.S. , but he did n't prove very useful until he was transferred to Ames ' CIA department .
In Ames ' hands , Ogorodnik ( code - named Trigon ) was reassigned to the Russian Foreign Ministry , where he developed a knack for photographing sensitive documents and files .
Although Ames had never successfully recruited a single spy , his handling of Trigon earned him a promotion .
He became the Counterintelligence Branch Chief of Soviet Operations , where he had access to information on every aspect of U.S. operations in Russia .
Life was looking swell for Ames until he ran into some girl trouble .
Ames was having an affair with a Colombian woman named Maria del Rosario Casas .
He brought Rosario to Washington , D.C. , and it was n't long before she started making trouble .
She demanded Ames divorce his wife , which he did , wiping out almost all of his savings and assets .
Rosario also spent money like it was going out of style , calling home daily and swiftly digging Ames nearly $ 35,000 into debt .
Ames became so desperate for funds that he considered robbing a bank .
But then he remembered that the Soviets paid $ 50,000 for the names of U.S. spies working in their country .
He arranged a meeting with Sergei Chuvakhin of the Soviet Embassy and gave him the names of three CIA spies .
In exchange for this information , Ames received $ 50,000 .
The story could have ended here but for the arrest of another tattletale , former Navy Warrant Officer John Walker , Jr. , who was caught selling information to the Russians .
Ames got so freaked out that he , too , would be exposed that he decided to beat all possible blabbers to the chase .
He contacted Chuvakhin and gave him the names of every single " human asset "  the CIA had in Russia .
To make the deal sweeter , he also reportedly gave up a British spy and nearly seven pounds of documents that he 'd carried out of the CIA office in his briefcase .
For his generosity in " playing the game , "  the double agent was made the world 's highest - paid spy , with an annual salary of $ 300,000 .
The Aftermath : Ames named 25 spies .
All of them were caught , and at least 10 were executed .
Meanwhile , the unsuspecting CIA transferred him to its office in Rome .
Ames felt Rosario would be happier there and wanted to distance himself from all his mischief .
He did not , however , distance himself from the cash the Russians were paying him , and he and Rosario lived lavishly .
Although his CIA salary was $ 70,000 a year , he wore a Rolex watch and drove a Jaguar to work .
It only took the CIA nine years to notice that something did n't quite add up , and the couple was arrested in 1994 .
Today , Ames is serving out a life sentence , and Rosario was shipped off to Colombia after serving a five - year jail term .
3. DoÃ±a Marina : Dictator 's Translator
The Tale : To this day , DoÃ±a Marina remains a controversial figure in Mexican history .
To some , she 's the embodiment of treason for her role in helping the Spanish conquer the Aztecs .
Others believe she was simply a victim .
To still others , La Malinche ( as she was called ) is the symbolic mother of the Mexican race who saved hundreds of Aztecs from the conquistadores .
This is what we do know : DoÃ±a Marina was born to a noble tribal chief in the southeast part of the Aztec Empire .
As firstborn , she was to become her father 's successor .
After her father died , however , her mother remarried and had a son whom she wanted to rule the tribe .
To make sure La Malinche did n't make too much trouble over the deal , her parents sold her into slavery .
She spent several years as a slave in the present - day state of Tabasco .
When Spanish conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s invaded the country , she became one of his servants .
The Tattle : Although described as intelligent , forward , and ambitious , La Malinche 's most important attribute was her linguistic skill .
A native speaker of the Aztec tongue , Nahuatl , her years in Tabasco also left her fluent in Mayan .
This was of tremendous help to CortÃ©s , who was negotiating with Mayan tribes as a means of usurping power in Mexico .
Her talents were discovered when she began speaking in Mayan to a member of CortÃ©s ' party , a friar named GerÃ³nimo de Aguilar .
It was unusual for a Spanish monk like Aguilar to know Mayan , but as luck would have it , he had been shipwrecked in Mexico in 1511 and spent seven years living among the Mayan tribes and learning their language .
Before long , Aguilar was translating La Malinche 's Mayan into Castilian for CortÃ©s .
This was a major breakthrough in communicating with the Aztecs , but the process was slow and cumbersome .
Fortunately , La Malinche quickly achieved fluency in Castilian , converted to Christianity , took the name DoÃ±a Marina , and was promoted to CortÃ©s ' personal staff .
Soon , she became CortÃ©s ' constant companion ( read : mistress ) and played an essential role in the Spanish conquest .
The Aftermath : Aided by Marina ( not to mention his superior weapons and military tactics ) , CortÃ©s subdued the Aztecs in 1521 , marking the official fall of the Aztec Empire .
Amid all of his conquering , CortÃ©s and Marina had a son who , as the product of Native American and European ancestry , is recognized as the first official Mexican citizen .
Today , much of the Hispanic world sees La Malinche only as a woman who betrayed her people .
In fact , her name eventually coined the term malinchista , which describes a Mexican who favors and / or imitates the language and customs of another country .
Some modern Mexican feminists even claim that the stereotypical disdain that Mexican men display toward their women is rooted in their anger at Marina 's betrayal .
Is all this anger misplaced ?
There 's evidence to suggest so .
Many historians contend that Marina 's diplomacy saved Aztec lives and brought civility to an otherwise barbaric society .
Still , to this day , the house Marina and CortÃ©s shared in Mexico City is not even adorned by a plaque .
Current resident Rina Lazo explained , " For Mexico to make this house a museum would be like the people of Hiroshima creating a monument for the man who dropped the atomic bomb . " 
4. Mordechai Vanunu : Paying the Price of Going Public
The Tale : Mordechai Vanunu was a Moroccan who immigrated to Israel in 1963 with his parents and his ten siblings .
Upon arrival , Vanunu served in the Israeli army before finding employment at the Dimona Nuclear Research Center in the Negev desert .
Happy to have a job , he worked there from 1976 to 1985 before concluding that Dimona was a secret nuclear weapons production plant that was covertly producing military warheads .
That 's when he started to feel a smidge uncomfortable .
The " research facility "  housed an enormous plutonium separation plant that rendered the Israeli nuclear arms program vastly more advanced than the international community suspected and operated entirely without the knowledge of the Israeli people .
Fully aware of the harsh repercussions he could face , Vanunu felt it was incumbent on him to share this information with the world .
The Tattle : Despite having signed an " Official Secrets Pact , "  Vanunu brought a camera to work one day and stealthily photographed the facility .
Soon thereafter , he fled Israel and went public with his information .
On October 5 , 1986 , The London Sunday Times headline blared , " Revealed : The Secret of Israel 's Nuclear Arsenal . " 
The cat was out of the bag , and it was sharing Israel 's secrets with anyone who 'd listen .
The Aftermath : Even before the Times story ran , the Israelis knew what Vanunu was up to .
Agents from Israel 's intelligence institute , Mossad , lured him to Italy , where he was kidnapped , drugged , and cargo - shipped back to Israel .
( Details of this abduction were made public when Vanunu inked them on his hand and allowed quick - thinking news photographers to snap pictures . )
In Israel , Vanunu was charged with treason and espionage .
Despite international outcry , the closed - door trial led to an 18 - year prison sentence , the first 11 of which he spent in solitary confinement .
In 1998 , Vanunu was allowed to join the general prison population , and in 2004 , he was " conditionally "  released .
While currently " free , "  the Israeli government still refuses to let Vanunu leave the country , and he is forbidden to speak with the international media .
He remains an unrepentant whistleblower and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times .
5. Elia Kazan : Snitch To The Stars
The Tale : Between 1945 and 1957 , Elia Kazan enjoyed a hot streak few in Hollywood could even dream about .
He directed 13 acclaimed motion pictures ( including " A Streetcar Named Desire "  and " East of Eden "  ) and was nominated for four Best Director awards .
Kazan was riding high when Hollywood entered the blackest period in its history ( barring the second and third installments of the " Matrix "  trilogy ) : the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's .
The Tattle : A philosophical and politically passionate man , Kazan had been a founding member of the leftist Group Theater in New York and , for a little more than a year , was a member of the Communist Party .
In 1934 , however , Kazan 's ideals began to diverge sharply from those of the Party , and he soon found himself a zealous anti-Communist .
Wanting names , the government pressured Kazan to spill the beans , even threatening to have him blacklisted by major Hollywood studios .
After wrestling with the question of whether or not he should sacrifice his career for people whose ideals he disdained , Kazan decided to share his knowledge of Communists in Hollywood with the House Committee on Un- American Activities .
In 1952 , he went before the Committee and named eight of his Group Theater buddies who had been members of the Communist Party with him .
The Aftermath : After Kazan 's testimony , the government was fast on the tails of those he'd named , pressuring them for yet more names , and it was officially witchhuntin ' season !
Many actors , writers , and directors were blacklisted , and scores of careers were ruined .
The era remains one of the least tinselly in Tinseltown history .
Not surprisingly , pretty much everyone not already in the business of rooting out Commies reviled Kazan .
His longtime friend and confidant , Arthur Miller , explained his feelings on the matter in his allegorical play " The Crucible . " 
Not to be outdone , Kazan shot back by crafting a sympathetic informer character in his film " On The Waterfront , "  which Miller rebutted in " A View From The Bridge . " 
( Jeez , guys , just pick up the phone or something . )
But the controversy surrounding Kazan was yet to abate .
In 1999 , Kazan was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the Oscars , and more than 500 people showed up to protest .
Writer and director Abraham Polonsky , whom 20th Century Fox had fired and blacklisted for his refusal to cooperate with the House Un- American Activities Committee , said of the event , " I 'll be watching , hoping someone shoots him . " 
Um , Mr. Polonsky , do you think you could put that in the form of a play ?
6. Sammy " The Bull "  Gravano : Blabbing on the Boss
The Tale : Probably the world 's most notorious hairdresser - turned - hitman , Salvatore " Sammy The Bull " 
Gravano was the highest - ranking Italian Mafia member ever to break omerta , the mob code of silence .
Born in Brooklyn and nicknamed " The Bull "  for his short stature , thick neck , and ruthless fighting tactics , Gravano rose to the position of underboss in the Gambino crime family .
Allegedly responsible for 19 murders , Gravano was no angel , and no tight - lips , either .
Sammy 's damning testimony sealed the fate of many in the organization , including his former boss , John Gotti .
The Tattle : The reason Gravano snitched varies depending on whom you ask .
Some claim he did it to receive a lighter prison sentence , while others say he got mad after hearing Gotti badmouthing him on a wiretap .
But in Underboss : Sammy The Bull Gravano 's Life In The Mafia , Gravano says Gotti needed to be taken down because he was addicted to publicity , and all the attention was harming the mob .
Either way , Gravano delivered such damaging testimony in court that lead Gotti prosecutor John Gleeson described him as having rendered " extraordinary , unprecedented , historic assistance to the government . " 
The Aftermath : Information provided by Gravano created a ripple effect throughout the Mafia underground , and numerous corroborating witnesses came forward .
Dozens of luminaries in the Cosa Nostra crime syndicate were convicted , jury - rigging schemes were exposed , mobsters already in jail had their sentences extended , and high - ranking members of the Gambino , Colombo , DeCalvacante , and Lucchese families were imprisoned .
In 1995 , Gravano got a cushy five - year sentence for his 19 murders , and was later placed in the Witness Protection Program .
After his release , Sammy made the most of his second chance by teaming up with some neo -Nazis and getting busted for selling Ecstasy .
Not so bright , Bull .
He got 19 years in the slammer this time , a sentence he 's still serving .

Yesterday someone from something called the Experience Project ( i.e. , " millions of life experiences shared anonymously through first person stories " ) posted on something rather bizarre :
So , I 'm walking back to work from lunch , and on the sidewalk of a very busy street in San Francisco ( right at 4th and Market in the South of Market district ) I see a huge Manta Ray on the sidewalk !
I was one of the first people at the site and a few police officers had just arrived on the scene .
Everyone was just staring at the giant Manta Ray wondering how it ever got there .
The guy who called the police said that it actually flapped its way over to that part of the sidewalk from about 20 feet away , so it must have been alive when it was dropped there !
Anyone else see what happened ?
How did it get there ?
Hurry , we need someone to blame !
Anyway , you can read more here .

In the United States , an ongoing housing slump has grown into a lead weight around the neck of American consumers .
But in the South of France , things are just grand .
An unidentified Russian billionaire has spent $ 750 million to buy a villa on the French Riviera , demolishing the previous global record for the sale of a private home , which was set by Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal 's $ 114 million purchase of his London mansion .
The Times :
The price of the Villa Leopolda , a Belle Époque mansion on the heights of Villefrance , has amazed estate agents but fuelled local worries that the invasion of Russian money on the Côte d'Azur is getting out of hand .
Since the early 1990s , Russian oligarchs , drawn by memories of the Riviera - mad old Russian aristocracy , have been piling into seaside properties at Cap Ferrat , Cap d'Antibes , Saint - Tropez and the other great playgrounds .
None , however , has come near the price with which the unnamed Russian clinched the Leopolda deal with Lily Safra , the widow of Edmond Safra , a Lebanese banker who was killed by an arsonist 's fire in Switzerland in 2003 .
So apart from spending the GDP of small countries on a house , what else do super - rich Russian billionaires do to pass the time ?
Burn money :
Russian excess is feeding discontent among poorer people .
Pierrette , a housekeeper for one Russian , said : “ I attended a party where the guests had fun throwing burning €500 notes into the air while everyone split their sides laughing .
The domestic staff were later told to collect the ashes .
It was sickening . ”
‘ Elephant Legs ’ Woman Finds Hope Outside of China
Wang Cheng , a 24 year - old Chinese girl often referred to as ‘ Elephant Legs ’ , has a rare medical condition of elephantiasis , which has caused her legs to swell nearly three times their normal size .
Wang has suffered from the condition since the age of 6 and currently cannot even wear pants because of the pain it causes her 110 pound legs .
“ I can not go out to work .
Nor can I wear trousers as normal people . ”
Wang said while sitting in her bed at Taipei Municipal Wan Fang Hospital waiting for an upcoming operation .
Living with a paralyzed father and an unemployed mother in China , Wang was given a blessing when she was offered an opportunity to receive free surgery that would cut away some of the lymphatic tissue in her legs .
Hsu Wen -hsien , a senior doctor who will lead the operation on Monday , indicated that he had never seen such a sever case in all his 30 years experience .
“ In the past cases , none of the patients have had two legs swelling to this size , ” said Hsu .
The operation is expected to reduce Wang ’s leg size by about 35 % initially , and up to 50 % after about 2 months of rehabilitation .
Taiwanese Buddhist group Fo Kuang
Shan is paying for the travel expenses to Taiwan and non-medical expenses while the 10 - hour operation and related care , estimated at $ 17,600 , is being provided free by the hospital .
Elephantiasis , or lymphatic filariasis , is often transmitted by mosquitoes .

Claim : Some Chinese - made hair bands were fashioned from recycled condoms .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , July 2008 ]
Chinese Hair Band – Condom Chinese Hair Band – Condom Grosssssssssssssssssssssssss
Just try to be careful when you are buying hair bands … who knows what it is made from .
These hair bands were made from used condoms and threads .
Used condoms are being recycled into hair bands in southern China , threatening to spread sexually - transmittable diseases they were originally meant to prevent , state media reported Tuesday .
In the latest example of potentially harmful Chinese - made products , rubber hair bands have been found in local markets and beauty salons in Dongguan and Guangzhou cities in southern Guangdong province , China Daily newspaper said .
Origins :
In November 2007 , news emerged from China that some hair bands manufactured there were found to have been made from recycled condoms .
The prophylactic hair ties were discovered in Dongguan and Guangzhou , two cities in the province of Guangdong .
( The colorful hair bands were believed to have been manufactured in Jinhua , a city in the province of
Zhejiang . )
The “ secret ingredient ” came to light when a young woman in Dongguan thought to investigate the hair bands given to her in a local salon after one began to fray , revealing an unexpected color inside .
“ The hair bands are swathed in colorful wool - like materials , ” said Ms. Chen , the woman who found the condoms .
“ But a small part came loose when I used the bands to tie my hair up one morning .
It looked strange to me because of its different color — not the yellow color we normally see in plastic bands .
I peeled deeper and found something that looked like a condom . ”
Speculation about the issue held that substandard unused condoms ( i.e. , new prophylactics that had failed to meet quality standards at the condom manufacturing plant where they were produced ) were resold to hair band manufacturers as raw materials .
It is not clear that , as claimed , some or all of the hair ties ’ hidden surprises were condoms that had reached their original intended market and been used before being recycled .
If the latter case were true , they could serve to spread sexually - transmittable diseases because they might still harbor certain bacteria and viruses .
This had not been the first time rejected condoms had been used to make hairbands .
In 2002 the Shanghai Star reported on a case that had surfaced in Qingdao , Shandong Province , after a woman living there discovered that a rubber band she had purchased to tie up her hair had been made from a prophylactic .
The bands had been manufactured in Yiwu , Zhejiang Province and were being wholesaled by a couple operating out of Qinyang , Henan Province .
It was confirmed that the rubber bands had been fashioned from bits of used and abandoned or low - quality condoms rejected by the factory where they were made .
Said items should have , according to state regulations , been broken down and sent to a plastics factory in Beijing .

In this post , I will tell a little about what I learned .
I will also look at prospects for the future -- both in terms of being able to expand operations and threats to maintaining current production levels .
I recently visited BP America 's tight gas facility in Wamsutter , Wyoming on a trip paid for by the American Petroleum Institute .
I was the only representative of internet media on the trip .
The other reporters on the trip were from AP - Cheyenne , Casper Star - Tribune , and Natural Gas Weekly .
On the trip , we spent a day and a half listening to presentations and touring facilities .
We also stayed overnight at the facility BP built for visiting workers .
The Wamsutter gas field is located in southwestern Wyoming .
It is about 55 miles long and 35 miles wide .
BP America has had operations there since the mid 1970s .
BP is not the only operator in this field , but it is the largest one .
Wamsutter 's gas is tight gas --
It has low permeability ( .01 md ) and low porosity (< 12 % ) .
Hydraulic fracturing ( " fracing " ) is needed to get the natural gas out .
Compared to conventional gas , wells need to be spaced closer together because gas does not travel far in such a tight formation .
The initial internal pressure of a well can be high , but drops off quickly .
Natural gas production also start off high , but quickly drops .
Wamsutter gas is sweet gas -- without H2S ( hydrogen sulfide ) .
The produced natural gas has water with it .
Once the pressure of a well declines , external energy inputs are required to separate the gas from the water .
The energy source BP and other companies in the Wamsutter gas field have been using for many years is electricity from solar panels .
BP is now considering adding windmills as an additional source of external energy .
The reservoir depth is about 10,000 feet .
At this depth , there is a layer 500 feet thick , about 20 % of which is pay .
The productive portion is found in strata as thin as 10 feet thick .
The productive strata ( the " net pay " ) together add up to about 60 to 100 feet of the 500 foot layer .
In the early years , BP 's approach to extracting natural gas was similar to that used for conventional gas .
Individual vertical wells were drilled , with 8 wells per square mile ( 80 acre spacing ) .
From the air , the arrangement looked like this :
Figure 2 - Early layout of gas wells and roads
This arrangement was very costly to service and maintain , in part because BP was responsible for building the roads to the wells .
In addition , service people needed to visit each well individually .
Pipelines were needed to each well .
Separate tanks and other infrastructure were also needed for each well .
Besides well arrangements , BP followed industry practice in other respects .
When prices were relatively high , it would rent more drilling rigs and increase the number of wells drilled .
When prices decreased , it would lay off workers , stop renting rigs , and let production level off or fall .
BP America 's 2005 Wamsutter Investment Program
In 2005 , BP made a decision to change the way it managed the Wamsutter gas field .
Instead of simply following the conventional gas drilling model , it would put together its own model , one more in line with maximizing productivity as a tight gas facility .
BP announced that it was planning to invest $ 2.2 billion in the field , to raise production from 125 million to 250 million cubic feet a day , before 2010 .
Of this , $ 120 million was investment in improving technology .
One of the major things BP decided to change was well spacing .
Instead of drilling eight separate wells on individual pads within an area one mile square , it would consolidate up to eight wells onto a single pad , and arrange the pipes so they still drained the same area one mile square .
This way , much less land would be disturbed and many fewer roads would be needed .
Other infrastructure could also be consolidated and servicing costs would go down .
In order to make this change , BP needed drilling rigs that would drill " deviated " wells - that is , wells that angled off , then down , so that the surface portion of the wells could be placed on a single pad , while the wells themselves were spaced out , like the legs of a daddy long legs spider .
The drilling rigs also needed to be capable of drilling one well , and then moving to the next , without being taken apart , transported a few feet , and put back together again .
Since rigs are rented by the day , the several days that rigs are out of service during the take - down and set - up would add greatly to the cost .
In order to get rigs of the proper specifications , BP found it was necessary to work with manufacturers to produce rigs suited to its needs and then sign long - term leases on the rigs .
BP decided to lease seven rigs -- three from Helmerich & Payne , and four from Nabors , at rates averaging approximately $ 30,000 a day .
Figure 3 - One of the new drilling rigs
Besides having the proper specifications , the new drilling rigs are much more automated .
The " dog houses " are air conditioned and relatively quiet .
Operators need to be highly trained individuals , instead of traditional " roughnecks " .
Figure 4 - Controls inside " dog house " of drilling rig - Click for larger picture
As part of the 2005 initiative , BP made a decision to staff at a fixed level -- the level of operations that the seven drilling rigs on long - term contracts could support .
With this approach , there would be no more lay - offs , even if the price of natural gas declined .
Besides fitting with the long - term contracts on the rigs , this approach had the benefit of providing a more stable working environment for employees .
Prior to the 2005 initiative , the community of Wamsutter had a population of 261 , and had few amenities .
The homes were mobile homes , each with its own well .
BP decided that this needed to change , if Wamsutter was to be an inviting place for educated workers to live .
Starting in 2005 , BP began helping Wamsutter add services .
Some of the projects BP has helped fund include water and sewer systems , road improvements , a day care , and a park .
Figure 5 - Community development director at the new day care
In order to have educated workers , BP has also contributed $ 500,000 to Western Wyoming Community College , to enhance the college 's oil and gas technology program and $ 5 million to University of Wyoming 's School of Energy Resources .
Other Technology Enhancements
Besides shifting from individual wells to grouped wells , BP has been pursuing other types of research :
• Remote monitoring .
Years back , service people needed to drive around in a truck to check each well individually .
Now most of the relevant information is transmitted electronically , so that a visit is required only if there is a problem .
• Electrification of wells .
Electricity is needed at the well site to separate natural gas from the water produced with it and to transmit monitoring information to the office .
The original approach , used by BP and others , was to use a single solar panel and battery for each well .
Now that BP is grouping wells on a pad , BP uses a larger grouping of solar panels together with several batteries , to provide longer backup .
BP is considering adding a windmill to some pads , as an additional source of energy .
• Cordless seismic imaging .
BP has worked with outside contractors on what it calls Firefly ( R ) land seismic imaging system .
With the old technology , seismic imaging systems needed to be plugged into electric power at a proposed well site .
This was a problem , since there are no electric power lines in most areas being tested .
The new system uses battery operated units which transmit signals to the office .
• Horizontal wells .
BP 's current wells are basically vertical wells , adjusted for the need to have the surface units located on a single pad .
BP is planning to test horizontal wells , to see how the economics of these wells compare with the current approach .
Well Productivity
The written material we were provided indicates that with BP 's new technology , hydrocarbon recovery has been increased by up to 40 % and drilling costs have been reduced by up to 50 % .
I do not know to what base this comparison is being made , but I can believe that costs have been brought down substantially .
We were not provided with an estimate of the expected recovery per well , but I tried to compute one from various information given at the presentation .
I came up with a range of about 900 million to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per well .
This seems like a fairly respectable level , compared to estimates for other natural gas producers .
One figure that is fairly easy to calculate is average annual gas production per operating well , including wells that were drilled years ago .
In this calculation , only natural gas " not associated " with petroleum production is used .
One can compare this statistic to statewide averages , using EIA statistics for natural gas production and number of wells .
For BP
Wamsutter , the information provided suggests the average annual production per operating well is currently about 68 million cubic feet per well ( ( 240 million x 365 days ) / 1,282 wells ) .
If wells have an average life of 30 years , and this average continues to hold , this would suggest ultimate recovery averaging just over 2.0 billion ( =30 x 68 million ) cubic feet per well .
One could get a similar number with a 40 year life and a lower annual average .
One thing I noticed when looking at EIA data is how much average production per well varies from state to state ( Figure 6 ) .
Ohio , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia all have very low averages -- about 3 or 4 million cubic feet per year .
I expect this production is coal bed methane .
If these wells have a 40 year life span , one might expect ultimate recovery of 140 million cubic feet per well ( =40 x 3.5 ) .
I find it hard to believe that wells with this low level of productivity could be profitable .
Yet developers seem to view these wells as at least marginally profitable -- the number of wells in these states has been increasing in recent years .
In contrast , Figure 6 shows Wyoming 's average annual production per well is above the US average ( excluding these states with very low average production rates ) .
BPs Wamsutter 's average of 68 million cubic feet is in line with both the Wyoming average and the US average excluding Ohio , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia .

Production Costs
We were not given an accounting of costs that go into producing BP 's tight gas , but it appears that drilling costs are a smaller percentage of the total than for conventional gas .
Items which would contribute to BPs costs include the following :
• Drilling costs .
We were told that the individual wells costs in excess of $ 2 million .
I am not certain which costs are rolled into this calculation .
The seven drilling rigs are rented at rates averaging $ 30,000 a day , and these seven drilling rigs in total drill 150 to 170 wells a year .
• Seismic imaging .
Imaging is needed at each proposed well site .
• " Fracing " of wells .
BP uses two portable rigs for this operation .
I would presume these rigs are considerably less expensive than the seven drilling rigs on long - term lease .
• Long term lease for the large amount of land held .
Costs may be low , since the same land can be used for agricultural purposes ( grazing cattle , etc . )
• Roads to service the wells .
Roads are gravel and need to be regraded when affected by washing .
• Travel of service people to wells .
We were told that while this amounted to 1,000,000 miles per month in the past , it has been reduced to 800,000 miles per month through greater use of long distance monitoring .
• Technology research .
BP has allocated $ 120 million for research , over a five year period .
• Well infrastructure and replacements .
Each well or group of wells contains equipment for separating the extracted material into its components , holding tanks , monitoring equipment , solar panels , and battery back - ups .
If wells have a 40 year life , replacements will be needed for many reasons -- corrosion , solar panel theft , battery life , etc .
• Pipelines and compressors .
Pipelines are needed for natural gas transmission .
Compressors use natural gas for power , since electricity is rarely available in Wyoming .
• Office .
Building for people overseeing natural gas production .
Also warehouse for supplies .
• Residence facility .
Since nearby living facilities are very limited , BP built a residence facility for workers who desire to stay there .
It provides meals , recreation and laundry for up to 200 workers .
The cost is at least partly offset by charges to workers using the facility .
• Assistance to Wamsutter .
BP has been active in setting up a city a water system , building a day care , and finding a person to coordinate town development .
Part of this is funded by BP ; part is funded by Wyoming state agencies .
• Funding for University Training Programs .
Noted previously .
• Taxes .
Material provided indicates that in Wyoming ( not just Wamsutter ) , these were $ 60 million in 2005 , plus $ 170 million in federal royalties .
• Cost of money .
Most of the expenses are front end expenses .
Either funds need to be borrowed , or there is an opportunity cost in using funds that might be invested elsewhere .
We were told that in total , there are 750 to 900 workers at the BP site in a typical month .
Of these , only 150 are actually BP employees .
The rest are contractors of various types .
Future Prospects for BP Wamsutter
The company generally seems to be well situated .
It is taking an approach of trying to learn as it goes , and incorporating new technology to hold down costs .
The company says that it has produced about 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since 1977 .
This represents less than 20 % of the resource available in BP 's portion of Wamsutter field .
We were told that gas wells from the 1970s are still flowing .
To date , the spacing of the wells has been one well per 80 acres .
BP has filed for approval to change the spacing to one well for 40 acres , and is in the process of getting necessary approvals .
With this spacing , BP can put up to 16 wells on a pad , instead on 8 .
It can also add infill wells to previously drilled areas .
BP 's research indicates that in some portions of the field , flow rates will be adequate with the closer spacing .
Based on what BP has done to date , BP seems to be in a good position to increase production in the future , if it chooses to .
For example , it could decide to increase the number of drilling rigs it operates by one or two in say , 2011 .
If it were to make such a decision , it would need to order new rigs sufficiently in advance , and sign additional long term leases .
It might need to make increases in other areas as well - - more employees , more support for the Wamsutter community , greater office space , and perhaps a larger residence for visiting workers .
I do n't know whether BP would choose to make such an increase in production , however .
With its current " level load " philosophy , BP could choose not to add capacity .
Instead , it might extend the number of years over which it can produce gas further into the future .
I think issues which would tend to hold back BPs Wamsutter production are peak oil issues and possibility water shortages .
Wamsutter is in a remote location .
At present , it has a population of about 600 .
It does not have a grocery store , any medical services , or a hotel .
Many of the workers live as far as 70 miles away , in order to have basic services .
Even those who live nearby make many long car trips to purchase necessities .
All of this is very oil dependent .
BP Wamsutter 's natural gas operations are also quite petroleum dependent .
The service people visit the wells in trucks ; the drilling rigs are powered by diesel fuel .
Grading of roads requires diesel .
All of the supplies are brought by truck from distant locations .
Visitors generally fly into Rock Springs , a tiny airport 70 miles away .
Cutbacks in the availability of oil could affect all of these oil uses .
Regarding water scarcity , Wamsutter is in the Red Desert .
It gets 8 inches of rain a year .
The Rock Springs newspaper was full of stories about water issues when I visited .
For example , it talked about well levels for existing homeowners dropping when new wells are added .
Clearly , Wamsutter cannot be self - sufficient in growing its own food .
It will need to have nearly everything brought in by truck .
If residents try to pump more than the aquifer can handle , there could be a serious problem .
Increasing the number of resident is likely to make the water problems worse , sooner .
Possibility of Others Ramping Up Production
What is the possibility of others jumping in and ramping up production in another tight stands location ?
Shale gas is different , but I do n't know how different .
I suspect that some of the issues might be similar with Hayneville shale , which now seems to have the possibility of increased production .
My guess would be that if anyone wants to ramp up production quickly , it will not be easy .
The number of rotary drilling rigs in use for natural gas in North America has stagnated in the last year .
One reason for this may be the competition from oil , since the higher price is drawing rigs toward oil .
Another reason may be that the more popular rig types are already close to full utilization .
If this is the case , a company wishing to ramp up production quickly might need to make do with whatever happens to be available , even if it is not optimal for the particular application .
Figure 7 . Number of North American leased rotary drilling rigs
Three of the rigs used by BP are manufactured by Helmerich & Payne .
A check of its website indicates that in the past year , its land rigs were 97 % utilized .
Clearly trained workers are another issue , especially with unconventional gas .
Unconventional gas is expanding so rapidly that there are not enough workers to go around .
I have listed some other costs that BP has encountered , such as building roads , getting pipelines laid , and doing seismic testing .
Depending on the location , a new company would need to deal with many of these issues .
These are likely to take time and money , and may delay production .
I would expect that much of the research would be skipped , so as to start production quickly .
Because of the important role technology plays , this could easily mean the difference between a profitable operation and an unprofitable one .
Putting these things together , it seems like ramping up production of tight gas will be a challenge .
There is likely to be a delay of at least three years just to get all of the basics covered .
Skipping research puts the new producer at risk of a much lower profitability level .
And of course , the new producer will have to deal with the impacts of peak oil , just as BP will .

Figure 1 : Abqaiq oil decline 1946 - 2006 .

cumulative production ( CP ) = 99 Gb ,

2P = 292 Gb ,
3P =363 Gb and
contingent resources 238 Gb

Figure 13 : Oil consumption in 20 countries where 2006 retail gasoline price was below normal .
Figure 14 : Saudi Arabia oil consumption and population ( UN 2006 medium ) forecast .
Reserves reporting in Saudi Arabia ( SA ) , being unaudited as all OPEC reserves , are mainly political as confirmed by Sadad al Husseini ( former VP of Aramco ) with the 300 Gb referenced by OPEC being just a speculative number and not a proved one .
Field production data are confidential , except for a few publications by Aramco to reply at Matt Simmons book “ Twilight In The Desert ” IHS is obliged to follow Aramco 's reporting and has increased cumulative oil discovery from 313 Gb in 2004 to 395 Gb in 2006 .
It is difficult to check field reserves estimates with oil declines , because of production quotas and incomplete data , except for Abqaiq which was reported by the end of 2003 as being 73 % depleted ( CP = 11.8 Gb or U = 16 Gb ) .
Abqaiq 's oil ultimate is about 15 Gb when calculated from the decline profile , when Baqi reported 16 Gb in 2004 , Saleri 17 Gb in 2007 with wishful EOR .
IHS reports 18 Gb ( 30 Gb OIP ) in 2008 ( plus 0,5 Gb condensate ) , but in 1993 was reporting 15 Gb .
Old data ( before the quotas fight ) seem more reliable .
In the bookpublished by Aramco in 1980 before nationalisation , Saudi Arabia proved reserves were reported to be 113 Gb and probable reserves 65 Gb , with cumulative production by the end of 1979 being 38 Gb. 2P discovery was 216 Gb for Aramco in 1979 .
Since then , discovery have been negligible , as shown by the creaming curve ( cumulative discoveries versus the cumulative number of New Field Wildcats - NFW ) .
The first 40 NFW ( 1935 - 1968 ) found 360 Gb in 22 fields while the last 40 NFW ( 1994 -2007 ) found only 6
Gb with 33 fields !
From IHS data , the oil ultimate is about 400 Gb and natural gas ultimate about 65 Gboe ( = 400 Tcf ) .
Recent natural gas exploration by IOCs has been dry ( 6 NFW ) and Total has withdrawn .
Aramco ( Baqi & Saleri 2005 ) reported as of end 2003 :
All of this for an oil in place of 700 Gb. Saleri seemed to have forgotten that contingent resources are potentially producible one day and he assumes that all oil will be produced without leaving one drop in the ground (! ) when the range is from 99 % to 5 % .
Aramco discovery as of end 2003 is then 2P 391 Gb , giving an increase from the 1980 estimate of +175 Gb , mainly for political reasons , because of the quotas fight .
IHS was obliged to accept Aramco 's field estimates and reports 396 Gb at the end 2007 .
But Sadad al - Husseini ( VP of E&P ) when retired in 2007 stated that the 300 Gb proved reserves increase from 1985 to 1990 by OPEC are based on speculative resources and that Saudi Arabia 's increase in 1990 was 90 Gb .
In 1980 Aramco 's 2P reserves were about reported 1P .
Colin Campbell estimates Saudi Arabia 's ultimate to be at 275 Gb. Production linearization is not reliable , ranging from 180 Gb to infinite depending on the selected period .
The plot is linear only if the pattern is logistic but this is not the case because of above and below ground conditions .
Oil production seems to have been pushed very hard with new drilling .
The comparison between oil production and number of rigs seems to show that oil production is at the peak , despite that the new drilling could be the redevelopment of fields like Khurais and Khusanyah .
Anyway King Abdallah has declared that , if new fields are discovered , they will be kept for the next generation .
I am inclined to choose 250 Gb for the oil ultimate with 110 already produced as of end 2006 .
Colin ’s 275
Gb seems optimistic and the maximum is 300 Gb , far from IHS 400 Gb .
But there are also NGL ( natural gas liquids , reported as natural gas plant liquids by USDOE / EIA ) and it is hard to forecast NGL production which increases more than crude oil because it is outside OPEC 's quotas and Saudi Arabia has high needs for gas ( in water desalt plants ) .
Natural gas ( NG ) production data varies with sources .
The ratio Mb NGPL to Tcf NG seems stable at 200 Mb per Tcf during the last 20 years .
If the NG ultimate is 400 Tcf ( assuming no overestimation as for oil because there 's no quotas ) , the NGPL ultimate is about 80 000 Mb ( 400 x 200 ) or 80 Gb .
The ultimate for Oil + NGL could be about 250 Gb + 80 Gb , rounded to 300 Gb. Crude Oil+NGL production ( CP 2007 = 122 Gb ) is plotted assuming a plateau up to 2020 and a decline of 3 % / a after 2020 with a 300 Gb ultimate , but the big problem is domestic oil consumption which is increasing with population .
The oil consumption estimated in Figure 14 is plotted as the volume of production less consumption available for export , which could be zero in 2050 .
Oil consumption is plotted , estimated from population forecasts ( UN 2006 , USCB , PRB = population reference bureau ) and per capita consumption .
Population forecasts are based on fertility rate forecasts , but Saudi Arabia 's fertility rate is badly reported .
Oil consumption per capita was about 25 annual barrels , but it has increased lately to 32 b because domestic gasoline price is well below the normal price : in 2006 gasoline was 0.16 $ / l compared to a normal price of 0.58 $ /l ( USDOE / EIA study ) .
Oil consumption for the producing countries where gasoline price is well below the normal price increases more than the world 's mean , meaning that their exportation will decrease rapidly .
Saudi Arabia domestic oil consumption could reach 4 Mb/d in 2050 if consumption per capita stays at the present ratio of 32 b/a , but it has to decrease because Crude Oil +NGL production will be at this level ( Figure 9 ) .
There are many uncertainties in liquids forecasts mainly because of the poor quality of the data for production and population .
Saudi Arabia should improve the quality of these data in order to manage the coming crisis .
Saudi Arabia could stop exporting oil in 2050 meaning that they will be in trouble to finance their budget .
Furthermore the world needs to know that Saudi Arabia cannot fulfill the wishes of many countries in increasing their oil imports .
The Dutch High Tech Crime Unit has arrested a 19 year - old man and his 16 year - old brother and charged them with operating ( and attempting to sell ) the Shadow botnet .
Shadow was created by the two brothers , and is currently thought to infect some 100,000 machines , down from a peak of 150,000 .
Shadow appears to have been mostly confined to the Netherlands , as the messages and phishing hooks were all sent in Dutch , but had apparently infected some US systems as well , as the FBI is credited for assisting on the case .
The arrests actually occurred several weeks ago , on July 29 , but it's what happened afterwards that has made this situation interesting .
Instead of simply shutting the botnet down , the High Crime Tech Unit took control of it .
Once Shadow was secured , the police contacted Kaspersky Labs about providing a means to neutralize the malware .
Kaspersky has made their fix public , and will also deploy the instructions over the Shadow botnet itself .
Reaching out to infected users and notifying them that they are , in fact , infected is a new twist , and it uses the spammers ' own work against them .
As for Shadow , there 's nothing particularly special about it .
The two creators initially infected users through Microsoft 's Windows Live Messenger service .
Victims received a message purporting to be from a friend .
The message contained a link , the link wants to download a file ... we all know the drill .
Once in place , Shadow collected all the instant messenger contacts it could get its hands on and relayed them back to the command and control ( C&C ) server .
The success of the Shadow botnet takedown lends credence to the speech Rod Beckstrom gave at Black Hat just last week .
Speaking at the conference , Beckstrom highlighted the need for cooperation between companies , individuals , and the government , itself , when it comes to defining and deploying the best security practices .
This particular case is the second high - profile , international action we 've seen so far this year and a further example of how cooperation at all levels is an effective weapon in the ongoing fight against malware .

UPDATED to Include New Footage of Bizarre Mass Arrests in St. Paul ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/20/2008 , 11:34 am PT
To nobody 's suprise , Democracy Now !
announces that charges against journalist Amy Goodman and two other staff journalists arrested while doing their job covering protests at the Republican National Convention are being dropped by the City of St. Paul .
Journalists intimidated .
Mission accomplished ...
The St. Paul City Attorney ’s office announced Friday it will not prosecute Democracy Now ! journalists Amy Goodman , Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman also issued a statement Friday that “ the city will decline to prosecute misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists arrested during the Republican National Convention . ”
Both announcements come two weeks after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention where over 40 journalists were arrested while reporting on protests taking place outside the convention center .
Upon learning of the news , Democracy Now !
Host , Amy Goodman said , “ It ’s good that these false charges have finally been dropped , but we never should have been arrested to begin with .
These violent and unlawful arrests disrupted our work and had a chilling effect on the reporting of dissent .
Freedom of the press is also about the public ’s right to know what is happening on their streets .
There needs to be a full investigation of law enforcement activities during the convention . ”
...
John Lundquist , attorney for the Democracy Now !
journalists , said , “ The most notable lapse by law enforcement during the RNC was the record - breaking number of journalists indiscriminately arrested and detained for doing nothing more than performing in the best tradition of reporters who gather the news . ”
Chris Bowers has more thoughts on the arrests of journalists , and the dropped charges , and what he alleges amounted to ' a deal ' of sorts between the RNC and the St. Paul cops .
Videos of DN !
reporter Nicole Salazar being assaulted by the police ( :23 seconds ) and Goodman 's outrageous arrest while peacefully trying to learn what had happened to her reporters ( :49 seconds ) , both follow below ...
UPDATE : New footage was released late last week ( said by the videographers to have been " buried " until now to avoid confiscation ) of a bizarre mass arrest by St. Paul police .
Scores of seemingly peaceful folks just sitting in a park are seeing being seized by riot squads .
" LisaG , " posting at Firedoglake , notes :
My personal favorite moment in the tape is an off - camera exchange .
Police in riot gear have surrounded loungers in a waterfront park .
They announce , " Ladies and Gentlemen , You 're Under Arrest " and you hear one young woman say incredulously " Are you serious ? "
Yep , I 'm afraid they are .

Give your speakers some extra personality by making them out of a vinyl doll .
Kid Robot makes the easily hackable 7 " Munny doll and I 've been meaning to cut one up .
The combined need for some new speakers created a happy union of doll and speaker .
Now , I 'm not the first person to think of this .
I 've seen at least three different versions of a Munny with a speaker in its head .
Still , the only one I 've seen in person was just one doll for mono sound and the driver was pretty worthless .
I wanted mine to sound at least decent and I 'd say I surpassed that .
What 's Really Driving
The High Price Of Oil ?
By Ralph Nader
30 May , 2008
Countercurrents.org
W hat factors are causing the zooming price of crude oil , gasoline and heating products ?
What is going to be done about it ?
Do n’t rely on the White House — with Bush and Cheney marinated in oil — or the Congress — which has hearings that grill oil executives who know that nothing is going to happen on Capitol Hill either .
Last week the price of crude oil reached about $ 130 a barrel after spiking to $ 140 briefly .
The immediate cause ?
Guesses by oil man T. Boone Pickens and Goldman Sachs that the price could go to $ 150 and $ 200 a barrel respectivly in the near future .
They were referring to what can be called the hoopla pricing party on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
( NYMEX )
Meanwhile , consumers , workers and small businesses are suffering with the price of gasoline at $ 4 a gallon and diesel at $ 4.50 a gallon .
Suffering but not protesting , except for a few demonstrations by independent truckers .
A consumer and small business revolt could be politically powerful .
But what would they revolt to achieve ?
Their government is paralyzed and is unable to indicate any action if oil goes up to $ 200 or $ 400 a barrel .
Washington , D.C. is leaving people defenseless and drawing no marker for when it will take action .
Oil was at $ 50 a barrel in January 2007 , then $ 75 a barrel in August 2007 .
Now at $ 130 or so a barrel , it is clear that oil pricing is speculative activity , having very little to do with physical supply and demand .
An essential product — petroleum — is set by speculators operating on rumor , greed , and fear of wild predictions .
Over the time since early 2007 , U.S. demand for petroleum has fallen by 1 percent and world demand has risen by 1.3 percent .
Supplies of crude are so plentiful , according to the Wall Street Journal , “ traders of physical crude oil say their market is suffering from too much supply , not too little . ”
Iran , for instance , is storing 25 million barrels of heavy , sour crude oil because , in the words of Hossein Kazempour Ardebili , Iran ’s oil governor , “ there are simply no buyers because the market has more than enough oil . ”
Mike Wittner , head of oil research at Societe Generale in London agrees .
“ There ’s various signals out there saying for right now , the markets are well supplied with crude . ”
Historically , oil has been afflicted with the control of monopolists .
From the late nineteenth century days of John D. Rockefeller , and his Standard Oil monopoly , to the emergence of the “ Seven Sisters ” oligopoly , made up of Standard Oil , Shell , BP , Texaco , Mobil , Gulf and Socal , to the rise of OPEC representing the major producing countries , the “ free market ” price of oil has been a mirage .
Despite the breakup of the Standard Oil company by the government ’s trustbusters about 100 years ago , selling cartels and buying oligopolies kept reasserting themselves .
In an ironic twist , the major price determinant has moved from OPEC ( having only 40 % of the world production ) and the oil companies to the speculators in the commodities markets .
What goes on in the essentially unregulated New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) — without Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) enforced margin requirements , and , unlike your personal purchases , untaxed — is now the place that leads to your skyrocketing gasoline bills .
OPEC and the Big Oil companies reap the benefits and say that it ’s not their doing , but that of the speculators .
Gives new meaning to “ passing the buck . ”
Deborah Fineman , president of Mitchell Supreme Fuel Co. in Orange , New Jersey , summed up the scene : “ Energy markets have been dictated for too long by hedge funds and speculators , who artificially manipulate the numbers for their own benefit .
The current market is n’t based on the sound principles of supply and demand but it is being rigged by companies and speculators who are jacking up prices for their own greed . ”
Harry C. Johnson , former banker who worked for many years inside Big Oil and ran his own small oil company in Oklahoma , blames the CFTC , the Department of Energy , the Administration , and Congress , as “ asleep at the switch on an issue that is probably costing U.S. consumers $ 1 billion per day . ”
He cites “ some industry experts , who profit greatly from the high price of crude , and have stated openly that the worldwide economic price of crude , absent speculators , would be around $ 50 to $ 60 per barrel .
Imagine , our government is letting your price for gasoline and home heating oil be determined by a gambling casino on Wall Street called NYMEX .
The people need regulatory protection from speculators and an excess profits tax on Big Oil .
In addition , a sane government would see the present price crises as an opportunity to expand our passenger and freight railroad capacity and technology .
A sane government would drop all subsidies and tax loopholes for Big Oil ’s huge profits and other fossil fuels and promote a national mission to solarize our economy to achieve major savings from energy conservation technology , retrofitting buildings , and upgrading efficiency standards for motor vehicles , home appliances , industrial engines and electric generating plants .
Those are the permanent ways to achieve energy independence , reduce our trade deficit , create good jobs that ca n’t be exported and protect the environmental health of people and nature .
Those are the reforms and advances that a muscular consumer , worker and small business revolt can focus on in the coming weeks .
What say you , America ?
Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent .
MIT physicists have taken a step toward understanding the puzzling nature of high - temperature superconductors , materials that conduct electricity with no resistance at temperatures well above absolute zero .
If superconductors could be made to work at temperatures as high as room temperature , they could have potentially limitless applications .
But first , scientists need to learn much more about how such materials work .
Using a new method , the MIT team made a surprising discovery that may overturn theories about the state of matter in which superconducting materials exist just before they start to superconduct .
Understanding high - temperature superconductors is one of the biggest challenges in physics today , according to Eric Hudson , MIT assistant professor of physics and senior author of the paper .*
Most superconductors only superconduct at temperatures near absolute zero , but about 20 years ago , it was discovered that some ceramics can superconduct at higher temperatures ( but usually still below 100 Kelvin , or - 173 Celsius ) .
Such high - temperature superconductors are now beginning to be used for many applications , including cell - phone base stations and a demo magnetic - levitation train .
But their potential applications could be much broader .

" If you could make superconductors work at room temperature , then the applications are endless , " said Hudson .
Superconductors are superior to ordinary metal conductors such as copper because current does n't lose energy as wasteful heat as it flows through them , thus allowing larger current densities .
Once a current is set in motion in a closed loop of superconducting material , it will flow forever .
In the Nature Physics study , the MIT researchers looked at a state of matter that superconductors inhabit just above the temperature at which they start to superconduct .
When a material is in a superconducting state , all electrons are at the same energy level .
The range of surrounding , unavailable electron energy levels is called the superconducting gap .
It is a critical component of superconduction , because it prevents electrons from scattering , thus eliminating resistance and allowing the unimpeded flow of current .
Just above the transition temperature when a material starts to superconduct , it exists in a state called the pseudogap .
This state of matter is not at all well understood , said Hudson .
advertisement
The researchers decided to investigate the nature of the pseudogap state by studying the properties of electron states that were believed to be defined by the characteristics of superconductors : the states surrounding impurities in the material .
It had already been shown that natural impurities in a superconducting material , such as a missing or replaced atom , allow electrons to reach energy levels that are normally within the superconducting gap , so they can scatter .
This can be observed using scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) .
The new MIT study shows that scattering by impurities occurs when a material is in the pseudogap state as well as the superconducting state .
That finding challenges the theory that the pseudogap is only a precursor state to the superconductive state , and offers evidence that the two states may coexist .
This method of comparing the pseudogap and superconducting state using STM could help physicists understand why certain materials are able to superconduct at such relatively high temperatures , said Hudson .
" Trying to understand what the pseudogap state is is a major outstanding question , " he said .
* The findings are reported in the February issue of Nature Physics .
Lead author of the paper is Kamalesh Chatterjee , a graduate student in physics .
MIT physics graduate students Michael Boyer and William Wise are also authors of the paper , along with Takeshi Kondo of the Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University and T. Takeuchi and H. Ikuta of Nagoya University , Japan .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Research Corporation .

I admit I get a slight case of schadenfreude in watching the mainstream media get forced to come around to what we in the liberal blogosphere have been saying all along : the Bush administration will be looked at as the worst ever .
As we come mercifully to the final months of the Bush presidency , The McLaughlin Group asks its panel ( made up of one " liberal " - Eleanor Clift and three conservatives - Monica Crowley , Mort Zuckerman and Michelle Bernard , naturally ) just how toxic the legacy of Bush & Cheney will be .
Try as they might to spin it to a more positive bend , none of the conservatives can truly deny McLaughlin 's list .
Clift :
Well , the notion that the terrorist threat would have been worse if he had not acted the way he did does not excuse a war of choice in Iraq that was then needlessly and poorly managed .
And also you left off the list ‘ shredded the US Constitution ' .
I thought your list was pretty good [ laughter ] and that 's why President Bush has a 29 % approval rating .
He deserves it !
Big kudos to Clift as well for challenging Monica Crowley 's mindless " we 're winning in Iraq " meme .
The clueless award goes not to Zuckerman for his equally mindless " at least we have n't had another terrorist attack " either , but to Michelle Bernard , who seeks to give credit to Bush for bringing our collective attention to education and women 's rights , especially in the Middle East .
Say what ?
I guess the fact that the conversation is about how lacking the Bush policies are in those areas does n't negate that we 're at least talking about them .
Transcripts below the fold :
McLaughlin : Is George W. Bush quote unquote radioactive ?

Rep . Tom Davis :
The President 's the face of the party , he 's absolutely radioactive at this point ...

We 're seen as an appendage to President Bush and between an unpopular war , you take a look at the gas prices , the housing costs and everything , we are being tied to that .

In the House of Representatives , three seats held special elections this year .
In the last six months , Democrats have picked up three long time Republican seats .
The GOP on March 8th lost an Illinois seat to a Democrat .
Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert had occupied the seat for 22 years .
Hastert resigned in November .
In May , Republicans lost a Louisiana House seat that has been in Republican hands also for 22 years , since 1986 , and most recently , Republicans lost a Mississippi special election .
That seat had also been held by Republicans for 14 years .
Question : how toxic is the Bush legacy for all 173 Republican House members up for re-election and 23 of the 49 Senate Republicans ?
Uh , Monica Crowley .
Crowley : Here 's what Republicans have to do going into November .
Number one , pray .
Number two , if the President offers to come to your district and campaign for you ...
McLaughlin : Run for your life .
Crowley : ...opt for the cardboard cutout of President Bush , rather than the actual guy .
And you also have to run ... they have to get back to conservative principles .
They have to talk about reducing the size of government , lower taxes , fighting the War on Terror , continuing that on the offense , talking about a national energy strategy , in a very real , tangible way , because gas prices are dominating the conversation .
And also talk about the need to appoint conservative judges .
[ crosstalk ]
McLaughlin : Let me ... let me go ahead with this exit question and you can fill it in with your own point now .
Exit question :
Is it too soon to conclude the following about the Bush / Cheney legacy ?
One :
They destroyed the GOP Congressional majority .
Two :
Tanked the value of the dollar .
Three : Created unprecedented red ink in the federal budget .
Four : Drew us into a quagmire in Iraq .
Five : Left us with a recession and inflation .
Six :
Then skedaddled out of town .
The question is , is it too soon to conclude that the foregoing constitutes the Bush / Cheney legacy ?
Zuckerman .
Zuckerman :
Well , I think you probably have weighted the case just slightly , John .
Now I do n't know why I think that .
[ laughter ]
McLaughlin :
What are the redeeming features ?
Zuckerman :
Well , I mean , the one that you have to imagine , okay , is that ...
McLaughlin : Imagine ?
Then it does n't exist .
Zuckerman : No , excuse me .
That the terrorist threat is something that might have been a lot worse had he not been as forceful as he was .
And the thing that I think astonishes everybody about this administration is not that their policies [ sic ] , but how incompetent they were in administering their policies .
Clift :
Well , the notion that the terrorist threat would have been worse if he had not acted the way he did does not excuse a war of choice in Iraq that was then needlessly and poorly managed .
And also you left off the list ‘ shredded the US Constitution ' .
I thought your list was pretty good [ laughter ] and that 's why President Bush has a 29 % approval rating .
He deserves it !
McLaughlin : Treat it as the abridged version .
The executive summary .
Clift :
You have to .
Zuckerman :
He has a higher disapproval rating than Richard Nixon did in the last week of his presidency .
McLaughlin : Truman was the lowest though ... I believe .
Clift :
Well , by two points , he was at 27 , I think , which at that time ...
McLaughlin :
That 's a lower figure ...
Clift :
Well , he has time .
Crowley : Okay , so that was a pretty loaded question , John , and I do think it 's too soon to pass judgment on the Bush / Cheney legacy .
They still have a couple of more months in office , anything could happen .
But on Mort 's point , this is ...
McLaughlin :
You talking about Israel ?
Crowley : ... this is , well , a number of things could happen .
The economy could improve , and by the way , we 're winning the war in Iraq now ...
[ crosstalk ]
... which even left - wing media that opposed the war - the Associated Press and so on - now admits we 're winning in Iraq .
There are a lot of ...
Clift : Could you describe what winning is ?
Winning , what does that mean ?
Crowley :
The violence is down dramatically , Eleanor .
There 's political reconciliation happening like mad in Iraq .
That does n't mean it 's not reversible , but ...
Clift :
And all those refugees is winning ?
Crowley : ... progress is in the right direction .
And I will say , in terms of the Bush / Cheney legacy , there is some time to go and it's too early to pass judgment .
Bernard :
Here is something positive , that I hope we'd all agree on about the Bush / Cheney legacy .
Despite all the negatives that you just listed , which are probably correct , the Bush ... President Bush brought education to the forefront of our national discussion .
For the first time in a very long time , people are talking about what happens in our K - 12 system , and how we prepare the future for a 21st century workforce .
Clift :
But they 're hating No Child Left Behind .
Bernard :
But we are having the discussion .
We have never had this discussion before , it is a national discussion , it 's an important one to have , regardless of how you feel about No Child Left Behind , and also to President Bush 's credit , for the first time in I think a very long time , we are actually talking about women 's rights as human rights in the Middle East .
We have had these discussions with Saudi Arabia , with Egypt , with Pakistan , with Iraq , and even in Iran , and I credit the administration for doing that .
McLaughlin : I think those are redemptive features .
I also think Mort 's point is quite helpful , helpful to redeem , and that is we have n't had a terrorist attack of the kind of significance that brought us to our knees with September the 11th .

Why are we asking this now ?
Because if confirmation were needed that crackdowns on drug use in the UK were having little effect , it came in a report by the UK Drug Policy Commission ( UKDPC ) , an independent group set up to examine the state of the nation 's drug trade .
The report , published yesterday , paints a grim picture , suggesting that the billions of pounds spent on attempts to reduce the availability of drugs on the streets have been in vain .
It said there was " remarkably little evidence " that action by customs officials , police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency has had any significant effect in disrupting illegal drug markets .
The report argued that the UK should try a radically different approach to tackling the misery brought about by drug - dealing and the crime and social disorder associated with it .
Others advocate taking the ultimate step – legalisation .
What is the state of the UK drugs trade ?
The report said the UK 's illegal drug market was one of the most lucrative in the world , with the trade worth a hefty £ 5.3 bn – a third of the size of the country 's tobacco market and 41 per cent of the alcohol market , despite the vast sums spent on attempts to limit supply .
Half of the trade centres on two of the most addictive and destructive drugs , crack cocaine and heroin .
The UK 's drugs trade is made up of about 3,000 wholesalers and 70,000 street - level dealers .
When it comes to the " Mr Bigs " keeping shipments of drugs flowing into the country , there are far fewer .
About 300 major importers are bringing in the drugs , said the report .
What do we spend trying to cut supplies ?
Taxpayers currently shell out £ 1.5 bn on measures designed to tackle the UK 's drugs problems .
Within that is the £ 380 m that goes towards the reduction of supply , the main target of the report 's criticisms .
A further £ 573 m goes towards drug abuse treatment .
That does n't even include the massive bill that results from drug - related crime .
In 2003 - 04 , that was estimated to have cost the public purse £ 4bn .
Do seizures have any effect ?
The report was unequivocal .
It said : " Despite significant drug and asset seizures and drug - related convictions in recent years , drug markets have proven to be extremely resilient .
They are highly fluid and adapt effectively to government and law enforcement interventions . "
It added : " While the availability of controlled drugs is restricted by definition , it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the UK . "
How do we know ?
A sure sign that attempts to strangle the supply of drugs have come to little is the fact that prices have continued to fall .
Street prices for heroin , cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis have all fallen since the start of the decade .
The average price for a gram of heroin in 2000 was £ 70 , but that had fallen to £ 45 by last year .
Cocaine has more than halved in price in some areas – from £ 65 a gram in 2000 to as little as £ 30 a gram last year .
Even though the number of seizures more than doubled between 1996 and 2005 , that only makes up 12 per cent of heroin and nine per cent of all cocaine .
The crux of the problem is that experts believe authorities would need to seize between six and eight times more than that to make a real dent in the drugs business .
That does n't seem realistic , leading some – current and former policemen among them – to call for a change in tactics .
The results of the study came as no surprise to Danny Kushlick , head of policy at the pressure group Transform .
He said : " This is nothing new – we 've known that prohibition measures have n't worked for 20 years .
But the situation is actually worse than the report suggests .
It is the measures of prohibition that have caused drugs problems , and pushed the trade into the hands of organised crime and street corner dealers . "
Why do current tactics have so little effect ?
One of the problems is that the drug trade is extremely adaptable .
According to the report , even when a major drug seizure is made or a high - level dealer is convicted , little changes on the streets .
Other dealers move in , or the remaining supplies are made less pure so they last through the period of shortage .
The dealing and buying , in most cases , carries on regardless .
What needs to change ?
For a start , the obsession with big drugs busts .
Police having their picture taken in front of table - loads of captured drugs may make a good photo opportunity , but do not do much to help the communities affected by drug dealing , the report said .
David Blakey , a former president of the Association of Chief Police Officers and a commissioner for UKDPC , said the police were still being judged on old measures , such as seizure rates .
" This is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug - related harm , " he said .
" Of course , drug dealers must be brought to justice , but we should recognise and encourage the wider role that the police and other law enforcement officials can play in reducing the impact of drug markets on our communities . "
Instead , more emphasis should be placed on hitting drug markets that cause the most " collateral damage " to surrounding communities – such as dealing associated with prostitution , human trafficking and gang violence .
Anything else ?
Instead of going after the never - ending supply of bad guys , it suggests tackling issues from the point of view of the communities hardest hit by the drugs trade .
Above all , it claims that forming partnerships between police , local communities and other related workers is vital in ridding an area of drug problems .
It also advocates prevention – tackling problem - spots before they get out of hand .
Should we just legalise drugs and have done with it ?
According to its advocates , including the Chief Constable of North Wales Police , Richard Brunstrom , and Transform , legalisation would turn drug - taking from a crime issue into a health issue .
Drugs could be vetted for their quality , while the trade would be taken from the grasps of criminal gangs and drug lords .
Legalisation seems to be making a lot of sense to many .
Even some politicians admit to being sympathetic to the idea in private .
But there is one glaring problem with the policy – the Amsterdam issue .
When hedonists around the world got wind of the city 's liberal drugs laws and hash cafes , they all started making the pilgrimage .
Would many people really tolerate the influx of a new type of hedonist holiday - maker ?
Probably not .
Until the whole world agrees to end prohibition at the same time , it will probably remain impossible .
So is the approach counter - productive ?
Yes ...
* Preventing supply has been very unsuccessful – the drugs trade is worth £ 5.3 bn
* A sharp fall in street prices since 2000 suggests more than ever is getting through
* Even after big seizures and arrests , other dealers simply move in to fill the gap
No ...
* Tackling supply is only one strand of the strategy – more is spent on treatment
* Police must make high - profile seizures for as long as they are judged on them
* Trying other approaches to the problem should not mean drug dealers escape justice

Two months ago the Coast Guard cutter Dallas ( pictured ) sailed from Charleston , South Carolina .
Rather than heading south to intercept drug runners and migrants – two of the biggest Coastie missions – the 40 - year - old ship veered east ... and headed across the Atlantic to the West African coast .
Dallas ' recently - wrapped deployment , though unusual for a quasi-military law enforcement agency , continues an accelerating trend in the U.S. sea services .
The Navy and Coast Guard are shifting away from traditional missions in favor of " soft power " exercises in the the world 's neglected shallow - water zones ( aka " littorals " ) .
Navy amphibious and hospital ships carry trainers , doctors , aid workers and scientists to Africa and South America , with the goal of alleviating environmental and humanitarian problems that could bloom into crises .
Coast Guard cutters , Dallas included , bring law - enforcement training teams to developing countries in order to improve the countries ' ability to police themselves .
Dallas skipper Captain Robert Wagner said the Coast Guard is perfect for the African mission .
Dallas paid visits to Cape Verde , Gabon and Equatorial Guinea , among other nations .
" Look at the threats these countries face : migrant interdiction , drug interdiction , pollution response – these are things the [ U.S. ]
Coast Guard also faces every day , " Wagner told DANGER ROOM today during a Pentagon teleconference .
" Also some of the resources these countries have , small patrol boats , are similar to what the Coast Guard has . "
But some critics have questioned the Coast Guard 's increasing emphasis on " luxury " overseas deployments at a time when the tiny service 's aging fleet is stretched thin , resulting in shortfalls in domestic missions .
The Coast Guard 's $ 25 - billion " Deepwater " modernization plan ( new ships , airplanes and electronics ) has been hit hard by scandal , technical failure and delay , meaning old cutters must keep on keeping on for years longer than planned .
Wagner said Dallas suffered not one , but several engine room fires during her African cruise – and kept right on chugging .
Consider that a smallish fire on the aircraft carrier George Washington a few weeks back resulted in several senior officers losing their jobs .
In the rusting , overworked Coast Guard , catastrophes are almost routine .

You remember the new GI Bill ?
The one that John McCain opposed because it was TOO GENEROUS to our troops fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan .
McCain can remind us again and again how he was a POW , so this proves that he cares about the troops , and I suspect he ’ll remind us of that fact yet again in response to this latest criticism from Biden , but it does n’t negate the fact that there are American service members in Iraq and Afghanistan who are n’t getting more benefits because of John McCain .
Tell them why John McCain did n’t think their sacrifice merited all the benefits Senator Webb ’s bill was offering them .
The Republicans like to talk all patriotic , but when you put their patriotism into practice , it does n’t look very patriotic at all .
Make John McCain explain exactly what constitutes “ too generous ” for our troops ?
From CBS :
“ George Bush initially opposed it , John McCain stood with him and he called Jim Webb ’s effort , quote , too generous .
Ladies and gentlemen , if John McCain had his way on that G.I.
Bill , those military personnel who served two tours in Iraq or Afghanistan would not qualify for the same benefits that anyone in the ‘ regular Army or Marine corps ’ did . ”
“ Ask yourself the question , who supports our troops ?
Who supports those National Guard personnel ?
Who supports those reservists who make up 40 percent of the people ? ” asked Biden , and turned to Gov. Ed Rendell , D - Pa. , in the crowd .
“ I do n’t have to tell you that , Governor .
You see them dispatched every day from your state , and you ’re there like I am when that flag - draped coffin comes home for some . ”
As he speech went on , Biden ’s tone turned from critical to one of disgust .
“ I am sick and tired of this Republican garbage , ” Biden said to applause from the crowd of 3,000 supporters .
“ I am sick and tired of being told that we do n’t care . ”
While the McCain campaign called Biden ’s comments “ absurd ” , a McCain campaign aide speaking on background , when asked if Biden was accurate in saying that McCain had called the G.I.
Bill ‘ too generous ’ , said “ I do n’t know . ” McCain , who is a veteran , said last spring that he feared the bill would deter soldiers from re-enlisting .
John McCain did n’t even bother showing up to vote for the GI Bill when it came up on the Senate floor .
Here is what Obama had to say at the time :
This just in : Sarah Palin has NOT given up her spot of the Republican presidential ticket .
Nor do we expect her to .
But we broach the prospect simply because a nationally syndicated conservative columnist , Kathleen Parker , has called for Palin to do exactly that .
Parker 's piece showed up at midday Friday on the National Review website ( you do n't get much more conservative than that ) and since then has generated lots of buzz ( and been picked up , not surprisingly , by lots of liberal blogs ) .
The columnist , who resides in South Carolina and posts regularly at Townhall.com ( another conservative outlet ) , was high on Palin earlier this month in the immediate aftermath of her selection as John McCain 's running mate .
In a commentary following Palin 's boffo speech at the Republican National Convention , Parker wrote that the Alaska governor had shown " strength , conviction , determination , confidence , a willingness to rumble and fearlessness . "
Now , in the wake of Palin 's less - than - well - received Q & A with Katie Couric of CBS , Parker writes :
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , I ’ve been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I ’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .
Palin filibusters .
She repeats words , filling space with deadwood .
Cut the verbiage and there ’s not much content there .
Parker , who if nothing else has increased her visibility , concludes her column with her call for Palin to " bow out [ of the national race ] for personal reasons , perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn . "
Those on the left with a conspiratorial bent may wonder if the latest developments in the Palin saga are part of a hidden effort to create an environment in which she can't help but exceed expectations in her Thursday debate with Joe Biden .

The KDE Community has announced the availability of KDE 3.5.10 , a maintenance release of KDE , the free desktop for GNU Linux and other Unix flavors .
The KDE desktop is the system of choice for a broad array of Linux users .
And although the KDE community released KDE 4.1 at the end of July , KDE e.V. , the nonprofit organization that represents the KDE Project , maintains the KDE 3.5 series for its user base of large organizations that do not migrate to the next major release as quickly as others .
The release of KDE 3.5.10 on Aug. 26 follows the release of KDE 3.5.9 in February .
KDE 3.5.10 includes improvements in the KDE Kicker , which is the KDE application starter panel , and KPDF , the desktop 's PDF viewer .
The panel improvements include improved visibility on transparent backgrounds , themed arrow buttons in applets that were missing them , and layout and anti-aliasing fixes in various applets .
KDE e.V. officials said KDE 3.5.10 ships with a basic desktop and 15 other packages , including a PIM ( personal information management ) package and packages for administration , network , " edutainment , " utilities , multimedia , games , art work and Web development .
KDE 's tools and applications are available in 65 languages .
KDE officials said users should expect to see the KDE 3.5.10 enhancements in the next release of their Linux products , as most of the Linux distributions and Unix operating systems do not immediately incorporate new KDE releases , but will integrate KDE 3.5.10 packages in their next releases .
KDE officials also announced that the FSFE ( Free Software Foundation Europe ) has welcomed the adoption of the Fiduciary License Agreement by the KDE project .
The FLA is a copyright assignment that allows free software projects to assign their copyrights to a single organization or person .
Adriaan de Groot , vice president of KDE e.V. , said KDE e.V. has endorsed the use of a particular FLA as the preferred way to assign copyright to the association .
" We recognize that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise ; it is in no way pushed upon KDE contributors , " de Groot said .
" There are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the FLA , but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done , with little fuss . "
Georg Greve , president of Free Software Foundation Europe , said :
" We see the adoption of the FLA by KDE as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community .
The FLA was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long - term protection and reliability .
KDE is among the most important Free Software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop . "
KDE 's adoption of the FLA is the result of cooperation between KDE e.V. and FSFE 's Freedom Task Force over the last 18 months .
In the last couple of years , various friends have adopted dairy - free or gluten - free diets for themselves or their children .

In reading about the federal bailout of all those financial wheeler - dealer outfits that are supposedly “ too big to fail , ” the layman may be forgiven for failing to comprehend the intricacies of the arcane financial instruments currently backfiring on their whiz - kid inventors .
Such exotic creatures as “ credit default swaps ” may elude the understanding of the hoi polloi , but one thing the man in the street does know : he ‘ll never be “ too big to fail , ” of that he can be sure .
He ’s just not the Bear - Stearns type , and Congress would never shell out a penny before he loses his savings and his home , which  due to the propaganda of Panglossian economics , whereby houses stopped being homes and became investments  amount to pretty much the same thing .
The paper - pushers of Wall Street made untold trillions out of a policy that was doomed to fail [ . pdf ] in advance , and whose critics have long predicted would end in precisely the manner our tale of economic woe is unfolding .
The policy of bank credit expansion , which enriches the already wealthy at the expense of the rest of us , has a fatal allure .
It induces an initial euphoria , the false promise of permanent prosperity .
This Panglossian view is the perfect economic system for an emerging empire , especially one with such inflated pretensions as ours .
It is the economics of hubris  the same grandiosity that let us imagine we could implant “ democracy ” in the arid soil of Iraq and make the desert bloom .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , the U.S. bestrode the earth like a colossus , America ’s stock was rising , and the pride that goeth before a fall imbued our leaders with the illusion that they could n’t fail .
The American empire , they thought , is too big to fail .
It ’s the end of history  and the rest will just be a mopping - up operation , that will be well worth the costs .
The failed policies that led to our current economic predicament  the whole system of central banking and fiat currency  are precisely those policies that benefited those who are now demanding to be bailed out .
They may have bankrupted the country , but you can be damned sure they are n’t going down with the rest of us , no sirree !
This outrageous rip - off is mirrored in the foreign policy realm , where the very same crowd that dragged us waist - deep into the Middle Eastern quicksand are lecturing us from every podium .
The neocons who brought us the Iraq war are directing John McCain ’s campaign , hanging on to power for dear life , shamelessly touting their alleged “ success ” even as the $ 3 trillion bill comes in and the people ask “ For what ? ’
These are the real dead - enders , the ones who believe that George W. Bush never implemented his self - proclaimed “ global democratic revolution , ” but they will .
The same foreign lobbyists who pushed for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by U.S. force of arms have now turned their sights on Iran .
The same newspaper columnists and professional know - it - alls who imagined that we would have a quick victory in Iraq  that it would be a “ cakewalk , ” as one of the more arrogant neocons once put it  are still dominating the official discourse with their calls to action on this front and that .
Bill Kristol , the little Lenin of the neocons , who made the Iraq war his vocation , was awarded a coveted pulpit on the op - ed page of the New York Times .
Other people are demoted for advocating failed policies , but members in good standing of the War Party are promoted .
They , too , are too big to fail .
When the bill comes due , American taxpayers  and grieving parents and loved ones of the fallen  will have to pay , while the authors of our suicidal foreign policy get off scot - free .
The war profiteers are n’t just the arms manufacturers , the Halliburtons , and the “ private ” international security firms who do the empire ’s dirty work .
Key to the War Party are the intellectuals who gain prestige and real power over policymaking and public opinion on the strength of their reputations as paladins of interventionism .
In some cases , these two types are embodied in the same people , Richard Perle being the exemplar .
In any event , what ’s becoming increasingly clear is that the bailout brothers are all members of the same clan : think of them as a Mafia family , with a strict hierarchy of authority and command , albeit an informal one .
At the top is the Don , finance capital , which controls the engine and sits at the dashboard pressing buttons according to a pattern : first inflation , then deflation , boom then bust , peace and then war again .
But the bailout boys always parachute to safety before disaster envelopes the rest of us .
Which is why failure only emboldens them .
Our rulers really do believe their empire is too big to fail , but of all the would - be lords of creation , our own ruling elite may have the shortest reign  and the hardest fall .
The engine that runs the machinery of imperialism is breaking down at key junctures , and the whole structure is teetering and creaking ominously , as if to presage the coming implosion .
For the truth of the matter is that the very bigness of the American Imperium , the sheer scope of its rulers ’ ambition , is precisely what is fated to bring about its downfall , and a very messy and painful descent it will surely be .
As I relate in Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement , during Rose Wilder Lane ’s eye- opening trip to the Soviet Union in the 1920s she met a Russian peasant who predicted , with perfect accuracy , the fate of the commissars some 70 years later :
“ ‘ It ’s too big , ’ he said .
‘ Too big .
At the top , it is too small .
It will not work .
In Moscow , there are only men , and man is not God .
A man has only a man ’s head , and one hundred heads together do not make one great head .
No. Only God can know Russia . ' ”
The problem is that some men think they are gods .
In the end , however , we will all pay the price for their hubris  the guilty as well as the innocent  as the American empire meets the fate of its Soviet predecessor , and for the same reason .
Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama speaks to supporters during an event at Mountain Range High School in Westminster , Colorado , September 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
WESTMINSTER , Colo . ( Reuters ) - Presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Monday he believed Congress would ultimately pass a proposed $ 700 billion financial bailout deal , despite its initial rejection by the House of Representatives .
“ I ’m confident that we ’re going to get there .
It ’s going to be a little rocky , ” said Obama , who added that “ things are never smooth in Congress . ”
The Democratic White House hopeful said he had spoken by phone with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers following the rejection of the measure by the House .
“ The stability of our entire economy is at risk so we ’ve been left with no good options , ” he said .
He urged Americans and the financial markets to remain calm after the bailout deal failed , provoking a drop of about 5 percent or more in many U.S. stock market averages .
The iPod Touch makes a great e-book reader , with a large , high - resolution screen and touch navigation .
You ’ll need to jailbreak it first ( find out how at the Wired How - To Wiki ) and install either the free Books application or the $ 35 i2 Reader ( both of which are found in the Installer ) .
Any text file can then be loaded up and you simply swipe through the pages .
I2 Reader also lets you bookmark pages to go back to later .
That ’s fine , but the little iPod gets uncomfortable to hold after a while , and it lacks the presence of a real book .
Imagine seeing an attractive girl ( or boy ) sitting outside a pavement café , drinking an espresso , smoking a Gauloise and reading a tatty paperback .
It ’s a romantic image which is shattered when you swap the book for a PDA .
I decided to disguise my iPod as a book , and if that was n’t pretentious enough , I put it in a modded Moleskine , the notebook of choice for fops and dandies the world over .
Follow along to see how it turned out .
The Tools
One Moleskine sketchbook , chosen because it has less pages than the notebook .
When you have to cut a square in every one , this makes a difference .
One jail - broken iPod Touch , one X - acto - type knife and some PVA glue .
Sizing Up
The Moleskine is the perfect size .
It seems pointless putting a small iPod inside a bigger book .
The next stage was to draw around it with a pencil and then get cutting .
I put a couple of index cards in between the last page and the thicker flyleaves so I did n’t cut through .
In fact , the back part remains intact and the Moleskine ’s pocket is still accessible .
Cutting the Holes
This takes a while , and is best done using a straight steel edge as a guide .
I used a plastic one and ended up taking chunks out of it , which , as you can see , does n’t make for a very clean edge .
Still , the plan is to cover this up at the end , so it does n’t matter too much .
Gluing the Pages
This looked like it would take even longer than the cutting , so after around ten pages I mixed some of the PVA with water and used a wadded up kitchen towel to brush the liquid in from the side .
This soaked the pages a little , so I slid in two index cards at each end to protect the front and back pages .
Then , the whole lot went under a stack of books for a few hours .
Finishing
Here ’s the book after being glued , with a nice little iPod - shaped hole in the middle .
Let ’s see if it fits …
Strangely , the psychological effect of a real book is quite strong , and I kept forgetting that I had an iPod in there .
Which meant it kept falling out every time I tipped the book .
The book is still a little messy , too , so I thought I ’d add a flap to the top edge to keep the iPod in as well as tidying things up .
There it is .
The next step is to cut a ( neat ) hole in the front page and glue that down .
The Finished Product
There it is .
The top strip works well to keep the iPod in place , and holding a book is a lot more comfortable and natural than a bare iPod .
The book , by the way , is Cory Doctorow ’s new novel , Little Brother , freely available as a download from his website .
I recommend it .
MkII of the Moleskine case is already underway .
It needs a better way to hold the iPod in place , and there will also be a hole drilled top left where I will mount the clicker mechanism from a ballpoint pen to press the on / off switch .
Right now , though , I ’m off to a bar to see if my new pickup scheme works .
PHYS771 Lecture 19 : Time Travel
Scott Aaronson
Scribe : Chris Granade
Last time we talked about free will , superintelligent predictors , and Dr. Evil planning to destroy the earth from his moon base .
Today I 'd like to talk about a more down - to - earth topic : time travel .
The first point I have to make is one that Carl Sagan made : we 're all time travelers — at the rate of one second per second !
Har har !
Moving on , we have to distinguish between time travel into the distant future and into the past .
Those are very different .
Travel into the distant future is by far the easier of the two .
There are several ways to do it :
Cryogenically freeze yourself and thaw yourself out later .
Travel at relativistic speed .
Go close to a black hole horizon .
A : The Earth ages , too .
Scott : Yeah , so all your friends will be dead when you get back .
What 's a solution to that ?
A : Bring the whole Earth with you , and leave your computer floating in space .
Scott : Well , at least bring all your friends with you !
Let 's suppose you 're willing to deal with the inconvenience of the Earth having aged exponentially many years .
Are there any other problems with this proposal ?
The biggest problem is , how much energy does it take to accelerate to relativistic speed ?
Ignoring the time spent accelerating and decelerating , if you travel at a v fraction of the speed of light for a proper time t , then the elapsed time in your computer 's reference frame is :
It follows that , if you want t′ to be exponentially larger than t , then v has to be exponentially close to 1 .
There might already be fundamental difficulties with that , coming from quantum gravity , but let 's ignore that for now .
The more obvious problem is , you 're going to need an exponential amount of energy to accelerate to this speed v.
Think about your fuel tank , or whatever else is powering your spaceship .
It 's going to have to be exponentially large !
Just for locality reasons , how is the fuel from the far parts of the tank going to affect you ?
Here , I 'm using the fact that spacetime has a constant number of dimensions .
( Well , and I 'm also using the Schwarzchild bound , which limits the amount of energy that can be stored in a finite region of space : your fuel tank certainly can't be any denser than a black hole ! )
Let 's talk about the more interesting kind of time travel : the backwards kind .
Can closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) exist in Nature ?
This question has a very long history of being studied by physicists on weekends .
It was discovered early on , by Gödel and others , that classical general relativity admits CTC solutions .
All of the known solutions , however , have some element that can be objected to as being " unphysical . "
For example , some solutions involve wormholes , but that requires " exotic matter " having negative mass to keep the wormhole open .
They all , so far , involve either non-standard cosmologies or else types of matter or energy that have yet to be experimentally observed .
But that 's just classical general relativity .
Once you put quantum mechanics in the picture , it becomes an even harder question .
General relativity is not just a theory of some fields in spacetime , but of spacetime itself , and so once you quantize it , you 'd expect there to be fluctuations in the causal structure of spacetime .
The question is , why should n't that produce CTCs ?
Incidentally , there 's an interesting metaquestion here : why have physicists found it so hard to create a quantum theory of gravity ?
The technical answer usually given is that , unlike ( say ) Maxwell 's equations , general relativity is not renormalizable .
But I think there 's also a simpler answer , one that 's much more understandable to a doofus layperson like me .
The real heart of the matter is that general relativity is a theory of spacetime itself , and so a quantum theory of gravity is going to have to be talking about superpositions over spacetime and fluctuations of spacetime .
One of the things you 'd expect such a theory to answer is whether closed timelike curves can exist .
So quantum gravity seems " CTC - hard " , in the sense that it's at least as hard as determining if CTCs are possible !
And even I can see that this can't possibly be a trivial question to settle .
Even if CTCs are impossible , presumably they 're not going to be proven impossible without some far - reaching new insight .
Of course , this is just one instantiation of a general problem : that no one really has a clear idea of what it means to treat spacetime itself quantum - mechanically .
In the field I come from , it 's never our place to ask if some physical object exists or not , it 's to assume it exists and see what computations we can do with it .
Thus , from now on , we 'll assume CTCs exist .
What would the consequences be for computational complexity ?
Perhaps surprisingly , I 'll be able to give a clear and specific answer to that .
So how would you exploit a closed timelike curve to speed up computation ?
First let 's consider the naïve idea : compute the answer , then send it back in time to before your computer started .
From my point of view , this " algorithm " does n't work even considered on its own terms .
( It 's nice that , even with something as wacky as time travel , we can definitively rule certain ideas out ! )
I know of at least two reasons why it does n't work .
Anyone want to take a shot ?
A : The universe can still end in the time you 're computing the answer .
Scott : Yes !
Even in this model where you can go back in time , it seems to me that you still have to quantify how much time you spend in the computation .
The fact that you already have the answer at the beginning does n't change the fact that you still have to do the computation !
Refusing to count the complexity of that computation is like maxing out your credit card , then not worrying about the bill .
You 're going to have to pay up later !
A : Could n't you just run the computation for an hour , go back in time , continue the computation for another hour , then keep repeating until you 're done ?
Scott : Ah !
That 's getting toward my second reason .
You just gave a slightly less naïve idea , which also fails , but in a more interesting way .
A : The naïve idea involves iterating over the solution space , which could be uncountably large .
Scott : Yeah , but let 's assume we 're talking about an NP - complete problem , so that the solution space is finite .
If we could merely solve NP - complete problems , we'd be pretty happy .
Let 's think some more about the proposal where you compute for an hour then go back in time , compute for another hour then go back again and so on .
The trouble with this proposal is that it does n't take seriously that you 're going back in time .
You 're treating time as a spiral , as some sort of scratchpad that you can keep erasing and writing over , but you 're not going back to some other time , you 're going back to the time that you started from .
Once you accept that this is what we 're talking about , you immediately start having to worry about the Grandfather Paradox ( i.e. , where you go back in time and kill your grandfather ) .
For example , what if your computation takes as input a bit b from the future , and produces as output a bit ¬b , which then goes back in time to become the input ?
Now when you use ¬b as input , you compute ¬¬b = b as output , and so on .
This is just the Grandfather Paradox in a computational form .
We have to come up with some account of what happens in this situation .
If we 're talking about closed timelike curves at all , then we 're talking about something where this sort of behavior can happen , and we need some theory of what results .
My own favorite theory was proposed by David Deutsch in 1991 .
His proposal was that if you just go to quantum mechanics , the problem is solved .
Indeed , quantum mechanics is overkill : it works just as well to go to a classical probabilistic theory .
In the latter case , you have some probability distribution ( p 1 , ... , p n ) over the possible states of your computer .
Then the computation that takes place within the closed timelike curve can be modeled as a Markov chain , which transforms this distribution to a different one .
What should we impose if we want to avoid grandfather paradoxes ?
A : That the output distribution should be the same as the input one ?
Scott : Exactly .
We should impose the requirement that Deutsch calls causal consistency : the computation within the CTC must map the input probability distribution to itself .
In deterministic physics , we know that this sort of consistency can't always be achieved — that 's just another way of stating the Grandfather Paradox .
But as soon as we go to probabilistic theories , well , it 's a basic fact that every Markov chain has at least one stationary distribution .
In this case of the Grandfather Paradox , the unique solution is that you 're born with probability ½ , and if you 're born , you go back in time and kill your grandfather .
Thus , the probability that you go back in time and kill your grandfather is ½ , and hence you 're born with probability ½.
Everything is consistent ; there 's no paradox .
One thing that I like about Deutsch 's resolution is that it immediately suggests a model of computation .
First we get to choose a polynomial - size circuit C : { 0,1}n → { 0,1}n .
Then Nature chooses a probability distribution D over strings of length n such that C( D ) =D , and gives us a sample y drawn from D. ( If there 's more than one fixed - point D , then we 'll suppose to be conservative that Nature makes her choice adversarially . )
Finally , we can perform an ordinary polynomial - time computation on the sample y.
We 'll call the complexity class resulting from this model P CTC .
What can we say about this class ?
My first claim is that NP ⊆ P CTC ; that is , closed timelike curve computers can solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
Does anyone see why ?
More concretely , suppose we have a Boolean formula φ in n variables and we want to know if there 's a satisfying assignment .
What should our circuit C do ?
A : If the input is a satisfying assignment , spit it back out ?
Scott : Good .
And what if the input is n't a satisfying assignment ?
A : Iterate to the next assignment ?
Scott : Right !
And go back to the beginning if you 've reached the last assignment .
We 'll just have this loop over all possible assignments , and we stop as soon as we get to a satisfying one .
Assuming there exists a satisfying assignment , the only stationary distributions will be concentrated on satisfying assignments .
So when we sample from a stationary distribution , we 'll certainly see such an assignment .
( If there are no satisfying assignments , then the stationary distribution is uniform . )
Q : So we 're assuming that Nature gives us this stationary distribution for free ?
Scott : Yes .
Once we set up the CTC , its evolution has to be causally consistent to avoid grandfather paradoxes .
But that means Nature has to solve a hard computational problem to make it consistent !
That 's the key idea that we 're exploiting .
Related to this algorithm for solving NP - complete problems is what Deutsch calls the " knowledge creation paradox . "
The paradox is best illustrated through the movie Star Trek IV .
The Enterprise crew has gone back in time to the present ( meaning to 1986 ) in order to find a humpback whale and transport it to the 23rd century .
But to build a tank for the whale , they need a type of plexiglass that has n't been invented yet .
So in desperation , they go to the company that will invent the plexiglass , and reveal the molecular formula to that company .
They then wonder : how did the company end up inventing the plexiglass ?
Hmmmm ....
Note that the knowledge creation paradox is a time travel paradox that 's fundamentally different from the grandfather paradox , because here there 's no actual logical inconsistency .
This paradox is purely one of computational complexity : somehow this hard computation gets performed , but where was the work put in ?
In the movie , somehow this plexiglass gets invented without anyone ever having taken the time to invent it !
As a side note , my biggest pet peeve about time travel movies is how they always say , " Be careful not to step on anything , or you might change the future ! "
" Make sure this guy goes out with that girl like he was supposed to ! "
Dude — you might as well step on anything you want .
Just by disturbing the air molecules , you 've already changed everything .
OK , so we can solve NP - complete problems efficiently using time travel .
But can we do more than that ?
What is the actual computational power of closed timelike curves ?
I claim that certainly , P CTC is contained in PSPACE .
Does anyone see why ?
Well , we 've got this exponentially large set of possible inputs x ∈ {0 , 1}n to the circuit C , and our basic goal is to find an input x that eventually cycles around ( that is , such that C( x ) =x , or C ( C ( x ) ) =x , or ... ) .
For then we 'll have found a stationary distribution .
But finding such an x is clearly a PSPACE computation .
For example , we can iterate over all possible starting states x , and for each one apply C up to 2n times and see if we ever get back to x .
Certainly , this is in PSPACE .
My next claim is that P CTC is equal to PSPACE .
That is , CTC computers can solve not just NP - complete problems , but all problems in PSPACE .
Why ?
Well , let M 0 , M 1 , ... be the successive configurations of a PSPACE machine M. Also , let M acc be the " halt and accept " configuration of M , and let M rej be the " halt and reject " configuration .
Our goal is to find which of these configurations the machine goes into .
Note that each of these configurations takes a polynomial number of bits to write down .
Then , we can define a polynomial - size circuit C that takes as input some configuration of M plus some auxiliary bit b .
The circuit will act as follows :
C( 〈M i , b〉 ) = 〈M i + 1 , b〉 C( 〈M acc , b〉 ) = 〈M 0 , 1 〉 C( 〈M rej , b〉 ) = 〈M 0 , 0 〉
Now if we think about what 's going on , we have two parallel computations : one with the answer bit set to 0 , the other with the answer bit set to 1 .
If the true answer is 0 , then the rejecting computation will go around in a loop , while the accepting computation will lead into that loop .
Likewise , if the true answer is 1 , it 's the accepting computation that will go around in a loop .
The only stationary distribution , then , is a uniform distribution over the computation steps with b set to the correct answer .
We can then read off a sample and look at b , to find out whether the PSPACE machine accepts or rejects .
Thus we can tightly characterize P CTC as equal to PSPACE .
One way to think about it is that having a closed timelike curve makes time and space equivalent as computational resources .
In retrospect , maybe we should have expected that all along , but we still have to show it !
Now , there 's an obvious question that we have to ask : what if we have a quantum computer acting inside the closed timelike curve ?
Obviously , we need to know the answer .
How does this work ?
Now we have a polynomial - sized quantum circuit instead of a classical circuit , and we say that we have two sets of qubits : " closed timelike curve qubits " and " chronology - respecting qubits . "
We can do some quantum computation on both of them , but we 're only really going to care about the CTC qubits .
There will be some induced superoperator S that acts on the CTC qubits .
( Recall that a superoperator is just a general quantum operation , not necessarily unitary . )
Then , Nature will adversarially find a mixed state ρ that is a fixed point of S : i.e. , such that S ( ρ ) = ρ .
It 's not always possible to find a pure state ρ=|ψ〉〈ψ| with that property , but by basic linear algebra ( Deutsch worked out the details , and I wo n't drag you through them ) there is always such a mixed state .
Q : So ρ is a state just over the CTC qubits ?
Scott : Yes .
The only real reason for the other qubits is that without them , the superoperator would always be unitary , in which case the maximally mixed state I would always be fixed point .
And that would trivialize the model .
As a general principle , quantum computers can simulate classical ones , and ( as is easily shown ) it 's no different when we throw in closed timelike curves .
So we can certainly say that BQP CTC contains PSPACE .
But what 's an upper bound on BQP CTC ?
A : EXPSPACE ?
Scott : EXPSPACE would certainly work , yes .
Can we give a better upper bound ?
So we 're given an n-qubit superoperator ( specified implicitly by a circuit ) and we want to find a fixed point of it .
This is basically a linear algebra problem .
We know that you can do linear algebra in time polynomial in the dimension of the Hilbert space , which in this case is 2n .
This implies that we can simulate BQP CTC in EXP .
So we now have that BQP CTC is somewhere between PSPACE and EXP .
In my survey paper on NP - complete Problems and Physical Reality a few years ago , pinning this down further was the main technical open problem !
Recently John Watrous and I were able to solve the problem .
Our result is that BQP CTC = P CTC = PSPACE .
In other words , if closed timelike curves existed , then quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical ones .
Q : Do we know anything about other classes with closed timelike curves ?
Like PSPACE CTC ?
Scott :
That one is going to be PSPACE again .
On the other hand , you can't just take any complexity class and append a CTC to it .
You have to say what that means , and for some classes ( like NP ) it wo n't even make any sense .
In the last part of the lecture I can give you a little hint of why BQP CTC ⊆ PSPACE .
Given a superoperator S that 's described by a polynomial - size quantum circuit , which maps n qubits to n qubits , our goal is to compute a mixed state ρ such that S ( ρ ) = ρ .
We wo n't be able to write down ρ explicitly ( it would be far too large to fit in a PSPACE machine 's memory ) , but all we 're really aiming to do is to simulate the result of some polynomial - time computation that could have been performed on ρ .
Let vec( ρ ) be the " vectorization " of ρ ( a vector with 22n components , one for each matrix entry of ρ ) .
Then there exists a 22n × 22n matrix M such that for all ρ , S ( ρ ) =ρ if and only if M vec ( ρ ) = vec ( ρ ) .
In other words , we can just expand everything out from matrices to vectors , and then our goal is to find a +1 eigenvector of M .
Define P := lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) ( I − zM ) - 1 .
Then by Taylor expansion :
MP = M lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) ( I+zM+z2M2+⋅⋅⋅ ) = lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) ( M+zM2+z2M3+⋅⋅⋅ ) = lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) / z ( zM+z2M2+z3M3+⋅⋅⋅ ) = lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) / z [ ( I − zM ) - 1 − I ] = lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) / z
( I − zM ) - 1 = lim z → 1 ( 1 − z ) ( I − zM ) - 1 = P
In other words , P projects onto fixed - points of M . For all v , M( Pv ) = ( Pv ) .
So now all we need to do is start with some arbitrary vector v—say vec( I ) where I is the maximally mixed state — and then compute :
But how do we do apply this matrix P in PSPACE ?
Well , we can apply M in PSPACE since it 's just a polynomial - time quantum computation .
But what about taking a matrix inverse ?
Here , we borrow something from computational linear algebra .
Csanky 's algorithm , proposed in the 1970's , lets us compute the inverse of an n×n matrix not merely in polynomial time , but by a circuit of depth log2n .
Similar algorithms are actually used in practice today , for example when doing scientific computing with lots of parallel processors .
Now , " shifting everything up " by an exponential , we find that it 's possible to invert a 22n × 22n matrix using a circuit of size 2O ( n ) and depth O ( n2 ) .
But computing the output of an exponential - size , polynomial - depth circuit ( which is described to us implicitly ) is a PSPACE computation — in fact it 's PSPACE - complete .
As a final step , one can take the limit as z → 1 using algebraic rules , and some further tricks due to Beame , Cook , and Hoover .
Obviously I 'm skipping a lot of details .
Q : So does this P always project onto the vectorization of a density matrix ?
Scott : OK , that 's an additional point that needs to be argued .
If you look at the power series above , each individual term maps a vectorization of a density matrix onto another such vectorization , so the sum has to project onto vectorizations of density matrices as well .
( Well , you might worry about the normalization , but that works out also . )
As usual , I 'll end with a puzzle for next lecture .
Suppose you can only fit a single bit at a time through a CTC .
You can make as many CTCs as you like , but you can only send one bit through each , not a polynomial number of bits .
( After all , we do n't want to be extravagant ! )
In this alternate model , can you solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?

According to the researchers from the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research , they were able to discover the strategies that biofilm bacteria use .
In most cases biofilm bacteria develop in crowds and squat on areas where they create a community with other bacteria .
They can develop on any surface to which bacteria can affix to .
It is interesting to note that these biofilms cannot be destroyed by any disinfectants and antibiotics , not even phagocytes and our immune system are able to annihilate the biofilm bacteria .
This is one of the major problems in hospitals if biofilms create a community a catheter or implant , surfaces where bacteria may cause a dangerous infection .
Researchers working at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research , located in Braunschweig , claim that they have spotted one of the main mechanisms that biofilms use in order to defend themselves against the attack of phagocytes .
Teamed up with colleagues from Australia , Great Britain and the United States , scientists are now publishing their discoveries in the popular specialist publication PLoS ONE .
The finding states that biofilm bacteria apply chemical weapons to protect themselves .
Until recent findings , researchers could not understand the core of the biofilm problem - why phagocytes cannot destroy the biofilm bacteria .
Dr. Carsten Matz was the one to start a serious investigation of the problem .
The model for his research was the marine bacteria , which face continuous threats in their environment .
The threat comes from the amoebae , whose behavior resembles the behavior of phagocytes .
The amoebae acts the same way in the sea as the immune cells in human body , namely they look for and feed on the bacteria .
As long as bacteria are free and separated in the water , they turn into an easy target for the attackers .
But when they become affixed to a surface and form a community with other bacteria , the amoebae is unable to assault them .
" The surprising thing was that the amoebae attacking the biofilms were de-activated or even killed .
The bacteria are clearly not just building a fortress , they are also fighting back , " says Carsten Matz .
In order to protect themselves , bacteria use chemical weapons .
Marine bacteria , for instance , uses a very effective molecule called pigment violacein .
After the protection system is prepared , the biofilm bacteria turn color soft purple .
In case the invaders consume only one cell of the biofilm , together with the pigment included , they are instantly paralyzed and the chemical weapon activates their suicide mechanism .
" I feel that these results could offer a change of perspective .
Biofilms may no longer be seen just as a problem ; they may also be a source of new bioactive agents .
When organized in biofilms , bacteria produce highly effective substances which individual bacteria alone cannot produce , " says Carsten Matz .
Researchers look forward to apply these molecules in order to deal with a certain group of pathogens : parasites living in human body and causing serious infections , including sleeping illness and malaria .
It is worth mentioning that amoeba represent olden relatives of these pathogens , which is why weapons obtained by the biofilm bacteria may offer a great basis for the development of new parasiticidal drugs .

THE VISUAL IMAGE is inherently ambiguous : an image of a person on the retina would be the same size for a dwarf seen from up close or a giant viewed from a distance .
Perception is partly a matter of using certain assumptions about the world to resolve such ambiguities .
We can use illusions to uncover what the brain ’s hidden rules and assumptions are .
In this column , we consider illusions of shading .
In illustration a , the disks are ambiguous ; you can see either the top row as convex spheres or “ eggs , ” lit from the left , and the bottom row as cavities — or vice versa .
This observation reveals that the visual centers in the brain have a built - in supposition that a single light source illuminates the entire image , which makes sense given that we evolved on a planet with one sun .
By consciously shifting the light source from left to right , you can make the eggs and cavities switch places .
In illustration b , the image is even more compelling .
Here the disks that are light on the top always look like eggs , and the ones that are light on the bottom are cavities .
So we have uncovered another premise used by the visual system : it expects light to shine from above .
You can verify this by turning the page upside down .
All the eggs and cavities instantly switch places .
Amazingly , the brain ’s assumption that light shines from above the head is preserved even when you rotate your head 180 degrees .
Ask a friend to hold this page right side up for you .
Then bend down and look between your legs at the page behind you .
You will find that , again , the switch occurs , as if the sun is stuck to your head and shining upward from the floor .
Signals from your body ’s center of balance — the vestibular system — guided by the positions of little stones in your ears called otoliths , travel to your visual centers to correct your picture of the world ( so that the world continues to look upright ) but do not correct for the location of the sun .
From this experiment we learn that despite the impression of seamless unity , vision is actually mediated by multiple parallel information - processing modules in the brain .
Some of the modules connect to the vestibular system ; however , the one that handles shape from shading does not .
The reason might be that correcting an image for placement in so - called world - centered coordinates would be too computationally expensive and take too much time .
Our ancestors generally kept their heads upright , so the brain could get away with this shortcut ( or simplifying assumption ) .
That is , our progenitors were able to raise babies to maturity often enough that no selection pressure acted to produce vestibular correction .
If you look at illustration c , you find that you can almost instantly mentally group all the eggs and segregate them from the cavities .
As visual scientists discovered decades ago , only certain elementary features that are extracted early during visual processing “ pop out ” conspicuously and can be grouped in this manner .
For example , your brain can discern a set of red dots in a background of green ones but cannot group smiles scattered among a backdrop of frowns .
Color is thus a primitive feature that is extracted early , whereas a smile is not .
( It makes survival sense to be able to piece together fragments of similar color .
A lion hidden behind a screen of green leaves is visible merely as gold fragments , but the visual brain assembles the pieces into a single , gold , lion - shaped form and warns : “ Get out of here ! ”
On the other hand , objects are not made up of smiles . )
The fact that you can group the eggs in c implies that shading information , like color , is extracted early in visual processing .
This prediction was verified in recent years by recording activity in the neurons of monkeys and by conducting brain - imaging experiments in humans .
Certain cells in the visual cortex fire when the observer sees eggs ; others respond only to cavities .
In illustration d , where the circles have the same luminance polarities as in c , you cannot perceive the grouping ; this fact suggests the importance of perceived depth as a cue that is extracted early in visual processing .
Of course , over millions of years , evolution has “ discovered ” and taken advantage of the principles of shading that researchers have explored only lately .
Gazelles have white bellies and dark backs — countershading — that neutralize the effect of sunshine from above .
The result reduces pop -out so that gazelles are not as conspicuous ; they also appear skinnier and less appetizing to a predator .
Caterpillars have countershading , too , so they more closely resemble the flat leaves on which they munch .
One caterpillar species has “ reverse ” countershading — which did not make sense until scientists realized that the insect habitually hangs upside down from twigs .
One type of octopus can even invert its countershading : if you suspend the octopus upside down , it uses pigment - producing cells called chromatophores in the skin , which are controlled by its vestibular input , to reverse its darker and lighter areas .
Charles Darwin noticed a striking example of nature ’s use of shading in the prominent eyelike spots on the long tails of argus pheasants .
With the tail feathers at horizontal rest , the orbs are tinged from left to right .
During the birds ’ courtship display , however , the tail feathers become erect .
In this position , the spots are paler on top and duskier at bottom , so the disks seem to bulge out like shiny metallic spheres — the avian equivalent of jewelry .
That a few simple shaded circles can unveil the underlying assumptions of our visual systems — and even how such principles have played a role in shaping evolutionary adaptations — shows the power of visual illusions in helping us to understand the nature of perception .

WASHINGTON  Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne told a House committee Thursday that he might fire employees in the agency that collects oil and gas royalties , a week after the department ’s inspector general reported extensive ethics abuses there .
Mr. Kempthorne also said his department would follow all of the recommendations from the inspector general , Earl E. Devaney , to improve the Minerals Management Service , including enhanced oversight of the agency and a stronger ethics program .
“ This process will be completed as swiftly as possible , and we will examine the full spectrum of disciplinary actions , including termination , ” Mr. Kempthorne said .
In three reports released last week , Mr. Devaney detailed what he called a “ culture of ethical failure ” that existed at the agency from 2002 to 2006 , including high - ranking officials who defied procurement regulations and employees who had sexual relationships with and accepted gifts from oil company employees .
" I 'm sure I 'll have more information and continue to refine my policy , " he told reporters in North Dakota .
During his presidential campaign , the Democrat has gone from the hard - edged opponent to Iraq that defined his early candidacy to calling for a phased - out withdrawal of all combat brigades that , at a rate of one or two a month , could last 16 months .
He has said that if al Qaida builds bases in Iraq , he would keep troops either in the country or the region to carry out " targeted strikes " .
Responding , Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant said : " There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience .
" Obama 's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician . "
But Mr Obama insisted that his position has not changed at all .
He said he is saying now what he always has - the war was a mistake and needs to be brought to " a responsible end , " but " we need to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in . "
This means , he said , that his 16 - month timeline was always premised on troops being safe and Iraq being stable .
" I 'm going to continue to gather information to see whether those conditions still hold , " he said .
" My goal is to end this conflict as soon as possible . "
Mohammed Erraji's family claim he did not receive a fair trial A Moroccan blogger has been jailed for two years for showing disrespect to the monarchy , say the man 's family .
Mohammed Erraji , 29 , was convicted after writing an article claiming King Mohammed VI 's charitable habits were encouraging a culture of dependency .
There has been no official comment on the case , but rights groups claim Erraji did not have a fair trial .
A BBC reporter says criticising the king is an offence in Morocco and the royal family remains a taboo subject .
Morocco has previously caused international outrage with its treatment of internet users .
Earlier this year , Fouad Mortada was sentenced to three years in prison for creating a false profile on the internet site Facebook using the identity of the king 's brother .
He received a royal pardon following protests from internet users around the world .
' Disastrous ' Erraji claimed in an internet article that the king 's charity towards Moroccans was stifling development by encouraging people to be lazy .
It happened so quickly that all his rights were flouted
AMDH's Khadija Riyadi
" This has made the Moroccans a people without dignity , who live by donations and gifts , " he wrote .
The BBC's James Copnall in the capital , Rabat , says he was particularly critical of the practice known as grima - giving lucrative licences to run taxis and other transport in exchange for begging letters .
Erraji said this did not happen in developed countries , where hard work rather than begging is rewarded .
He was arrested by the authorities last Friday and accused of " lacking the respect due to the king " .
In court on Monday , he was given a two - year prison sentence and fined 5,000 Dirham ( $ 630:£356 ) .
One relative , who claimed to have been present at the trial , said Erraji had not had a lawyer and that the judgement took only ten minutes .
" The judge passed sentence very quickly but we could n't hear what was being said .
He had no opportunity to explain himself , " said the relative , who asked not to be named .
He told Reuters news agency that Erraji was in poor health and was just a " free thinker who simply wants the best for his country " .
The blogger 's brother told the BBC the sentence was disastrous for his family , as Erraji is the only one with a regular income ' Totalitarian '
Human rights groups have criticised the verdict and demanded that Erraji be released .
It is an offence to disrespect the king under Moroccan press laws Reporters Without Borders said the trial was " worthy of the most totalitarian states " and the Moroccan Association of Human Rights ( AMDH ) said the basic elements of a fair trial were not respected .
" It happened so quickly that all his rights were flouted , " said Khadija Riyadi .
A Facebook group and an internet site have been set up in support of Erraji .
Our correspondent says Erraji's best hope of freedom could lie in a pardon from the very man whose policies he criticised .

What are these ?
An experiment performed at the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt ( PTB ) in Germany has uncovered that a spin- torque switching of a nanomagnet is as fast as what is permitted according to the fundamental laws of physics ’ limit .
This method of switching , also named ballistic switching , could allow for increased speeds in future non-volatile magnetic memories .

Current high speed memories , such as Dynamic Static Random Access Memory ( DRAM ) and Static Random Access Memory ( SRAM ) , have one critical drawback - they require constant power in order to retain memories .
Using a magnetic memory chip known as Magnetic Random Access Memory ( MRAM ) , information can be stored in the form of magnetization of a magnetic cell even when no power is maintained .
The newest generation of MRAM employs the spin - torque effect for programming the magnetic bits .
By using a current pulse , the spin - torque can be controlled and the memory state of the cell can be programmed .
To obtain a digital state ‘ 0 ’ , a positive current is applied and the magnetization is set to a particular direction .
A negative current , on the other hand , is applied to reverse the direction of magnetization , creating a digital state of ‘ 1 ’ .
The application of spin torque in MRAM leads the way for a higher storage density compared to DRAM and Flash .
In a conventional spin - torque system , the current pulse creates a rotation of magnetization of the memory cell , which is also termed ‘ precession . ’
Usually , several precessional turns are made during magnetization to ensure reliable reversal .
Therefore , spin torque MRAMs currently in production must operate with rather long write pulses of about 10 nanoseconds .
This limits the MRAM clock speed .
Experiments carried out at PTB Braunschweig , led scientists to the discovery that a single precessional turn is sufficient for spin torque magnetization reversal .
This type of ‘ ballistic ’ spin torque reversal relates to the particularly quick physical time limit of spin torque magnetization reversal .
The achievement was made using specifically tailored current pulse parameters in combination with a small magnetic bias field .
By using the ballistic spin torque reversal , potential MRAMs could be programmed by current pulses quicker than 1 nanosecond and subsequently , achieving write clock rates well above 1 GHz .
Thus , high - density and non-volatile memory executing at the clock rates of the fastest volatile memories were enabled .
TFOT previously covered advanced MRAM technology developed by Freescale Semiconductor in 2006 .

In Chinese newspaper profiles this year , He was listed as 14 , too young for the Beijing Games .
The Times found two online records of official registration lists of Chinese gymnasts that list He ’s birthday as Jan. 1 , 1994 , which would make her 14 .
A 2007 national registry of Chinese gymnasts  now blocked in China but viewable through Google cache  shows
He ’s age as “ 1994.1.1 . ”
Another registration list that is unblocked , dated Jan. 27 , 2006 , and regarding an “ intercity ” competition in Chengdu , China , also lists
He ’s birthday as Jan. 1 , 1994 .
That date differs by two years from the birth date of Jan. 1 , 1992 , listed on He ’s passport , which was issued Feb. 14 , 2008 .
There has been considerable talk about the ages of Chinese gymnasts on Web sites devoted to the sport .
And there has been frequent editing of He ’s Wikipedia entry , although it could not be determined by whom .
One paragraph that discusses the controversy of her age kept disappearing and reappearing on He ’s entry .
As of Friday , a different version of the paragraph had been restored to the page .
The other gymnast , Jiang , is listed on her passport  issued March 2 , 2006  as having been born on Nov. 1 , 1991 , which would make her 16 and thus eligible to compete at the Beijing Games .
A different birth date , indicating Jiang is not yet 15 , appears on a list of junior competitors from the Zhejiang Province sports administration .
The list of athletes includes national identification card numbers into which birth dates are embedded .
Jiang ’s national card number as it appears on this list shows her birth date as Oct. 1 , 1993 , which indicates that she will turn 15 in the fall , and would thus be ineligible to compete in the Beijing Games .
Zhang Hongliang , an official with the Chinese gymnastics federation , said Friday that perhaps Chinese reporters and provincial sports authorities made mistakes in listing He ’s and Jiang ’s birth dates differently from the dates given on their passports .

“ The two athletes have attended international sports competitions before , and I ’m sure the information is correct , ” Zhang said of the athletes ’ passports .

A Lesson In Salesmanship At The Seashore .
Selling is like fishing .
You must bait your hook with the food your prospect likes , not what you like or assume they like .
After you read this story , you will understand .
FLUKE ARE FISH caught in salt water , and they are quite abundant around Long Island .
It is an interesting sport at times , although fluke are lazy fish .
They are thin and wide .
Some people call them ‘ door mats . ’
They are white on the bottom and dark on the top .
This is for protection .
The dark top is invisible from above the fish .
The fluke swims close to the bottom of the sea .
It is easy - going and is influenced by the tides .
When the tide begins to flow , the fluke is stirred up , permits itself to move in the direction of the tide .
To catch the fluke , you attach a live killie , a small fish about two or three times the size of a minnow , by its tail to a hook with a three - foot leader and a sinker which takes the killie down close to the bottom of the sea .
The killie swims around trying to get away from the hook which is holding it by its tail .
The fluke opens its mouth , takes the killie ’s head , and holds it for several minutes .
The fisherman does n’t realize this .
After a while the fisherman becomes restless and begins moving the line up and down and the killie begins to slide out of the fluke ’s mouth .
The fluke is evidently warned it ’s going to lose the killie and so he takes the killie entirely into its mouth .
Hooking The Fluke
If the fisherman stops moving the line , the fluke continues to hold the killie in its mouth , however if the fisherman again moves the line , the fluke becomes fearful of losing the nice morsel and swallows the killie entirely .
He is then hooked .
Now the experienced fisherman knows this eating habit of the fluke .
He raises his anchor and allows his boat to drift with the tide , so the killie is drifting on the sea bottom when it comes upon a lazy fluke .
The fluke takes hold of the killie ’s head , immediately feels the killie start drifting away , and , fearing he will lose his bait , swallows it and is hooked .
Therefore , if you want to catch fluke , keep the line moving up and down .
Drift with the tide and you will float by the lazy fluke .
On the other hand , if you let the bait alone , the fluke will merely hold onto the killie , and perhaps decide to release it .
It ’s exactly the same principle when selling your products and or services !
How true this principle is in selling an idea to your prospects , existing customers or in selling anybody anything .
Let them feel you are overly anxious , let them feel the supply is unlimited , and they will postpone investing .
When you let them taste what you have to offer , then start pulling your bait away from them – watch certain types of people make a lunge and get caught in your sales trap .
There comes a time in many a negotiation when it is advisable to remove your offer , explaining how the time limit is up and you must offer it elsewhere .
This is the point where many people will buy from you – quickly .
If you let your prospect feel other people are bidding for your services or want your products , their interest will be aroused .
People want what other people want .
It ’s a human trait .
Now you can get your fish with the correct bait . . . every time .
Dedicated to kicking your ass until you succeed .
Warmly
Trevor ‘ Toe Cracker ’ Crook
PS .
You can now fish for your ideal prospects using the correct bait every single time in a river full of ‘ em .

The McCain / Obama chat Saturday at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest is turning out to be a major national affair .
CNN , Fox News and MSNBC plan to cover it live .
The church ’s pastor , Rick Warren , was making the rounds Friday explaining how the event would be formated .
According to City News Service :
Warren will separately question McCain and Obama for about an hour .
A coin toss determined that Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , will answer questions first .
Warren will then ask McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , the same questions .
McCain will not be able to hear Obama ’s responses , Warren told the Fox News Channel .
“ The primaries proved that Americans care deeply about the faith , values , character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues , ” said Warren , author of the best - selling devotional book “ The Purpose Driven Life . ”
“ I will be raising questions ... beyond what political reporters typically ask .
This includes pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation , such as poverty , HIV / AIDS , climate and human rights . ”
The questioning will be divided into four segments , Warren said .
The initial segment will be on stewardship , with questions on the roles of government , the president and Constitution and “ what they believe about the direction of our government , ” Warren said .

An oldie but a goodie :
A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery .
He goes to the monastery , knocks on the door , and says , “ My car broke down .
Do you think I could stay the night ? ”
The monks graciously accept him , feed him dinner , even fix his car .
As the man tries to fall asleep , he hears a strange sound .
The next morning , he asks the monks what the sound was , but they say , “ We ca n’t tell you .
You ’re not a monk . ”
The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way .
Some years later , the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery .
The monks accept him , feed him , even fix his car .
That night , he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier .
The next morning , he asks what it is , but the monks reply , “ We ca n’t tell you .
You ’re not a monk . ”
The man says , “ All right , all right .
I ’m * dying * to know .
If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk , how do I become a monk ? ”
The monks reply , “ You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles .
When you find these numbers , you will become a monk . ”
The man sets about his task .
Forty - five years later , he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery .
He says , “ I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for .
There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth . ”
The monks reply , “ Congratulations .
You are now a monk .
We shall now show you the way to the sound . ”
The monks lead the man to a wooden door , where the head monk says , “ The sound is right behind that door . ”
The man reaches for the knob , but the door is locked .
He says , “ Real funny .
May I have the key ? ”
The monks give him the key , and he opens the door .
Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone .
The man demands the key to the stone door .
The monks give him the key , and he opens it , only to find a door made of ruby .
He demands another key from the monks , who provide it .
Behind that door is another door , this one made of sapphire .
So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald , silver , topaz , and amethyst .
Finally , the monks say , “ This is the last key to the last door . ”
The man is relieved to no end .
He unlocks the door , turns the knob , and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound .
But I ca n’t tell you what it is because you ’re not a monk .
To get this windfall , the oil companies did n't have to conspire with the Bush administration to start a war in Iraq .
They did n't have to conspire among themselves to raise prices at the pump .
If you own oil anywhere in the world , you did n't have to do a damned thing .
Just close your eyes , make a wish , open them , and - surprise - you 're getting an extra $ 25 a barrel .
Two years ago the online magazine Slate ( a sister Washington Post publication ) published a Michael Kinsley piece about taxing oil companies that touched on the subject .
Kinsley noted that oil wells that could be profitably operated at $ 46 a barrel ( the price a year before his column ) could be even more profitably operated at $ 70 a barrel .
Kinsley wrote :
I 'm often asked this question : How did Big Oil conspire to get its big profits ?
The idea that a company like Exxon Mobil could earn $ 11.7 billion in a single quarter boggles the mind , even if you know what a far - flung empire it is .
Naturally , those same wells can be tapped more profitably still at $ 120 or more a barrel today .
Yesterday , in an effort to get a little more historical perspective , I called Jay Hakes , who was head of the Energy Department 's Energy Information Administration from 1993 to 2000 and who is currently head of the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta .
He witnessed the tussle in the late 1970s over the profits of the giant oil companies , including the passage of the windfall profits tax .
At the time , President Carter had twinned the windfall profits tax with the lifting of price controls that had been in place for years on much of U.S. oil and gas .
Some news organizations rented helicopters to see whether the oil companies had rented tankers and had idled them just off the coast to withold supplies and drive up prices .
Hakes , who has just published a book titled " A Declaration of Energy Independence , " said his view on Exxon Mobil 's profits goes something like this : " My basic explanation is that most of the oil reserves in world are controlled by state - owned oil companies , " he said .
" It 's the explicit policy of OPEC to keep supplies tight and prices high .
And other countries like Russia agree .
So Exxon becomes kind of a free rider to that problem . "
As a result , he said he has a problem with both sides of the recent vociferous political debate over oil company profits and their connection to high oil prices .
Recent ads , he says , sound " strangely familiar " to the ads taken out in magazines in the late 1970s .
Hakes said , " The historical perspective is that the oil companies always blame the environmentalists .
The environmentalists and consumer groups blame the oil companies .
And no one points the finger where it belongs , which is OPEC . "

Without memory , there is no debt .
Put another way :
Without story , there is no debt .
The story of debt reached a historic moment this week .
An outsized bubble of interlocking debt burst , leading to the downfalls of prominent companies .
Loans by and to the government , financial institutions and consumers collided on an epic scale .
Still , the idea of what we owe one another is an ancient theme , and this is just the latest chapter in a long cultural history .
A story is a string of actions occurring over time -- one damn thing after another , as we glibly say in creative writing classes -- and debt happens as a result of actions occurring over time .
Therefore , any debt involves a plot line : how you got into debt , what you did , said and thought while you were in there , and then -- depending on whether the ending is to be happy or sad -- how you got out of debt , or else how you got further and further into it until you became overwhelmed by it , and sank from view .
The hidden metaphors are revealing :
We get " into " debt , as if into a prison , swamp , or well , or possibly a bed ; we get " out " of it , as if coming into the open air or climbing out of a hole .
If we are " overwhelmed " by debt , the image is possibly that of a foundering ship , with the sea and the waves pouring inexorably in on top of us as we flail and choke .
All of this sounds dramatic , with much physical activity : jumping in , leaping or clambering out , thrashing around , drowning .
Metaphorically , the debt plot line is a far cry from the glum actuality , in which the debtor sits at a desk fiddling around with numbers on a screen , or shuffles past - due bills in the hope that they will go away , or paces the room wondering how he can possibly extricate himself from the fiscal molasses .
In our minds -- as reflected in our language -- debt is a mental or spiritual non-place , like the Hell described by Christopher Marlowe 's Mephistopheles when Faust asks him why he's not in Hell but right there in the same room as Faust .
" Why , this is Hell , nor am I out of it , " says Mephistopheles .
He carries
Hell around with him like a private climate :
He 's in it and it 's in him .
Substitute " debt " and you can see that , in the way we talk about it , debt is the same kind of placeless place .
" Why , this is Debt , nor am I out of it , " the beleaguered debtor might similarly declaim .

Python is big enough for the mainstream .
Guess who writes its applications in it .
It has crossed the threshold for the critical adoption rate .
While this statement is mostly based on my personal observations from interactions in the field , it seems that both programmers and sysadmins are adopting Python steadily .
It is cross platform language with no politcal colors attached to it .
It is not an “ anti ” language .
Linux environment , Java and .NET support it – willingly ( CodePlex is Microsoft sponsored as well ) .
It is a modern , object - oriented , modular and self documenting language .
It is , in my own view , a perfect blend of a simple but powerful scripting language such as Perl , and more application development oriented languages such as Java or C# .
For those interested in further learning resources , I recommend Python official tutorial and these three books : Python from Novice to Programmer Learning Python , 3 - rd edition Python Cookbook
The GOP base aside , some observers believe that picking an outside - the - box running mate such as Lieberman could help McCain with the broad middle of the country who are fed up with the political status quo and enable him to pick off even more Clinton backers .
McCain alarms with abortion comment
Top social conservative leaders in key battleground states are urging John McCain not to pick a running mate who supports abortion rights , warning of dire consequences from a Republican base already unenthused about their nominee .
McCain ’s comments Wednesday to the Weekly Standard ’s Stephen Hayes that former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge ’s pro-abortion rights views would n’t necessarily rule him out quickly found their way into the in - boxes of Christian conservatives .
For those who have been anxiously awaiting McCain ’s pick as a signal of his ideological intentions , there was deep concern that their worst fears about the Arizona senator may be realized .

“ It absolutely floored me , ” said Phil Burress , head of the Ohio - based Citizens for Community Values .
“ It would doom him in Ohio . ”
Burress e-mailed about a dozen “ pro-family leaders ” he knows outside Ohio and forwarded it to three McCain aides tasked with Christian conservative outreach .
“ That choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other Republican candidates , ” Burress wrote in the message .
He and other Ohio conservatives met privately with McCain in June , and while the nominee did n’t promise them an anti-abortion rights running mate , his staff said they could “ almost guarantee ” that would be the case , Burress recalled .
Now , Burress said , “ he ’s not even sure [ Christian conservatives ] would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro-abortion running mate . ”
James Muffett , head of Michigan ’s Citizens for Traditional Values , met with McCain along with a handful of other Michigan - based social conservatives Wednesday night .
“ A good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro-life running mate , ” Muffett said , noting that they were doing so before even getting wind of the Standard story .
“ That choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials . ”
Muffett said McCain did n’t offer any promises on the issue , but rather reiterated his anti-abortion record and assured them that he was aware of how critical the base was to the electoral success of Republican presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan .
To select a running mate who supports abortion rights would be “ wrong - headed , short - sighted , fracture the Republican Party and not allow us to capitalize on the Democratic Party ’s fracture right now , ” Muffett argued .
“ If he does that , it makes our job 100 times harder .
It would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm . ”
McCain , Muffett said , got that message in their meeting .
“ Some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death .
He heard that in the room last night . ”
With polls showing McCain and Obama still neck - and - neck in many competitive states , conservatives argue that their candidate must turn out Christian conservatives in large numbers to win .
In Iowa , for example , many in the GOP say Bush won in 2004 after losing there in 2000 because he bolstered turnout among the religious right in the conservative western part of the state and in exurban areas .
“ Bush only won by 10,000 votes , ” recalled Steve Scheffler , president of the Iowa Christian Alliance and a Republican committeeman from the state .
“ You ’re going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for McCain to win . ”
And , Scheffler noted , it ’s not just a matter of ensuring that social conservatives vote — picking a supporter of abortion rights could erode McCain ’s volunteer base .
“ Ninety percent of the workforce for Bush in ’04 came out of that constituency , ” he said , alluding to the Christian right .
“ Picking a Ridge or a [ Joseph ] Lieberman would not be helpful at all . ”
Rep. Peter Hoekstra , who represents a conservative , heavily Dutch district in western Michigan where Republicans traditionally pile up huge margins , said a pro-abortion - rights running mate “ would be problematic . ”
“ That ’s not where they ’d want him going , ” Hoekstra said of the party base .
McCain ’s campaign sought to tamp down the uproar , suggesting the candidate had merely been overly expansive about a sensitive topic and had n’t intended to float a trial balloon .
“ The point that McCain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party , ” said an aide .
“ The fact that Gov. Ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a Republican . ”
In the interview , McCain said “ the pro-life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the Republican Party . ”
“ And I also feel that — and I 'm not trying to equivocate here — that Americans want us to work together .
You know , Tom Ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro-choice .
And I do n't think that that would necessarily rule Tom Ridge out [ for vice - president ] . ”
He added : “ I think it 's a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro-life , but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro-choice .
We just have a — albeit strong — but just it 's a disagreement .
And I think Ridge is a great example of that . ”
The GOP base aside , some observers believe that picking an outside - the - box running mate such as Lieberman could help McCain with the broad middle of the country who are fed up with the political status quo and enable him to pick off even more Clinton backers .
“ This move to a pro-choice running mate such as Lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters , ” said Doug Schoen , a Democratic pollster who worked for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg when he was a Republican and has written a book about moving away from the two - party system .
“ The right - wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over - 40 women who voted for Hillary in the primaries . ”
But to some in the GOP who supported other candidates in the primary and are having trouble mustering much enthusiasm for McCain , the mere mention of a pro-choice running mate is disheartening .
“ A lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed , ” said Elizabeth Sipfle , a Michigan Republican and former leader of Mike Huckabee ’s grass - roots “ Huck ’s Army ” organization who contacted Politico to register her concern .
“ Let ’s not get our blood boiling . ”
“ Be smart , ” she urged McCain .
“ There ’s a big group here that ’s already feeling marginalized . ”
I 'm not a big fan of targeting politicians for their wealth .
I do n't begrudge anyone succeeding and admire many fabulously wealthy Americans .
But the inheritance - rather than earning - of great riches can rub some the wrong way .
George W. Bush is not wealthy because he earned it ; his family connections made all the difference .
And John McCain , who hails from a very privileged family , married money that most people can barely imagine .
If your house just got foreclosed on , or you can't afford the mortgage any more , this is not someone you can easily identify with :
Those real estate holdings include a Sedona ranch with three dwellings , worth $ 1.1 million ; a Phoenix condominium suite that had originally been two units , worth $ 4.7 million ; an $ 847,800 three - bedroom high - rise condo in Arlington ; an oceanfront condo in La Jolla , Calif . ; a half - million - dollar loft in Phoenix purchased for their daughter Meghan ; another Phoenix condo , worth $ 830,000 ; and two beachfront condos in Coronado , Calif , one of which is valued at $ 2.7 million .
The other was purchased just this year , as McCain was lamenting the difficulties that struggling Americans were facing just to make their mortgage payments .
Cindy McCain told Vogue magazine the family needed the second condo because the first was getting too crowded as their family grew .
I do n't know about you , but this is more distant to me than someone who just earned a bunch of royalties for a book he actually wrote himself .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Iran 's Jews have given the country a loyalty pledge in the face of cash offers aimed at encouraging them to move to Israel , the arch - enemy of its Islamic rulers .
The incentives — ranging from £ 5,000 a person to £ 30,000 for families — were offered from a special fund established by wealthy expatriate Jews in an effort to prompt a mass migration to Israel from among Iran 's 25,000 - strong Jewish community .
The offers were made with Israel 's official blessing and were additional to the usual state packages it provides to Jews emigrating from the diaspora .
However , the Society of Iranian Jews dismissed them as " immature political enticements " and said their national identity was not for sale .
" The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of money , " the society said in a statement .
" Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians .
Iran 's Jews love their Iranian identity and their culture , so threats and this immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out the identity of Iranian Jews . "
The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv reported that the incentives had been doubled after earlier offers of £ 2,500 a head failed to attract any Iranian Jews to leave for Israel .
Iran 's sole Jewish MP , Morris Motamed , said the offers were insulting and put the country 's Jews under pressure to prove their loyalty .
" It suggests the Iranian Jew can be encouraged to emigrate by money , " he said .
" Iran 's Jews have always been free to emigrate and three - quarters of them did so after the revolution but 70 % of those went to America , not Israel . "
Iran 's Jewish population has dwindled from around 80,000 at the time of the 1979 Islamic revolution but remains the largest of any country in the Middle East apart from Israel .
Jews have lived in Iran since at least 700BC .
Hostility between Iran 's Islamic government and Israel means Iranian Jews are often subject to official mistrust and scrutiny .
In 2000 10 Jews in the southern city of Shiraz were jailed for spying for Israel , which Iran refuses to recognise .
A Jewish businessman , Ruhollah Kadkhodah - Zadeh , was hanged in 1998 , apparently for allegedly helping Jews to emigrate .
Jews generally avoid political controversy , but Mr Motamed wrote a letter of protest to Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , last year after he called the Holocaust " a myth " .
Mr Ahmadinejad had earlier said that Israel should be " wiped off the map " .
Jews are free to practise their religion and have their own schools , although they are forced to open on Saturdays , the Jewish sabbath .
Despite the absence of diplomatic ties with Israel , Iranian Jews frequently go there to visit relatives .
Nate Silver :
A tight race ?
It certainly is a tight race , and has been all year .
But this , of course , is not really the lead story .
The story is that there has been a rather dramatic shift in the national polling toward Barack Obama in the past 2 - 4 days , coinciding with the Wall Street financial crisis .
Some pundits will love this , since it gives them something fresh to talk about .
But others , like those cynical beat writers in the Wrigley Field press box , will be annoyed , because it means that the the story they were telling us just a few days ago -- that the Obama campaign was in trouble , that Sarah Palin was the greatest thing since sliced bread -- has now been more or less invalidated .
Anyone care what Scott McClellan has to say ?
The former Bushie who cashed in with his book " What Happened " talks to Essence mag :
On Electing Sarah Palin : “ … I think Senator McCain made his decision based more on political calculation than governing .
He wanted to satisfy and energize the conservative base by choosing Palin .
He also wanted to be able to reinforce an image that he wants to portray , which is that of a maverick reformer .
And he wanted to neutralize the historic nature of Senator Obama ’s candidacy by picking a woman .
So , I think it was more so a selection based on political calculation than governing . ”
On Candidates ’ Messages : “ McCain has conceded that this whole election will be a change election , but he wants to reach undecided voters by saying , “ I ’ll bring change by way of my strong personality . ”
Obama is saying , “ I ’ll bring about change based on policy . ”
He ’s betting that undecided voters are going to go with him because they ’re fed up with the policies of the current administration .
McCain believes it ’s not so much policy that needs change , but a stronger character in office .
Both messages are very effective in their own right . ”
On Candidates ’ Attacks Against Each Other : “ … My concern is when you see such an intense focus on negative attacks .
Then you have to wonder whether that is going to be the way he may govern in his presidency .
If that ’s the case then that would not be someone who would really change things in office , or who could unite Democrats and Republicans around a common purpose .
That ’s the question for me :
Which candidate will best be able to change the culture in Washington ? ”
On His Hopes for the White House : “ … But we need a president with more candor and openness with the public and the press about government .
Unfortunately , we ’re not seeing that today .
We also need a candidate who ’s driven by bipartisanship and problem - solving .
It ultimately will take the right person who is fully committed to making that happen . ”

A U.S. Border Patrol agent was held at gunpoint Sunday night by members of the Mexican military who had crossed the border into Arizona , but the soldiers returned to Mexico without incident when backup agents responded to assist .
Agents assigned to the Border Patrol station at Ajo , Ariz. , said the Mexican soldiers crossed the international border in an isolated area about 100 miles southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent , who was not identified .
It was unclear what the soldiers were doing in the United States , but U.S. law enforcement authorities have long said that current and former Mexican military personnel have been hired to protect drug and migrant smugglers .
“ Unfortunately , this sort of behavior by Mexican military personnel has been going on for years , ” union Local 2544 of the National Border Patrol Council ( NBPC ) said on its Web page .
“ They are never held accountable , and the United States government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of ‘ Oh well , they did n’t know they were in the United States . ’
“ It is fortunate that this incident did n’t end in a very ugly gunfight , ” said the local ’s posting .
The NBPC represents all nonsupervisory personnel among the agency ’s 16,000 agents .
Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel did not return calls for comment Tuesday .
State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson said Tuesday that the department had no information on the incident , and referred further questions to the Border Patrol .
“ It is not an incident that we are aware of , ” she said .
Ricardo Alday , spokesman at the Mexican Embassy in Washington , said Tuesday that Mexico and the United States are engaged in “ an all - out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border . ”
“ Law enforcement operations have led , from time to time , to innocent incursions by both U.S. and Mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations , and in particular along non-demarcated areas of our border , ” he said .
“ We always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion , and as acknowledged by the Border Patrol , this was the case in the episode at Ajo , ” he said .
Since 1996 , there have been more than 200 confirmed incursions by the Mexican military into the United States .
Local 2544 , the largest in the NBPC , is headed by veteran Border Patrol agent Edward “ Bud ” Tuffly II .
He noted on the Web page that the local ’s leadership would “ withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it . ”
“ We do n’t have much confidence in most of them , ” the local ’s posting said .
Sunday night ’s incident bears similarities to other incursions by armed men in Mexican military gear in recent years :
c The incident occurred in the same area where heavily armed Mexican soldiers riding in a Humvee shot at a Border Patrol agent in 2002 .
A .50 - caliber bullet ripped through the agent ’s rear window as he sped away .
Mexican officials denied at the time that the shooters were Mexican soldiers , saying they were criminals using military uniforms .
It is a position they steadfastly have maintained .
But the agent who reported encountering the gunfire was certain he saw soldiers , said Mr. Tuffly .
He said at the time that the agent was able to identify their attire “ down to a T , and it matched exactly what they [ Mexican soldiers ] wear . ”
That purported incursion began after a Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation police ranger reported being chased by men in a Humvee .
cA year ago , U.S. law enforcement authorities were confronted by gunfire from automatic weapons as they chased and caught a drug - smuggling suspect in Texas trying to flee back into Mexico , the Hudspeth County ( Texas ) Sheriff ’s Office said .
No one was hurt in that incident , and the gunmen were not identified , although the area has been the scene of similar incidents over several months , including a confrontation in January 2007 , when heavily armed men in Mexican military uniforms fired on Texas officers with a .50 - caliber machine gun mounted on a camouflaged Humvee .
The men were identified at the time by Hudspeth County Sheriff Arvin West as “ soldiers . ”
In that incident , Hudspeth County deputies pursued three sport utility vehicles back to Mexico after spotting them driving north from the Rio Grande .
The pursuit ended on the U.S. side of the border when the deputies encountered 10 heavily armed men in what they described as battle - dress uniforms .
At that time , deputies found 1,400 pounds of marijuana in one of the vehicles abandoned after it blew a tire early in the pursuit .
Another made it into Mexico and a third got stuck in the Rio Grande and was burned by the “ soldiers ” after it was unloaded .
cIn November 2007 , the Border Patrol chased a dump truck full of marijuana in the same area when it also got stuck in the river while trying to return to Mexico .
While agents sought to unload 3 tons of marijuana , the driver - who had fled - returned with a heavily armed group of men wearing Mexican military uniforms and carrying military - style weapons .
The soldiers backed the agents away and bulldozed the truck back into Mexico .
“ Nothing was ever done , ” Local 2544 said .
“ Nobody was ever held accountable .
Particularly galling is the fact that the Mexican military often pulls these stunts in Humvees donated to them by the American taxpayers .
We note that Border Patrol agents have historically driven worn - out , junk vehicles . ”
A coalition of Texas border sheriffs has demanded that the U.S. and Mexican governments investigate incursions into the United States by heavily armed drug escorts dressed in Mexican military uniforms “ before someone gets killed . ”
Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. of Zapata County , Texas , who founded the coalition , said a growing number of suspected incursions and violence aimed at the area ’s law enforcement officers is making the border “ a pretty dangerous place . ”
Sheriff Gonzalez said three of his deputies in 2006 spotted 25 men dressed in military uniforms in the U.S. during a late - night patrol .
He said the men marched two abreast and carried duffel bags and automatic weapons , and that his “ outmanned and outgunned deputies ” were forced to retreat .
“ The only thing you can do in that kind of situation is seek cover , ” Sheriff Gonzalez said .
“ I ’m not going to lose someone in an unfair fight . ”
The State Department on Tuesday also confirmed a separate case in which two California police officers were arrested at the border Friday on charges of attempting to smuggle guns , ammunition and training materials into Mexico .
A Mexican court is expected to decide Wednesday whether the two Monterey County officers will remain in jail or be released on bail .
The U.S. Consulate in Tijuana said Mexico holds the largest population of U.S. prisoners outside the United States .

“ Japan taught itself decade s ago how to compete with gasoline at $ 4 per gallon , ” said Hisakazu Tsujimoto of the Energy Conservation Center , a government research institute that promotes energy efficiency .
“ It will fare better than other countries in the new era of high energy costs . ”
According to the International Energy Agency , based in Paris , Japan consumed half as much energy per dollar worth of economic activity as the European Union or the United States , and one - eighth as much as China and India in 2005 .
While the country is known for green products like hybrid cars , most of its efficiency gains have been in less eye - catching areas , for example , in manufacturing .
Corporate Japan has managed to keep its overall annual energy consumption unchanged at the equivalent of a little more than a billion barrels of oil since the early 1970s , according to Economy Ministry data .
It was able to maintain that level even as the economy doubled in size during the country ’s boom years of the 1970s and ’ 80s .
Japan ’s strides in efficiency are clearest in heavy industries like steel , which are the nation ’s biggest consumers of power .
From 1972 to 2006 , the Japanese steel industry invested about $ 45 billion in developing energy - saving technologies , according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation .
The results are visible at the Keihin mill on Tokyo Bay , run by Japan ’s No. 2 steelmaker , JFE Steel .
Massive steel ducts snake from the blast furnaces and surrounding buildings .
These capture heat and gases that had previously been released into the air or burned off as waste .
Now , they are used to power generators that produce 90 percent of the plant ’s electricity .
( The plant ’s main fuel remains the coal used to heat its huge blast furnaces . )
Such innovations allow the mill to produce a ton of steel using 35 percent less energy than it did three decades ago , said Yoshitsugu Iino , group leader of JFE Steel ’s climate change policy group .
Mr. Iino calculates that if the global steel industry adopted Japanese conservation measures , it could reduce carbon emissions by some 300 million tons a year .
But even with corporate efficiency gains , Japan ’s emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse - gas emission from human activities , have grown , largely because of rising living standards and continued reliance on coal , according to climate scientists .
James E. Hansen , NASA ’s leading climatologist , sent an open letter to Mr. Fukuda on Thursday seeking a greater commitment to emissions cuts .
The toilet house was built by Sim Jae-duck , chairman of the organizing committee of the Inaugural General Assembly of the World Toilet Association .
To mark the launch of the association 's first general assembly in November , South Korean sanitation activists will be lifting the lid on a lavatory - shaped home south of Seoul .
Sim , a member of parliament , hopes to attract 300 representatives from 70 countries to the inaugural meeting .
The world 's one and only toilet house is a 4,508 square foot concrete and glass structure being constructed on the site of Sim 's former home in his native city of Suweon .
The two storey house features 2 bedrooms , 2 guestrooms , and 3 deluxe lavatories .
The cost : $ 1.6 million dollars to construct .
It symbolizes Sim 's ongoing effort to to assist developing countries without toilets as well as promote clean and sanitary bathrooms worldwide .
Although Sim 's intentions are to reside in the property , prior to Sim moving in it will be available to rent at $ 50,000 per night .
The proceeds will be funding the organization and supporting their cause .
Sim stated that epidemics caused by poor sanitation around the world cost two million lives a year .
Worldwide , 2.6 billion people live without toilets .
In addition , many areas have poorly designed flush toilets waste vast amounts of potential drinking water .
His campaign will focus on setting international standards for clean public toilets and that bathrooms must be treated as the sanctuary that protects human health .
The actual name of the house is Haewoojae , meaning " a place of sanctuary where one can solve one 's worries " .
You can find more information on Sim Jae-duck , the Toilet House , and the World Toilet Association from Reuters .
Asatru : Faith of the Vikings
Asatru is a modern revival of the beliefs in the ancient Gods of the Germanic and Nordic peoples : Freya , Thor , Odin and others .
For many Asatruar , embracing this faith feels like being called home to the way of their ancestors .
Although a small number of white supremacists have claimed to follow Asatru , generating controversy in the news , they are not representative of Asatru at large .
Following a moral code , Asatruar believe that life is good and should be lived with boldness and enthusiasm , and value courage , honor , industriousness , and personal responsibility .
Gathering by " hearths " and " kindreds " they honor the Gods , ancestors , and tribal connections to family and kin .
" Asatru fits like a comfortable pair of jeans .
It 's intrinsic and natural .
The honor code appeals to me as well ; chief among these the concept of personal responsibility .
I also like the rootedness of it .
That being how it connects me to my European and Northern Isles ancestors . "

" I was always very fascinated with mythology , especially Norse .
I kept on reading and also began to notice my thoughts start to change from ' what a load of ...' to ' well that 's interesting ' and then finally to ' well that 's just plain awesome . '
I started to get more and more interested in Asatru and eventually found I was calling myself one . "
-- Beliefnet member Jonny
" I will face my challenges with a grin , accept nothing less than victory until death , and face my gods and ancestors secure in the knowledge that I made the most of the life they gave to me , and that my children and neighbors will face less danger and strife for my efforts . "

Cubicle Mercenaries , Subcontracting Warriors , and Other Phenomena of a Privatizing Pentagon
Seven years into George W. Bush ’s Global War on Terror , the Pentagon is embroiled in two big wars , a potentially explosive war of words with Tehran , and numerous smaller conflicts – and it is leaning ever more heavily on private military contractors to get by .
Once upon a time , soldiers did more than pick up a gun .
They picked up trash .
They cut hair and delivered mail .
They fixed airplanes and inflated truck tires .
Not anymore .
All of those tasks are now the responsibility of private military corporations .
In the service of the Pentagon , their employees also man computers , write software code , create integrating systems , train technicians , manufacture and service high - tech weapons , market munitions , and interpret satellite images .
People in ties or heels , not berets or fatigues , today translate documents , collect intelligence , interpret for soldiers and interrogators , approve contracts , draft reports to Congress , and provide oversight for other private contractors .
They also fill prescriptions , fit prosthetics , and arrange for physical therapy and psychiatric care .
Top to bottom , the Pentagon ’s war machine is no longer just driven by , but staffed by , corporations .
Consider the following :
In fiscal year 2005 ( the last year for which full data is available ) , the Pentagon spent more contracting for services with private companies than on supplies and equipment — including major weapons systems .
This figure has been steadily rising over the past 10 years .
According to a recent Government Accountability Office report , in the last decade the amount the Pentagon has paid out to private companies for services has increased by 78 % in real terms .
In fiscal year 2006 , those services contracts totaled more than $ 151 billion .
Ever more frequently , we hear generals and politicians alike bemoan the state of the military .
Their conclusion :
The wear and tear of the President ’s Global War on Terror has pushed the military to the breaking point .
But private contractors are playing a different tune .
Think of it this way :
While the military cannot stay properly supplied , its suppliers are racking up contracts in the multi-billions .
For them , it ’s a matter of letting the good times roll .
What a Difference a War Makes
As we prepare to close the book on the Bush presidency , it is worth exploring just how , in the last seven - plus years , the long War on Terror has actually helped build a new , privatized version of the Pentagon .
Call it Military Industrial Complex 2.0 .
Consider fiscal year 2001 , which conveniently ended in September of that year .
It serves as a good , pre-War on Terror baseline for grasping just how the Pentagon expanded ever since — and how much more it is paying out to private contractors today .
Back then , the Pentagon ’s top 10 suppliers shared $ 58.7 billion in Department of Defense ( DoD ) contracts , out of a total of $ 144 billion that went to the top 100 Pentagon contractors .
Number 100 on the list was The Carlyle Group with $ 145 million in contracts .
Keep in mind , of course , that this was the price of " defense " for a nation with no superpower rival .
Fast forward to 2007 and the top 10 companies on the Pentagon ’s list of private contractors were sharing $ 125 billion in DoD contracts , out of a total of $ 239 billion being shared among the top 100 contractors .
The smallest contract among those 100 was awarded to ARINC and came in at $ 495 million .
In those seven years , in other words , contracts to the top 10 more than doubled , the size of the total pay - out pie increased by two - thirds , and the lowest contract among the top 100 went up almost four - fold .
Just as revealing , almost half the companies on the Pentagon ’s Top 100 list in 2007 were not even on it seven years earlier , including McKesson , which took in a hefty $ 4.6 billion in contracts and MacAndrews and Forbes which garnered $ 3.3 billion .
And here ’s a fact that makes sense of all of the above :
Given the spectrum of services offered and the level of integration that has already taken place between the Pentagon and these private companies , the United States can no longer wage a war or even run payroll without them .
These have been the good times for defense contractors , if not for the military itself .
Since September 2001 , many companies have made a quantum leap from receiving either no Pentagon contracts or just contracts in the low hundred millions to awards in the billion - dollar range .
Here are just a few portraits of companies that are booming , even as the military goes bust .
URS Corporation :
This engineering , construction , and technical services firm based in San Francisco employs more than 50,000 people in 34 countries .
A publicly - held firm , which recently acquired Washington Group International , it had numerous reconstruction contracts in Iraq .
More than 40 % of the company ’s revenue ( $ 5.4 billion in 2007 ) comes from the federal government .
Between 2001 and 2007 , its Pentagon contracts increased more than a thousand fold ( by 1,400 % ) from $ 169 million to $ 2.6 billion .
URS began the War on Terror at number 91 on the Pentagon ’s Top 100 list .
It is now number 15 .
Electronic Data Systems Corporation : Founded by political maverick Ross Perot , EDS is a global technology services company headquartered in Plano , Texas .
In March , the Pentagon awarded it a $ 179 million contract to provide information technology support services to the Pentagon ’s Defense Manpower Data Center , its central archive of all kinds of data on personnel , manpower and casualties , pay and entitlements , as well as the whole gamut of financial information .
The company — which employs 139,000 people in 65 countries — boasted $ 22.1 billion in revenue in 2007 .
Computer giant HP bought EDS in August 2008 .
In 2001 the company occupied slot 71 on the DoD ’s Top 100 list with $ 222 million in contracts .
By 2007 , it had climbed to number 16 with $ 2.4 billion in contracts , an increase of almost 1,000 % .
Harris Corporation :
This communications and information technology company is headquartered in Melbourne , Florida , and employs 16,000 people .
Harris boasted $ 4.2 billion in revenue in 2007 , with more than one - quarter of that ( $ 1.6 billion ) coming from Pentagon purchases of communications and electronics capabilities like Falcon II high - frequency radio systems .
When the Global War on Terror began , Harris had a modest $ 380 million in Pentagon contracts ( and was number 43 on that top 100 list ) ; over the last seven years , it has steadily risen in rank and now is number 30 .
KBR : Gaming the System
The United States first heard the phrase " military industrial complex " during President Dwight David Eisenhower ’s January 17 , 1961 Farewell Address .
As he left public office , our last general - turned - president warned that the " conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience " and its influence — " economic , political , even spiritual — is felt in every city , every Statehouse , every office of the Federal government …
" In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist . "
If , in many ways , Ike ’s comment is still applicable , in the last 47 years the Military Industrial Complex ( MIC ) he described has evolved in startling ways — and massively .
Today , it does more than wield influence ; it has created unparalleled dependence and unrivaled profit .
What this means in practice can be illustrated by KBR , a privately - held company that does not publish quarterly reports .
Nonetheless , its recent history provides an object lesson in what the MIC 2.0 can do for the profitability of a private contractor .
KBR has shadowed the US military every step of the way through the invasion and occupation of Iraq : first as Kellogg Brown and Root , a subsidiary of Halliburton ( for which Dick Cheney was once CEO ) , and then as KBR , an independent company .
It has , in fact , made its corporate fortune on the Pentagon ’s now infamous " no-bid , " " cost - plus contracts . "
Since December 2001 , KBR has been working for the Pentagon under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ( LOGCAP ) — a multi-billion dollar agreement that guarantees the company those cost - plus profits for fulfilling contracted tasks .
This huge and sweeping contract was awarded without the rigors of the competitive marketplace .
Its " no - bid " nature was a sign that KBR was anything but a run -of - the - mill Pentagon contractor .
A second sign lay in the Pentagon ’s acceptance of that cost - plus arrangement .
A rarity in the business world , " cost plus " means that the more a job costs , the more profit the company pockets .
Professor Steve Schooner , a contract expert at George Washington University Law School , commented , " Nobody in their right mind would enter into a contract that basically says , ‘ come up with creative ways to spend my money and the more you spend the happier I ’ll be . ’"
Under this contract , the Pentagon has doled out $ 20 billion to KBR to build and staff facilities for military personnel in Iraq and provide food and other necessities to US troops there .
Ironically , the Pentagon is n’t even getting what it paid for … not by a long shot .
KBR ’s fraudulent activities have , according to the Government Accountability Office , included the failure to adequately account for more than a billion dollars in contracted funds ; the leasing of vehicles to be used by company personnel for up to $ 125,000 a year ( despite the fact that these vehicles could have been purchased outright for $ 40,000 or less ) ; the purchase of unnecessary luxuries such as monogrammed towels for use in company - run recreation facilities for military personnel ; the overcharging for fuel brought into Iraq from Kuwait for military use ; the charging to the Pentagon ’s tab three to four times as many meals as were actually consumed by US military personnel ; and the provision of unclean water for US troops .
All of these abuses came to light thanks to investigations by Representative Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the Pentagon ’s own Office of the Inspector General , and others , but Halliburton and its former subsidiary got off with little more than such wrist slaps as the revocation of the fuel supply contract and of KBR ’S exclusive LOGCAP contract for Iraq .
That was recently divided into three parts and put out to bid .
KBR was , however , allowed to join the bidding , and is now sharing the contract with DynCorp and Fluor Corporation .
Each company has received a $ 5 billion contract that includes nine one - year options for renewal that could be worth , in total , up to $ 150 billion , according to Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post .
The most recent of many black marks against KBR came when members of Congress and investigators charged that substandard electrical work by company employees in showers at military bases in Iraq had resulted in the electrocution deaths of 16 American soldiers .
To understand what privatization means in action at the Pentagon , consider just one modest example of the corruption that infects KBR and how it was addressed .
In 2004 , the company submitted requests for reimbursement on more than one billion dollars in charges that Army auditors deemed " questionable , " in part because they were n’t backed up by reliable records .
Charles Smith , the Army official managing Pentagon contracts , refused to approve the payments and threatened to levy fines against the company if it did not get a better handle on its spending .
Later , he told James Risen of the New York Times that KBR had " a gigantic amount of costs they could n’t justify .
Ultimately , the money that was going to KBR was money being taken away from the troops . "
Despite his 31 years with the Army , and without notice , Smith was transferred from his post , while the requested payments were subsequently sent to KBR .
According to the New York Times , the Army argued that " blocking the payments to KBR would have eroded basic services to the troops .
They said that KBR had warned that if it was not paid , it would reduce payments to subcontractors , which in turn would cut back on services . "
In other words , the Pentagon — in charge of hundreds of billions of dollars and more than a million personnel in and out of uniform — was essentially held hostage by a company which threatened to withhold services that ( just to be clear ) had been pretty shoddy to begin with .
Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) saw the problem : " We have found ourselves dependent on profit - oriented companies for even the day - to - day basics of feeding and housing our troops , [ and ] for carrying out a myriad of other functions of the mission , including security .
These kinds of contracts opened the door for every manager to game the system in order to maximize profits . "
And game the system they do .
For example , the sort of corruption that seems endemic to KBR has created a profitable new market for another kind of private military corporation — one specializing in oversight and accountability .
After the Army replaced Smith , it hired RCI Holding Corporation to review KBR ’s records .
Smith says the private company " came up with estimates , using very weak data from KBR , " while ignoring audit information gathered within the Pentagon .
While KBR was subsequently awarded high performance bonuses and a portion of that new 10 - year contract with the Army , Serco ( RCI Holding ’s parent company ) also received a new contract — to continue to oversee KBR ’s contracts .
And so dependency begets deeper dependency , while corruption , incompetence , and callous indifference become ever more ingrained in the military way of life .
During his first presidential campaign , George W. Bush identified Christ as his favorite political philosopher .
But as the first American President with a Masters of Business Administration ( and from Harvard , no less ) , he has done a much better job of applying the profit - first principles of Donald Trump and Jack Welch than exemplifying the man from Galilee who promised the rich young man " treasure in heaven " once he sold all he owned and gave it to the poor .
As president , Bush has brought a corporations - can - do - no - wrong perspective to the Oval Office and quickly sought to give the private sector an ever freer rein over a smorgasbord of public works and services .
Today , the military sector leans remarkably heavily on private corporations to perform what used to be their basic functions , from war to disaster relief to washing the dishes .
KBR is just one multi-billion dollar example of the MBA presidency ’s legacy .
Beyond Blackwater : The Pentagon ’s Cubicle Mercenaries
The new Complex 2.0 regularly employs companies whose job it is to send armed mercenaries into action beside US soldiers or to guard US diplomats and high military officers .
Fighting wars for hire has become an essential part of the Pentagon ’s MO since 2001 , and the Blackwater employee gunning through Baghdad in a Kevlar vest , a kafiyah , and wrap - around shades is the ultimate symbol of the new moment .
But there ’s another dimension of the Bush era ’s privatization surge at the Pentagon that has gotten far less coverage : Private military firms are also doing the paperwork of war .
According to a March 2008 GAO report , Additional Personal Conflict of Interest Safeguards Needed for Certain DoD Contractor Employees , in offices throughout the Department of Defense , cubicle mercenaries in startling numbers are working shoulder - to - shoulder with uniformed military staff and federal employees .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) looked at 21 different Pentagon offices and found that private contractors outnumbered Department of Defense employees in more than half of them .
In the engineering department of the Missile Defense Agency , for example , employees from private contractors made up more than 80 % of the work force .
The GAO found that contractors were responsible for carrying out a wide range of tasks and were not subject to federal laws and regulations designed to prevent conflicts of interest — including the rules that concern personnel who want to take positions with companies they had awarded contracts to as federal employees .
Another March 2008 GAO report assessed the Army ’s Contracting Center of Excellence where private contractors made up less than 20 % of the workforce .
The average hourly cost of an employee from a private contractor , however , was more than 26 % higher than that of a government employee .
Similar disparities in pay can be seen even more starkly in Iraq , where a soldier is paid little more than minimum wage , while a private military contractor can earn well above $ 100,000 a year tax - free .
For perhaps the ultimate contrast in military privatization , consider this : Testifying at a Congressional hearing in July , Blackwater CEO Erik Prince offered a ballpark estimate for his annual salary — " more than a million . "
He assured Representative Peter Welch ( D - VT ) that he would " get back " to him with a more exact figure .
Welch noted at the time that General David Petraeus — then responsible for more than 160,000 US military personnel in Iraq — earned $ 180,000 a year .
Privatization at the Bottom
Once private companies take on military and war - making tasks , where does the buck stop ?
It is not uncommon , for example , for a company hired to perform a service for the Pentagon to subcontract part of the job to another company , which may then subcontract part of its task to a third .
Who , then , is in charge ?
When something goes wrong , who is culpable ?
A recent investigation by Craig and Marc Kielburger , Canadian co-founders of the NGO Free the Children , and Toronto - based journalist Chris Mallinos found that KBR has subcontracted to more than 200 different firms — many based in Kuwait — to transport materials into Iraq .
One result of this :
The United States has ended up paying companies that are essentially enslaving Filipinos , Sri Lankans , and other " third country nationals " who drive supplies into Iraq .
In a recent article in Epoch Times , the trio recount a series of fact - finding trips to Kuwait to meet with dozens of South Asian and Filipino men " recruited to the Middle East with the promise of good jobs , only to be hired by Kuwaiti transport companies driving into Iraq . "
A Filipino described how Jassin Transport and Stevedoring Company — one of KBR ’s sub-subcontractors — took his passport , nullified the contract he had signed in the Philippines , and issued him a new contract written in Arabic .
Employees were " given an ultimatum : sign or be abandoned . "
Then they were handed the keys to unarmored tractor - trailer trucks and told to drive fast along roads known to be dangerous .
The authors concluded that these companies " openly flout US labor laws by using cheap imported labor , withholding employee passports and housing workers in decrepit conditions . "
Officially , nothing like this is supposed to happen .
The Philippines , Nepal , and other countries bar their citizens from taking work in Iraq .
In 2006 , the Defense Department actually issued stricter regulations forbidding such labor trafficking , and KBR and other companies pledged that they and their subcontractors would follow local labor laws .
But regulations or no , the truth is that the Pentagon is no longer really in control of the process , and sub - sub - subcontracting is how you make the big money in places like Iraq .
Oh … and despite hearings , investigations , and legislation , Congress is n’t in control either .
In an attempt to address the privatization of the military , for example , the Senate ’s Democratic Policy Committee has held a total of seventeen hearings on waste , fraud , and corruption in Iraq .
Representative Henry Waxman ’s Oversight and Government Reform Committee has made the role of congressional gadfly respectable .
Hearings in both the House and Senate have offered riveting , sometimes shocking , inside - the - Beltway theater , but subsequent legislation created to make decent Pentagon reporting and oversight a reality , close gaping loopholes in accountability , criminalize fraud , and curb some of the worst abuses of private contractors has proven well - meaning but hopelessly weak and ineffective in practice .
Is MIC 3.0 in our Future ?
President Bush will leave office boasting that the United States has the most powerful and professional military machine in the world .
We have paid dearly for this machine in the past seven - plus years .
The bill for all that might and muscle comes to more than $ 3.8 trillion since 2001 — plus another $ 900 billion plus for actually flexing it in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere .
And if the US military machine is now both oversized and staggeringly expensive , it is also more prone to breakdown in a more dangerous and unstable world .
So think of George W. Bush ’s legacy to us as a Pentagon bloated almost beyond recognition and crippled by its dependence on private military corporations .
As for Bush ’s legacy to the Lockheed Martins , the KBRs and the Pentagon ’s whole " Top 100 " crew , it ’s been money beyond measure , enough to leave them all hard at work on Military Industrial Complex 3.0 .
They naturally want to make sure that the money continues to pour into their ever upgrading war machine , no matter who takes over the White House in 2009 .

Sue Decker Makes the Yahoogle Case and ( Finally ) Gets It Right
This week , it will be Yahoo stepping up the volume in the debate over the controversial Yahoo - Google advertising outsourcing deal .
And it could not come a minute too soon .
Yahoo has been unusually quiet about the issue , after weeks of Google ’s more aggressive and listen - to - us - big - brains approach ( along with some creative fake - blurbing of BoomTown ! ) .
That ’s all resulted in more Justice Department scrutiny and more critics piling on , including the typically dulcet Canadians , who might also be launching an antitrust investigation .
Thank goodness , then , that the first foray by Yahoo President Sue Decker ( pictured here ) makes the case in a much more sensible and straightforward manner , which has been sorely needed on the Yahoogle side .
In her piece on Yahoo ’s corporate blog –the inexplicably named Yodel Anecdotal–called “ Myth - busting and the Yahoo ! - Google Agreement , ” Decker ’s just - the - facts - ma ’am approach is well done .
Writes Decker :
“ Here ’s the bottom line :
Yahoo !
will use this agreement to help us become a stronger competitor in all aspects of online advertising ; and Yahoo ! is not exiting the sponsored search business .
We plan to remain a strong player in sponsored search . ”
That said , Decker does take aim at a lot of paper tigers and makes some assertions about the strength of Yahoo ’s search business that stats belie .
I have been pretty clear , as have many , that the pair will not fix prices ; nor are they merging their businesses in some fashion to create a search behemoth that controls more than 80 percent of the market .
In addition , Decker ’s assertion that Yahoo did not do an exclusive deal to avoid the monopoly issue is kind of moot–never ever would the pair have been allowed to strike such an agreement .
Nonetheless , even in this looser partnership , there is reason to be worried .
Most people ’s problem , actually , is over whether the No. 1 and No. 2 players in any market should be allowed to partner at all .
And what most are nervous about is what happens if Yahoo ( YHOO ) becomes too dependent on Google ( GOOG ) as its search market share declines ( and it is declining , to be sure , according to all stats on the subject ) .
Nonetheless , it is hard not to like Decker ’s examples of how Yahoo cannot fill up all search page results with ads , such as a search about the “ elevation of Mount Elbert . ”
( That lovely highest peak in the Rocky Mountains is pictured at left . )
Decker also does not spend a lot of time playing victim to the mean lobbying of Microsoft ( MSFT ) .
While she does mention it , she does not dwell on it , as Google has .
And , surprising to me , Decker does clearly admit that Yahoo is doing this deal because advertisers pay more for Google queries than for those on Yahoo .
With some enthusiasm , she also tries to make the case that Yahoo is attempting to change that .
Writes Decker :
“ We will implement the agreement in a way that respects an important principle you may know as the Hippocratic Oath : ‘ first , do no harm . ’
That is , we will not use Google ads in a manner that would create a significant risk to the health of our own sponsored search business .
“ It ’s important for us to recognize when using Google ads is beneficial for users and advertisers .
Queries for which we have no coverage , low depth , and / or low relative monetization are all circumstances in which backfilling probably makes sense–they indicate that Yahoo !
is not currently delivering enough value for that inventory .
If Google can deliver that value where we currently do n’t , then everyone wins –including the advertiser and the consumer . ”
I like the idea of backfilling , even if I do n’t like the fact that it is the too - powerful Google that is doing this heavy lifting for Yahoo .
But , at the very least , Decker is being honest that Yahoo has come up short and needs help , as it tries to right itself .
Admitting you have a problem , of course , is the first step to recovery .
So , let ’s hope the cure Yahoo is using –better and more search ads from Google–does not kill it .
Here ’s Decker ’s whole post on the Yahoogle deal :
Myth - busting and the Yahoo!- Google Agreement
Posted September 26th , 2008 at 12:23 pm by Sue Decker , President
There ’s been a lot of speculation swirling around about the Yahoo !
- Google agreement .
We hear everything from the claim that Yahoo ! and Google will be fixing prices to the prediction that the agreement is a death sentence for Yahoo ! ’s sponsored search business .
Since the critics clearly do n’t understand the deal and what it means for Yahoo ! , Google , advertisers , and users , it ’s time for some myth - busting .
Here ’s the bottom line :
Yahoo !
will use this agreement to help us become a stronger competitor in all aspects of online advertising ; and
Yahoo ! is not exiting the sponsored search business .
We plan to remain a strong player in sponsored search .
What is the agreement ?
You may have heard that the agreement gives Google control over 90 % of search advertising .
That ’s just plain wrong .
It ’s simply a contract that gives Yahoo !
the right , but no obligation , to show Google AdSense ads on Yahoo ! ’s own network .
It ’s important to note that the agreement is non-exclusive and gives us the option to “ backfill ” with Google ads if and when we see fit .
The reason we structured the deal this way–rather than a more typical exclusive deal with revenue commitments to us and traffic commitments to Google–was precisely to avoid the issues the critics are raising .
Since Yahoo !
bought
Overture three years ago , we ’ve run that business as a closed system .
For example , if you want to put a sponsored search ad on a Yahoo !
search results page ( “ SRP ” ) , you have to buy the ad from us .
Right now , that ’s the only way to access the millions of online customers who visit the Yahoo !
network at the key moment when they express their interests by making a search query .
Given the size of our user base and the extraordinary diversity of searches they generate , we cannot , by ourselves , provide relevant paid search ads for every search–we can’t “ fill up ” all of our SRPs .
In fact , no one company can fill them up–not even Google .
Yes , you read that right .
There are millions of unique queries , like “ elevation of Mount Elbert ” and many of them are never matched to a relevant sponsored search ad .
These “ uncovered ” queries are missed opportunities for advertisers to directly engage with consumers and for consumers to benefit from relevant offers .
Fortunately , Yahoo ! has strong “ coverage ” and “ depth ” for many queries –meaning we have a good number of ads to display for many searches .
However , coverage and depth are not equal for all categories in our marketplaces .
One of our key goals is to unlock the huge value of the hundreds of thousands of less popular queries that do n’t show ads Yahoo ! today .
The “ monetization gap ” between Google and Yahoo ! is in reality a value gap .
Where Google is getting higher bids than Yahoo !
today , this is because advertisers perceive that Google is delivering more value–more targeted leads , more clicks , and more conversions .
That ’s why an advertiser might be willing to bid more for a click on Google than for a click on Yahoo !
–the belief that the advertiser will get more value from Google .
Google is not setting prices .
Advertisers determine how to value keywords .
Yahoo !
is committed to providing advertisers with greater value and consumers with more relevant offers and this agreement helps us meet this challenge more quickly .
Increasing advertiser value is a complicated endeavor .
Part of it is technological –for example , building better matching algorithms .
Part of it is giving advertisers more control over their advertising campaigns .
But we also want to increase revenue by building query share , which takes time .
In the past year , we have thought about these challenges very carefully and we created a strategy that we ’re convinced is a “ win win ” for Yahoo ! and advertisers .
The core idea is limited use of Google ads to deliver more value from our SRPs and other inventory in circumstances where we are n’t delivering the best advertiser value today , and then to use resources gained by that strategy to accelerate our investments in the technologies and marketplaces of the future .
That ’s where the agreement comes in–it allows us to provide better , more valuable connections immediately .
Current thoughts on implementation
We will implement the agreement in a way that respects an important principle you may know as the Hippocratic Oath : “ first , do no harm . ”
That is , we will not use Google ads in a manner that would create a significant risk to the health of our own sponsored search business .
It ’s important for us to recognize when using Google ads is beneficial for users and advertisers .
Queries for which we have no coverage , low depth , and / or low relative monetization are all circumstances in which backfilling probably makes sense–they indicate that Yahoo !
is not currently delivering enough value for that inventory .
If Google can deliver that value where we currently do n’t , then everyone wins –including the advertiser and the consumer .
It ’s equally important for us to protect the long - term health of our marketplaces .
As we studied this issue , we became acutely aware that our value proposition depends on having an active , “ liquid ” marketplace of search terms .
The good news ?
Yahoo ! has that for the more popular and commercial queries –the ones that produce over two - thirds of Yahoo ! ’s search revenues .
This is often not the case , however , for less popular “ tail ” queries .
As we proceed , we ’ll hold true to our goal of making Yahoo !
a “ must buy ” for online advertisers .
We have no intention of abandoning our key advertiser relationships .
To the contrary , we are exploring ways to further strengthen those relationships , and one of the ways we will do that is through our recently announced Digital Advisory Council .
We are asking industry executives from our agency and advertiser partners to join us as we explore the continued evolution of digital media and online advertising .
We ’re going to start by addressing the confusion and misinformation that currently exists in the market regarding Yahoo ! ’s agreement with Google , which is a hotly debated topic that needs some much - needed clarification .
I ’ve said in the past that we ’ll backfill where the monetization gap between Yahoo ! and Google is the greatest .
This gap is the greatest in areas in which we do n’t have matches of offers with very specific queries or where our matches are narrow or not relevant .
This should only enhance our relevance to consumers and bring new advertisers to our inventory that did’t do business with us or that made only limited commitments .
Our overriding principle to backfill will be those win-win opportunities to backfill our inventory with advertising that clients find valuable but to which they have had scarce access and in other ways that both optimize for user experience and the maintenance of a robust marketplace .
Finally , let me be absolutely clear that we are not in any way going to be coordinating or setting search term pricing with Google .
The fact is that advertisers set prices by bidding in our real time auctions .
This agreement gives advertisers a new opportunity to bid for placement on an additional network that includes Yahoo ! inventory .
They will bid for what they think this opportunity is worth at prices that produce positive ROI .
That ’s how pricing works today in this industry and this agreement wo n’t change that .
I hope readers of this post , as well as advertisers and regulators , can move past the false rhetoric being peddled by some of our competitors and see the marvelous potential that the agreement offers the marketplace .
It ’s a great opportunity for Yahoo ! , and we ’re committed to implementing it in a way that produces the most value for advertisers and users .
Ultimately , that ’s the only way we can provide value for Yahoo ! ’s stockholders .

“ I ’m shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here ! ” - Captain Renault , Casablanca
Many of our elected officials were “ shocked ” and astounded to realize that the entire economy has turned into a glorified casino .
Ironically , the quote above comes from Casablanca which translated into English means Whitehouse .
How appropriate given the circumstances .
How the economy can go from fundamentally sound earlier in the week to flat out meltdown mode where Hank Paulson had to not only use his bazooka , but also had to use his rocket propelled grenade with a nuke tip while jumping out of a window launching ninja stars and slapping the markets with brass knuckles is really amazing .
This goes to show how quickly we can adapt our thinking .
Remember long ago on the weekend of September 6th and 7th 2008 when most Americans were only coming to terms with the largest bailout known to humankind of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ?
As it turns out , it only took 2 weeks before we ended up pushing the easy button :
Well as it turns out , we ’re all homeowners now .
We went overnight from a tough stance of no bailouts letting Lehman Brothers go into bankruptcy this weekend to the biggest socialist intervention into the markets on Thursday .
I ’m just calling what occurred by its true name .
This was the biggest socialistic move into the markets ever and will put the U.S. taxpayer at risk to the tune of probably $ 1 trillion .
It makes the $ 30 billion pumped into Bear Stearns look like pocket change .
Sure makes the $ 100 billion in proposed healthcare spending look like a bargain !
We all will need healthcare after people realize the magnitude of this market intervention .
I understand that the politics of the situation forced both parties to concede to the current moment .
They really had no choice and given that this is an election year , I have already braced myself for such a move .
Think about it for a second .
The ad hoc bailouts were simply not solving the problem and Americans were seeing their home prices fall off a cliff .
The systemic risks were not being addressed .
That is , until the United States decided to go socialistic .
In fact , it was a tumultuous week all over the world .
In Russia , the Micex and RTS exchanges were closed on Wednesday and Thursday after epic losses .
That is right .
Russia flat out decided to shut down the market .
They also decided to inject liquidity into the market since they had fallen by 55 % from their May peak .
Yet we do things bigger here .
In conjunctions with the massive new bailout which I will discuss in detail later , the SEC also decided to ban short sellers on 799 financial stocks .
Looking at the list is like looking at a FBI Wanted List of the most responsible for the housing mess .
My take on the strategy of all this is as follows :
( a) The government allowed Lehman Brothers to fail as the sacrificial lamb .
This allowed the “ no bailout ” stance .
( b) The no bailout stance only lasted until we bailed out AIG a few days later .
( c) The market was n’t buying this so they called in the big guns
(d) Short selling and the U.S. Motherland bailout hit rumor mills late in the trading day on Thursday making stocks soar .
Keep in mind stocks opened much lower on Thursday and turned around to have a late 1 hour massive rally .
(e) Word is out that we are going to have the bailouts
( f) It just happened that this Friday was triple witching day .
A day when stock index futures , stock index options , and stock options all expire on the same day .
This happens once every 3 months .
(g) Massive short squeeze rally .
(h) Currently the short ban is only for a couple of weeks just coincidentally enough time to piece together some legislation for the new U.S. Motherland “ bad bank ” to be created to off load toxic debt .
I ’ve been getting a ton of e-mail of people here in California thinking this is somehow going to boost housing prices in the state .
They are going to be in for the shock of their life .
If they have n’t noticed already , the Hope Now Alliance , FHA Secure , the lifting of jumbo loan caps to $ 729,500 , and the Housing and Economic Recovery
Act of 2008 did nothing for prices here because these bailouts are for the cronies !
In addition , many of these programs are voluntary so no bank is going to voluntarily modify a loan out of good will .
Why do this when you can call on your comrades and have them bail you out ?
And there is a little thing called employment and income that is n’t so good here .
We just went into the stratosphere hitting a statewide 7.7 % unemployment rate .
10 Reasons to Be Cautious About Rescuing the Motherland
Reason # 1 – The Fundamentals are not Sound
Whenever someone starts arguing that the fundamentals are sound you can rest assured something is horrible and unsound .
But make no mistake , we have been in this situation before .
Have you noticed that all of a sudden people are referencing the Great Depression over and over ?
How can we be teetering near an economic depression if we are n’t even in a recession !?
Here are some quotes from the Great Depression from The Great Crash by John Kenneth Galbraith :
“ On Tuesday [ October 22 , 1929 ] , Charles E. Mitchell dropped anchor in New York with the observation that “ the decline had gone too far . ”
( Time and sundry congressional and court proceedings were to show that Mr. Mitchell had strong personal reasons for feeling that way . )
He added that conditions were “ fundamentally sound , ” said again that too much attention had been paid to the large volume of brokers ’ loans , and concluded that the situation was one which would correct itself if left alone .
However , antoher jarring suggestion came from Babson .
He recommended selling stocks and buying gold . ”
“ Eugene M. Stevens , the President of the Continental Illionois Bank , said , “ There is nothing in the business situation to justify nervousness . ”
Walter Teagle said there had been no “ fundamental change ” in the oil business to justify concern ; Charles M. Schwab said that the steel business had been making “ fundamental progress ” toward stability and added that this “ fundamentally sound condition ” was responsible for the prosperity of the industry ; Samuel Vauclain , Chairman of the Baldwin Locomotive Works , declared that “ fundamentals are sound ” ; President Hoover said that “ the fundamental business of the country , that is production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis . ”
President Hoover was asked to say something more specific about the market – for example , that stocks were now cheap – but he refused . ”
A reason to be cautious about the bill is the fundamentals of our economy are not sound .
Here are a few reasons :
- The housing market is still falling and inventory in housing is still high
- Unemployment is still growing
- Large entitlement programs will start coming due for baby boomers soon
- We have incredibly large deficits
- There has been nearly $ 5 trillion housing equity destroyed and $ 4 trillion in stock market value has evaporated since this correction started
Do those look like good fundamentals ?
Reasons # 2 – A New RTC ?
Aside from the massive cost of the program let us examine the logistics .
First , there has been comparison to the Resolution Trust Corporation ( RTC ) , which was used during the S & L Crisis to liquidate assets from failed institutions .
Between 1989 and 1995 the RTC closed or resolved the accounts of 747 thrifts with assets amounting to $ 394 billion .
The major difference with this current program and we ’ll write more when we get the full details is they are planning to purchase bad debt from current solvent intuitions to liquidate .
The RTC for the vast majority of institutions simply dealt with liquidating the books once the thrift was taken over and had already failed .
With that said , many institutions in order to participate will need to take a steep discount on their debt .
This may in fact turn currently solvent institutions insolvent .
For example , an institution with Pay Option ARMs with a buyer currently paying $ 1,500 a month but is looking at a recast in 2 years where his payment will jump to $ 3,000 , is actually a massive asset on the book of the institution .
Yet we all know from current data that once the recast hits , they will very likely default .
Thus if an institution wants to participate , they will be forced to realize a loss and bring it on the books .
Yet how can they bring a loan like this on the books if the buyer is technically still current ?
With $ 500 billion of Pay Option ARMs out there , will the new bad bank program allow such loans on their books ?
That is yet to be seen .
I ’m not sure how this will resemble the RTC since they are going to be dealing with live institutions .
Which institutions you ask ?
Try looking at the 799 financials on the short ban list and you ’ll get a good idea .
Reason # 3 – Flood of new Inventory
In the early 90s we had a declining housing market across the country .
Take a look at the Case Shiller Index chart :
As you can see , in the early part of the 90s prices slightly went lower .
Some even argued that the RTC pushed prices lower because they added much more housing inventory on the market .
As anyone knows , more supply with the same demand will lower prices .
Another problem with this new plan is that we already have record amounts of inventory .
How are they going to avoid flooding the market with more inventory ?
Keep in mind that the longer they hold these properties and assuming housing prices still continue lower , the bigger the taxpayer expense gets .
After all , we ’re all homeowners now and there are only 2 ways we make money when we own homes .
We either flip it for a profit or rent it out .
Somehow I doubt the government is going to become a landlord .
Reason # 4 – You Ca n’t Force People to Buy
Even assuming that we dump every single piece of toxic waste into this new bad bank , you still have a populace with growing unemployment and weak income .
Unless Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are planning to go no-doc and bring back NINJA loans there are now standards .
In fact , one of the reasons the market has slowed down is there are so few qualified buyers out there .
Did they somehow disappear over night ?
Absolutely not .
We simply added a touch of standards and the market came to a grinding halt .
In addition , how are you going to convince people that are watching this current mess and are psychologically hit to buy ?
That multi-generation mantra of “ real estate never goes down ” has been destroyed for a generation of Americans .
You cannot bring that back with legislation .
People are going to be more cautious and selective when buying a home .
In addition , a weak economy normally causes people to hold off on large purchases .
Unlike the government , people do not have an unlimited line of credit to the Treasury .
Even though it is their money , they are not part of the crony circle which makes up 2 % of the population .
Reason # 5 – Wolf in Sheep ’s Clothing
You ’ll be surprised as the months go along who was short this market .
The flavor for the next few days is the idea that short sellers caused this mess .
Forget about the shady mortgage brokers , fast talking real estate agents , the rampant fraud , eager flippers , the Wall Street greed of securitization , and incestuous crony capitalism that went on for a decade unimpeded .
As it will turn out , you are going to realize that many of these investment banks and hedge funds were the largest beneficiaries of the short market .
Now , there will be plenty of ammunition against these folks .
This is n’t a new phenomenon .
Let us take a trip down memory lane :
“ The bankers met twice on the 29th ( October 29 , 1929 ) – at noon and again in the evening .
There was no suggestion that they were philosophical .
This was hardly remarkable because , during the day , an appaling rumor has swept the Exchange .
It was that the bankers ’ pool , so far from stabilizing the market , was actually selling stocks !
The prestige of the bankers had in truth been falling even more rapidly than the market .
After the evening session , Mr. Lamont met the press with the disenchanting task of denying that they had been liquidating securities – or participating in a bear raid .
After explaining again , somewhat redundantly in view of the day ’s events , that it was not the purpose of the bankers to maintain a particular level of prices , he concluded : “ The group has continued and will continue in a co-operative way to support the market and has not been a seller of stocks . ”
In fact , as later intelligence revealed , Albert H. Wiggin of the Chase was personally short at the time to the tune of some millions .
His co-operative support , which if successful would have cost him heavily , must have had an interesting element of ambivalence . ”
There are now reports that certain hedge funds , investment banks , and institutional investors will be brought to testify regarding their trades .
Oh what a tangled web we weave .
Reason # 6 – We are not Unique in Bailouts
Bailouts are nothing new and are practiced all over the world .
The Chinese government put in about $ 350 billion into the largest banks in China over the past decade .
Many of these banks were largely insolvent because they were lending under political pressure and throwing money at declining industries .
European banks only provide insurance up to 20,000 Euros in comparison to our $ 100,000 per FDIC insured account ( by the way , another bank failed this Friday ) .
Denmark , Norway , Finland , and Sweden during the 1980s had much of their banking system nationalized .
Taxpayers initially took a hit but in the slow end , may have even turned a profit .
Given the absolute magnitude of this bailout , there will be MAJOR losses .
For someone to say we may turn a profit with a straight face has not looked at any Real Homes of Genius properties and their accompanying mortgages .
Many on the street clamoring for bailouts need to be careful for what they wish for .
Let us look at what happened to a few of the recent bailouts :
Bear Stearns shareholders got $ 10 per share .
People need to be careful what they wish for .
To make this even remotely palatable to the American public , any institution participating in this program will take a major hit and may likely put themselves up for insolvency .
It will be an expensive proposition .
In fact , this may simply be a preemptive move to create a major garbage dump for all the impending bank failures that will be happening over the next few years .
Out of 8,430 8,429 commercial banks it is estimated only half will survive after all is said and done .
Reason # 7 – $ 1,000,000,000,000
Barclays has come out and stated that the U.S. may need to borrow $ 700 to $ 1 trillion to fund the biggest rescue of any financial system since , you guessed it , the Great Depression .
This sum is so large that it may in fact put our AAA rating as a country at risk .
The U.S. National Debt already stands at $ 9.7 trillion and we have yet to enact the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 which will probably eat up $ 200 billion and this current plan will add an additional $ 700 to $ 1 trillion in debt .
In one month we are looking to increase our national debt ceiling by 10 to 12 percent .
Like I said a few months ago , who really believed that $ 25 billion figure from the CBO ?
Bwahaha !
That figure was probably for the printing and binding budget of the new bad bank legislation .
In the meantime the GSEs will be buying up mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) as detailed in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout plan .
With similar authority the U.S. Treasury will also buy mortgage backed securities .
We are all now homeowners !
The U.S. homeownership rate by the end of this month will be 100 % .
Reason # 8 – Can we Bailout the American Worker ?
Since 1978 worker pay has been lagging behind .
Total debt has been growing at such a rapid pace , that total debt now exceeds total employee compensation .
I think this graph sums it up nicely :
Source : Sudden Debt
Instead of focusing on sustainable and good job creation we have been focused on keeping this debt Ponzi scheme going for way too long .
Henry Ford was chastised for raising the wages of his workers but he knew that people with money ( not massive debt ) would ultimately end up spending .
Even though many bought cars on installment plans their debt to income ratios were modest compared to where we are today .
Now back then the debt world was n’t that large .
Fast forward to today and you realize that any feeling of real gains was simply a façade being masked by debt .
We financed our current “ prosperity ” completely on debt .
The current market correction is simply bringing things back to reality .
In addition , 30 % + of all job creation since 2000 was directly or indirectly related to real estate .
Was the apex of our economic system basically selling houses to one another in an endless of orgy of price pyramids ?
Hard to believe that in such a fiercely competitive world we would dedicate such a large amount of resources to such an unproductive activity .
Instead of looking at engineering innovations or biotechnological advances for the well - being of our society , we instead wasted an entire decade figuring out the best way to put granite countertops on a central kitchen island .
How funny that a political platform so bent on no new taxes did n’t even “ blink ” when it came to backing a $ 1 trillion bailout .
Reason # 9 – I Think I ’m Turning Japanese , I Really Think So !
An astute reader sent me a link to an October 1998 article talking about the zombification of the Japanese market .
I have argued many times that we are going to likely see a deep L shaped recession like Japan ’s for a variety of reasons .
Just to give you a peak into the future , this experiment has already been done :
“( New York Times October 13 , 1998 ) The possibility of a way out of the financial crisis sent stocks surging today , with shares of the nation ’s banks jumping an average of 8 percent .
The Nikkei index of 225 shares rose 5.24 percent , to 13,555.01 , in a big comeback after last week ’s plunge .
United States markets also rose on optimism about a solution to Japan ’s financial problems . ”
“ The law enacted by Parliament today allows the Government for the first time to deal with large , failing banks by nationalizing them , liquidating them or transforming them into publicly owned ” bridge banks , ” which take over the good loans and good borrowers and try to collect on the bad loans .
It would establish a public institution to resell the good assets and deal with the bad ones in a process also used by the American Resolution Trust Corporation , which helped clean up the savings - and - loan crisis in the 1990’s . ”
At the time of the above proposal , they were talking about injecting $ 400 billion into the markets .
How did that turn out ?
Let us take a look :
So what happened in Japan ?
After a 1 year 7 month bull run , the market shot up from 12,879 in early October of 1998 to 20,434 in April of 2000 .
This was a stunning increase of 58 % in less than 2 years .
Well as you can see from the graph , even after 10 years , the market has yet to see prices of a decade ago .
What happened to real estate from 1980 to 2005 in Japan ?
Scroll up and take a good look at our Case - Shiller graph .
Do you notice a resemblance ?
Reason # 10 – Blame the Wrong People
You know you have reached the absolute peak of madness when you start pointing fingers at the wrong culprits .
Blaming short sellers is one .
Trying to blame the mainstream media is another .
And trying to convince people it is patriotic to buy stocks has got to be the final straw .
Even the comedy shows are starting to pick up on this economic mess .
Stephen Colbert was asked about diversification and he stated that he was diversified since he had money stuffed under his couch and mattress .
Humor at a certain point lightens the mood .
Even in the Great Depression humor was used :
“ In March 1930 , following a flood of optimistic forecasts by his subordinates , Mr. Hoover said that the worst effect of the crash upon unemployment would be ended in sixty days .
In May Mr. Hoover said he was convinced “ we have now passed the worst and with continued unity of effort shall rapidly recover . ”
Toward the end of the month he said that business would be normal by fall .
What was perhaps the last word on the policy of reassurance was said by Simeon D. Fess , the Chairman of the Republican National Committee :
“ Persons high in Republican circles are beginning to believe that there is some concentrated effort on foot to utilize the stock market as a method of discrediting the Administration .
Every time an Administration official gives out an optimistic statement about business conditions , the market immediately drops . ”
Welcome to the bad bank era .
Get ready for a decade long malaise just in time to go with the 76 million baby boomers who will start to retire in droves .
We ’ll have to wait to see the final details on this plan to discuss further .
Update Sunday 9/21 :
The plan was leaked this weekend and the details are extraordinary :
Under section 8 :
“ Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . ”
In addition , Paulson confirmed on Sunday that this would also aid in foreign institutions :
“ Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Sunday that foreign banks will be able to unload bad financial assets under a $ 700 billion U.S. proposal aimed at restoring order during a devastating financial crisis .
“ Yes , and they should .
Because … if a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution , ” Paulson said on ABC television ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopolous . ”
Is there any wonder why they are trying to jam this thing through ?
This bailout will be on history books for centuries and they want to rush it through in a few days ?
There is no need to rush it .
The toxic assets are n’t going anywhere .
The way the plan stands now , it is pushing for dictatorial powers and as a democracy we should always have the power to question certain actions especially when it is the taxpayers ’ money on the hook for this bailout !
Contact your representative now and let them know that they need to seriously look into this plan before jumping head first :
Write your Representative
Write your Senator
The plan is going to happen but it does not have to be in the current form .
The mainstream media coverage needs to dig deeper into this to shape the public ’s perception since it seems the way they are covering it that this is already a done deal in the current form .
It is not a done deal and a few representatives are testing the water with dissent as they should .

" Have you ever been through the Denver airport ?
It 's strange .
It 's one of the busiest , but I 'm telling you , it 's weird .
There 's a firestorm of people talking about this thing . "
Especially on June 11 , when George Noory devotes all four hours of Coast to Coast , his nationally syndicated talk - radio program dedicated to the " paranormal , extraterrestrial and other topics typically overlooked by more mainstream media outlets , " to a discussion of Denver International Airport .
Broadcast on more than 500 affiliate stations , including KHOW , the popular overnight show is the 60 Minutes of conspiracy theories , often with self - educated experts expounding on such subjects as the occult , psychic visions , crop circles , Skull and Bones and apocalyptic predictions .
And almost all of these conspiracies intersect at DIA .
More DIA Conspiracy Stories :
- DIA Conspiracy Makes List of World 's Weirdest
- Best DIA Conspiracy Video Ever !
- Jesse Ventura blows the lid off DIA conspiracy theories !
Maybe !
For the show this night , a special line is set up for listeners in Colorado .
Susan from Denver finds it strange that so many contractors were dismissed during the airport 's construction , and speculates that this was a tactic to prevent workers from understanding the true scope of the project , allowing planners to build a facility six stories underground " without anyone questioning it . "
Chris from Indianapolis has heard that the tunnels below DIA were constructed as a kind of Noah 's Ark so that five million people could escape the coming earth change ; shaken and earnest , he asks how someone might go about getting on the list .
" Well , you first need a lot of money , " replies guest expert Jay Weidner .
" And then you need a lot of influence . "
Weidner , a filmmaker and freelance journalist , is on Noory 's show to promote 2012 : The Odyssey , a new documentary that connects Weidner 's previous work uncovering the secrets of ancient alchemy with a growing interest in the year 2012 as a historical " end date " for the world as we know it , a kind of new - age Armageddon .
Some conspiracy buffs predict this end / beginning nexus will generate a telepathic wave of harmony throughout humanity ; others see signs that 2012 will be fraught with fire and warfare .
The date comes from the ancient Mayan calendar , which marks a day in December five years from now as the conclusion of the 5th Sun .
Weidner has found evidence in monuments built by alchemists and Freemasons that they were not only aware of this Mayan prophecy but have been secretly preparing for 2012 for generations .
His film examines a 150 - year - old cross in France , a Stonehenge - like structure in Georgia and Masonic connections in Washington , D.C.
It concludes at DIA , where Weidner shows the capstone located in the terminal 's Great Hall — a name that 's no accident , since Masonic temples call their main meeting rooms by the same name .
Engraved in the marble facade is a coffee - cup - sized icon of a square and compass , symbols of the Masonic order , with the words " New World Airport Commission . "
Weidner associates this with the New World Order , an autonomous behind - the - scenes government that manipulates global events and communications .
" And my feeling is that the Denver airport is some kind of cathedral to these guys , a cathedral to the world that they 're making , " Weidner tells the listening audience .
The airport holds more clues .
" These murals , which are shown in the film , are a story , " Weidner continues .
" Like a message ? " Noory asks .
" Are they trying to tell us something ?
Or are they trying to [ rub ] it in our face ? "
Weidner explains that some high - level factions in Masonic society may be using the murals to alert the general population to the earth - shattering political and environmental changes in store for 2012 .
Either that , or those factions are amazingly arrogant .
Because for Weidner and other conspiracy experts , the symbolism is as explicit as a manifesto .
One mural features three women in coffins surrounded by endangered animals , including a Quetzal bird , named after the Mayan god Quetzalcoatl , in a glass cage — an " extinction message , " Weidner says .
The next panel shows children of the world gathered around a " gigantic psychedelic plant of some kind .
And they 're all extolling that all the races are going to live together in a world of peace . "
" It 's like the one - world government bylaws , " says Noory .
But the peace does n't last .
Another mural depicts a Gestapo - like figure " knifing the dove of peace with his bayonet , " surrounded by crushed cities and starving citizens .
Considered in the context of other curiosities captured in his documentary , Weidner concludes that these DIA murals reveal that 2012 will be a time of intense military oppression .
" To put it bluntly , " he says , putting it bluntly , " It 's going to be a real nail - biter . "
Back in 1994 , Leo Tanguma was working in his studio in the Lakeside Mall when a van full of people pulled up .
" And they were n't hostile , " he recalls .
" They asked a lot of questions . "
They wanted to know about all the different symbols in the murals that he'd been commissioned to make for the still - unopened DIA .
" And I explained it like I explain it to everybody , " the artist says .
The first part of the environmental mural is about the ways that humans destroy nature and themselves through destruction and genocide .
The second part is about humanity coming together to rehabilitate nature and revive their own compassion .
Tanguma likes to keep things simple .
He may be left - wing , but he says he 's not a liberal intellectual .
He 's a Christian who thinks of his murals as painted sermons , depicting the virtues of the poor and hardworking , and warning against the evils of greed and violence .
Like many painters trained in the Mexican style of mural art , Tanguma gears his work to the street and all of its elements , everyone from businessmen and college professors to people like his parents , who were all but illiterate .
The last thing Tanguma wants is for viewers to mistake his meaning .
The visitors stayed for more than an hour , looking around his studio , talking .
One of the women asked Tanguma if the airport had told him what to paint .
He remembers that , because he remembers how she said it .
He told her no , that he was given no instructions on content .
And then the visitors began to talk about how the United Nations was another conspiracy to take over the United States .
" How do you figure that ? " he asked .
Before they left , they went to the back of their van and pulled out a thick , photocopied book detailing the U.N. conspiracy .
They gave Tanguma the book .
He knew where it was until about ten years ago , when he moved his studio from the strip mall to a modest house in Arvada where he lives with his wife .
Now that his art has become so central to a growing group of conspiracies , he wishes he could find it .
Even before the U.N. came into being , the United States had a rich history of conspiracy movements .
It stretches back to seventeenth - century Salem , Massachusetts , where Puritans began executing witches in hopes of saving their crops and livestock from God 's wrath .
In a 1964 article for Harper 's magazine , Richard Hofstadter labeled groups prone to such " exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy " as having " paranoid style , " and he compared the anti-Masonic movements of the previous century with the McCarthyism trials of the 1950s .
Hofstadter wrote this piece before the Jimmy Hoffa disappearance and the Apollo moon - landing hoax became mainstays of conspiracy subculture , but the assassination of John F. Kennedy was already providing plenty of fodder .
In the '90s , Waco and the Oklahoma City bombing massacre both prompted bumps in theorizing , but the events of September 11 , 2001 , really kicked government coverup conspiracies into high gear .
The 9 - 11 Truth Movement points to purported incongruities in the official explanation of the attacks as proof that the events were actually conducted by elements within the U.S. government .
And other large - scale disasters , such as the 2004 tsunami and Hurricane Katrina , have also fallen under the microscope of conspiracy theorists .
It 's not difficult to see why national disasters and global catastrophes would inspire suspicion , but a set of paintings at an airport in middle America ?
How the Tanguma murals became the focus of such a diverse spectrum of conspiracists is a mystery in itself .
Still , whispers of shadowy plots , nefarious schemes and activities ranging from paranormal to extraterrestrial have been tied to DIA since even before it opened in 1995 , and the growth of the Internet and the increased interest in conspiracies since 9/11 have combined to pull even the most cryptic oddities from the back of the web to the forefront of the conspiracy networks .
Today , dozens of websites are devoted to the " Denver Airport Conspiracy , " and theorists have even nicknamed the place " Area 52 . "
Wikipedia presents DIA as a primary example of New World Order symbolism , above the entry about the eyeball / pyramid insignia on the one - dollar bill .
And over the past two years , DIA has been the subject of books , articles , documentaries , radio interviews and countless YouTube and forum board postings , all attempting to unlock its mysteries .
While the most extreme claim maintains that a massive underground facility exists below the airport where an alien race of reptilian humanoids feeds on missing children while awaiting the date of government - sponsored rapture , all of the assorted theories share a common thread :
The key to decoding the truth about DIA and the sinister forces that control our reality is contained within the two Tanguma murals , " In Peace and Harmony With Nature " and " The Children of the World Dream of Peace . "
The murals each stretch about 28 feet along wide hallways near the baggage claims on the east and west sides of the rectangular Great Hall .
Each is split into two parts by access - area doorways .
Painted in the Mexican " muralista " style typified by such artists as Diego Rivera and Jose Orozco , with simplified figures cast in bright , solid colors , the characters in the murals — mostly children of various ethnicities — are portrayed with almost cartoonish qualities and laden with symbolism , such as a boy weeping as he holds a soon - to - be - extinct chipmunk in front of a burning forest .
According to the DIA website , the murals function metaphorically as diptychs ( hinged tablets of theological artwork and writing often placed on Catholic altars ) designed with two simple themes : environmental destruction vs. environmental healing and war vs. peace .
But conspiracy theorists from as far away as Australia , Romania and Japan offer their own analyses of the paintings on message boards and blogs .
Some think the murals depicting peace and environmental harmony are meant to be read first , which makes the second parts of the visual narratives — genocide and the devastation of the natural world — the conclusion ; the murals can then be read as prophetic warnings from all - knowing groups or celestial beings that humans must clean up their act .
Others view the murals not as an oracle , but as a propaganda tool of power - hungry interests who hope to distract people with false concerns over global warming , lulling citizens into complacency with dreams of peace .
Once all the swords have been beaten into plowshares — as Tanguma 's " Dream of Peace " mural illustrates — then the evil forces , represented by the military figure in the adjacent panel , will enact their brutal overthrow of the world .
When Syracuse University professor Michael Barkun was researching his 2006 book A Culture of Conspiracy , he found DIA in the stream of conspiracy theory that considers the Freemasons , a fraternal organization that grew out of the stone - mason guilds of medieval Europe , as a group secretly in control of world politics .
" We think of anti-Masonic material as essentially a nineteenth - century genre , " Barkun says .
" But there is an enormous amount of anti-Masonic stuff being recycled . "
Barkun was n't really surprised by DIA 's Freemason - to - Illuminati - to - New World Order conspiracy connection , but he was intrigued by how DIA conspiracies intersected not only with UFO and 2012 " millennialist " contingents , but also the conspiracy branches concerned with underground military bases and reptilian aliens .
Left - wing radicals , fundamentalist Christians , UFO hunters , white nationalists , hippie mystics , Vietnam veterans and anti-U.N.
Libertarians are all able to pick out evidence within the main body of DIA infatuation to support their competing perspectives .
And not all these theorists are Unabomber - like crackpots uploading their hallucinations from basement lairs .
Former BBC media personality David Icke , for example , has written twenty books in his quest to prove that the world is controlled by an elite group of reptilian aliens known as the Babylonian Brotherhood , whose ranks include George W. Bush , Queen Elizabeth II , the Jews and Kris Kristofferson .
In various writings , lectures and interviews , he has long argued that DIA is one of many home bases for the otherworldly creatures , a fact revealed in the lizard / alien - faced military figure shown in Tanguma 's murals .
" Denver is scheduled to be the Western headquarters of the US New World Order during martial law take over , " Icke wrote in his 1999 book , The Biggest Secret .
" Other contacts who have been underground at the Denver Airport claim that there are large numbers of human slaves , many of them children , working there under the control of the reptilians . "
On the other end of the conspiracy spectrum is anti-vaccination activist Dr. Len Horowitz , who believes that global viruses such as AIDS , Ebola , West Nile , tuberculosis and SARS are actually population - control plots engineered by the government .
The former dentist from Florida does not speak about 2012 or reptiles — in fact , he sees Icke 's Jewish alien lizards as a Masonic plot to divert observers from the true earthly enemies : remnants of the Third Reich .
He even used the mural 's sword - wielding military figure as the front cover of his 2001 book , Death in the Air .
" The Nazi alien symbolizes the Nazi - fascist links between contemporary population controllers and the military - medical - petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel largely accountable for Hitler 's rise to power , " Horowitz explained in a 2003 interview with BookWire .
A YouTube video dated last fall shows him standing before a podium as he deconstructs photos of the murals projected onto a large screen .
He points to Tanguma 's work as an " expression of the devil - doers ' confidence " in their plan to generate mass genocide of undesirable populations through air - based chemical warfare .
The wispy rainbow that extends between the two adjacent murals is a stand - in for lethal toxins sprayed into the atmosphere , he tells the audience , " and as a result , you have dying people , mostly ethnic populations . "
Evangelical Christians have also found messages in the murals .
In a 2003 newsletter , biblical research group Cephas Ministry included photos of the murals , along with the caution that they referred to bio-warfare , 9/11 and paganism .
" They are frightening to Christians as well as American citizenry since one speaks of death to Christianity as we know it , " the newsletter noted .
Another grainy YouTube video shows a speaker alleging that the murals indicate that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has built a concentration camp below the airport to systematically murder the " people that Lucifer hates . "
Many of these Internet speculators believe that DIA is linked via underground tunnels to nearby conspiratorial hotbeds such as NORAD and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs .
But some also believe that the conspiracy stretches from the airport to controversial Colorado tragedies such as Columbine .
( A few even posit that those students may have been consumed by aliens . )
One 1998 article posted on www.konformist.com managed to connect the DIA conspiracy to JonBenét and the Denver Broncos .
Reached by phone at his home in Las Vegas , the site 's creator , Robert Sterling , admits that the best conspiracy theories often necessitate dizzying leaps of logic , demonstrated by a kind of free - association exercise he calls " the conspiracy game . "
Even though Sterling realizes that these connections are more than a little tenuous , he is willing to err on the side of speculation , given the sheer weirdness of the murals and evidence of DIA 's capstone .
" The idea that [ DIA ] is a temple or monument to the New World Order , it almost in some bizarre way makes sense , " he says .
In his sociological observations of conspiracy culture , Barkun has noticed a rise in the number of individuals suspicious of Freemasonry , a trend he thinks may be the cause ( or effect ) of conspiracy - thriller novelist Dan Brown 's popularity .
As with The Da Vinci Code , there 's a belief that the future can be accessed if you can only decipher the code .
" It 's often something that 's in plain sight as it is [ at DIA ] .
But their claim is that there 's a hidden meaning , " Barkun says .
" Most often it is thought to exist in text ; people have long done this with the Bible .
But it can often be visual , as in the case of DIA . "
Although conspiracy theories vary widely , they all share three commonalities .
" One is the belief that nothing happens by accident , " Barkun points out .
" Another is that everything is connected .
And a third is that nothing is as it seems . "
Jay Weidner would agree with that .
From his office in Seattle , the former National Public Radio talk - show host says that world events like the war in Iraq , the oil crisis and the erosion of global economies signal that a fundamental alteration in human history is on the horizon .
" There 's some profound shift that 's about to happen , " he says .
" And for those of us who are prescient and aware and conscious , we can feel there 's something going on here . "
And they can see it in the Tanguma murals .
Although the DIA conspiracies have branched off into wild ideological directions , they 're all rooted in a 1996 radio interview with Alex Christopher , an interview whose transcription has been republished on hundreds of websites .
Many theorists surmise that the man quoted in this transcription is dead .
Actually , Christopher is a 65 - year - old grandmother living in Alabama .
Christopher first became interested in the New World Order in the mid-'80s , and she started writing a book on the subject .
In the mid-'90s , she came to Denver for the Global Sciences Congress conference , where she gave a lecture on her theories about aliens and the globalist agenda .
People there were talking about how odd the long - delayed airport was , " and I started looking at all the murals and floors and weirdness , " she remembers .
" I got really intrigued . "
At the conference , she met people who she claims took her into DIA 's underground tunnels .
The first time , she went with a man who worked there .
" It was really spooky , " she remembers .
Then she returned with fellow conspiracy theorist Phil Schneider , and they went down four levels .
That was enough to convince Christopher that something funny was going on at DIA .
" As far as I know , I 'm the one who started all that , " she acknowledges .
She went with a few family members to visit Tanguma at his studio , where he was working on the second mural .
" And I asked him , ' Where on earth are you coming up with this material from ? '
And he said , ' Well , it 's just a collection , a collage . '
And he had a lot of books in his studio that had strange pictures , " she remembers .
" I understand that he did n't have free rein on those things , " Christopher continues .
" He was given an outline of what was supposed to be in the murals .
And I tried to talk to him about what I thought , and he was n't buying it at all .
Evidently he was bought and paid for , because there was no talking to him .
And his mind was totally shut down to what he was depicting . "
Christopher , on the other hand , was open to hearing anything .
A man called her and said he had found an elevator at DIA that led to a corridor that led all the way down into a military base that also contained alien - operated concentration camps .
She detailed this theory in her next book , Pandora 's Box II , and in 1996 was a guest on an esoteric California radio show hosted by Dave Alan .
There she outlined her theory that the British secretly control the United States , as shown in the " secret society " symbolism of the Tanguma murals .
But then Phil Schneider turned up dead — officials determined it was a suicide , but conspiracy theorists recognized it as an assassination , and he has since become a martyr for underground - base believers .
Christopher became fearful for her life and her children 's safety .
" And so for them , I shut up and disappeared and decided to see if somebody would take the material and let it take on a life of its own so that their focus would be somewhere else , " she says .
And Christopher has tried to stay hidden , which has led to even more conspiracies .
" Everybody thinks I 'm dead or they think I 'm a man , " she says .
" My daughter and I have a real good chuckle over it . "
But she 's grown tired of how " notorious " her KSCO interview has become , as others pick apart and misquote her work to serve their own conspiracy - theory agendas .
She 's now working on an updated version of her books , which she says may even include a DVD containing photographic proof of DIA 's underground labyrinth .
While the Tanguma murals appear in all DIA conspiracies , the pieces themselves are not the root of the airport obsession .
Every good conspiracy theory needs a foundation of fact or a pre-existing controversy as its framework .
And in this case , the theories all build off the origins of DIA , which seem bizarre enough on their own : an airport built absurdly far off into the prairie , on a massive piece of land , billions of dollars over budget , years late , with a high - tech baggage system that never worked .
An airport that critics say was never needed in the first place .
Since it first opened in 1929 as Denver Municipal Airport in the northeast corner of the city , Stapleton Airport had steadily grown in both size and capacity .
But commercial and residential development around the airport made new construction so cramped that jets were forced to taxi through underpasses built below I - 70 to access certain runways .
Talk of building a new airport at a different location started as early as the 1960s and continued through the mayoral administration of Bill McNichols , who commissioned a study of new sites .
When Federico Peña took over as mayor in 1983 , he thought that expanding Stapleton onto the adjacent Rocky Mountain Arsenal might be a better alternative .
But the costs of cleaning up the contaminated site and opposition from Adams County sunk that idea .
Meanwhile , Park Hill residents were growing increasingly angry over airport noise and pollution and even filed a lawsuit in hopes of prompting a relocation .
Peña knew that building a new airport would not be easy .
But with the support of then - governor Roy Romer and other high - profile boosters from the civic and business world , Peña was able to work out a complicated deal that would allow the annexation of a large swath of farmland northeast of Denver .
Despite a strong opposition campaign , the arrangement was approved by both Adams County and Denver voters in the late ' 80s .
From the beginning , plans for DIA were ambitious .
Peña , who now works in the local office of an international investment company , says he wanted the airport to make a " bold statement across the world " that would put Colorado on the global map .
And the scale of DIA reflected this desire :
It was to be the largest , most modern airport in the world .
But almost as soon as ground was broken in 1989 , problems cropped up .
The massive public - works project was encumbered by design changes , difficult airline negotiations , allegations of cronyism in the contracting process , rumors of mismanagement and real troubles with the $ 700 million ( and eventually abandoned ) automated baggage system .
Peña 's successor , Wellington Webb , was forced to push back the 1993 opening date three times .
By the time DIA finally opened in February 1995 , the original $ 1.5 billion cost had grown to $ 5.2 billion .
Three months after that opening , the Congressional Subcommittee on Aviation held a special hearing on DIA in which one member said the Denver airport represented the " worst in government inefficiency , political behind - the - scenes deal - making , and financial mismanagement . "
But Peña , who by then was serving as the Secretary of Transportation for President Bill Clinton , testified that despite the project 's shortcomings , more cities would need to construct world - class airports in the future .
And what looked like a gamble in 1995 seems to have paid off for Denver .
Today , DIA is considered one of the world 's most efficient , spacious and technologically advanced airports .
It is the fifth - busiest in the nation and tenth - busiest in the world , serving some 50 million passengers in 2006 .
Peña knows all about the statistics — but he had n't heard about any of the DIA conspiracies .
They " have no basis in fact , " he asserts , but still manages to put them in a positive light , suggesting that it's a compliment that Denver International Airport has attracted so much interest .
" If it were a boring architectural structure , if it were a minor cog in the complex system of aviation traffic around the world , it probably would n't get very much attention from anybody , " he says .
" So in a way , I would think of this as a somewhat interesting observation that people make of DIA , which means that people give it a lot of importance , which it deserves .
So I think it 's good in that sense . "
DIA spokesman Chuck Cannon has heard all about the DIA conspiracies .
He 's been getting questions about the underground bases and the airport 's connection to the New World Order since before DIA opened , at a rate of about one a month .
And his response has n't changed over the years .
With all of the intense public and media scrutiny of the airport project , he asks , how could these supposed underground facilities have been built without somebody seeing them or reporting them ?
" Sometimes these conspiracies are fun to read about , but they 're hokum ; they just do n't hold water , " Cannon says .
" And the people who say they 've been out here and worked on the project and saw all of this stuff being built are smoking something stronger than what they can buy at their local supermarket . "
The strangest theories he's heard are that the capstone in the main hall is a beacon for the mothership , and that underneath the basement is a camp for political prisoners .
" When I tell them it 's bunk , they say , ' Well , of course you 'd say that .
You work there .
You 're part of the conspiracy , too ! ' " he says .
" Well , if they think that 's true , why did they bother calling me ? "
No one has bothered to call Charles Ansbacher , now the conductor of the Boston Landmarks Orchestra , which gives free classical concerts at public landmarks around the Boston area .
But as the co-chair of the now - defunct New World Airport Commission , which orchestrated DIA 's opening festivities , Ansbacher would be a prime candidate for the conspiracists '
Illuminati puppet master .
Back in 1990 , the longtime arts advocate was living in Denver and working as an aesthetic design - policy advisor for DIA when he decided to start a not - for - profit organization that would help promote the new airport to the people of Denver , and enlisted big - name corporate and civic names to serve on the board .
Ansbacher can't quite remember how he came up with the name for the organization , but he guesses it might have come from Dvorák 's New World Symphony .
The New World Airport Commission name emphasized that DIA was the newest airport in the world , and the first new airport built in this country since Dallas / Fort Worth in 1973 , he says ; it did not symbolize that DIA was a monument to the New World Order .
" The idea that there is anything secretive about this is totally preposterous , " Ansbacher says .
The group 's main function was to plan both an air show and a public gala in 1993 , which went on despite the fact that the airport was delayed .
He was there the day the capstone , which is also a time capsule , was dedicated .
The Masonic symbol was placed on the stone because it was provided by a local Masonic lodge .
" One of the remaining things they do is provide time capsules , " he points out .
Ansbacher was also a force behind the plan to make art a pervasive part of the new airport .
With a budget of more than $ 7 million , DIA 's art program grew into the largest single - facility public - art program in the nation .
" We are definitely not a Greyhound bus depot , " says Colleen Fanning , DIA art program manager .
" We 're not just a bland environment .
We have a transitory public that oftentimes has a little bit of time to spend as they make their way through security .
We definitely want to enhance and humanize our spaces here at the airport and just beautify the experience . "
From the beginning of the design process , an effort was made to infuse art into the architecture , with 39 artists chosen to create original work for the project .
These artists were selected by a committee of public officials , community members and working artists .
There was a major cultural component to pieces chosen , and the committee was careful to include work by black , Native American and Hispanic artists .
Still , there was no specific slot for a Mayan artist — which Jay Weidner insists Tanguma is .
Fanning has gotten calls about Tanguma 's art , including one last year from a person who accused the airport of changing portions of his murals to cover up secret meanings .
" They basically scream at me and ask me why we have taken those murals down , but they 've never been changed or been taken down , " she says .
" Those murals will be there for a while .
They 're not coming down . "
In fact , DIA will soon be getting more art .
The airport will undergo $ 1.2 billion in infrastructure improvements over the next ten years , and under the city 's one - percent - for - art program that requires all capital improvement projects to allocate that percentage of the budget to art , Fanning 's program should get a significant boost .
And so the conspiracy calls will keep coming .
" And really , there is nothing controversial here at all , " Fanning insists .
" I really do n't give credence to any of the thinking that goes behind these theories . "
Weidner does .
He visited DIA while working on his documentary and checked out the Tanguma murals .
" I do n't know where he is , " Weidner says of the artist .
" Last I heard , he was in Chicago ; that 's all I could find out .
I know he was commissioned to do the murals , and I know he was told pretty much what to paint .
And that 's all I know .
He 's pretty much just gone away . "
Leo Tanguma , a quiet man with a gray goatee , has n't moved from Colorado since DIA opened .
Right now he 's standing in front of " The Children of the World Dream of Peace , " describing his work while travelers scurry past .
" This is my daughter 's friend , " he says , pointing to the children 's faces .
" That 's my niece .
Here 's my other niece .
This is my granddaughter , Sandiana .
This is my other granddaughter . "
Other faces belong to friends of the family , neighbors , relatives .
Some were victims of gang violence .
" This little boy was at the zoo with his parents .
At the zoo !
And somebody was having a war in the neighborhood , and one of those bullets came in the air and paralyzed him , " Tanguma says .
" It took him one year to die .
So when I met the parents , I went to their home , and they gave me his photographs . "
The children represent a wide assortment of nationalities : " Panama .
Brazil .
Greece .
Arabia .
Sweden .
Czech Republic . "
The mural is about kids dreaming of a world without violence , he explains , with the dream turning into a rainbow that leads to children of all nations putting down their weapons by beating swords into plowshares .
The soldier in the mural could be any soldier .
" That 's why I put a mask on him , " Tanguma explains .
" I did n't want to make him white or black .
I wanted to make him villainous to give that aspect of something vile , something real , something mean . "
Tanguma grew up in a small town in Texas , where Latinos were in the minority .
He created his first mural when he was in the fifth grade and the local sheriff shot and killed three of his cousins in a questionable incident .
He got up and went to the blackboard to draw what he liked to draw : horses , lions and tigers .
" But this kid , somebody , said , ' Draw me killing the sheriff . '
We were totally helpless in those days . "
So he drew the kid stabbing the sheriff .
And then the teacher walked in .
He got a few licks for his depiction .
" But somebody asked me to do that art , " he remembers .
" And in my life , I always felt that the community needed somebody to express its feelings . "
He only finished school through the sixth grade .
Later , he joined the military .
While overseas , he got his GED and took a cartooning correspondence course .
Once out of the service , Tanguma went to Texas Southern University in 1972 , where he 'd paint community - center walls or street murals for small commissions .
His murals can now be found on the walls of elementary schools , college campuses , housing projects , churches and art museums across the western U.S .
Tanguma moved to Colorado in 1983 because he thought there would be more opportunity here .
The first piece he did in town was a mural in response to gang violence , paid for with small donations from churches and neighbors .
In 1993 , Tanguma got a $ 100,000 commission for DIA .
Initially , it was for one mural — but as he started painting , he decided to do more .
" I wanted it to live up to how I felt about Denver , for the opportunity , " he says .
He insists that he was given no guidelines for what to paint , and it took him three years to finish the work .
" I tried to paint according to my conscience .
Because I told the committee I tried not to paint just for decoration .
It has to have a meaning . "
But meaning is created by the viewer as much as the artist .
And it 's not just conspiracy theorists who find unintended meaning in the murals .
Tanguma remembers how passersby would question his work even while he was finishing it on the walls at DIA .
One man complained that the Scottish boy 's shawl had the crest of an enemy of his clan , so Tanguma included the man 's family crest on the shawl .
Others wondered why the multi-racial murals did n't have more black people , or white people , or why one country 's flag seemed to be covering another's .
No matter how big the murals , no matter how inclusive the content , viewers always seem able to find a subtext , a code that explains the chaos now common in the new world .
Tanguma 's murals have even traveled from the world of fictional fact into outright fiction .
In Forever Conceal , Never Reveal , a novel published online in 2005 , Washington - based author Dawn Meier wrote about a character who got sucked into the Masonic underworld and traveled to DIA in one scene :
" How on earth did the city of Denver approve of such horrific murals in their airport ? "
Aaron asked .
" They really did n't have anything to say about it .
Freedom of speech ; freedom of expression in art ; all the freedom arguments allowed the Masons to influence all the murals you see .
Here is another one . "
They moved on to the next one .
" Oh , Gordon .
How horrible .
I can't believe my eyes ; a dark green giant monster wearing what looks like a gas mask , destroying a city .
And what are these ?
It looks like women carrying dead babies .
What sick person drew all these ? "
" It does n't matter who drew them , Aaron .
This is the future . "
Tanguma says he would like to " have a chance to meet with those folks and explain to them what I meant by this .
I 'm not part of any conspiracy whatsoever .
I mean , it 's weird to be saying that .
In general , this is about humanity .
What could they find bad about this ? "

BARDALA , West Bank ( Reuters ) -
In the plains around the village of Bardala , the Israeli - Palestinian tug - of - war over land and water plays itself out in vivid colour -- largely brown Palestinian farms border green fields owned by Jewish settlers .

Israel and the occupied West Bank have both been hit hard by drought , but Palestinian farmers say Israeli restrictions on their water supplies have made conditions far worse for them than for farmers in nearby Jewish settlements .
In many homes in the West Bank city of Jenin , water has been all but cut off since April .
To cope , residents of Jenin and hundreds of villages get their water delivered by truck at sky - high prices .
In U.S. - sponsored peace talks over Palestinian statehood , disputes over water may be overshadowed by more sensitive issues like the future of Jerusalem and refugees .
But Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said an accord would be “ unthinkable ” without agreement on dividing up the region ’s water resources .
“ If you want to have a state , you must have water , ” said Palestinian Water Authority chief Shaddad Attili .
In Bardala in the northern Jordan Valley , Ziyad Sawafta says he gets only enough water to plant eggplant , cabbage and other crops on half his 125 - acre ( 50 hectare ) plot .
To illustrate the disparity , Sawafta , a 60 - year - old father of four , points to the thriving citrus grove next door , owned by the Jewish settlement of Mehola and fed with water through a network of irrigation pipes .
“ We get only the ear from the whole camel .
The rest of the camel goes to the settlements , ” said Sawafta , using a common Arab saying to illustrate how little water he receives .
Uri Shor , spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority , said Palestinians get more water than called for under interim peace agreements .
He attributed shortages to Palestinians who he said illegally tap into the water system .
SCARCE WATER
Water has long been a scarce resource in the Middle East but the problem is more acute this year .
Scant rainfall has further strained supplies already restricted by Israel , which largely controls the West Bank ’s three main aquifers .
Water Authority Chief Attili estimated Palestinian farmers in West Bank and Gaza need 250 million cubic metres of water per year only for irrigation , but they get only about 20 percent of that , or about 50 million cubic metres a year .
The total amount of water that Palestinians get from their own resources and from Israel is estimated at 205 million cubic metres annually .

“ People and land are thirsty and we can do little about it , ” Attili told Reuters .
Palestinian officials say Israel controls some 50 West Bank wells , with a total capacity of 50 million cubic metres per year , directing it mainly to Jewish settlements , which house some 250,000 people .
The Palestinians control about 200 shallow wells in the West Bank , many of them drilled before the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel captured the territory .
Those wells produce about 105 million cubic metres per year , but they are meant to supply water to 2.5 million Palestinians .
Attili says West Bank Palestinians supplement their own well supplies by buying up to 45 million cubic metres of water from Israel .
Another 5 million cubic metres bought from Israel goes to the Gaza Strip , supplementing 50 million from an aquifer .
A big part of the problem for Palestinians , officials and rights groups say , is that the amount of water supplied by Israel , set by quotas in interim peace agreements in the 1990s , has not increased in line with Palestinian population growth .
“ That is not fair , ” Attili said , adding that the shortages could be alleviated if Israel allowed his authority to drill two or three new wells in the West Bank .
But Shor , of the Israeli Water Authority , said permitting Palestinians to drill more wells could “ ruin ” the existing West Bank aquifers .
Israeli officials say Palestinians are n’t the only ones facing water shortages .
Underscoring its concerns , Israel ’s government has launched a public campaign to discourage residents and businesses from wasting limited supplies .
Abdel - Rahman Tamimi , head of the Palestinian Hydrology Group , said there was no comparison between the shortages facing Israelis and those facing Palestinians in the West Bank because some areas do not even have piped water and other areas suffer from irregular access to drinkable water .
He described the West Bank water crisis as “ suffocating ” because it affects both families and businesses , “ whereas Israel is talking about reducing water for recreational purposes , such as ... swimming pools and lawns ” .
A recent report by the Israeli human rights group B’tselem said Israeli households consumed on average 3.5 times as much water as Palestinian households .
The group attributed the water shortage in Palestinian areas to what it called Israel ’s “ discriminatory ” policy in distributing water resources and restrictions on drilling new wells .
WATER TRUCKS
The shortages have translated into brisk business for water delivery trucks in several West Bank areas .
Jenin is connected to the water system but dwindling supplies have forced many there to turn to water vendors , whose prices have soared due to heavy demand and limited supply .
A recent U.N. report found that Palestinians in some of the hardest - hit communities were spending as much as 30 percent to 40 percent of their income on water delivered by truck .
The Israeli Water Authority did not return several calls from Reuters to request similar information about Israeli consumers .
“ I have never witnessed such shortage before , ” said Hussein Rahhal , a 73 - year - old Jenin water vendor , as he stood by his truck in a long queue of similar vehicles waiting to fill their tanks .
He added that some Jenin wells have already dried up .
His colleague , Hashem Abdel - Hafith , who nodded in agreement with Rahhal , said he switched off his mobile phone because he could n’t keep up with callers demanding water .
“ I kept answering : ‘ No water , ’ ” Abdel - Hafith said .
In Bardala , home to nearly 2,000 Palestinians , farmers remember better days .
Bardala had a surplus of water until the late 1970s when Israel drilled three deep wells next to the village ’s four shallow wells , causing them to dry up , they said .
Since then , Israel has reduced the amount of water it pumps to Bardala ’s farms , from 240 cubic metres per hour to 140 , forcing many to slash production by up to 50 percent and to choose crops such as eggplant and beans that can survive on one watering per week .
Yousef Sawafta , another farmer from Bardala , said prices were falling because everyone in the village was planting the same drought - resistant crops .
“ In the past , one could find all kinds of vegetables throughout the year .
It is not the same any more , ” he said .

( New York , N.Y. ) U.S. banks borrowed $ 188 billion per day on average in the latest week from the Federal Reserve , meaning that the Fed loaned out more money than the Treasury ’s proposed bailout in just one week , still barely managing to keep the economy afloat .
Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday the total amount banks borrowed nearly quadrupled the previous record of $ 47.97 billion per day notched just the week before , Reuters reports .
$ 188 billion per day on average over the course of five days means that the total amount borrowed from the Fed in the week ending the 24th September stood at $ 940 billion – a figure that easily eclipses the proposed $ 700 billion bailout .
As we have already reported , the $ 700 billion number was simply pulled out of thin air by the Treasury .
The Treasury ’s fact sheet about the bailout states , “ The Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets . ”
This gives the government and the Federal Reserve carte blanche to do whatever they want to long as it is done in the name of stabilizing financial markets , they can nationalize any company or industry and use taxpayer money , above and beyond the initial $ 700 billion , for whatever purpose is deemed necessary , without any oversight .
Paulson ’s bailout plan is also unreviewable by any court , it will remain in perpetuity .
Paulson ’s draft bailout plans says : “ The Secretary ’s authority to purchase mortgage - related assets under this Act shall be limited to $ 700,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time . ”
As Chris Martenson writes , “ This means that $ 700 billion is NOT the cost of this dangerous legislation , it is only the amount that can be outstanding at any one time .
After , say , $ 100 billion of bad mortgages are disposed of , another $ 100 billion can be bought .
In short , these four little words assure that there is NO LIMIT to the potential size of this bailout .
This means that $ 700 billion is a rolling amount , not a ceiling . ”
If the bailout bill passes it is just the beginning of something much larger .
$ 700 billion is a meaningless figure that will do nothing to shore up the economy .
It is not a bailout , it is a giveaway that will allow insiders to purge themselves of bad bets and free to continue where they left off .
The real reason for the bill is the unprecedented transfer of power to the Executive Branch and into the hands of the global corporate elite .

Britain has failed in its duty to stop the US from committing " shameful acts " in the treatment of suspects detained during the war on terror , one of America 's most respected intellectuals warns today .
In an interview with The Independent , Professor Noam Chomsky calls on the Government to use its special relationship with Washington America to secure the closure of Guantanamo Bay .
Claiming that he has heard only " twitters of protest " in the UK , the emeritus professor of linguistics also asks British " thinkers " to be more conspicuous in their opposition to the erosion of civil rights since the 9.11 attacks on the US .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the wake of the invasion of Iraq , Prof Chomsky , a leading opponent of the Vietnam conflict , has been the most prominent among US intellectuals critical of the war with the Iraq and the treatment of terror suspects sent to Guantanamo Bay and other prison camps around the world .
Professor Chomsky 's comments now call into question Britain 's political and intellectual will to stand up for the rule of law in the face of actions that have been repeatedly condemned by courts on both sides of the Atlantic .
While a small number of British writers , artists and philosophers continue to voice their concerns about UK involvement in America 's rendition programme and its refusal to close Guantanamo Bay , a concerted opposition among the so called liberal intelligentsia has failed to materialise .
" A country , " says Prof Chomsky , " with any shred of self - respect will be vigilant to ensure that it does not take part in this criminal savagery .
Because of the " special relationship , " Britain has a particularly strong responsibility to bar these shameful crimes in any way it can .
[ And ]
In whatever respect the relationship is " special " , the UK can use it to bar these shameful crimes . "
Asked whether Britain should be doing more to seek the closure of the Guantanamo Bay , Professor Chomsky answered : " Definitely .
I 've seen only twitters of protest . "
Noam Chomsky has been a fearless critic of US foreign policy since the 1960s when he became one of the leading opponents of the Vietnam War with the publication of his essay , " The Responsibility of Intellectuals " in 1967 .
And his reputation as an outspoken American dissident has made him many enemies in his own country where he requires police protection .
Professor Chomsky believes that the case against Guantanamo needs to be made more forcefully .

" We hardly needed evidence ( although there is more than enough ) that Gitmo was going to be a torture chamber , " says Prof Chomsky .
" Otherwise , why not place " enemy combatants " in a prison in New York ?
The security argument is not serious .
Taking a step back , does the US have the right to hold these prisoners at all ?
Hardly obvious .
In brief , there are plenty of grounds for protest ( and action ) , at varying levels of depth . "
His comments have met with broad support from those who have been campaigning for the British government to take a more critical position in its relationship with the Bush administration .
Clive Stafford Smith , the lawyer representing British Guantanamo detainee , Binyam Mohamed , said : " Professor Chomsky is right .
To borrow from President Clinton , the world is much more impressed by the power of America 's example than the example of American power .
Likewise , the world is more impressed by British principle than the pretense of Britain 's special relationship .
A true friend to American would not stand by while President Bush squanders America 's birthright . "
Andrew Tyrie MP , chairman of the all party parliamentary group on rendition , said : " The UK Government 's reaction to the US programme of rendition : a policy of kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be tortured , has been inadequate , to say the least .
It is scarcely credible that now , despite all we know about rendition and the UK 's involvement in it , the British Government still refuses to condemn this illegal , immoral , and counterproductive policy . "
He adds : " As an Atlanticist , I believe that a strong transatlantic alliance is an essential part of combating dangerous extremism .
But this does not mean turning a blind eye or , as the High Court recently found in the case of Binyam Mohamed , facilitating America 's deeply damaging rendition programme .
We cannot afford to undermine the values we are seeking to export .
The UK must use its influence to convince the United States that rendition does precisely this . "
But Peter Hitchens , political commentator and author , argues that many of the so called liberal intelligentsia , who might have been expected to oppose the Iraqi war and other US policies , have placed too much faith in a Labour government : " I think perhaps Chomsky has been looking in the wrong place .
The Mail on Sunday and I have certainly been trenchant in our criticism of some this – the war in Iraq and Guantanamo .
For example , we were one of the first to run pictures of the orange jumpsuits alongside stories about Guantanamo . "
Mr Hitchens says Prof Chomsky is right in the sense that many of the writers on left have either supported the war or made no protest .
" In some respects there has been a failure of the modern left , where traditional leftwing writers have been supporting the ' war on terror ' as some sort of liberal crusade .
That is partly because of the Labour government which made the left believe they have had friends in office .
Chomsky needs to look in other places if he wants to find voices of criticism . "
Professor Chomsky , professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog , says that the US must now hand Guantanamo Bay back to Cuba .
" The region was taken by a ' treaty ' that Cuba was forced to sign under military occupation .
The US has been violating the terms of this outrageous treaty for decades - e.g. , using it for holding Haitians who were illegally captured when they were feeling terror in Haiti ( for which the US bore ample responsibility ) .
Current use also radically violates the terms of the outrageous treaty . "
Rise of a libertarian socialist
Noam Chomsky , 79 , rose to prominence in the field of linguistics during the 1950s by positing new theories on the structures of language .
His naturalistic approach to the study of linguistics deeply influenced thinking in both psychology and philosophy .
But it was his strident opposition to the Vietnam War which brought him to the attention of a wider American public .
Through his adherence to libertarian socialism he became a cheerleader for the dissident left in opposition to many aspects of US foreign policy .
Later he described his belief as " the proper and natural extension of classical liberalism into the era of advanced industrial society " .
Professor Chomsky , who lives in Lexington , Massachusetts , has been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq and the " war on terror " .
In 2005 he was voted the leading living public intellectual in the Global Intellectuals Poll run by the magazine Prospect .
His characteristic reaction to the news of his achievement was : " I do n't pay a lot of attention to polls . "

Eleven pelicans have been found on Bolsa Chica State Beach this week with their wings intentionally broken , prompting an investigation by federal wildlife authorities and the offer of a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest .
The sole pelican to survive is being cared for at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center of Orange County , which put up the reward .
Ten of the birds were less than a year old and were probably feeding in the water , said Lisa Birkle , the Huntington Beach center ’s assistant wildlife director , adding that residents have reported seeing fishing boats close to shore in recent days .
“ The birds targeted are new birds arriving from the Channel Islands , ” she said .
“ They are young and inexperienced and do n’t have a fear of humans .
. . .
Because they ’re so hungry , they ’ll go right up to people . ”

With ocean temperatures around 70 degrees , small fish that would normally provide food for the birds near the surface have submerged deeper in search of cooler water .
Nine pelicans were found Monday by a Bolsa Chica lifeguard .
The two others were found near the same lifeguard tower in subsequent days .
Birkle said the injuries were consistent : “ Someone is snapping the wings backward . ”
Because the pelicans were found wet with sand packed into their exposed wounds , it is suspected that they were injured in the water and dragged themselves up on shore .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating .

Stephen Hawking has made his way back to Cambridge after participating in the launch of the LHC to unveil an unbelievable new clock at Corpus Christi College .
Designer John
Taylor intended the clock to be " terrifying , " saying that he views time as " as not on your side . "
In his words , time will " eat up every minute of your life , and as soon as one has gone he 's salivating for the next . "
Dubbed as the " strangest clock in the word , " the Corpus clock features a time - devouring grasshopper at its top that moves around the face one second at a time .
As it moves , the 60 slits cut into its face light up to show the time .
It took a team of eight engineers and craftsman five years to mold the clock , and it is expected to last another 25 years on its current electric motor .
" Conventional clocks with hands are boring , " Taylor admits .
" I wanted to make timekeeping interesting . "
Mission accomplished , my friend .
It 's hard to imagine that something so sinister looking could have come out of the mind of that harmless looking older gentleman in the video .
I mean , he made his fortune developing the kettle thermostat , for crying out loud .

Gallup Daily : Obama Stretches Lead to 8 Points Lead one of largest in campaign
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking finds Barack Obama moving to an eight percentage point lead over John McCain , 49 % to 41 % .
Obama 's significant lead over McCain almost certainly reflects the effects of the Democratic National Convention .
The two presidential candidates were tied at 45 % in the last Gallup Poll Daily tracking results conducted entirely before the convention began .
The latest results include interviews from Tuesday through Thursday night , though most of the interviewing was conducted before Obama 's acceptance speech late Thursday .
Gallup has measured the convention bounce for candidates in previous years by comparing the last poll conducted entirely before the convention began with the first poll conducted entirely after the convention concludes .
That historical calculation is complicated this year by the intense media focus on McCain 's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate on Friday , and the increasing focus on next week 's Republican National Convention .
Obama has clearly seen a rise in the polls since the convention began with a 4 - point increase in his support ( from 45 % to 49 % ) with the margin moving eight points in his favor .
Obama 's largest advantage at any point in the campaign was a 9 - point lead recorded July 24 - 26 , so as his party 's convention concludes , he is about as strongly positioned as he has been at any point this year .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Aug. 26 - 28 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,727 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Remember Barack Obama ?
Time was , you could n't turn on the television or open a newspaper without seeing our next president - for that was how we thought of him , in those days .
But lately the man with the striped ties and the big ears has been more difficult to find in the American mediascape .
On Sunday , Obama gave a wide - ranging interview to one of the morning talkshows , in which he offered a thoughtful , complex assessment of the Iraq surge and discussed how rising unemployment and the Fannie - Freddie bailout might change his economic plans .
What crumb did the wire services seize upon ?
A throwaway line about basketball : " Obama offers Palin a game of hoops . "
John McCain 's running mate might be avoiding the press , but Sarah Palin is everywhere - on the covers of Time and Newsweek , not to mention People and Us Weekly .
You'd be forgiven if you thought that the woman was running for president herself .
A good fraction of the coverage has been harsh , yes .
But it has also been frustratingly distracted .
The idiotic rumours that her ( now pregnant ) daughter is the true mother of child
No 5 were unworthy of a telenovela , but that did n't stop the New York Times from putting four different reporters on the case .
Her string of alleged abuses of power , her rejection of the realities of climate change , her apparent ignorance of the basics of the mortgage market : these are stories worth covering , and they 've got a bit of play .
But they 've been drowned out by the dumber stories about her hair or her family , and by the Republican chorus that the media have it in for her .
" Shame on you ! " they shouted in unison , like Puritans around a ducking stool , as Palin scolded the media during her speech last Wednesday in St Paul .
It 's ironic , to say the least , that the GOP has decided to hit the press in order to win an election for McCain , a man who has enjoyed the media 's adulation for 25 years and who used to call reporters " my base " .
But the stratagem is plain : discredit the messenger , and reports on Palin 's serious ethics problems or shoddy record can be written off as baseless ( and sexist ) attacks by a group with a vendetta , hell - bent on destroying an unimpeachable hockey mom who shares your values .
Unlike that other guy .
In its malign simplicity , the beat - the - press theme bears the mark of Steve Schmidt , the Karl Rove acolyte who has imposed an impressive unity on the once - errant McCain campaign .
For him , reporters are on " a mission to destroy " their VP candidate , hopelessly infatuated with Obama and not to be trusted .
But demonising the media and keeping the running mate under a form of house arrest are not winning tactics .
Indeed , like the Palin pick itself , the media bashing does little more than excite the base .
For despite the hysteria of a few lefties who seem never to have heard of a convention bounce , Palin has not instantly won the hearts of millions of undecided voters in Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan .
On the contrary , outside the base she has n't played very well – and she has nowhere to go but down .
The McCain campaign understands that inevitability .
Palin 's sequestration is testament to the fact that she cannot withstand the scrutiny that the press ( though not , apparently , McCain 's vetting process ) demands .
And the campaign 's legal actions in Alaska , where it 's doing its best to block any embarrassing new revelations surrounding her firing of her public safety commissioner , bespeak a real fear of an October surprise .
It 's a war against information .
The McCain team knows that if the media do their job and give Palin the same scrutiny that any candidate for high office must endure , she will collapse .
Whether that will happen , or whether the press will be cowed by the GOP into doubting its own raison d'être , remains to be seen .
Palin will emerge from her televisual purdah at the end of this week , when she 'll face Charles Gibson , the ABC anchor who has not won much praise lately for hard - hitting journalism .
The Clinton - Obama debate that he moderated ( along with George Stephanopoulos ) set new standards for vacuity , with nearly an hour devoted to such non-topics as the iconology of flag lapel pins .
Rick Hertzberg , the indispensable analyst at the New Yorker , called it " something akin to a federal crime " .
Here 's hoping that Gibson asks Palin a few questions about her record - and also a few about instability in Pakistan or how to increase liquidity in credit markets .
But do n't get your hopes up .
Bizarrely , Gibson will interview Palin over the course of a few days , meaning that if the questioning turns in a direction the campaign does n't like , later sessions can be cancelled .
If he fluffs it , we may have to wait all the way until the vice - presidential debate on October 8 to put real questions to the woman who might one day be president .
Local councils , health authorities and hundreds of other public bodies are to be given the power to access details of everyone 's personal text , emails and internet use under Home Office proposals published yesterday .
Ministers want to make it mandatory for telephone and internet companies to keep details of all personal internet traffic for at least 12 months so it can be accessed for investigations into crime or other threats to public safety .
The Home Office last night admitted that the measure will mean companies have to store " a billion incidents of data exchange a day " .
As the measure is the result of an EU directive , the data will be made available to public investigators across Europe .
The consultation paper published yesterday estimates that it will cost the internet industry over £ 50 m to store the mountain of data .
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats last night branded the measure a " snooper 's charter " .
When the measure was floated after the London bombings in 2005 by the then home secretary , Charles Clarke , it was justified on the grounds that it was needed to investigate terrorist plots and organised crime .
But the Home Office document makes clear that the personal data will now be available for all sorts of crime and public order investigations and may even be used to prevent people self - harming .
The measure will mean that details of personal internet and text traffic , but not the content , will have to be made available by telecommunications companies to public sector officials investigating crime , or to " protect the public " .
The measure will also cover VOIP - voice over internet protocol - calls such as Skype .
The Home Office confirmed yesterday that access to personal internet and text data will also be available to all public bodies licensed under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) .
This means that hundreds of public bodies including local councils , health authorities , the Food Standards Agency , the Health and Safety Commission and even the education standards watchdog , Ofsted , will be able to require telecommunications companies to hand over the personal data .
It is already mandatory for telecommunications companies such as BT , Orange and O2 to keep records of all mobile and landline phone traffic .
They voluntarily store electronic internet data as well .
But the Home Office said yesterday they now had to make it mandatory because of a European directive requiring all such personal data to be collected across all EU states .
This is justified on the grounds that much of the information is already stored as billing information by the companies .
Clarke campaigned strongly in Europe for the measure to be adopted after the 7/7 bombings in London .
The government has already indicated that it intends to go one step further this autumn by introducing a draft communications bill which would require all the telecommunications companies to hand over this data to one central " super " database so that the police and other public authorities will be able to access it directly without having to make a request each time to the individual company holding the records .
A Home Office spokesman said that historic communications data was a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime : " This data allows investigators to identify suspects , examine their contacts , establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time , " he said .
" It also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities , identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest .
Many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data .
Without the EC directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost . "
But the Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said that ministers had proved time and again they were not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seemed intent on pressing ahead with this snooper 's charter : " We will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if Ripa powers are anything to go by , it will soon be used to spy on ordinary people 's kids , pets and bins . "
The shadow home secretary , Dominic Grieve , added : " Yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances . "
The chief surveillance commissioner , Sir Christopher Rose , last month criticised local councils for " a serious misunderstanding of the concept of proportionality " in their use of their intrusive surveillance powers .
JERUSALEM - Doctors in Israel say a premature baby girl who survived six hours in a hospital morgue refrigerator after being declared stillborn has died despite efforts to save her .
The baby had been delivered in the 23rd week of pregnancy at a weight of just one pound , five ounces and was initially declared dead and placed in the morgue .
When the parents came to collect the tiny body for burial on Monday they found the baby breathing and showing a faint heartbeat and she was rushed to the intensive care unit .
Hospital deputy director Moshe Daniel said the child died early today .
He told Army Radio the specific cause of death would only be known after a post - mortem examination .
SUSPICION of banks is a recurrent historical theme , from President Andrew Jackson 's opposition to “ money power ” in the early 19th century , to the British Labour party 's suspicion of the “ bankers ' ramp ” that forced it from office in 1931 .
So there is a natural temptation to think that the current crisis may be entirely artificial , a device dreamed up by bankers to help them out of a hole .
But if there is a conspiracy , it is extremely well organised and extraordinarily risky .
The money markets are a bit like the sewers of the financial system : in normal times , nobody notices them but when they get blocked up , the stench is abominable .
And they are severely congested at the moment .
The good news is that , unlike last week , it is possible for banks to borrow overnight at a reasonable rate .
The bad news is that borrowing at longer rates is either impossible or prohibitively expensive .
Why is this ?
The problem seems to relate to the money - market fund sector , which suffered an outflow of assets when one of them “ broke the buck ” ( failed to repay clients at face value ) last week .
Other funds are desperate not to repeat the trick , so are desperately opting for safe assets , which means those offered by the American government .
Consequently , three - month Treasury bills were yielding just 0.43 % last week ( something like 2 % would be more normal ) .
According to Barclays Capital , the cost of long - term financial debt was some 450 basis points ( 4.5 percentage points ) above that of government debt , compared with a normal spread of less than 50 basis points .
Shorter term , the gap between three month Libor ( the rate at which banks borrow ) and that paid by the government is getting wider and wider ( see chart ) .
At that level , it is simply uneconomic for banks to lend money to customers .
So they wo n't .
Banks are getting by on borrowing overnight , but the markets for one and three - month loans have dried up .
That explains why central banks have been forced to offer billions of dollars at those maturities .
This cannot last long without causing immense damage .
Companies will be unable to raise new money and , more importantly , refinance old loans .
Corporate bankruptcies will soar .
Consumers will also find it difficult , or expensive , to borrow .
The result will be a sharp downturn in demand that will push the economy into a deep recession .
So some kind of bailout deal is necessary .
Whether all the details were right is , at the moment , secondary to whether it does the trick .
And the trick will be the restoration of confidence in the banking system .
It is , indeed , unfair that banks tend to be rescued when they go wrong whereas coal mines and shoe retailers do not .
But banks play a key role in oiling the system ; they provide the credit that lets the rest of us do business .
They also have innate risk , because they lend more money then they have cash in hand .
To put it another way , they borrow short and lend long .
This has made them the subject of panics throughout history , and those panics have always led to economic turbulence .
The authorities can let them go bust , but the risk is depression .
Or they can hold their noses and bail them out .
They have , after all , not got away entirely scot - free .
A lot of bonuses in recent years have been paid in the form of restricted stock , and that has fallen sharply in value .
Jobs have been lost at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , and more will follow .
In future , banks will have to accept a lot more regulation ; in particular , higher capital ratios that will restrict the potential for profitability .
And there will be more crises in future .
Now that investment banks are part of commercial banks , we have returned to the risks that characterised the system before the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 — specifically , that reckless investment banks can fritter away retail depositors ' money .
And what will we have to do if that happens ?
Bail them out again .

Business correspondent , BBC Scotland
The North Sea has almost as much oil left as has already been extracted , a BBC Scotland investigation has been told .
Experts believe between 25 and 30 billion barrels could still be recovered over the next 40 years .
Calculating oil reserves is not an exact science and this fact has made it difficult over the years to weigh up the true wealth of oil beneath the North Sea .
Oil producers have tended to play down their oil reserves .
The markets do not cope well with shocks , so companies take the view that it is better to pleasantly surprise than disappoint them .
In 2004 , Shell stunned shareholders when it revised its proven oil and gas reserves , slimming the figure by 20 % .
The revelation had an instant impact on the company 's share price and has served as a lesson to the industry ever since .
The first minister and former oil economist Alex Salmond told me that there was another motivation for oil companies ' reticence .
He said : " If oil companies said ' look we 've got lots of reserves in the future ' , the immediate response of government would be to stick taxation up .
So there was a kind of incentive for the big companies to underplay the significance of the province . "
That is hardly surprising - since the late 1960s , the oil companies have paid £ 140bn in taxation to the Treasury .
We 're bringing on four new fields this year .
We 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds
John Gallagher
Shell
That is a pretty big disincentive .
No wonder there is such divergence over how much oil is left in the North Sea .
Sir Bernard Ingham , who was press secretary in the Department of Energy when North Sea oil came ashore , admitted that government negotiations with the oil companies always boiled down to the same thing - taxation .
As he put it : " The whole political calculation is how much brass can you get out of North Sea oil without driving the oil companies away . "
The one thing that I did not expect to find in my investigation was that the proven reserves on some of the region 's oldest fields are in fact rising .
The Forties Field , one of the biggest and most iconic , is still producing oil 33 years after the first oil was pumped ashore .
Higher costs
Five years ago , BP sold it to the Texas - based oil exploration and production company Apache .
Since then Apache has invested $ 2bn in the field 's sub sea network , its platforms and in re-evaluating how much oil is in the field .
According to Jim House , CEO of Apache , flow rates from the Forties field have increased and the amount of recoverable oil has also increased .
He said : " Forties was definitely showing her age when Apache took it .
At the time when it was sold , pre-developed reserved were in the region of 150 million barrels .
We ended last year with 200 million barrels on our books . "

The downside to operating off the coast of Scotland has always been the relatively higher cost and , as the region matures , that cost factor is becoming more fundamental for the oil majors .
Shell has also been selling off some of its core assets in the North Sea to newer and more aggressive companies like Fairfield Energy .
Through shooting new seismic surveys and drilling new wells these new players are extending the life of North Sea oil fields .
John Gallagher , from Shell in Aberdeen , said his company was still committed to the area .
He said : " We 're bringing on four new fields this year .
We 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds .
" The plant rejuvenation work that we 're doing is hundreds of millions of pounds and the work we 're doing cross - border - linking up Norway and the UK , which is a growing trend in our industry - is again hundreds of millions of pounds . "
Huge gamble
The same high oil price that makes it harder for you and me to drive to the shops on a whim is making it easier for companies to take a gamble on previously undeveloped parts of the North Sea .
With a simple oil well costing $ 22 m to drill , exploration companies are taking a huge gamble .
Canadian oil exploration company Oilexco last year drilled 39 out of 140 exploration and appraisal wells in the North Sea , despite rising costs .
Its chief executive officer , Arthur Millholland , said " In 2004 we were paying approximately $ 55,000 a day for a drilling rig .
" Today we 're paying $ 350,000 a day .
So even though the price of oil today is higher than it was in 2004 , our costs of doing business here have increased just as dramatically . "
It still seems to be worth their while staying in the North Sea , despite the high costs .
What I have seen in my investigation is an industry that is better placed to shoulder these costs .
Smaller companies with lower overheads can go after smaller pockets of oil and still make a decent profit .
How long will North Sea oil last ?
The answer to that depends on many things , including market conditions , future government initiatives and constant technological improvements .
Technology alone is playing its part in extending the activity in the North Sea .
John Forrest , Talisman Energy 's general manager for the Flotta Catchment Area , said the company was now drilling wells that they were unable to drill five to 10 years ago .
World - class
He said : " We 're bringing on fields that we 've known were there for quite a long time but they just were n't economic or we did n't have the technologies .
We recently brought on a field without drilling any more wells .
We just had better technology . "
The Talisman - owned Claymore platform is expected to keep pumping oil for another 30 years .
Mr Forrest said : " We foresee an economic life at that installation until the late 2030s and that 's with the ideas we currently have .
We think other innovations will come along that will almost certainly extend that . "
The North Sea has many things in its favour .
It has world - class geology which makes it attractive to those wanting to harvest its rich reservoirs .
Compared with many of the world 's oil producing regions , it is governed by a relatively stable political and economic regime .
The market price of oil is a much more volatile factor , but at current prices the oil that still lies beneath the North Sea is becoming more and more valuable every day .
BBC Scotland 's journalists are focusing on the high price of oil , and what this means for the industry in the North Sea , this week .
Hayley Miller will present a special hour - long documentary - Truth , Lies , Scotland and Oil - at 2240 BST on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland .

What are these ?
The BigBelly is a trash receptacle that is totally solar powered .
The BigBelly can take up as much space as the normal trash receptacle but can accommodate up to five times more than the normal receptacle .
This feature will lessen the pick - up interval of the waste collection truck and will eventually help lessen green house gas emission .
However , too much amount of wastes may cause some foul odors and will eventually cause some air pollution .
But if something can be done to avoid the spread of foul odor , then the BigBelly is top notch .
Perfect for school campuses and public places .
The BigBelly is an excellent design solution because it helps improve the environment in many ways .
Garbage trucks burn over 1 billion gallons of diesel a year , wreaking havoc on the environment .
Using solar power , the Big Belly compacts trash to a quarter of its original size so collection trips can be reduced by 75 % .
The amount of energy used to drive a garbage truck for one mile can run a BigBelly for eight years .
Trash overflow and litter are also reduced with the Big Belly , which improves the visual appearance of the cityscape and reduces the presence of pests ( rats , pigeons , etc ) .
Reducing the manufacturing costs allows the client to have a more viable business and produce enough products for the demand .
The Big Belly is being used in some of the biggest cities in the world , including New York , Boston and Chicago .
The new design is more attractive than its predecessor and the color palate is a neutral addition to cities .
In addition , custom colored recycled plastic can be ordered to match certain themes , such as a university colors .

Republicans accuse Mr Obama of being more of a celebrity than a leader White House hopeful Barack Obama has hit back over a TV ad which questions his readiness to lead the US .
Republican John McCain 's campaign released the ad , which juxtaposes images of Mr Obama with those of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Titled " Celeb " , the ad calls Mr Obama the " biggest celebrity in the world " , but questions his economic policies .
The Democrat responded by accusing his rival of negative campaigning , and of only revealing what he was against .
" You need to ask John McCain what he 's for , not just what he 's against , " Mr Obama said while on the campaign trail in Missouri .
The ad shows images of the Illinois senator speaking to a 200,000 - strong crowd in Berlin last week , interspersed with shots of celebrities Spears and Hilton .
The ad , set to be broadcast in nearly a dozen key states , was followed by a rival ad from Mr Obama 's own campaign team .

It accuses Mr McCain of practising the " policies of the past " , and uses images of him with President George W Bush .
Mr Obama 's chief strategist , David Axelrod , told MSNBC the McCain ad was " balony " .
" I am going to paraphrase , oops he did it again , " he said , playing off the title of a Britney Spears song and album .
" This is not the John McCain we expected . "
Rapper row The Republicans have been keen to stress their belief that Mr Obama is not tested , not ready to lead and too out of touch with the public .
JUSTIN WEBB'S AMERICA
This latest ad is a cleverer effort I think at debunking Obama - less angry than the military hospital attempt but sowing the seeds of doubt
Sowing the seeds of doubt Obama slams Ludacris lyrics
The Democrats have meanwhile distanced themselves from lyrics by supporter and rapper Ludacris , which brag about an Obama presidency being destiny , call President Bush " mentally handicapped " and say Mr McCain does n't belong " in any chair unless he is paralysed " .
Mr McCain 's campaign manager said it was up to the American people to decide what was positive or negative .
" I 'm going to do everything in my power to protect my candidate and to define the race in terms that I think are appropriate , " said Rick Davis .

You know , there ’s a reason why famous sayings are , well , famous sayings .
It ’s because they ’re true and they usually sum up this truth is just a few words so as to package their neat truism in a tidy little box .
BMJ ’s article , New York ’s road to health , quickly brought to mind one of those sayings in just two simple words :
Money Talks
If you ’ll allow me to though , I ’m going to add three words to this saying to make it even more apropos for this topic :
Across the Board Money Talks
In Karen McColl ’s feature story , New York ’s daring health initiatives are summarized with an emphasis on the role that current New York City mayor , Michael Bloomberg , plays in these events .
New York City has plenty to boast about when it comes to health mandates that have successfully been put in place : the Smoke Free Air Act , the phasing out of trans fatty acids from many restaurants , and requiring certain restaurant menu items to list calorie information .
But the most recent health initiative is the one that I found surprising .
As part of a pilot project , selected low - income families can earn money for taking care of themselves and their families .
How much money ?
Maintaining subsidized health insurance — $ 20 per parent group , $ 20 for all children
Keeping up private or employer insurance for the entire family — $ 50 / month
Attending an annual medical check - up — $ 200 per family member
Attending suggested follow - up visits within the correct timeframe — $ 100 per family member
Attending regular preventive dental check - ups — $ 100 per family member
It is suggested that Mayor Bloomberg ’s unique leadership and personal qualities are largely responsible for enabling New York City to make such huge and powerful public health gains .
Not only is he highly dedicated to public health in general , he has money .
Bloomberg is a private philanthropist who donates vast amounts of money to health causes .
Plus , his connections and personal monetary strength means that he has a wide breadth of influence .
I ’m not suggesting that the city ’s success hinges upon Bloomberg ’s wealth .
In fact , Dr. Frieden , the health commissioner does n’t mince words .
He states :
None of these things would have been possible without [ Mayor Bloomberg ’s ] leadership .
It took a lot of political effort to get these things through , and it involved taking a lot of political heat to do the right thing .
They are all now very popular , but getting them through meant standing up to vested interests and doing things that lead to a fairly brutal critique in the tabloid newspapers .
And Mayor Bloomberg was willing to do that because he knew that it would save lives .
The barriers that prevent disadvantaged families from taking care of their health are beyond the scoop of this article but I am optimistic that this plan will work because money is behind the initiatives .
From both the man who is the “ face ” of the program to the money provided to the families who follow the requirements , money is involved .
And money talks .

Reflecting concerns about the health of the global financial system , the Federal Reserve and the world ’s other major central banks significantly escalated their assistance to global markets on Thursday , making almost $ 200 billion available after bank lending came to a near halt and threatened the global economy .
In a statement released at 3 a.m. in Washington , just as the markets opened in Europe , the Fed said that it had authorized a $ 180 billion expansion of its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements , known as swap lines , to allow banks to borrow more dollars in money markets at a lower rates .
Paul Mortimer - Lee , head of market economics in the London office at BNP Paribas , said the move reflected concerns that the financial markets now appeared to be facing their gravest problems since the Depression .
“ We ’re high on a mountain , with a thin rope and holding on by our fingertips , ” he said .
“ Are policy makers scared ?
They should be . ”
Paralysed man walks again thanks to Robocop - style exoskeleton
A man who has been paralysed for the past 20 years is able to walk again thanks to a revolutionary electronic exoskeleton .
Radi Kaiof , 41 , now walks down the street with a dim mechanical hum as the system moves his legs and propels him forwards .
Radi Kaiof walks using an electronic exoskeleton .
It is due to go on sale in 2010
' I never dreamed I would walk again .
After I was wounded , I forgot what it 's like , ' said Kaiof , who was injured while serving in the Israeli military in 1988 .
' Only when standing up can I feel how tall I really am and speak to people eye to eye , not from below . '
The device will allow many wheel - chair bound people to stand
The device , called ReWalk , is the brainchild of engineer Amit Goffer , founder of Argo Medical Technologies , a small Israeli high - tech company .
Engineer Amit Goffer developed the Robocop - style exoskeleton
Something of a mix between the exoskeleton of a crustacean and the suit worn by Robocop , ReWalk helps paraplegics - people paralysed below the waist - to stand , walk and climb stairs .
Goffer himself was paralysed in an accident in 1997 but he cannot use his own invention because he does not have full function of his arms .
The system , which requires crutches to help with balance , consists of motorized leg supports , body sensors and a back pack containing a computerized control box and rechargeable batteries .
The user picks a setting with a remote control wrist band - stand , sit , walk , descend or climb - and then leans forward , activating the body sensors and setting the robotic legs in motion .
' It raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight , ' Goffer said .
' It 's not just about health , it 's also about dignity . '
Kate Parkin , director of physical and occupational therapy at NYU Medical Centre , said it has the potential to improve a user 's health in two ways .
' Physically , the body works differently when upright .
You can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs , ' Parkin said .
' Psychologically , it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact . '
The ReWalk is now in clinical trials in Tel Aviv's Sheba Medical Centre .
It is due to go on sale to the public in 2010 and will cost around £ 10,000 .
Today a Congressional commitee conducted an oversight hearing on the status of sexual assault services in the military .
Congresswomen and survivors stepped up to testify .
" Reproductive and sexual health and rights " sounds like such an unwieldy and imprecise phrase to describe so many issues that we address on Rewire .
The truth is , we ’ve yet to come up with a better way to describe so many of these issues .
Sexual assault , for instance .
It ’s about a woman ’s right to live free from violence , it ’s about sexual health , it ’s about your right to bodily autonomy .
And , so , it ’s critical that we make the connections between sexual assault and reproductive and sexual health and rights .
Consider this :
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Women serving in the U.S. military are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in Iraq .
The military has been slow – too slow – to build its capacity , to create an infrastructure for dealing with the rising numbers of sexual assault and rape cases within its ranks .
In fact , in March of 2008 the Department of Defense ’s fourth
annual report on sexual assault in the military stated that there were 2,688
reported cases of sexual assaults by people in uniform .
In addition , reports of sexual assault jumped by about 24 percent in 2006 and nearly
40 percent in 2005 .
Thank god for Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York and the parents and victims of sexual assault in the military who have so bravely stepped forward to push , prod and pull the military through this process in order to ensure that the United States military has the tools to deal with sexual assault survivors and cases properly .
Today , the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs
held a hearing on sexual assault in the military .
Representative Louise Slaughter testified .
She also reintroduced the Military Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Act , a bill that would do a number of things to protect service members who are victims of sexual violence and their families , including :
Establish an Office of Victims Advocate ( OVA ) within the Department of Defense
Strengthen policies for reporting , prosecuting and treating perpetrators of violence
Create counseling and treatment programs through the Department of Veterans Affairs ; and
Codify rights , restitution policies , treatment and other services for victims … including creating comprehensive confidentiality protocols to protect the rights of victims within military law .
Scheduled to testify as well were : Congresswoman Jane Harman of California ; Mary Lauterbach , the mother of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , who went missing last year just as she was going to testify in her own rape case and was found dead in the yard of a Marine whom she had accused of rape ; Ingrid Torres was also scheduled to testify today as a member of the armed forces and a survivor of rape by a fellow soldier .
In her testimony , Rep . Slaughter reminded the committee that this act would also protect government contracted employees – women like " Lisa Smith " who was raped while working in Iraq and Tracy Barker , sexually assaulted by another contractor – both employees of KBR .
Ingrid Torres ’ remarks are brutal and should be a call to action for Congress and the United States military :
Executive Summary
We 've got a solvency crisis here , not a liquidity crisis ... terms explained below ... and at least some within the Federal Reserve System have known about ... shown below ... but for some reason could n't bring themselves to use the word .
The original Paulson plan could address the solvency crisis if we assume the idea was to buy toxic waste financial asset at sweetheart prices .
That would not only re-capitalize the fortunate recipients of government insolvent institutions selected for special treatment by Paulson , but would have done so without the normal quid - pro-quo of giving up a share in the company .
IOW , if it addresses solvency , the method involves Welfare for the Rich .
The Dodd plan allows conversion of toxic waste into liquidity at whatever its value eventually turns out to be .
At that time , the excess payment , which was the re-capitalization , is matched by stock in the company with a 25 % penalty on top .
So after the crisis is passed we sort out how much was a interest free loan and how much was capitalization , and the capitalization part results in public ownership of an equivalent amount of corporate stock .
The plan of the radical reactionaries in the House to set up an insurance system is not just closing the barn door after the horse has left the barn ... its closing the barn door after the horse has broken its leg in a groundhog burrow running around outside .
If the assets are price fairly , it does nothing about current insolvency , while reducing the liquidity of the system by the amount of the insurance payments .
If it over - prices the assets , then the correct insurance premium would be a massive rate that would drive many more firms into an illiquid position .
The Public Preferred Share plan , discussed under this username last week , uses the halfway - house between debt and common share ownership , the preferred share , to immediately give the public a claim on the future profitability of firms that are to be bailed out , without creating new liquidity problems in the middle of a recession .
Ah , what 's the difference between liquidity and solvency , again ?
Liquidity and solvency are about the two different ways of being broke .
Liquidity is about having a bill to pay today and no cash money to pay it with ...
Solvency is about being over your head in debt compared to your total assets .
You can be liquid but insolvent .
Enough money to meet your current obligations , but obligations facing you in the future that you do not have assets to cover .
Take the old fraudulent con game where someone sets up a company with a slick cover story , sells shares in a company that does nothing but pay the salaries of the people in the company and dividends .
The classic trick is to make the dividends lucrative enough that more and more people buy in .
Eventually , of course , the dividends run out , but the con-artist would hope to skip town with a big slice of the remaining cash ahead of anyone realizing it .
You can be illiquid but solvent .
You have a series of bills to pay each month , and are owed a big payment , more than enough to cover all your bills for the balance of this year and the next at the end of next year .
As long as that discounts the future payment for the fact that its December 2009 , and as long as whomever owes that money is ready , willing and able to pay , that 's an asset ... and you are solvent but not liquid .
In terms of a commercial corporation ( whether productive , financial , or both ) :
a company that is insolvent needs an injection of financial capital .
Normally , what someone gets who injects financial capital is a piece of the action in the future profits of the company ... a " share " .
What a company that is illiquid needs is a loan ... liquidity now against future income .
Obviously what a company that is both illiquid and insolvent needs is an injection of financial capital in liquid form .
Status Solution Liquid and Solvent No problem to solve Illiquid Lending against Illiquid Assets Insolvent Financial Capital Illiquid and Insolvent Liquid Financial Capital
There was Detailed Analysis at the Fed about Solvency Problems
Its a lot easier to prove existence than to prove lack of existence ... one example proves existence .
So here is that example .
So what has been driving the recent widening in term funding spreads ?
In my view , the rise in funding pressures is mainly the consequence of increased balance sheet pressure on banks .
This balance sheet pressure is an important consequence of the reintermediation process .
Although banks have raised a lot of capital , this capital raising has only recently caught up with the offsetting mark - to - market losses and the increase in loan loss provisions .
At the same time , the capital ratios that senior bank managements are targeting may have risen as the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated and funding pressures have increased .
Now , that may sound " like Greek " to you , but I 'll break it down :
In my view , the rise in funding pressures is mainly the consequence of increased balance sheet pressure on banks .
The balance sheet is where you show assets and liabilities .
The assets of the corporation minus its external obligations make up its equity ( counted as a liability to shareholders ) , and the bigger its equity compared to its total liabilities , the more solvent it is .
If the difference is negative , its insolvent .
So " balance sheet pressure " means growing risks of insolvency .
This balance sheet pressure is an important consequence of the reintermediation process .
Part of the reaction to the financial problems of last year was for people to shy away from direct participation in financial markets for all sorts of funky new types of financial contracts , and shift back toward working through the commercial banking system .
But in the Anglo- system , the commercial banking sector is a minority of the total fiscal sector .
And further , the way that commercial banks have been doing business for real big deals is by going to the financial markets ... the very same financial markets that their new customers are trying to back out of .
Although banks have raised a lot of capital , this capital raising has only recently caught up with the offsetting mark - to - market losses and the increase in loan loss provisions .
" Mark to model " means you have some formula that is supposed to measure the value of an asset ... " Mark to market " is that you use prices in recent trades in financial markets to value assets .
If prices are falling , then the value of your asset side is shrinking .
A bank can make that good out of income ... but financial market prices can drop very quickly , while you have to wait for the income to arrive to use it to shore up your balance sheet .
And if those who owe you money go belly up , there goes the income flow , so rebuilding the asset side of your balance sheet can go from slow to impossible in the middle of a financial meltdown .
At the same time , the capital ratios that senior bank managements are targeting may have risen as the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated and funding pressures have increased .
Capital ratios refers to the mix on your balance sheet between higher - income , lower - liquidity assets like business loans and mortgages , and lower - income , higher - liquidity assets like Treasury Securities .
The higher the quality of your asset mix , the less exposed you are to risks like mortgage default ... but the less income you can expect to rebuilt your balance sheet and pay exorbitant salaries to your CEO and Bank President .
If the Fed " Knew " This , What Were They Doing ?
If you know that there is a looming risk of insolvency , you 'll do something about it , right ?
Trying to think through how to re-capitalize the useful parts of the financial system would make sense .
And yet , the actions taken , as reported in May , were all discussed in terms of liquidity :
The number of liquidity facilities developed and introduced by the Federal Reserve is another list that has gotten much longer .
Policymakers have responded to the persistent pressures in funding markets by introducing several new liquidity tools .
...
Let me first define the underlying problem .
The diagnosis is important both in influencing the design of the liquidity tools and in assessing how they are likely to influence market conditions .
...
On one side , actual risks — due to changes in the macroeconomic outlook , an increase in price volatility , and a reduction in liquidity — and perceptions about risks — due to the potential consequences of this risk for highly leveraged institutions and structures — have shifted .
...
Banks and dealers were raising the haircuts they assess against the collateral they finance .
The rise in haircuts , in turn , was causing forced selling , lower prices , and higher volatility .
This feedback loop was reinforcing the momentum toward still higher haircuts .
This dynamic culminated in the Bear Stearns illiquidity crisis .
During the past eight months , the financial sector as a whole has been trying to shed risk and to hold more liquid collateral .
...
In essence , the Federal Reserve ’s willingness to provide liquidity against less liquid collateral allows the reintermediation and deleveraging process to proceed in an orderly way , which reduces the damage to weaker counterparties and funding structures .
...
The Federal Reserve has introduced three new liquidity facilities during the past five months .
...
... and etc .
By contrast , in this analysis under the cover of an analysis that talks about " bank balance sheet pressure , and is therefore about banking system solvency ... where is " solvency " used ?
Here is a complete list :
Or , IOW , {*crickets *}
Corporate Group
Think and the Danger of Euphemisms for Insolvency
So here could well be part of what has been going on .
An Executive VP is willing to talk in terms of liquidity .
He is willing to talk about solvency .
But the Executive VP is not willing to talk in terms of solvency .
And of course , in a corporation the information that gets to the senior decision leaders is most often not the detailed analysis .
It is taken from the Executive Summary .
And further , for the very top levels where truly strategic decisions are made , Executive Summaries of reviews written mostly on the basis of Executive Summaries of detailed analyses .
If you are willing to say " liquid " and " illiquid " , that very easily rises up through the Executive Summary pyramid .
However , if you are unwilling to say " solvent " and " insolvent " , but rather talk around it in more cumbersome terms ... and side by side much clearer discussion of liquidity ... that faces a much harder time climbing up the Executive Summary pyramid .
And then if " a broad reading " of analyses shows that a problem is a liquidity problem , it is easier for the next round of analyses to talk in those terms of a single issue ... and if " a broad reading " obscures solvency problems under a range of euphemisms , it is easier for the next round of analyses to act as if a single solvency crisis is instead a disparate collection of distinct smaller problems in distinct parts of the finance sector .
Which is why I said that the Fed ( well , at least William C. Dudley on May 15 , 2008 ) " called it " ... but did n't name it .
" Solvency Crisis " : a brain tool for your use
Having the name for the problem really does make it easier to make sense of things ... like various " bail - out " plans .
The original Paulson proposal ... well , formally it was , " give me $ 700 b , I 'll do what I want " ... but if it was to re-capitalize financial institutions , that would occur by buying junk at inflated prices to recapitalize financial institutions under extreme sweetheart terms that left them without any countering obligations at all .
The Dodd proposal is to buy the assets , sell them off in calmer times after the crisis has ( hopefully ) passed , and then judge at that time how much of the original payment was liquidity and how much was capitalization .
The liquidity is received for free , but the capitalization requires the firm to hand over shares ( stock ) equal to 125 % of the value of the recapitalization .
The " close the barn door after the horse has broken his leg " plan by the House radical reactionaries to set up some kind of insurance fund after the car has been wrecked would be clearly moronic if we were , say , sliding into a recession a year into a long running solvency problem that is becoming a solvency crisis ... if the assets to be insured are priced fairly , the firm is still insolvent .
Oh , right , we are in the middle of a financial crisis and sliding into recession ... indeed , most likely already in and sliding more deeply into recession .
So under current conditions , the House radical reactionaries have the kind of brain - dead plan you would expect from ideologue hacks facing a crisis created by their precise ideology .
The Public Preferred Shares system recapitalizes firms with Preferred shares , which are like a debt when the firm is making a profit , but with dividends that do not have to be paid while a firm is running a loss , so unlike a bond ( or an insurance premium like the bone - headed proposal by the House radical reactionaries ) , they cannot drive an illiquid firm out of business .
So there you have it .
There are mikes scattered around for concerns , comments , criticisms , complaints , etc .
Have at it .

Mark Nuckols is the founder and CEO of Hufu , LLC , and his company has but one goal :
To serve man ( or some reasonable , soy - based facsimile thereof ) .
Hufu is tofu , but textured and flavored into a pseudo - meat billed as “ The Healthy Human Flesh Alternative . ”
They say it tastes like people .
At this point , the first question to spring to the mind of a normal , well - adjusted individual is , “ Why !! ? ”
For those of us who fall outside of that category , our first response is , “ How ? ”
As usual , the normal and well - adjusted will get a lot more satisfaction than the rest of us .
The company is delighted to share details on why , but as for how , their only comment is , “ The taste and texture of Hufu are the result of painstaking research and extensive testing in our kitchens .
We are supremely confident that our food products would satisfy the tastes of even the most demanding cannibal . ”
Clearly , there ’s no meat in that response .
Cough .
As for why , the company says that they originally intended to market the product to students of anthropology who were curious about the cannibal experience , yet daunted by the task of reproducing it .
But the folks at Hufu soon learned through market research that some of the general public was “ interested ” in such a food⁠ — though perhaps “ morbidly curious ” might have been a more fitting description⁠ — so they are now marketing it to a broader audience .
And people are buying it .
So what does human flesh taste like ?
Their FAQ says , “ If you ’ve never had human flesh before , think of the taste and texture of beef , except a little sweeter in taste and a little softer in texture .
Contrary to popular belief , people do not taste like pork or chicken . ”
Their ambiguity on how makes one wonder if they simply made their best guess on the flavor , knowing that any persons able to refute the claim would most likely be unwilling to do so .
And who would believe such a person ’s claims anyway ?
Perhaps they used a beef - based flavoring , sweetened it a tad , and called it good ; but if so , they wo n’t fess up .
Of course it ’s always possible that their researchers really were willing to make some sacrifices to get the flavor just right , but they would never admit to that either .
No doubt the ambiguity is key to their borderline , curiosity - driven marketing : sales will dry up if they admit to shenanigans , but equally so if they claim their researchers have eaten real human flesh .
Watch for Hufu in your grocer ’s refrigerated section , and coming soon , Hufu “ Healthy Hearts ” and Hufu “ Doctor Lecter ’s Liver . ”
Urges Commissioners to Persevere in Defense of Consumers ’ Rights and Net Neutrality Washington , DC – Today the Federal Communications Commission is expected to penalize Comcast for violating the FCC ’s principles to ensure open access to the Internet .
The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ We applaud the FCC for taking enforcement action against Comcast .
The nation ’s second largest Internet service provider violated the commission ’s open access rules by unlawfully blocking file - sharing services such as BitTorrent .
Significantly , it violated the rules by which the Internet must operate if it is to remain an open forum .
“ We commend Free Press , Public Knowledge , and the other groups who pursued the complaint against Comcast .
We also applaud ACLU activists and the public for speaking out at field hearings and sending in thousands of personal comments about Comcast ’s illegal practices .
“ Today ’s FCC penalty against Comcast is a step forward toward freedom on the Net .
We urge the commissioners to remain vigorous in their defense of consumers ’ rights and the open Internet .
“ Kevin Martin deserves credit in this case for leading the commission to limit Comcast ’s abuse of the Internet .
But commission decisions are only as permanent as the commissioners who voted for them and we are far from a point where we can all relax secure in the knowledge that the Internet as we have always known it is safe .
More needs to be done .
Soon , power will change hands in Washington , and we urge party leaders to nominate FCC commissioners who will make it a priority to restore and protect network neutrality principles .
The ACLU will continue to work towards legislation that will free the Internet from corporate censorship and the fleeting policy decisions that accompany a commission filled with political appointees . ”

· People in busy roads more likely to be ill , says study · Lack of traffic promotes sense of community
Mrs A lives in Dovercourt Road in north Bristol and considers five people on her street as friends .
But Mrs B , who is roughly the same age and lives round the corner in a very similar house in Muller Street , has only one friend .
The difference , says a study , has nothing to do with personality , but is because of the weight of traffic .
Fewer than 150 vehicles a day pass down Dovercourt Road , compared with more than 21,130 a day on Muller Street .
New research , based on interviews with households on three Bristol streets , has found that people who live with high levels of motor traffic are far more likely to be socially disconnected and even ill than people who live in quiet , clean streets .
It confirms a study done by a British academic in San Francisco in 1969 .
This found the weight of traffic in urban areas largely determined people 's quality of life and also identified a major erosion of community on busy streets .
The Bristol study is the first time that research has been conducted in Britain .
Joshua Hart , a researcher at the University of the West of England , Bristol , looked at Muller Street , Filton Avenue and Dovercourt Road , three streets with very different traffic flows .
He dubbed them Heavy ( Muller Street ) , Medium ( Filton Avenue ) , and Light ( Dovercourt Road ) streets and mapped the movement of residents .
People were asked to identify their social contacts , and say what they considered to be their " home " .
He found wide differences in community interaction and a serious deterioration of community life on busy roads .
On average , residents on Heavy Street had about one fifth the number of local friends and only half the number of acquaintances compared with the people living in Light Street .
People there admitted to knowing very few others in the road , had very few friends on the other side of the street and seldom crossed over .
" It 's hellishly busy .
The buses and lorries shake the house and the air pollution can be quite bad , " said one man .
Residents on Light Street , however , reported that they felt a sense of community , frequently popped in and out of each others ' homes and said that they felt personally responsible for a much larger area than residents on Heavy Street .
More than half the people interviewed said they felt " at home " in other people 's houses .
" People stay for a while and put down roots , " said one man .
" We look after each other , " said another .
Hart also found people were taking extreme measures to adapt to the noisy , dirty environment on Heavy Street .
Residents largely lived in the back rooms of their houses and many chose dark or black curtains to conceal the soot build - up from vehicles .
They kept their front windows closed , did not allow children to play in the street and usually accompanied them to school , he said .
Heavy Street also found people less likely to care for their street .
" The whole street needs knocking down and rebuilding " was one comment .
" People argue and shout regularly . "
It could not have been more different on Light Street , reported Hart .
There , very few people felt the need to build a fence or a wall in the front garden , and most people had their windows open .
Residents there reported almost three times the number of gathering spots compared with Heavy Street .
" The primary influence on social deterioration is the external effect of traffic , not any possible personality differences among residents of the three streets , " he concluded .
" Growing car dependence is creating an epidemic of deteriorated mental and physical health associated with air and noise pollution , inactivity and road deaths and injuries .
" It seems that community and quality of life have been neglected whilst planning and transport policies have led to a massive growth in motor vehicles in the UK , " said Hart .
" More than 5 million extra cars are expected on the UK 's roads by 2031 , and these findings point to an urgent need for the government to provide healthy residential environments and to stem traffic growth by investing in public transport , walking and cycling in order to avoid many more local communities being impacted . "
Zimbabwe 's economic situation is dire A German company which helps Zimbabwe supply its banknotes has become the latest firm to end links amid outrage over the situation in the country .
Giesecke & Devrient said it would stop providing paper for banknotes immediately following a " political and moral assessment " of conditions there .
Foreign firms in Zimbabwe are under pressure to pull out after President Mugabe 's controversial re-election .
The UN is considering tougher economic sanctions against his regime .
' Political tension '
The UN's Security Council has outlined a resolution calling for further measures against Robert Mugabe and key allies following Friday 's unopposed presidential vote , which the US , UK and other countries dismissed as a " sham " .
A senior British minister recently warned that the " game was changing " for foreign firms operating in Zimbabwe and urged businesses to reconsider their investments in the light of further action by the international community against Mr Mugabe .
Our decision is a reaction to the political tension in Zimbabwe , which is mounting significantly
Dr Karsten Ottenberg , Giesecke & Devrient chief executive
Business risks mount in Zimbabwe British supermarket chain Tesco said on Monday that it would no longer buy produce from Zimbabwe , ending about £ 1 m worth of trade .
Giesecke & Devrient said it had taken the decision to withdraw from Zimbabwe following an official request to do so from the German government .
" Our decision is a reaction to the political tension in Zimbabwe , which is mounting significantly rather than easing as expected , " said chief executive Dr Karsten Ottenberg .
The decision had been influenced by the hardening of the international community 's stance on Zimbabwe and by public opinion in Germany , he added .
Hyperinflation , which has risen as high as 165,000 % on an annual basis , has hit Zimbabwe 's economy and accelerated the political crisis in the country .
The African Union has called for a government of national unity to be formed including opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai who boycotted Friday 's poll following widespread violence against his party 's supporters in the run-up to the election .

What are these ?
We live in the era of Google Maps .
What started off as an impressive refresh of Mapquest - style maps now fuels web mashups .
With APIs official and unofficial , Google Maps is simple enough for front - end designers to embed and for back - end programmers to target .
Along the way to becoming nearly ubiquitous , it has played a major role in the “ democratization of mapping . ”
For the practical developer who wants to add geospatial information to a site or application , the Google Maps API has been an easy call .
Article Continues Below
But , perhaps no longer .
As websites mature and the demand for geographic applications grow , the old mashup arrangement is starting to chafe .
Mapping components are more and more vital , and so we demand greater control , expressiveness , and functionality from them .
Fortunately , as in many aspects of internet technology , an ecology of open source online mapping tools has emerged alongside the market leader .
It is now possible to replicate Google Maps ’ functionality with open source software and produce high - quality mapping applications tailored to our design goals .
The question becomes , then , how ?
Google Maps is the best ( right ? ) #section2
Google Maps is an impressive application .
It ’s fast , responsive , and nicely rendered , and it exposes a ton of functionality via its well - documented and well - understood API .
Why on earth would n’t you outsource this bit of functionality to Google ?
Ask yourself this question : why would you , as a website developer who controls all aspects of your site , from typography to layout , to color palette to photography , to UI functionality , allow a big , alien blob to be plopped down in the middle of your otherwise meticulously designed application ?
Think about it .
You accept whatever colors , fonts , and map layers Google chooses for their map tiles .
Sure , you try to rein it back in with custom markers and overlays , but at the root , the core component — the map itself — is out of your hands .
The result is Google Maps fatigue .
We ’ve all experienced it .
It manifests not only when we yawn at YAGMM ( Yet Another Google Maps Mashup ) , because there are high - quality web apps deploying the Google Maps API seamlessly and with great success .
Despite this , and despite the fact that Google itself continues to refine and improve the base application , the fatigue remains .
It ’s the effect of seeing the same elements over and over again across the web .
As web developers , we live with constraints , so to a certain extent , the Google Maps API is similar to Verdana and Georgia — they ’re common components we know will work well .
But if it were possible and practical to make a substitution , would n’t you do so ?
Depending on your application , Google ’s choices about what display on the map and how to display it might not work for you .
On a general - purpose map , for example , it ’s great to see the outlines of building footprints , as Google is starting to display in certain cities — but such outlines might only constitute visual clutter for your application .
Google decides what information is conveyed to your users , but it ’s not necessarily what they need or want .
Further , you ’re only allowed to mess with Google ’s maps within limits placed on you by the API ’s terms and conditions — which you accept when you begin using it .
You may not conduct post - processing or other manipulation .
You may not obscure the copyright mark .
Not that it would be practical to do so : part of the API ’s appeal is a speedy response to requests for map tiles , so any on - the - fly mucking around would likely result in a sub-optimal user experience .
You ’re also limited to the functionality Google decides to implement .
To a degree , you can reverse - engineer the API to insert your own custom functionality ( and hackers certainly have ) .
But that can take serious JavaScript - fu , to say nothing of the inherent fragility of such a strategy .
If not Google Maps , then what ?
#section3
It ’s easy to acknowledge your mapping solution does n’t afford you all the design and development control you want .
It ’s quite another thing to consider tearing out that factory module ( from an admittedly pretty impressive factory ) and replacing it with your own finely tuned custom build .
Rolling your own maps need not be an intimidating affair , provided you understand the problem and the tools to fix it .
The map stack #section4
The key to this kingdom is understanding the map stack .
Modern online mapping applications all adhere to this architecture , which winds up in your user ’s browser as the click - and - draggable view of the world we all know and love ( the view , not always the world ) .
There are four major layers in the map stack , from the highest to lowest level .
Browser UI#section5
Users interact with your mapping application primarily through a JavaScript or Flash library that listens to user events , requests tiles from the map server , assembles tiles in the viewport , and draws additional elements on the map , such as popups , markers , and vector shapes .
This is the layer in the stack where the Google Maps API sits .
OpenLayers is one example of a browser mapping UI library written in JavaScript .
It ’s free software released under an open source license .
Even though it ’s still under heavy development , OpenLayers is a remarkably mature library that supports multiple projections and map server backends , geospatial data format reading and writing , event handling , and vector drawing .
“ View source ” in these examples to see what ’s possible and how to integrate these features into your application .
Tile cache#section6
A tile cache is a server that sits between the browser and the map server .
It checks to see if a requested map tile is already hanging around in a cache somewhere , where it can be served up quickly to short - circuit the call to the map server .
If the map tile is not already generated , the tile cache gets it from the map server and saves it to speed up subsequent requests .
For the most part , this layer should be all but transparent to the user , and is typically a simple set up and configuration .
Instead of pointing the client to the map server , point it at the tile cache , and point the tile cache at the map server .
You can consider the tile cache as one half of a layer in the map stack , because it ’s technically not required in order to close the loop from the user request for a tile to the response from the map server .
However , in the real world , our sites are under loads that make constant , on - the - fly map tile generation expensive , impractical , and needlessly wasteful .
The tile cache is the secret sauce which makes open source web mapping a viable alternative .
The aptly - named TileCache is an open source tile caching server that ’s simple to set up .
It can store tiles on local disks , in memcached , or on Amazon ’s S3 storage service .
Map server#section7
Here ’s where you get to flex your design muscle .
A map server is an application that takes geospatial data as input and renders graphical output .
Specifically , for modern online mapping apps , it spits out a series of map tiles , which are uniformly sized graphic files ( 256×256 PNGs , for example ) that are ultimately served to and assembled in the browser as the displayed map .
You can control the final appearance of your maps by styling the geospatial elements , in a manner not unlike CSS .
The exact mechanism varies by implementation , but all map servers provide hooks for defining styles such as stroke width , stroke color , fill color , opacity , and layer stacking order .
Map servers can be exposed directly to the internet , where a well - defined interface takes HTTP requests representing specific geographic places and returns the corresponding tiles .
However , map servers are usually hidden from direct access by the tile cache layer in the stack , for good reason .
Mapnik is an open source map server that renders beautifully and has a developer - friendly interface .
At EveryBlock , where I work , we use Mapnik to generate our map tiles , and we ’ve been pleased with the results .
Geospatial data#section8
The building blocks of any mapping application are the databases that define the points , lines , and polygons that represent real - world places , roads , and areas .
Geospatial data connects geometric shapes with a coordinate system ( latitude and longitude , most commonly ) and with attribute or feature data such as school names , interstate designations , or congressional district numbers and representatives .
The big kahuna in the geospatial data world is a “ streets ” database .
While not every mapping application needs it , most do , and users expect it as a primary way to orient themselves .
Adding streets to your app is a key step that I ’ll get into in more depth below .
Map yourself #section9
Now that you ’re familiar with the building blocks of the web map stack , I ’ll address some key considerations for putting your own stack together .
Because there are several alternatives for each layer , depending on your platform , existing data and code , programming language , and application requirements , I wo n’t dive into too much detail , but I will try to provide general hints and tips that apply regardless of the specific choices you make .
Where to store the “ where ” #section10
Geospatial data is stored and transmitted in many different flavors : the open source OGR library , which is used to open , read , and write vector files such as these , lists over 30 supported formats .
Fortunately , there are a few that are far more common than the rest .
The Shapefile is the granddaddy of them all , and you ’ll find many graphical information systems ( GIS ) organizations distribute their data in this format .
Shapefiles are actually bundles of files : usually three of them , with the extensions . shp , . shx , and .dbf .
An increasingly popular format is KML , which is an XML - based format first used in Google Earth .
Google Earth and Maps can both produce and consume KML files , making it a good format for interchange with these applications .
Since it ’s XML - based and therefore just text instead of the binary format of Shapefiles , the KML format is a bit verbose , but it ’s easy to open in a text editor for a good , old - fashioned “ view source ” session .
If you use a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) in your application , you should consider using its built - in geometric data type , if it has one , or adding an extension that enables one .
For example , PostGIS is a library for PostgreSQL which provides a geometry type and functions that operate on it .
You can then simply add an additional column to your tables and associate geospatial data with your existing rows .
This gives you the ability to make SQL queries that include “ spatial predicates . ”
Spatial predicates are statements like “ within five miles of this latitude and longitude , ” or “ this line intersects with this line . ”
No matter how you store your geospatial data , I recommend that you add the OGR library to your toolbox .
It ’s the Swiss Army knife of geospatial data , allowing you to translate between formats , change projections , and filter and combine datasets .
There ’s a command - line utility , ogr2ogr , that provides this functionality , and there are also OGR bindings for your favorite programming language .
The great thing about OGR is that it smooths out the differences between the various geospatial data serializations .
You do n’t have to care about what format , or in what crazy projection , you ’ve got your data layer — just translate it into the format that makes sense for the rest of your application and move on .
Just browsing # section11
One of the first things I do when I download a new geospatial dataset is get a rough visualization of it .
I want to see , quickly , what kind of geometries — points , lines , polygons , or combinations thereof — it has , and where it is in relation to my other datasets .
Basically , what will it look like , and how well does it match my expectations of what it should cover ?
I ’ve found that a GIS desktop application is a great tool for getting a quick look at a new Shapefile .
QGIS is a cross-platform , open source app that fits the bill .
Essentially , QGIS is the kind of application that web - based maps are emulating : click - and - drag and zoom , with layering .
It gives you an opportunity to mock - up your custom map application and see how the various layers hang together .
You can test things such as labeling and color palettes , or even edit the underlying data , which can be useful for one - off fixes and tweaks .
Street beat #section12
As I mentioned above , many mapping applications require a streets layer .
Streets are a primary way that people orient themselves — the closest thing we have to a practical coordinate system in the world .
As you might imagine , a database of streets is a large , complex , and valuable asset .
Companies , such as NAVTEQ and TeleAtlas employ a fleet of vehicles to scour the world ’s roads , arterials , and expressways , amassing the exact coordinates of each street they travel .
You can purchase a license to use this type of commercial database for your own applications — usually at a per-page - view rate .
It can be expensive , but if your organization can afford it , you ’ll have the benefit of a constantly - updated , high - quality streets layer , with near - comprehensive coverage .
An alternative to a commercial streets database , at least in the United States , is the TIGER / Line dataset , produced by the U.S. Census Bureau .
TIGER / Line is periodically updated to aid in the various programs of the Census and it ’s free to download and use for your own applications .
It has fairly comprehensive coverage of U.S. streets — it might not have the latest subdivision in your community , but it can be as good as the commercial products , especially in major metropolitan areas .
Many municipalities have GIS departments that publish Shapefiles of their streets .
These are great datasets because they are often more up - to - date and more accurate than TIGER / Line , since they are used to provide city services .
An interesting project to keep your eye on is OpenStreetMap , or OSM .
It ’s a kind of wiki for streets that allows anyone to upload their GPS traces or data from free sources like TIGER / Line .
The great thing about OSM is that it aspires to be worldwide .
This is a good thing , because unlike the United States , most countries do n’t put their geospatial data in the public domain .
While there ’s still a long way to go , you can already start downloading and using OSM data , which is fairly complete in some areas , especially in Europe .
The scales fall from your eyes # section13
“ Scale ” is a key concept in maps : it ’s the correspondence between a unit of measurement on the map and the thing being mapped , ( usually the world , but it could be the moon , the solar system , or a blood cell ) .
On the map , 1:10000 means that an inch on the map represents 10,000 inches in the world .
Note that scales are unit- independent : 1:10000 also means 1 cubit on the map represents 10,000 cubits in the world .
For example , let ’s say that the largest scale — in other words , the scale at which things in the map are as big as possible — is 1:10 , and the smallest scale is 1:160 .
Typically , there is a doubling of the second number in the scale at each zoom , so in between we will have zoom levels at scales of 1:20 , 1:40 , and 1:80 .
Altogether then , we have five total scales , and five zoom levels .
By convention , we give the smallest scale — which is the most - zoomed - out — zoom level number one , which in this case is 1:160 .
1:80 would be two , 1:40 would be three , 1:20 would be four , and 1:10 would be zoom level five .
In the web map stack , it ‘s helpful to determine the scales at which your maps will appear upfront .
One way to think of this is the “ zoom levels ” in Google Maps : there are a fixed number of them , and each level represents a particular scale .
In fact , in your application , there will be a one - to - one relationship between a zoom level and a scale .
Here ’s why it ’s important to define your scales in advance : the browser UI , the map server , and the tile cache work together best when they work with the same set of scales .
For the browser UI , you ’ll typically want to give your users a fixed number of zooms for consistency , as well as for fitting your application ’s domain — if you only cover the United States , for instance , you do n‘t need to zoom all the way out to see the rest of the world .
For the map server , you ’ll want a defined set of scales for your styling , because layers will turn on or off at certain scales , and different line widths and font sizes will apply at those scales .
Finally , the tile cache will cache your tiles at each zoom level , which are determined by the allowable scales .
Defining your scales is one way to reduce the complexity of your map application and improve coordination across the layers of the map stack .
Layers within layers # section14
In the previous section , I mentioned that defining your scales across your entire application helps when styling the map server .
As you think about your web map application as a stack of layers , also think about the visible layers within the maps themselves : streets , parks , rivers and lakes , building footprints , neighborhood boundaries , et cetera .
At each scale or zoom level , these layers come together in a certain way , one on top of the other , defined by your styles to render the final output .
Each layer is styled for each scale so that all the elements come together harmoniously .
For example , at a city - wide scale , we might display only the major streets and label only the expressways :
Screenshot of map tile at city - wide zoom
We obviously would n’t want to label every street at this scale , regardless of size , or the map would be too cluttered to read .
As we zoom in to a neighborhood - wide scale , however , we add labels to the arterials , and display all the rest of the streets :
Screenshot of map tile at neighborhood - wide zoom
Notice too that we increase the thickness , in pixels , of all street segments , to convey their greater scale .
Varying color intensity is another way to reduce or increase emphasis on elements at different scales .
Which method you choose should depend on the nature of the layer .
Embrace and extend #section15
Browser mapping UI libraries such as OpenLayers are ready to use out of the box : just link up the requisite resource in your site ’s < head > and start coding .
Since you ’re going through the trouble to replace the map stack because you wanted more control over its appearance , you ’re probably not going to just accept the stock icons and other styles these libraries provide .
As fond as I am of OpenLayers , its zoom , pan , and other widgets leave a lot to be desired .
Fortunately , we ’re talking about JavaScript and CSS , which means we can override to our heart ’s content .
At EveryBlock , we wanted a simple zoom - in / zoom - out widget for our maps .
We started by defining our controls explicitly , overriding the default controls OpenLayers sets up :
/* JavaScript */ var options = { ... controls : [ ] , ... } ; var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( " map-div " , options ) ; var customControls = [ new OpenLayers.Control.DragPan( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.PanZoom ( ) ] ; for ( var i=0 ; i ; map.addControl(control ) ; control.activate ( ) ; }
The DragPan control gives you the click - and - drag interface we expect from online maps .
PanZoom sets up the widget that allows you to click to zoom in and out , and pan by the cardinal directions .
We ’re not interested in panning with this widget , so we simply found the corresponding CSS styles and hid the panning elements :
/* CSS */ # OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_zoomworld , #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_panup , #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_panright , #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_pandown , #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_panleft { display : none ! important ; }
Finally , we replaced the zoom elements with our own , again simply overriding the CSS ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
/* CSS */ # OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_zoomin { background : url(/img/zoom-plus-mini.png ) no-repeat » ! important ; height : 20 px ! important ; width : 20 px ! important ; top : 13 px ! important ; } #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_zoomout { background : url(/img/zoom-minus-mini.png ) no-repeat » ! important ; height : 20 px ! important ; width : 20 px ! important ; top : 37px ! important ; } #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_zoomin:hover { background - image : url(/img/zoom-plus-mini-over.png ) » ! important ; } #OpenLayers_Control_PanZoom_zoomout : hover { background - image : url(/img/zoom-minus-mini-over.png ) » ! important ; }
Note the use of the ! important directive in each case .
This is obviously not ideal , but unfortunately it ’s necessary in this case , because OpenLayers hard - codes some style information in the JavaScript .
This is just an example , but it demonstrates how easy it is to use the vast functionality of these libraries and still exert control over the display .
One of the great things about online mapping is that it straddles the line between the artistry and communication of cartography , and the precision and programmability of GIS .
You can produce great - looking maps that are highly functional and integrate smoothly with your application .
It ’s my hope that this article demystified the web map stack and will get you thinking about how you can take control of the maps in your site .
There are many open source projects related to online mapping and GIS .
This article touched on these :
In addition , just to name a few : Modest Maps and Mapstraction are browser UI libraries similar to OpenLayers , in Flash and JavaScript , respectively .
GeoServer and MapServer are alternatives to Mapnik in the map rendering department .
You owe it to yourself to investigate these alternatives , as they each excel in different ways and one may meet your needs better than the others .
The remote and mic are supported only by iPod nano ( 4th generation ) , iPod classic ( 120GB ) , and iPod touch ( 2nd generation ) .
Audio is supported by all iPod models .
Click to expand ...
Apple introduced the new iPod Touch yesterday which contained a couple of minor hardware tweaks over the previous model .
Most notably , this included a built - in speaker and volume control buttons which were both absent on the 1st generation iPod Touch .
One item we failed to report , however , was that Apple appears to have also added external microphone support ( via accessory ) into the iPod Touch as well .
Apple introduced two new earphones accessories yesterday : Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic and In - Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic
The microphone feature of the headsets was advertised as allowing you to record voice memos on the new iPod Nano , but Apple 's product page indicates that the Mic also works with the iPod Classic as well as the new iPod Touch : Adding convenient microphone support into the iPod Touch opens up the possibility of Voice Over IP ( VOIP ) applications such as Skype which would allow you to make telephone calls from your iPod Touch over Wi -Fi networks .
Apple has said that they would not restrict Wi -Fi VOIP applications as long as they did not run over the iPhone 's cellular networks .
The microphones portion of the headsets will not work with the 1st generation iPod Touch .
DENVER , Aug. 28 ( UPI ) -- Operation Rescue charged Thursday that Denver police abused two teenage girls participating in an anti-abortion rally during a Prayer for Change event .
The two girls , ages 15 and 17 , were arrested as they were writing messages with chalk on the sidewalk in front of the hotel where Democratic presidential nominee Sen.
Barack Obama of Illinois was staying during the party 's convention , Christian Newswire reported .
Operation Rescue claimed police knocked the girls to the ground and kneed them in their backs before the two were handcuffed .

Also arrested was the Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition , who said the group received permission for the chalking activity from city officials .
Mahoney said the group had been " sidewalk chalking " for six days before Wednesday 's arrests without incident .
" I am shocked at how cowardly these police officers behaved by attacking little girls without warning or provocation , " said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman , who also called for disciplinary action against the officers involved in the incident .
" Operation Rescue spent the week participating in ' A Prayer For Change ' with Reverend Mahoney and these young people , who have conducted themselves peacefully and appropriately at all times , " Newman said .

By handing the Republican Party back to the Christian Right fanatics , John McCain has made a decision to unleash the ugliest forces in American politics .
JOHN MCCAIN and friends let the dogs loose at the Republican Party convention last week -- and it was n't just for show .
To the chanting of " USA ! USA ! " and " Drill , baby , drill ! " the Christian Right and social conservatives , thought to be consigned to the margins for this election , made their triumphant return to the spotlight -- in the form of John McCain 's running mate , Bible - thumping " hockey mom , " Sarah Palin .
Suddenly , the Republican base -- which has always regarded McCain with suspicion for his unforgivably " moderate " views , and which was working itself into a frenzy over a rumor that he might pick a pro-choice running mate -- was over the moon .
" A lady who 's a leader , " gushed the Weekly Standard 's William Kristol .
" I would pull that lever , " declared James Dobson of Focus on the Family .
Palin 's convention speech was expected to be a mild - mannered introduction from an almost entirely unknown figure .
Instead , she sneered at Barack Obama and snarled about the " liberal " media like an old hand .
That set the stage for an address by McCain that ended with bluster about his war wounds and patriotic duty .
Running mate Sarah Palin joins John McCain onstage at the Republican convention ( Brian Kersey | UPI )
If anyone thought the Republicans would be too humiliated by their disastrous eight years in power under George Bush to make much of an effort this time around , think again .
McCain was able to erase the Obama 's post - convention " bounce " in opinion polls , and then some , even taking a lead beyond the margin of error in a few .
To be sure , McCain 's own post - convention bounce will fade , and once it does , the Democrats ' significant advantages in this election -- above all , the crisis of the Bush administration and the collapse of the right - wing agenda -- should become more obvious .
But the presidential election is certainly looking like it will be closer than expected .
IF PALIN survived the convention week with a high level of popularity , it 's because the mainstream media let her get away with being all things to all people - - a firm family - values conservative and a down - to - earth working mother ; a straight - talking , get - things - done operator and a crusader against corruption and cronyism .
Palin is just what the doctor ordered for the Christian Right , whose top ranks , always overstocked with old white men , are bulging with the discredited , the scandal - plagued and a growing number of outright laughingstocks .
But beneath her just - folks image , Palin is a real fanatic .
The energy industry is in love with this " renegade " governor who can't wait to open up her home state of Alaska to oil drilling -- which is why she sued the Bush administration over plans to add the polar bear to the list of endangered species .
As far as Palin is concerned , she has God 's approval for her policies .
Referring to a $ 30 billion Alaskan oil pipeline , she told the graduating class of commission students at her former church , the evangelical Wasilla Assembly of God , three months ago , " I think God 's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built , so pray for that . "
The same goes for the war on Iraq .
" [ O ] ur leaders , our national leaders , are sending [ U.S. soldiers ] out on a task that is from God , " she said in the same church speech .
" That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan , and that that plan is God 's plan . "
Palin has appeared as a speaker for the Alaskan Independence Party , which supports secession of Alaska from the U.S.
She supports creationism being taught in school .
She opposes women 's right to abortion , even in the case of rape or incest .
Palin was asked in a 2006 debate what she would do if her daughter -- who was 14 years old at the time - - was raped and became pregnant .
" I would chose life , " Palin answered .
Then there 's Palin 's response -- as reported by a server at the restaurant where she was eating with friends -- to the news some months back that Obama had clinched the Democratic presidential nomination over Hillary Clinton : " So Sambo beat the bitch . "
Of course , Palin was only one cog in the Republican attack machine .
Lacking any program of its own worth cheering for , speakers repeatedly went after Obama and the Democrats -- to wild cheers from an arena packed with the Republican faithful .
The same message was repeated again and again :
The " urban " and " elitist " Democrats are " out of touch " with " small - town America . "
Thus , St. Paul witnessed the spectacle of Mitt Romney - - former governor of Massachusetts and CEO of an investment firm -- denouncing the " Eastern elite . "
Multimillionaire Rudolph Giuliani -- the ex-mayor , mind you , of one of the most diverse and multiracial cities in the world -- sneered that Obama supposedly thinks Palin's " hometown is n't cosmopolitan enough ... I 'm sorry , Barack , that it 's not flashy enough . "
And Palin herself joined in mocking Obama 's history as a " community organizer . "
These insults were n't chosen at random .
As even mainstream commentators recognized , " community organizer " and " urban elite " have become new racist code words -- just as surely as the Republicans ' talk about " law and order " and " welfare cheats " served to stir up bigotry in the past .
The Republican creep show in St. Paul served notice that McCain and his party have no qualms whatsoever about playing the race card -- as long as it's done in such a way that any allegations about what 's really being said can be denied with self - righteous anger .
Plus , all that snide abuse served to deflect attention from an obvious question :
Since when do the Republicans -- the party of big business interests and war profiteers -- represent ordinary , working - class Americans against the " elite " ?
As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman asked , " Can the vice - presidential candidate of a party that has controlled the White House , Congress or both for 26 of the past 28 years , a party that , Borg - like , assimilated much of the D.C. lobbying industry into itself -- until Congress changed hands , high - paying lobbying jobs were reserved for loyal Republicans -- really portray herself as running against the ' Washington elite ' ?
Yes , they can . "
IT'S CLEAR that the Republicans are on the attack , and there 's nothing they wo n't stoop to .
So the question is how the Democrats will respond .
In the days following the St. Paul convention , Obama did the round of political talk shows .
It was the perfect opportunity to call out the Republicans for their racism and anti-women rhetoric , and to propose an alternative to the right 's agenda .
Instead , Obama told Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly , " The surge [ of U.S. troops in Iraq ] has succeeded in ways that nobody anticipated . "
Obama added , " We have reduced the violence , but the Iraqis still have n't taken responsibility . "
When he spoke with George Stephanopoulos , Obama made sure to apologize for being " flip " in front of an audience of Christians at Saddleback Church on the issue of abortion ( while hardly defending his support of it ) .
He also tried to prove his own " maverick " status by listing the positions he has taken that are unpopular with ... fellow Democrats , such as support for merit pay for teachers .
This feeble display reflects the reality that Obama is not the " agent of change " that he portrays himself to be in his speeches .
As a leader of the Democratic Party and firmly within its ideological mainstream , his commitment is to defending the system , not offering a real alternative .
However they repackage themselves to whip up enthusiasm on the right , the Republicans are still the party responsible for a disastrous eight years under Bush .
Palin is n't an exception , either -- she 's committed to the most extreme positions of the right , which are rejected by a growing majority of ordinary people .
Given all this , the Democrats still have the upper hand in the race to win the White House .
The overwhelming rejection of Bush and the Republicans -- as well as the huge money advantage the Obama campaign has to build a turn - out - the - vote operation -- should remain the decisive factor on November 4 .
But in the meantime , it 's important to keep two things in mind .
First , by handing the Republican Party back to the Christian Right fanatics , McCain has made a decision to unleash the ugliest forces in American politics .
In particular , the Republicans will be stoking racism in a country founded on slavery .
Even if the strategy provokes an outcry and a backlash , the right 's renewed enthusiasm will sanction racist ideas among at least some people who would have felt less confidence to speak up otherwise .
The result , therefore , will be to contribute to social polarization .
Whatever criticisms we make of Obama - - and we have many -- we utterly reject the racist and reactionary slurs promoted by the Republican candidates , and with even more enthusiasm by the right - wing ideologues who pollute talk radio and other corners of the media .
Second , how quickly and sharply people turn against the Republican attack machine will depend to a great extent on how determined the Democrats are in challenging them .
The lack of a tougher response so far is allowing the right to stay on the offensive .
Obama and the Democrats have remained quiet because they fear raising hopes and expectations any further among the millions of people excited by the promise of change .
In the months since he clinched the Democratic nomination , Obama 's chief concern has been to prove himself a safe alternative for the corporate and political establishment .
But that has meant avoiding an open fight with the right .
On the contrary , because Obama and his advisers accept conservative assumptions about what working - class people supposedly think and want , their bid to capture the " middle ground " depends on adopting many of the right 's arguments .
The calculation is that if the Obama campaign went on the attack on the issue of racism in America or a woman 's right to choose , it would lose votes .
Setting aside the fact that the attempt to win over so - called " swing voters " has failed for the Democrats time after time , at a more fundamental level , this strategy shows just how little the Democrats have to offer the people they claim to represent .
If the ugly policies of the Republicans are going to be stopped -- and if there is going to be an outspoken opposition to racism , coded or not -- it wo n't come from the Democratic Party .
We need to organize it ourselves .
“ Can you give me a simple , concrete explanation of how quantum computers work ? ”
I ’ve been asked this question a lot .
I worked on quantum computing full time for 12 years , wrote 60 or so papers , and co-authored the standard text .
But for many years the question stumped me .
I had several pat answers , but none really satisfied me or my questioners .
It turns out , though , that there is a satisfying answer to the question , which anyone can understand if they ’re willing to spend some time concentrating hard .
To understand the answer , let ’s back up and think first about why big media outlets like the New York Times and the Economist regularly run stories about quantum computers .
The reason is that quantum computer scientists believe quantum computers can solve problems that are intractable for conventional computers .
That is , it ’s not that quantum computers are like regular computers , but smaller and faster .
Rather , quantum computers work according to principles entirely different than conventional computers , and using those principles can solve problems whose solution will never be feasible on a conventional computer .
In everyday life , all our experience is with objects which can be directly simulated by a conventional computer .
We do n’t usually think about this fact , but movie - makers rely on it , and we take it for granted – special effects are basically just rough computer simulations of events that would be more expensive for the movie makers to create in real life than they are to simulate inside a computer .
Much more detailed simulations are used by companies like Boeing to test designs for their latest aircraft , and by Intel to test designs for their latest chips .
Everything you ’ve ever seen or done in your life – driving a car , walking in the park , cooking a meal – all these actions can be directly simulated using a conventional computer .
Because of this , when we think in concrete terms we invariably think about things that can be directly simulated on a conventional computer .
Now , imagine for the sake of argument that I could give you a simple , concrete explanation of how quantum computers work .
If that explanation were truly correct , then it would mean we could use conventional computers to simulate all the elements in a quantum computer , giving us a way to solve those supposedly intractable problems I mentioned earlier .
Of course , this is absurd !
What ’s really going on is that no simple concrete explanation of quantum computers is possible .
Rather , there is an intrinsic quantum gap between how quantum computers work , and our ability to explain them in simple concrete terms .
This quantum gap is what made it hard for me to answer people ’s requests for a concrete explanation .
The right answer to such requests is that quantum computers cannot be explained in simple concrete terms ; if they could be , quantum computers could be directly simulated on conventional computers , and quantum computing would offer no advantage over such computers .
In fact , what is truly interesting about quantum computers is understanding the nature of this gap between our ability to give a simple concrete explanation and what ’s really going on .
This account of quantum computers is distinctly at odds with the account that appears most often in the mainstream media .
In that account , quantum computers work by exploiting what is called “ quantum parallelism ” .
The idea is that a quantum computer can simultaneously explore many possible solutions to a problem .
Implicitly , such accounts promise that it ’s then possible to pick out the correct solution to the problem , and that it ’s this which makes quantum computers tick .
Quantum parallelism is an appealing story , but it ’s misleading .
The problem comes in the second part of the story : picking out the correct solution .
Most of the time this turns out to be impossible .
This is n’t just my opinion , in some cases you can mathematically prove it ’s impossible .
In fact , the problem of figuring out how to extract the solution , which is glossed over in mainstream accounts , is really the key problem .
It ’s here that the quantum gap lies , and glossing over it does nothing to promote genuine understanding .
None of my discussion to now actually explains how quantum computers work .
But it ’s a good first step to understanding , for it prepares you to expect a less concrete explanation of quantum computers than you might at first have hoped for .
I wo n’t give a full description here , but I will sketch what ’s going on , and give you some suggestions for further reading .
Quantum computers are built from “ quantum bits ” , or “ qubits ” [ 1 ] , which are the quantum analogue of the bits which make up conventional computers .
Here ’s a magnified picture of a baby quantum computer made up of three Beryllium atoms , which are used to store three qubits :
The atoms are held in place using an atom trap , which you ca n’t see because it ’s out of frame , but which surrounds the atoms , holding them suspended in place using electric and magnetic fields , similar to the way magnets can be used to levitate larger objects in the air .
The atoms in the picture are about three micrometers apart , which means that if you laid a million end to end , they would n’t quite span the length of a living room .
Very fine human hair is about 20 micrometers in diameter – it ’d pretty much cover the width of this photo .
The atoms themselves are about a thousand times smaller than the spacing between the atoms .
They look a lot bigger in the picture , and the reason is interesting .
Although the atoms are very small , the way the picture was created was by shining laser light on the atoms to light them up , and then taking a photograph .
The particles making up the laser light are much bigger than the atoms , which makes the picture come out all blurry ; the photo above is basically a very blurry photograph of the atoms , which is why they look so much bigger than they really are .
I called this a baby quantum computer because it has only three qubits , but in fact it ’s pretty close to the state of the art .
It ’s hard to build quantum computers , and adding extra qubits turns out to be tricky .
Exactly who holds the record for the most qubits depends on who you ask , because different people have different ideas about what standards need to be met to qualify as a genuine quantum computer .
The current consensus for the record is about 5 - 10 qubits .
Okay , a minor alert is in order .
I ’ve tried to keep this essay as free from mathematics as possible , but the rest of the essay will use a little high - school mathematics .
If this is the kind of thing that puts you off , do not be alarmed !
You should be able to get the gist even if you skip over the mathematical bits .
How should we describe what ’s inside a quantum computer ?
We can give a bare - bones description of a conventional computer by listing out the state of all its internal components .
For example , its memory might contains the bits 0,0, 1,0, 1,1 , and so on .
It turns out that a quantum computer can also be described using a list of numbers , although how this is done is quite different .
If our quantum computer has n qubits ( in the example pictured above n = 3 ) , then it turns out that the right way to describe the quantum computer is using a list of 2n numbers .
It ’s helpful to give these numbers labels : the first is s 1 , the second s 2 , and so on , so the entire list is :
s 1 , s 2 , … , s 2n .
What are these numbers , and how are they related to the n qubits in our quantum computer ?
This is a reasonable question – in fact , it ’s an excellent question !
Unfortunately , the relationship is somewhat indirect .
For that reason , I ’m not going to describe it in detail here , although you can get a better picture from some of the further reading I describe below .
For us , the thing to take away is that describing n qubits requires 2n numbers .
One result of this is that the amount of information needed to describe the qubits gets big really quickly .
More than a million numbers are needed to describe a 20 - qubit quantum computer !
The contrast with conventional computers is striking – a conventional 20 - bit computer needs only 20 numbers to describe it .
The reason is that each added qubit doubles the amount of information needed to describe the quantum computer [ 2 ] .
The moral is that quantum computers get complex far more quickly than conventional computers as the number of components rises .
The way a quantum computer works is that quantum gates are applied to the qubits making up the quantum computer .
This is a fancy way of saying that we do things to the qubits .
The exact details vary quite a bit in different quantum computer designs .
In the example I showed above , it basically involves manipulating the atoms by shining laser light on them .
Quantum gates usually involve manipulating just one or two qubits at a time ; some quantum computer designs involve more at the same time , but that ’s a luxury , it ’s not actually necessary .
A quantum computation is just a sequence of these quantum gates done in a particular order .
This sequence is called a quantum algorithm ; it plays the same role as a program for a conventional computer .
The effect of a quantum gate is to change the description s 1 , s 2 , … of the quantum computer .
Let me show you a specific example to make this a bit more concrete .
There ’s a particular type of quantum gate called a Hadamard gate .
This type of gate affects just one qubit .
If we apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit in a quantum computer , the effect is to produce a new description for the quantum computer with numbers t 1 , t 2 , … given by
t 1 = ( s 1 +s 2n /2+1 ) /√ 2 t 2 = ( s 2 +s 2n /2+2 ) /√ 2 , t 3 = ( s 3 +s 2n /2+3 ) /√ 2 ,
and so on , down through all 2n different numbers in the description .
The details are n’t important , the salient point is that even though we ’ve manipulated just one qubit , the way we describe the quantum computer changes in an extremely complicated way .
It ’s bizarre : by manipulating just a single physical object , we reshuffle and recombine the entire list of 2n numbers !
It ’s this reshuffling and recombination of all 2n numbers that is the heart of the matter .
Imagine we were trying to simulate what ’s going on inside the quantum computer using a conventional computer .
The obvious way to do this is to track the way the numbers s 1 , s 2 , … change as the quantum computation progresses .
The problem with doing this is that even a single quantum gate can involve changes to all 2n different numbers .
Even when n is quite modest , 2n can be enormous .
For example , when n = 300 , 2n is larger than the number of atoms in the Universe .
It ’s just not feasible to track this many numbers on a conventional computer .
You should now be getting a feeling for why quantum computer scientists believe it is infeasible for a conventional computer to simulate a quantum computer .
What ’s really clever , and not so obvious , is that we can turn this around , and use the quantum manipulations of all these exponentially many numbers to solve interesting computational problems .
I wo n’t try to tell that story here .
But if you ’re interested in learning more , here ’s some reading you may find worthwhile .
In an earlier essay I explain why conventional ways of thinking simply cannot give a complete description of the world , and why quantum mechanics is necessary .
Going a little further , an excellent lay introduction to quantum mechanics is Richard Feynman ’s QED : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter .
It requires no mathematical background , but manages to convey the essence of quantum mechanics .
If you ’re feeling more adventurous still , Scott Aaronson ’s lecture notes are a fun introduction to quantum computing .
They contain a fair bit of mathematics , but are written so you can get a lot out of them even if some of the mathematics is inaccessible .
Scott and Dave Bacon run excellent blogs that occasionally discuss quantum computing , and their blogrolls are a good place to find links to other quantum bloggers .
Finally , if you ’ve enjoyed this essay , you may enjoy some of my other essays , or perhaps like to subscribe to my blog .
Thanks for reading !

Motivated by this observation , in my PhD thesis I posed a tongue - in - cheek quantum analogue of Moore ’s Law : to keep pace with conventional computers , quantum computers need only add a single qubit every two years .
So far , things are neck and neck .
Customs and Border Protection has long avoided explaining when , how and under what circumstances that agents at the nation 's borders can look through a traveler 's laptop , reading their email or searching through digital snapshots , to look for incriminating evidence .
But thanks to a newly published manual disclosed by the Washington Post , we know that agents do n't need any reason to search , seize or copy travellers ' laptop or phones .
The government argues , and the Ninth U.S. Appeals Court has agreed , that searching through a person 's laptop for copyright violations is no different from looking through their suitcase for cocaine – and thus fits what is known as the ' border exception ' to the Fourth Amendment .
That means a border agent does n't need reasonable suspicion , probable cause or even a hunch to open your laptop , seize it or make copies of your data .
The policy ( .pdf ) – dated July 16 , 2008 – does not set a limit on how long the government can hold on to a laptop or copy of a hard drive , other than saying it should be a ' reasonable period of time . '
However , if they do n't find anything incriminating or suggestive of a crime , they are supposed to destroy the data and not share it with other agencies .
DHS officials say the policy is necessary to snag potential terrorists and prevent copyright infringement .
Nor do agents need to have any suspicion of wrongdoing to get technical help in getting around encryption or translating foreign language material .
What is surprising is the clarity of the policy and that it is actually public :
Detention and Review by Officers .
Officers may detain documents and electronic devices , or copies thereof , for a reasonable period of time to perform a thorough border search .
The search may take place on - site or at an off - site location .
Except as noted in section D below , if after reviewing the information there is not probable cause to seize it , any copies of the information must be destroyed .
All actions surrounding the detention will be documented by the officer and certified by the Supervisor .
Oddly , though there seems to be one way to keep a border agent from looking in your electronics and papers unless they have probable cause to believe you have committed a crime .
Put it in a first class U.S. mail envelope and stamp it – or even better mail it to yourself before the trip .
Officers may not read or permit others to read correspondence contained in sealed letter class mail ( the international equivalent of First Class ) without an appropriate search warrant or consent .
Fed Ex , UPS and DHL do n't count .

James Gandolfini and fiancée Deborah Lin tied the knot Saturday in her hometown of Honolulu , Hawaii , a wedding guest confirms to PEOPLE .
“ There was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks ” as The Sopranos star and Lin officially became husband and wife , the guest tells PEOPLE .
“ They looked great . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
As a group of their closest friends and family looked on , Gandolfini , 46 , and Lin , a former model , 40 , exchanged their vows in an intimate ceremony surrounded by white lilies and rhododendrons adorning every pew held at Central Union Church .
According to the guest , Lin strolled down the aisle in a white gown made of Italian lace while her tuxedoed groom stood waiting as a harpist played the “ Hawaiian Wedding Song ” in the background .
Gandolfini ’s son Michael , 8 , from his first marriage to Marcy Wudarsk ( which ended in 2002 ) , served as best man .
Following the elegant 20 - minute nuptials , the newlyweds stepped into a white stretch limousine bound for the evening reception at a nearby resort .
At the reception , Gandolfini and Lin sat at an elevated table looking out onto the 200 guests – double the size of the wedding ceremony – in the filled ballroom .
“ They both wore long , green leis around their necks , ” says a source .
“ There were lots of white flowers on the tables and Gandolfini was beaming . ”
The happy couple and their guests nibbled on lobster , pork and seafood hors d’oeuvres ( pupu in local Hawaiian lexicon ) and during a sit - down dinner , feasted on Ahi tuna , Chinese roasted duck breast over angel hair pasta and steamed bok choy , broiled Mahi Mahi and filet mignon .
The final course featured tiramisu and – of course – cannolis .
Paying tribute to Lin ’s heritage , three teams of Chinese lion dancers ( at least three people per lion ) cavorted between tables as onlookers dropped a dollar in each gaping mouth for good luck .
“ Jim and Deborah mingled through the crowd a lot , ” says a guest .
“ Everything was just really tasteful . ”
Torture memos have been kept in the dark for too long

WASHINGTON , DC – The American Civil Liberties Union calls on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote to authorize a subpoena for the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to produce the legal opinions that approved harsh interrogations of detainees held by the United States .
The committee has repeatedly requested these documents and has seen very little cooperation from DOJ .
The Justice Department has provided some heavily redacted documents , which Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Ranking Member Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) have called inadequate .
If authorized , the subpoena would legally require DOJ to comply with the committee ’s request .
“ The Department of Justice has been stonewalling Congress for far too long – the time for a subpoena is now , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ The level of secrecy and noncompliance this administration has exhibited further underscores the lack of legal rationale for conducting torture in America ’s name .
President Bush and the Justice Department knew then , as they know now , that torture is clearly illegal under federal criminal law .
Only through full disclosure can we begin to wipe away this stain on America ’s image . ”
In October 2003 , the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
While more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit , the government continues to withhold many vital records and litigation is ongoing .
“ The Justice Department has repeatedly twisted or ignored the law in order to justify the use of brutal interrogation techniques the U.S. once prosecuted as war crimes , ” said Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU National Security Project .
“ This administration continues to use ' national security ' as a pretext to shield government officials from embarrassment , criticism and even criminal prosecution .
Far too much information is being withheld and the public has a right to the documents still being concealed . "
The documents received in the ACLU 's FOIA litigation are online at :

The ACLU has led the charge in calling for an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute any violations of federal criminal laws related to the interrogation of detainees , including any obstruction of justice .
