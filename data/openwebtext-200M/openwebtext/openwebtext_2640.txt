Well , this is n’t a micro-controversy I was expecting to wake up to .
A previous - RPS fave and Gametunnel ’s 2008 Innovation award winner has been pulled from Big Fish Games ’ portal after climbing its charts due to – gasp !
– salacious content .
Cue casual fans getting distinctly less casual .
The fairly - hefty eight - page comments thread has the full story , but the ( minorly spoilery ) details can be found beneath the cut …
The initial responses bounces back and forth between those who ca n’t believe the game ’s been “ censored ” and those are glad that it was , because it promotes bullying .
Which others note , it really did n’t .
Eventually , bfgAegean , a Big Fish representative elaborates on the reason for withdrawal …
“ However , after extensive testing of the game , there was content in the game that we deemed unacceptable for our family oriented standards here at Big Fish Games .
We are very sorry that some of you who wanted to play it will not be able to , and we apologize for the inconvenience . ”
It was removed due to some strong sexual content towards the end of the game .
We would ask that if you have not played the game to its end , that you trust our judgment and reasoning in our decision to pull it from the site .
Which of course just leaves everyone wondering what the content could be .
Ewonka muses …
The story does turn quite dark near the end , but the only bloodiness happens when you prevent an assault on one of your girls by shooting the assailant .
The event is described in two short paragraphs .
It is not illustrated .
It is a striking event that reminds one that women ( and men ) are not safe , unless they are prepared to defend themselves and others .
It ’s a message I would want to teach my older children , to respect the real troubles in the world , to prepare for but not fear them .
That ’s how I felt when my queen “ kissed her smoking gun ” .
Or maybe they did n’t like the scene with two women who claimed they were playing ‘ Parcheesi ’ .
Or maybe they did n’t like the bondage scene which is utterly ridiculous , like something from a Mork and Mindy show .
It ’s not even Seinfeld offensive .
Did I miss something ?
There are quite a lot of endings to the game .
Anyone find something more potentially offending than those ?
And then it goes back and forth for a bit .
Here ’s Rose247 with an anti-DHSGIT position …
Wow , did this just happen today ?
If the game got darker towards the end I understand , I could see little bits through my trial version of it that sort of just made me think “ Why ? ” Games , movies , and tv always get ruined with gutter type stuff in my opinion .
I did not notice any women in the credits of who worked on this game , so maybe that ’s why the game went dark .
If another version of this came out without some of the issues this game seemed to have .
I would certainly play it , give me a game set in the 1920s please without the sleaze !
( Then other people make it clear that women were actually involved )
And here ’s a pro-DHSGIT one from DonnyDJ …
I am a teacher and I have never played this game before .
Regardless of what content is in the game , the decision to remove the game on the basis of offensive content is ridiculous .
If I looked really hard , I am sure I could find things that offend me in several casual games , but I wo n’t ; I have more constructive things to do .
I also do n’t like the fact that Bigfish refers itself as a ‘ family site ’ .
What are they trying to say ?
Are they trying to impose ‘ family values ’ on us ?
Bigfish … please do not go right wing , ignorant , and close minded on me …
Please do not become the Anita Bryant or Ann Coulter of casual games .
Thankfully , the debate clarifies when Picman ( aka Paul Thelan , Big Fish big fish ) …
To clarify , we are not censoring content , it was a judgment call on what is appropriate or not for the BFG brand and it was a scene that was not spotted by our testers prior to release and not even in the gray area of acceptable .
To be transparent with you all , the scene that was brought to our executives ’ attention was a branch in the story that resulted in the implied violent rape of a woman in graphic detail .
So this is not about “ family friendly ” or “ rated G ” this is a simple judgment call on what we want the BFG brand to represent and that type of content definitely was not it .
Blimey .
At which point , MousechiefCo – aka Keith Nemitz , the game ’s designer – enters , noting that this really is n’t explicit at all …
“ ( person ’s name ) overlooks her unconscious form , trousers dropped to his ankles .
Nail marks and bites on his arms seep red . ”
That was the ‘ graphical detail ’ of an attempted rape .
No rape actually occurs in the game .
This incident is clearly described later in the game as an attempt that was foiled by the protagonist girls .
In this scene they save one of their friends by shooting the attacker .
And later …
We fully support our game as a fine entertainment for TEEN audiences and older .
Our website labels each game with a rating icon .
We also abide by Big Fish ’s decision to withdraw the game from their site .
However , picman , who appears to be a representative of BFG , made a false statement , and we felt obligated to clear it up .
Again , no rape occurs in the game , and there is no explicit sex of any kind .
The event picman mentioned is not on a branch in the story .
Everyone who plays will eventually encounter it , as it is a plot element critical for the ending of the game .
Yes , it is emotionally intense , but no more so than a similar event in the movie ‘ The Journey of Natty Gann ’ from Walt Disney pictures .
So there you go .
It ’s the micro - hot - coffee .
While no longer on Big Fish , for those intrigued by the events , you can still get the demo – and unlock the full version – from Mousechief ’s site .

Fresh evidence has emerged of police efforts to recruit paid spies within environmental groups after the Guardian revealed that police in Scotland are running a network of hundreds of informants inside pressure groups .
Anti-nuclear protesters in Scotland said yesterday that military police had offered them cash in exchange for information .
One protester said he was offered money on top of his jobseeker 's allowance - a move sanctioning benefit fraud - if he gave military police the names of people planning environmental action .
One activist from Plane Stupid revealed that members had been given £ 20 by police .
James Woods , 22 , an anti-nuclear protester arrested at Faslane , said : " When I was released I was asked by an officer about my income and how I got by ... they said they'd help my financial situation in a way that would not interfere with my dole if I gave them information on people involved in upcoming actions . "
Jane Tallents , also an anti-nuclear protester , said she was asked for information by two military police officers .
" They wanted to find out what groups worked together ...
They said ' if you help us , we will help you ' .
It was pretty obvious it was about money . "
The revelations are likely to increase pressure on the Scottish government to justify actions seen as disproportionate in dealing with peaceful groups .
At the weekend Scotland 's justice secretary , Kenny MacAskill , said he was satisfied Strathclyde police had " acted proportionately and legitimately " in a case in which officers allegedly offered an activist money for intelligence .
Greenpeace UK yesterday described the tactics as " intrusive and intimidating " .
The group is already demanding answers from the government after a private investigator claimed he was hired by French energy firm EDF and hacked into Greenpeace computers .
He also consulted MI5 about the campaign group 's work .
EDF denied it sanctioned such activities .
" EDF wholeheartedly condemns any method aimed at obtaining information illegally , " said a spokesman for the firm .

Without the release of the OLC memo from August 1 , 2002 , showing Bybee admitting that waterboarding gives the impression of imminent death and allowing it anyway , showing Bybee allowing the CIA to put detainees in a small box with bugs in a Room 101 - style exploitation of phobias , I 'm not sure this resolution would have passed .
A few weeks back , John Heaner , a party activist in the San Fernando Valley , offered the resolution , prior to the release of the memos .
After the release , the grassroots and netroots massed a groundswell of support .
The Los Angeles County Democratic Party and other local organizations offered their support to the resolution .
My petition to urge the CDP to support it gathered 4,827 signatures in about a week .
Courage Campaign hopped aboard as well and got 9,000 or so sigs on their petition .
Activists called the CDP offices and pushed for passage .
And the party got the message .
This is part of a legitimate sea change inside the California Democratic Party .
Yesterday Hillary Crosby , a progressive candidate , beat the incumbent in a race for state party Controller .
After multiple scandals with releases of funds from the party and a lack of transparency and accountability , the grassroots decided they have had enough , and this time they have the numbers to make a difference .
This has been a growing movement since the entry of the Deaniacs in 2005 , and a tipping point of sorts has been reached .
We really are seeing some change inside the party .
But the big story is this resolution , which can now be sent to all 6 Democratic California members of the House Judiciary Committee , as well as California 's own House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
The Party that provides money and organization has decided to make their will known , that we want accountability for those who authorized torture in our name , that we do not want the continued presence of one of those authorizers for torture on the federal bench .
Resolutions can go flat if they are n't picked up and used as a tool .
Today , when it passes the full party on the convention floor in a few hours , we can celebrate .
Tomorrow , we put this to work .
Thanks to everyone who put in the time and effort to get this done .
This is a huge victory .
... I should also add that , in a press conference with reporters and bloggers yesterday , I asked Sen. Barbara Boxer what she thought about the Party passing an impeachment inquiry into Bybee , and she responded , " I 'm very open to that , " reminding the assembled that there is an ongoing investigation from the OPR in the Justice Department , and that she did not vote for Bybee 's confirmation .
UPDATE : Here 's the full text of the resolution :
CALLING FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE JAY BYBEE AND OTHERS FOR THEIR ROLE IN ALLOWING TORTURE AS PART OF " ENHANCED INTERROGATION "
Whereas , former Assistant Attorney General , and current Federal Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Jay Bybee signed the " Bybee Memo , " or " Torture Memo " of August 1 , 2002 , which advised the C.I.A. that " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment was at times allowable under U.S. law , and authored , co-authored and signed other memos on " extraordinary rendition " and " enhanced interrogation , " more of which are being currently revealed to the American public as the new Administration brings them to light ; and
Whereas the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment , the supreme law of the land under Article VI of our Constitution , requires the prosecution of those who authorize torture , and it has been established that waterboarding is torture ; and
Whereas , on January 15 , 2009 before leaving office , President George W. Bush , in an effort to cover his culpability , and the culpability of others , had his Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice issue a memo stating that certain opinions issued in 2001 - 2003 with respect to " the allocation of authorities between President and Congress in matters of war and national security do not reflect the current view of this Office ; "
Therefore be it resolved that the California Democratic Party supports resolution of inquiry and vigorous investigation of these and related actions by the Congress of the United States , including the full use of Congressional subpoena power authority and all appropriate remedies , to disclose completely the possible criminal actions of Judge Jay Bybee and others to the American people and to take necessary and available action with appropriate remedies and punishment allowed by law ; and
Be it further resolved , that a copy of this resolution with its original authorization be sent to the Office of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate , and that copies of the signed resolution be sent to each Democratic member of the California delegation to the United States Senate and House of Representatives .
The scene is one familiar to many , if not most , American males of a certain age .
Colonel Ernesto Bella , the Cuban military ruler of Soviet - occupied Calumet , Colorado , is patiently interrogating Mayor Bates , who — since he poses no threat — is permitted the continued use of his official title ( even though Bella has appropriated the Mayor ’s limousine ) .
The subject is the whereabouts of Bates ’ son , Daryl , and several other local teenagers suspected of staging guerrilla attacks on the occupation troops .
“ Daryl , he would n’t hurt a fly , ” Bates insists in a voice heavily flavored with the bogus bonhomie that comes naturally to politicians .
“ I know my son , Colonel .
He ’s not the guerrilla type . ”
Col .
Bella is not convinced .
“ According to records , Mayor , your son is a prominent student leader , ” the Cuban points out .
“ Yes , well , he ’s a leader , but not in a violent or physical way , ” Bates stammers .
“ He ’s more of a politician , like his father .
He ’s not a troublemaker — “
“ Then who is ? ” interjects Col.
Bella , who , weary of Bates ’s piscine floundering , skewers him with a barbed look .
After taking a moment to catch his breath and collect his scattered wits , Bates offers an answer he knows will please his masters , and probably lead to the death of some former friends .
“ Well , let ’s just say — it runs in some of the families , ” he replies as he contorts his face into a caricature of a politician ’s confident smile .
Bella , not even attempting to hide his disgust , responds with a derisive chuckle .
“ This community is indeed fortunate to have a shepherd like him , ” Bella comments to his aide - de- camp , scorn oozing from every syllable .
Deflated yet determined to play out his chosen role , Bates tries to clothe his naked collaboration in the robes of respectable “ moderation ” : “ Well , I just want to see this thing through , Colonel . ”
Shortly thereafter we see Bella presiding over the execution of a large group of “ troublemakers , ” who are gunned down in a ditch at the outskirts of town .
They remain defiant to their last mortal breath , which they use to hurl the strains of “ America the Beautiful ” into the face of their murderers .
Standing , appropriately enough , at Bella ’s side — or , more exactly , at his heel — is Mayor Bates , who had been dragged along to see his handiwork primarily as an object lesson regarding his fate should be somehow manage to overcome his canine servility .
The premise of the movie from which those scenes are drawn , the 1984 jingo - fest Red Dawn , is the conquest of the Midwestern United States by a Soviet / Cuban / Nicaraguan invasion force .
Wildly implausible at the time , that storyline has not gained credibility over the past quarter - century .
However , the movie ’s depiction of young , athletic mountain boys harrying and wearing down a vastly superior military force through guerrilla tactics in some ways foretold the eventual defeat of Soviet forces in Afghanistan , and Washington ’s impending defeat there as well .
In addition to presenting a creditable dramatization of fourth generation warfare , the movie also offers some valid insights regarding the tactics employed by totalitarian rulers and those who oppose them .
While it ’s profoundly doubtful that Americans will be ground beneath the heel of a Russian - led occupation force , there ’s a growing likelihood that the government ruling us — a quasi - socialist kleptocracy supported by a militarized proto- police state — will metastasize into undisguised totalitarianism .
Every totalitarian system , whether imposed through military conquest or internal subversion , requires the services of people like the gelatinous Mayor Bates — those who have spent their lives seeking power and the favor of those who exercise it , and are willing to betray anybody and everybody in order to remain personally secure once power is in the hands of those who are utterly ruthless .
The common refrain of such people — the Collaborator ’s Song , as it were — is always some variation on the theme of “ I just want to see this thing through . ”
A different take on that treacherous tune was performed by the character of Max Detweiler in The Sound of Music , a melodramatic adaptation of the true story of Austria ’s Trapp Family .
Since that film is tragically disfigured by song and dance numbers ( guys prefer battlefield choreography set to the music of gunfire , punctuated by occasional explosions ) its surprisingly strong message about resistance to totalitarian subversion is largely unknown to the male film audience .
The story is set in Austria just prior to the Anschluss , an event anticipated with dread by Austrian patriots — such as Capt. von Trapp — and eagerness — by the loathsome likes of Herr Zeller , an arrogant little functionary who would become gauleiter once the Nazis were in power .
Caught in between were many like the wealthy Herr Detweiler , the self - appointed promoter of the von Trapp Family Singers .
Max was frustrated by Capt. von Trapp ’s reluctance to permit his children to sing in public , but terrified by his refusal to accommodate the Nazis in any way once the betrayal of his country was consummated .
When the Nazis sent the Captain a conscription notice , Max took aside Maria , the family ’s once - time governess who became the Captain ’s wife , and urged her to use her influence to moderate the Captain ’s views .
“ He ’s got to at least pretend to work with these people , ” Max admonished Maria .
“ You must convince him . ”
“ I ca n’t ask him to be less than he is , ” replied Maria with quiet pride .
To his credit , Max did aid the Captain and their large family in their escape from their Nazi - dominated homeland .
To his shame , Max — like many thousands of his countrymen — helped make the betrayal of their homeland possible by “ pretending ” to work with the enemy , rather than refusing to cooperate .
Unabashed collaborators like Mayor Bates — or their real - life versions , like the much - debated Malinche — are relatively few in number .
Those of the Max Detweiler type are quite common , and many of them — despite their best efforts at maintaining the pretense of support for the ruling power — find their names written down on the lists compiled , and dutifully turned in , by those whose collaboration is more overt , and whose desire is to “ see this thing through ” at whatever cost to other people .
What do such unpleasant matters have to do with life in contemporary America ?
The tragic answer to that question is : A great deal .
Many people were shocked just a few weeks ago when we were given a reminder that the government ruling us compiles a roster of official enemies , and that the enforcement arm of Leviathan ’s state - level affiliates is being trained to recognize “ danger signs ” of political “ extremism . ”
This reminder came courtesy of the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) , which issued a “ strategic report ” last February entitled “ The Modern Militia Movement .
MIAC is one of more than fifty counter - terrorism “ fusion centers ” that pockmark the American landscape like syphilitic sores .
These entities are jointly operated by state , local , and federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies , with involvement by some branches of the military and even a select few nominally private sector entities .
Fusion centers are more appropriately referred to as domestic intelligence soviets — policy making “ councils ” designed to create and impose a ruling “ consensus ” regarding the nature of the internal “ threat . ”
They tend to be highly secretive , and operate on the assumption that their activities are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act or its state - level equivalents .
The “ report ” itself is a product of the same congeries of left - wing “ watchdog ” groups who have been laboring for decades to criminalize everything but “ progressive ” opinion and activism .
I would write that MIAC simply “ regurgitated ” what it was fed by those people , but the olfactory signature of the report in question suggests that it exited the bureaucratic apparatus by way of a bodily orifice other than the mouth .
As with all such efforts at broad - brush civic excommunication , “ The Modern Militia Movement ” was written by people of bad faith whose net gathers of every kind but their own .
Where else could we find militant white power agitators ( a group whose ranks are routinely replenished with an endless supply of federal provocateurs ) forced into unnatural association with the supporters of the late Ron Paul presidential campaign , a multi-ethnic movement whose motto was “ Liberty , prosperity , and peace ” ?
It should be understood that this document was written for the guidance of law enforcement personnel , who are instructed that those displaying the traits and attitudes described in the report consider law enforcement to be “ the Enemy … .
They view the military , National Guard , and law enforcement as a force that will confiscate their firearms and place them in FEMA concentration camps . ”
Leaving aside the matter of which agency would run detention centers in the increasingly likely event of full - scale martial law , we ’re left with a perfectly reasonable question :
Why should n’t we view the State ’s armed enforcers as “ the Enemy ” ?
The typical conduct of police during confrontations with civilians bears eloquent testimony of the fact that they are indoctrinated to treat us as the enemy , and to be prepared to disarm us when given the opportunity — for their own safety , of course .
Why else would police ask motorists if they were armed , or confiscate video and audio recording equipment from witnesses whenever police are involved in potentially controversial episodes of official violence ?
The import of the Missouri MIAC report was to prime state law enforcement agents to perceive as potential terrorists anybody who displayed any of the political sentiments listed therein .
Thus bumper stickers announcing support for Ron Paul or Chuck Baldwin would be regarded as warning signs , as would the advertisement of hostility toward the FBI , ATF , IRS , UN , or Federal Reserve .
None of this is new .
The Missouri document reads almost exactly like a police checklist created in 1995 and presented in Oklahoma City when the federally - facilitated bombing of the Murrah Building by disgruntled former federal employee Timothy McVeigh ( and “ others [ conveniently still ] unknown ” ) was still a raw and bloody memory .
During a presentation on “ Criminal Justice and Right - Wing Extremism in America , ” John J. Nutter of the Ohio - based Conflict Analysis Group described that political persuasion as a “ lightning rod for the mentally disturbed ” and warned the 500 law enforcement personnel in attendance to be wary of those displaying the symptoms of such alleged derangement .
Those symptoms included , but were not limited to , opposition to the UN and the above - mentioned federal alphabet agencies ; “ excessive ” anger over , or familiarity with , the federal atrocities at Waco and Ruby Ridge ; opposition to the Federal Reserve ; a strong commitment to the right of armed self - defense ; unusual knowledge about the Constitution and its history ; a tendency to buy gold and silver ; and possession of various forms of “ extremist ” literature .
I was particularly intrigued by that last category , since it included the magazine for which I was then employed , as well as the book I had just recently published .
The document assumed that law enforcement agencies would have pretty detailed intelligence on the political opinions , literature collections , and personal habits of the people described as potential terrorist threats .
Like the more recent MIAC document , furthermore , Nutter ’s little report was intended to fortify the assumption that such people , rather than being active citizens in the tradition of Samuel Adams and Thomas Paine , were a direct threat to the physical well - being of law enforcement personnel .
Nutter ’s profile was just one of many versions of the same official libel that was reproduced in Missouri ’s MIAC report .
The post -OKC bombing “ Counter - terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act ” appropriated several million dollars to the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance ( BJA ) by way of the Institute for Intergovernmental Research ( IIR ) for use in creating the State and Local Anti-Terrorist Training program ( SLATT ) .
SLATT was a conduit linking the Justice Department and state police agencies directly into the demimonde of hard - left “ watchdog ” groups .
The program ’s official literature ( circa 1999 ) described its mission as providing “ pre-incident awareness … preparation , prevention , and interdiction training and information to state and local law enforcement personnel in the areas of domestic anti-terrorism and extremist criminal activity … .
The SLATT law enforcement training program focuses on the detection , investigation and prosecution of extremist - based crimes , criminals , and criminal activity . ”
Although SLATT ’s emphasis changed to reflect a pre-occupation with Middle Eastern terrorism following the 9 - 11 attacks , it still presents training about “ The Psychopathology of Hate Groups ” ( “ hate ” groups are always right - wing , of course — and note the call - back here to Nutter ’s Soviet - flavored idea that “ right - wing ” politics attract the “ mentally disturbed ” ) and “ Recognizing Terrorist Indicators and Warning Signs . ”
SLATT could be considered the progenitor of today ’s “ fusion centers . ”
Indeed , despite repeated disavowals of the fact , it can be demonstrated that SLATT played a key role in creating the FBI ’s tendentious 1999 Project Megiddo “ strategic report ” on domestic “ extremism ” and potential terrorist threats .
That document , widely circulated among state and local police nation - wide identified “ religious motivation and the NWO [ new world order ] conspiracy theory ” as the “ two driving forces behind the potential for millennial violence . ”
Both SLATT and the archipelago of “ fusion centers ” are subsidiaries of the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) , which collects and disseminates information about “ listed threats ” to state and local police .
The defamatory “ intelligence product ” distributed by Missouri ’s fusion center — the “ strategic report ” that listed supporters of Ron Paul or the Constitution Party among potential terrorist threats — is not only of a piece with previous efforts by the likes of Nutter and SLATT , it is all but certainly representative of the kind of material being distributed to police nation - wide .
None of this is the result of carelessness or ignorance .
The effort to shoehorn right - leaning activists into the role of “ domestic terrorist threat ” has been going on for nearly a decade and a half , and the people responsible for it certainly dispose of adequate resources to know exactly what they are doing .
They taxonomize us as terrorists and enemies of the state not because they have misinterpreted our values and objectives , but because they honestly regard us to be such , irrespective of our efforts to pursue the vindication of our ideals through lawful and peaceful means .
They consider us to be the domestic enemy .
We should be thankful for their candor , and earnestly reciprocate that designation .
This means , at the very least , that in our dealings with the State ’s agents , particularly those employed by what the Russians call the “ Organs of State Security , ” we should follow Solzhenitsyn ’s advice : “ Do n’t believe them , do n’t fear them , do n’t ask anything of them . ”
We certainly should not support them , respect them , or seek to cultivate a relationship with them .
Doing so will inevitably lead to compromise and collaboration .
And this brings up a sad and unpleasant element of this subject I ’m duty - bound to address .
A few days ago , just before the efforts of others led to the official retraction of the Missouri MIAC report , the upper management of a “ constitutionalist ” organization for which I was once employed has instructed its members , and whatever elements of the general public with which it has influence , to cultivate a good “ relationship ” with their local Homeland Security “ fusion center ” : “ The John Birch Society is urging members and all constitutionalists to work on bettering relationships with local police as well as the DHS Fusion Centers . ” ( Emphasis added . )
I reiterate that this was the voice of that organization ’s upper management .
I would assume that many within the rank - and - file membership have a much sounder take on the issue .
Why should constitutionalists seek to have a “ relationship ” of any kind with a governmental entity that exists without constitutional warrant ?
Fusion centers are designed to amalgamate law enforcement under federal control , which would be entirely impermissible , from a constitutional perspective , even if they were generating reliable intelligence regarding legitimate terrorist threats .
Why should any organization that advertises its supposed expertise regarding Communist subversion embrace a course of action that could be summarized in the slogan : “ Support your local Homeland Security Soviet “ ?
Is the intention here to do what is necessary to “ see this thing through , ” in the style of the invertebrate Mayor Bates , or merely to “ pretend to work ” with those who are building the New Order , as the duplicitous Max Detweiler would put it ?
The only principled approach to dealing with the fusion centers , and the entire Soviet - style “ Homeland Security ” apparatus , is to agitate for its abolition , rather than helping to consolidate the power of that apparatus by treating it as legitimate in any sense .
As bad as things presently are , we ’re experiencing merely the overture to what may become a bloody and violent historic tragedy .
Opposing the Organs of State Security now costs relatively little — much less than it will eventually cost when they have been “ strengthen[ed ] … in exercise , ” and their roles become “ entangle [d ] in precedents , ” to adapt Madison ’s timeless language .
Yet we see that even in these circumstances , some supposed defenders of “ Freedom and Family ” are choosing collaboration rather than timely confrontation .
Rather than hacking at the roots of police state tyranny , or even pruning some of the more conspicuous branches , they are helping to water and fertilize the monstrosity in the name of maintaining a good “ relationship ” with the enemy .
And all the while the people who dictate that course of action can be expected to sing — in counterpoint to whichever version of the Collaborator ’s Song they select — the occasional hymn to their own sensible moderation .
As I said , things will get much uglier than they are at present .
Those who choose to collaborate when the alternative is relatively painless will either have to make some painful course corrections right now , or they ’ll eventually find themselves standing metaphorically at the elbow of Colonel Bella as his troops gun down the people whose names were so thoughtfully provided to the Enemy — in the cause of maintaining that valued “ relationship ” and “ seeing this thing through , ” of course .

The operation targeted the trafficking of children for prostitution
US authorities have rescued nearly 50 child prostitutes - some as young as 13 - in a nationwide operation against the trafficking of children for sex .
More than 570 suspects were arrested during the action , which took place over three nights .
FBI agents and local police forces were involved in the operations which spanned some 29 cities .
Officials say a 16 - year - old girl who recruits children as prostitutes is being sought as a priority .
Special Agent Melissa Morrow , of Washington 's FBI , said adult prostitutes who were among those arrested tipped authorities off about the girl .
" She is currently 16 and started when she was 13 , " Agent Morrow said .
" Now she is out there recruiting other juveniles as well , " she said , adding that finding her was " at the top of our list " , the Associated Press news agency reported .

The FBI said 571 people were arrested on suspicion of the trafficking children for prostitution and solicitation .
" We continue to pursue those who exploit our nation 's children , " said FBI Director Robert S Mueller III .
" We may not be able to return their innocence but we can remove them from this cycle of abuse and violence . "
Nearly 20 years have passed since two old Eton College chums had a long , tense telephone conversation about a plan one of them had concocted to have a man beaten up – unaware that someone was secretly recording them .
It has been known for years that the tape existed , and tantalising snippets have been leaked in the past , but now finally , a full transcript has come to light of that bizarre exchange between Boris Johnson and his friend Darius Guppy , who went to prison for masterminding a multimillion - pound fraud .
The Good Fairy must been present at Guppy 's birth in 1964 to endow him with almost every quality a man could ask for , including wealth , good looks , ambition , intelligence and brilliant social connections .
And the Bad Fairy must have been there too , to ruin the party by making him a psychopath .

Guppy achieved notoriety in 1993 when he was jailed for an insurance fraud committed several years earlier , which came close to being a perfect crime .
He and an associate paid someone to tie them up and fake a robbery in New York , so that he could claim £ 1.8 m in insurance .
It was his revenge on Lloyd's , the insurance firm which had ruined his father during a notorious financial scandal in the late 1980s .
After being released from prison he had a bloody confrontation with Earl Spencer , the brother of Princess Diana , who he believed had tried to seduce his wife while he was locked away .
The allegation , which Earl Spencer vehemently denied , brought an end to the close friendship between the two old Etonians .
But it was three years before in 1990 that Guppy found infamy with Mr Johnson who was then the Brussels correspondent at The Daily Telegraph .
At the time Guppy was a frightened man after a News of the World reporter , Stuart Collier , started inquiring into his background and he feared his dubious activities were about to be exposed .
Guppy wanted Mr Collier stopped , frightened and physically assaulted – and had lined up a mysterious south London figure to arrange it .
However , one crucial part of the plan remained elusive – Collier 's private phone number and address .
His attempts to persuade Mr Johnson – a fellow journalist – to help get it has never been released in full until now .
It was recorded by Peter Risdon , a business associate of Guppy , who distrusted him so much he started secretly monitoring and recording his calls .
The full transcript illustrates the Teflon quality of the London Mayor , who is able to emerge smiling from scandals that might have destroyed another politician 's career , partly because it is difficult to know when to take him seriously .
The tape is also fascinating for what it says about Guppy , who has now vanished from the public eye .
Of the many things written about him , few are as damning as the words he uses to describe himself .
" Boris , can I tell you something , " he is heard saying .
" My honest opinion about myself is that I am a potential psychopath .
The reason I am not a psychopath is because I have ... "
" A mother ? " Johnson is heard interjecting .
" No , I have discipline over my feelings and it's as simple as that , " he replied .
" But I am telling you something , Boris , this guy has got my blood up all right , and there is nothing which I wo n't do to get my revenge .
It 's as simple as that . "

Guppy says he needs Mr Johnson to help trace Mr Collier 's address because he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to do so and one of the London heavies who was to inflict the beating was becoming impatient .
" I have just had a telephone call from this bloke , okay , " he told Mr Johnson .
" And I swear to you it is now getting to the stage where I am beginning to look stupid because I have been promising them for the past three weeks , and I can not afford to look stupid . "
Mr Johnson tried to reassure him : " These people are there to do your bidding .
Just tell them it happens .
You know – the trail is too warm , something like that . "
Minutes later , Mr Johnson revealed that his anxiety that the man from the News of the World might find out that he was involved .
" He is extremely dangerous , extremely dangerous , " he is heard saying .
" If you fuck up in any way , I mean frankly if he suspects that I am involved in this ... forget about me .
Honestly , Darius , you have really got to think whether it 's worth your while . "
Mr Johnson then revealed that he had approached four people to try to get Mr Collier 's details , only two of whom he could fully trust .
" If it got widely known that he'd been beaten up , it would inevitably get back to the contact I 've used , " he said .
To reassure him , Guppy said : " Okay , right , may I just tell you what my plan is .
My plan is this , that even once you give it to me I will leave it for one month before I do anything .
It will happen in one or two months ' time .
All right ? "
" You promise me that ? "
Mr Johnson is heard to reply .
Later in the conversation , Guppy repeated : " The deal is basically you furnish me the information , and I will put it on ice for one month . "
Mr Johnson then anxiously inquires : " How badly are you going to hurt this guy ? "
Guppy answers : " Not badly at all . "
The conversation goes on .
Mr Johnson : " If this guy is seriously hurt , I am going to be fucking furious . "
Guppy : " I guarantee you he will not be seriously hurt . "
Mr Johnson : " How badly hurt will he be ? "
Guppy : " He will not have a broken limb or a broken arm and he will not , er , he will not be put into intensive care or anything like that .
He will probably get a couple of black eyes and a , and a cracked rib or something like that . "
Mr Johnson : " A cracked rib . "
Guppy : " Nothing which you did n't suffer in rugby okay but he will get scared and that is what I want him to do , I want him to get scared , I want him to have no idea who is behind it okay , and I want him to realise that he 's fucked someone off and whoever he 's fucked off is not the sort of person he wants to mess around with .
" Because I guarantee you Boris , I guarantee you these people are , you know , if someone hurts their boss or threatens their boss I promise you it 's just total sort of , it 's like they 're like dogs , they are like Alsatians or rottweilers , they love their masters , they are affectionate towards them , they are evil bastards to everyone else . "
Mr Johnson : " Yeah , yeah , good .
Okay Darry now , yeah , I mean I but . "
Guppy : " You must have faith in me Boris . "
After holding onto the tape for years , Mr Risdon was finally persuaded to release it to be broadcast on last night 's Dispatches programme for Channel 4 – the same programme that ran a damaging investigation into Ken Livingstone 's political associates .
But he does not believe that the tape shows London 's Mayor as having been involved in anything criminal .
" My own feeling is that Johnson was just going along with Guppy , humouring him , and had no intention of helping . "
But John Biggs , deputy leader of the Labour Group in the London Assembly , said : " This was not some youthful misdemeanour but a revealing insight into the moral code of the man who now leads our police .
It appears that Boris was more worried about getting found out than the harm that would have been inflicted on one of his journalist colleagues . "
After his release from open prison , Guppy emigrated to South Africa .
An investigation by a Sunday newspaper two years ago found him living in a mansion with a swimming pool but with no bank account or visible means of support .
He returned to London briefly last year for his mother 's funeral but since then nothing more has been heard of the man who claimed that it was only self - control that saved him from being a psychopath .
Dispatches spent months trying to track him down but with no success .
For a man whose famous aquaintances have brought him infamy he seems to have decided an anonymous life is now for the best .

** UPDATE : Since it ’s over , I have a post about my interpretation of events here **
Let me be clear about this : I loathe Fox .
Everything Rupert Murdoch makes me want to spew my internal organs into a ditch .
That ’s putting it politely .
But tonight , April 22nd , my old college mentor Dr. Caroline Heldman will be on .
She ’s actually a somewhat regular pundit on the show ( per my youtube results ) fighting the good fight against Sean Hannity , on his own turf .
Dr. Heldman is currently a political science professor at Occidental College , who continues research in areas such as gender and voter behavior .
She is an incredibly intelligent and sharp person , who is funny and endlessly passionate about resolving gaps in equality that the government fails to remedy .
One skill of hers that seriously is admirable , is her uncanny ability to be concise and articulate .
I am confident you will witness this firsthand , if you choose to subject yourself to Hannity ’s obnoxious talking - over , interrupting , insulting speech towards his own panelists .
I wonder how / why they let her be on the show , is it a false stereotype that they generally only pick weak people easily pushed around ?

CLEVELAND --
A clear picture of how much the region 's big , tax - exempt hospitals give back to the community is taking shape after years of political pressure .
The Cleveland Clinic , University Hospitals and the Sisters of Charity Health System together spent just over 2 percent -- or $ 157.9 million on $ 7.2 billion in operating revenues -- providing free patient care in 2007 , according to their most recent federal filings and data requested by The Plain Dealer .
For the first time , all of the hospitals have provided their charity care numbers based on how much it actually cost to provide that care , not how much they would charge on a bill .
In addition to their charity care expenses , the hospitals also say they lost millions more because people did not pay their bills , and Medicaid and Medicare do not fully reimburse .
" Every hospital in this town has made a significant effort to step up in terms of their ability to provide charity care and financial assistance to people who have medical needs , " said Bill Ryan , president and chief executive of the Center for Health Affairs , a member organization of the hospitals .
There is no standard for the amount of charity care nonprofit hospitals should provide .
But for more than a decade , politicians and community activists have questioned whether nonprofit hospitals -- which do n't pay property taxes in return for providing services to the community -- give enough back .
The topic is particularly sensitive for Greater Cleveland , where MetroHealth Medical Center , the county - owned hospital , has said an increase in the number of non-paying patients has caused financial problems .
Last year , the safety - net hospital eked out $ 691,000 profit on $ 685.9 million in revenues , according to its unaudited report .
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa made national headlines several years ago when he asked the Cleveland Clinic and nine other hospitals to justify the tax breaks they received .
Grassley 's efforts dovetailed with a wide - ranging review of the nonprofit hospital sector by the Internal Revenue Service , which released results in February from its two - year study of more than 500 hospitals nationwide .
While the report did not break out hospitals ' average outlay for charity care , it stated that hospitals reported spending an average of 9 percent of their total revenues on community benefits .
Cleveland 's nonprofits spent an average of 8.4 percent of their total revenues on the broader category of community benefits , which includes not only charity care , but also a host of other programs and services , such as research , staff training and community outreach .
" It 's all of the things that we kind of take for granted , " Ryan said , adding that " those are the things that do suffer when budgets get cut . "
Here are a few highlights from the hospitals ' 2007 community benefits reports :
The Cleveland Clinic spent $ 421.6 million on community benefits , including subsidized health services such as psychiatric services at Huron and South Pointe hospitals and obstetrics at Hillcrest , Huron , Lakewood and Marymount hospitals .
University Hospitals spent $ 168 million on community benefits , including seminars for seniors , a women 's health exposition and the " Dare to C.A.R.E. " program that screens people for certain cardiovascular problems .
Sisters of Charity spent $ 8.2 million on community benefits , including community gardens , neighborhood improvement projects , tree planting , graffiti removal , child care for needy community residents , mentoring programs and watch groups .
In 2009 , all nonprofit hospitals will be required to disclose information on what benefits they provide to the community on their revised annual financial filings , called 990s .
The Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals included that information in their 2007 forms .
Ron Schultz , senior technical adviser with the IRS for tax - exempt government entities , said that eventually the IRS plans to use the information to determine whether there should be a standard national requirement for charity care or community benefit .
" It 's not that we 're sitting back and not doing anything , " Schultz said .
Grassley is n't sitting back either .
Staff members say that the senator is " weighing his options " about whether to introduce legislation to set a standard for charity care and bring more scrutiny to executive salaries .
In the short term , Grassley expects the nonprofit hospitals to continue to provide maximum care to the needy " regardless of the economy . "
All of Greater Cleveland 's hospitals report an increase in patients who can't pay .
Executives at each have said they expect a 10 percent increase in spending on charity care this year , largely because of the rising number of unemployed .
That increase comes when the hospitals are seeing their income shrink .
Hospitals make money off paying patients , or those with insurance .
But patients usually get health insurance from their jobs and Cuyahoga County 's unemployment rate climbed to 9.3 percent last month -- the highest it has been since May 1987 .
In addition , Ohio hospitals are fighting a proposed state fee that they say could cost them millions .
" Each individual hospital is going to have to deal with the way this assessment will affect finances , " said Rick Frank , director of state policy and advocacy for the Ohio Hospital Association .
The association expects to release a statewide survey today in which more than a third of the state 's hospitals say they will have layoffs or reduce services if the fee is passed .
" Some may have to reduce charity care , " Frank said .
Debra A. Draper , associate director with the nonprofit , Washington D.C. - based Center for Studying Health System Change , said the recession may give the hospitals a " perceived license to do things that they 've wanted to do for a long time , like cut charity care .
" Do n't get me wrong , the [ economic ] pressures have increased tremendously but this could give them the opportunity , " Draper said .
" That 's what we 've seen across the country . "
The Cleveland Clinic , University Hospitals and the Sisters have said they will not cut charity care .
They will find other ways , they said , to trim their budgets .
" We are resolute in our unwavering commitment to providing significant levels of charity care based on the needs of the communities we serve , " University Hospitals Chief Executive Officer Tom Zenty said in an e-mail to The Plain Dealer Friday .
The hospital system judges its managers ' performance on community benefit efforts , along with a host of other performance measures such as quality outcomes , he wrote .
After a recent meeting with other hospital executives to express their opposition to the proposed state fee , Sisters of Charity 's Chief Financial Officer Pat McMahon described charity care -- particularly at its downtown location St. Vincent -- as a primary responsibility .
" The Sisters will continue to follow their mission of giving care to anyone who walks in the door , " he said , adding " as long as we can keep our doors open . "

BRUSSELS  Misshapen fruit and vegetables won a reprieve on Wednesday from the European Union as it scrapped rules banning overly curved , extra knobbly or oddly shaped produce from supermarket shelves .
Ending regulations on the size and shape of 26 types of fruit and vegetables , the European authorities killed off restrictions that had become synonymous with bureaucratic meddling .
The rising cost of commodities also persuaded the European Commission that there was no point in throwing away food just because it looked strange .
As of July , when the changes go into force , these standards for the 26 products , as varied as peas and plums , will disappear .
European shoppers will then be able to choose their produce whatever its appearance .

Kucinich hits Iraq withdrawal : ' You ca n't be in and out '
Stephen C. Webster

It was n't even one year ago when Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) and members of his political campaign said now - President Barack Obama " seems to think losing a war will help him win an election . "
Which is what makes this week 's announcement of -- and the fallout from -- President Obama 's plan to withdrawal troops from Iraq so surprising .
It is n't the opposition party Obama must now win over :
It 's his own political allies .
Sen .
McCain and top Republican leaders actually support the Democratic administration 's plan , while some top Democrats have openly criticized it .
Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , himself a former presidential candidate , hit back Friday against a portion of Obama 's plan which would leave 35 - 50,000 " observer " soldiers in the country .
" You can't be in and out at the same time , " said Kucinich in a media advisory .
" America must determine at some point to end the occupation , close the bases and bring the troops home , " he said .
" We must bring a conclusion to this sorry chapter in American history where war was waged under false pretense against an innocent people .
Taking troops out of Iraq should not mean more troops available for deployment in other operations .
" In February of 2007 I presented H.R. 1234 , legislation that would end the war in Iraq , and the process I outlined is still necessary .
We should immediately bring home American service members and contractors , convene a regional conference to prepare an international peace - keeping force and accelerate Iraq - driven reconstruction . "
" As a candidate for President , I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown , while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains weve made and protect our troops , " Obama said on Friday .
" Those consultations are now complete , and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months . "
Obama added , " Let me say this as plainly as I can : by August 31 , 2010 , our combat mission in Iraq will end . "
Congressman Kucinich has been a leading opponent of the Iraq war policy even well before many of his Democratic colleagues in the House of Representatives came to agree with his position .

Bonding
Ultra-Long Range Molecules
Rubidium dimers have 100 - nm bond lengths
Pushing chemical bonding to an extreme , a group led by Vera Bendkowsky and Tilman Pfau of the University of Stuttgart , in Germany , has created rubidium dimers with 100 - nm bond lengths ( Nature 2009 , 458 , 1005 ) .
Courtesy of Tilman Pfau Pfau ( left ) and Bendkowsky align the laser apparatus used to create Rydberg atoms and molecules .
Molecules with such ultralong bonds had been predicted theoretically but never before observed experimentally .
Normal Rb 2 has a bond length of about 0.4 nm .
The new dimers are fleeting , with a lifetime of only about 18 microseconds at microkelvin temperatures .
Nevertheless , " the experimental proof of the existence of ultra - long - range molecules is truly a remarkable achievement " that could lead to a new kind of ultracold chemistry , says Jan M. Rost of the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems , in Germany .
The scientists prepared the new Rb 2 molecules by using a laser pulse to excite one Rb atom into a so - called Rydberg state , in which at least one electron has a high principal quantum number — 34 to 40 in these experiments .
That far - flung electron can then form a bond with a distant rubidium atom in the ground state , creating a Rydberg molecule .
In a commentary about the work , Chris H. Greene of the University of Colorado , Boulder , likens the outermost electron to " a sheepdog that keeps its flock together by roaming speedily to the outermost periphery of the flock and nudging back towards the center any member that might begin to drift away . "
Over the weekend , Australians united for a common cause : the destruction of the cane toad .
Thousands of toads were collected by Queensland residents and brought to a morbid block party where they were summarily frozen or gassed to death .
“ To see the look on the faces of the kids as we were handling and weighing the toads and then euthanizing them was just … , ” Townsville City Councilman Vern Veitch said , breaking off to let out a contented sigh .
“ The children really got into the character of the event . ”
Why such heart warmth over this mass extermination ?
In short , the cane toad was imported to Australia in the 1930s in the hope that it would control their cane beetle population .
Instead , the toad has turned into a pest of its own since it ca n’t jump high enough to affect the cane beetle population and , thanks to its poison glands , there are no natural predators to keep its reproduction rate in check .
Since the original introduction of 102 toads , the population has grown to several million and spread across much of northern Australia .
The story of Australians ’ very bizarre love / hate relationship with this critter is best told in the hilarious documentary , “ Cane Toads : An Unnatural History ” .
Here ’s a small excerpt .
Warning : a mouse is sacrificed to science , art , and cane toad hunger in this clip .

Financial Crisis Opportunities Amidst The Greatest Wealth Transfer In History
In G7 capitals and financial centers , Public Servants and their elite Banksters - both central and money center banks and investment brokers - nervously tell their clients to wait for the inevitable recoveries , along with a chorus from the elite media stooges to fool the citizens and investors of their cluelessness .
Neither the Chicago School nor Keynes can explain what is unfolding , and in the Austrian School everything is and has been predictable .
Why are the first two considered mainstream ?
Because in both schools of thought GOVERNMENT is the answer rather than the problem .
For the mainstream , the problems can always be solved by borrow , print , lend and spend .
In no way will the “ borrow , print , lend and spend ” model work in generating NEW economic growth ; it just moves the hyperinflationary ( Crack - up Boom ) outcome closer into view .
The G7 is now on the way to being a BANANA republic the likes of Venezuela , Argentina , Zimbabwe and the German Weimar republic .
The G7 public and their Public Servants are economically illiterate and the “ something for nothing ” character flaw now leads them to their inescapable future .
This Ship of Fools deserves its fate and nature is about to impose its lessons .
For those of us who understand what is unfolding , it is an amazing opportunity to prosper and thrive because the greatest transfer of wealth from those that hold their wealth in paper to those that do n’t is firmly underway .
As this is priced into markets , “ volatility ” shall reign supreme as the Ship of Fools tries to elude its fate , driving markets ( stocks , bonds , currencies , commodities , natural resources , energy ) up , down and sideways as they seek shelter from the unfolding storms and maelstroms .
But there is no escape as they have failed to learn history ’s lessons and are doomed to repeat them .
For the prepared investor , the opportunities are immense .
In April of 2007 , we identified the unfolding collapse of INCOME , as related to the S&P 500 and illustrated by a WOLF WAVE , and extrapolated it worldwide , because at that time the US was still the locomotive to the world economy .
In August of 2007 , this letter identified ROACH motels that were in essence the shadow banking systems over the counter derivatives .
We postulated that there would NEVER be enough money printed to underpin their worth : they were unknowable and no price discovery mechanism was built into them , and at this point , never would be .
If their worth was discovered the world would know : the G7 governments and their financial systems are INSOLVENT .
Both scenarios have unfolded as predicted , and now the greatest debt bubble in history is just beginning to POP ; what you have witnessed up until now is just the prelude .
As incomes are NOT sufficient to repay the debt , significant debt restructuring must take place and losses realized .
However , very little , if almost NONE of the debt restructuring has yet occurred .
Let ’s take a look at the mountain of debt going all the way back to the inception of the Federal Reserve .
The final severing of gold from the US currency at Breton Woods II in 1971 was the LATEST betrayal of the American people by Public Servants at that time since fiat money was constitutionally PROHIBITED and contrary to the constitution :
Notice how the accumulation of debt took off like a scalded cat after Breton Woods II severed the last links to gold - backed money .
Then the politicians with their central bank and private financial institutions embarked on the debt enslavement of the American and G7 people .
Obviously they have now achieved it .
GDP is declining while debt issuance is SOARING and the unpaid mountain of debts , as a percentage of GDP , continues to climb just as it did in The Depression .
Look closely at the period between 1930 and 1933 : Debt skyrocketed AFTER the stock market crashed in 1929 , and continued to skyrocket until 1935 when the deleveraging REALLY began .
Extrapolating this today , by looking at current executive and congressional actions and intentions , it is set to occur again NOW , as well .
So , look at this vertical growth in debt above as JUST the beginning of a debt - to - GDP ratio which projects to 500 % of GDP , without taking into account UNFUNDED entitlements .
During the first Great Depression , the United States was the greatest CREDITOR nation in the world .
Now it is the greatest debtor , and most of the debt is held by FOREIGNERS .
This is a recipe for ZIMBABWE .
Virtually NONE of this debt has been written off ( $ 1 Trillion of an expected and required $ 8 - 12 plus Trillion ) .
Most lenders are still holding these loans at 90 cents on the dollar , when in fact they may be worth 20 cents .
Lending and expansion will not resume until at least 20 % of these losses are retired because the INCOME to service it no longer exists .
In order to pay down debt you must PRODUCE MORE THAN YOU CONSUME .
This is something the G7 has n’t done in years ( properly adjusted for inflation ) and has forgotten to do ; it has substituted fiat currency and credit expansion in its place .
This is growth by misstated inflation and Ponzi finance .
Please do n’t call it Capitalism because it is not Capitalism .
It is a type of stealth Socialism and creeping enslavement of current and future generations with UNPAYABLE debt ; deficit spending can only be paid for by future taxes or INFLATION by printing press .
As this pile of debt just soars and comes due over the next several years , incomes are in freefall .
Let ’s review the Wolf Wave from the Crack - up Boom series of last summer :
3 Year Annualized earnings on the S&P 500 through June 2008
This is a chart from the summer of 2008 and 3 quarters later ; the drop in earnings has sliced through the lower trend line like a hot knife through butter and is approaching an 80 % decline on a quarterly and a monthly basis .
US corporate tax receipts have fallen from $ 32.57 billion in March 2008 to $ 3.39 billion in March 2009 , a decline of almost 90 % in just 1 year .
John Mauldin has been doing fabulous work detailing the falls in income .
It is outlined in his work from April 10th and available to you here : http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article9976.html, I urge you to read it as it removes any of the illusions you may have about corporate PROFITABILITY .
The FEDERAL budget deficit in the first six months of the fiscal year was reported close to $ 1 trillion ( $ 956.8 billion ) .
Last year , the budget deficit for the same period was $ 312 billion and for ALL 2008 , a mere $ 454 billion .
A quadrupling of the RED ink , codified into law and as we all know , never to be repealed regardless of which party holds the reins of power .
Through the first six months of the fiscal year , expenditures are up over 33 % and income is down over 13 % , and that is BEFORE the Washington spending and stimulus bills passed in January - March are included .
Rivers of RED ink as far as the eye and mind can see .
The bank rescue plan , known as the Public Private Partnerships , to remove the TOXIC bonds has FAILED because no one in their right mind would partner with the government .
As Jamie Dimond of JP Morgan Chase said , “ We have no intention of participating ; we have learned our lessons about government partners already . ”
To see the fall in income globally , look no further than this chart of World Trade from a recent New York Times :
This is another face of the global collapse in income .
Do you really believe these firms , economies and governments are still able to service their debts ?
How many lenders are now in jeopardy of default ?
My estimate is that it is quite a few .
Industrial production is at its lowest level since it started being measured in 1967 , about 68 % of capacity .
Inventories are skyrocketing , so it is set to fall MORE , and layoffs shall also .
Actual unemployment is almost 20 % if you eliminate the statistical definitions .
Take a look at this chart from www.shadowstats.com outlining the true picture :
Unemployment properly measured is almost 20 % and it has a long way up to go , only the government and mainstream media HIDE this betrayal by Public Servants to create the conditions for JOB growth !
This is also a picture of plummeting incomes .
MetLife has just released a study which discovered that 50 % of the people surveyed would be UNABLE to pay their bills after 30 - 60 days if they lost their jobs .
The Benedict Arnolds in the G7 capitals continue to bury the futures of their current and subsequent generations with debt to fund their follies in bribery with taxpayer money .
The interest expense on Obama ’s and Congress ’ new spending plans amounts to over $ 115,000 of ADDITIONAL INTEREST expense for every person over the age of 20 , over the rest of their lives .
This is in addition to what is already owed and does not include repayment of principle .
I am about to have a son born in the next two weeks and he is a DEBT slave of the government , impossibly indebted by over $ 250,000 AT BIRTH .
I was informed that when I apply for the birth certificate , they want me to apply for a Social Security number , placing their noose around my son ’s future earnings as their debt slave .
MY SON IS NOT RICH , and neither am I .
The immorality of the US government expecting future generations to pay for the profligate spending of people who REFUSE to pay for their own consumption is on plain display .
Obscene and immoral behavior .
Then , the most economically illiterate new gang of 535 ( the executive , congressional and judicial branches of the US government ) , in conjunction with the rest of the G7 , have implemented programs and plans which are accelerating the demise of the G7 financial systems bringing forward their unfolding insolvencies .
In just six months ( since October 1 , 2008 ) , the Public Servants and the president will have expanded government by 99 % .
It took George Bush eight years to double the size of government .
For President Obama and the Democrats , the doubling is accomplished when the 2010 budget begins .
Think of all the NEW opportunities for corruption that Public Servants can SELL via CAMPAIGN contributions and cushy jobs from the private sector contributors after retirement , as the new rules are written .
As they choose the NEW “ winners and losers ” in the private sector by government fiat and regulations , the new national champions are DECLARED and the money is spent .
It ’s Christmas day for every Public Servant and government office in the land .
Just this week , it was announced that Social Security contributions are almost less than the payouts , due to the collapsing income of the American people .
This was not projected to happen until 2011 - 2012 .
The losses which reside , for the most part , on the books of the lenders , whether they are banks , investors , institutions or pension funds , etc. - ALL are waiting for the ( as they believe ) typical post - WWII recovery to take place .
The IMF now estimates another $ 4.1 TRILLION of losses are yet to be realized ( the true number is MANY multiples of this figure ) .
The $ 12.9 Trillion borrowed , guaranteed or printed to date could PAY OFF every residential mortgage in America with Trillions to spare .
Recently , stock markets around the world have rallied from 25 to 45 % , depending on where you look and sectors such as the financials have enjoyed gains of up to 100 % .
DON ’T BE FOOLED .
The worst of the economic crisis is in front of us .
Use this rally to further position yourself for the next leg of the unfolding economic and political debacle .
Even DEAD CATS bounce and this dead cat was thrown to the floor harder than any time in history .
In February , the stock markets of the world on monthly charts were more oversold than anytime on record .
Emotional exhaustion , mainstream media- hyped HOPE , statistical manipulation and seasonal adjustments on an unprecedented scale and never before seen levels of PPT ( plunge protection team ) MONETIZATION of stocks are all combining to fuel this bounce .
The financial authorities are already buying US and agency debt .
What makes you think they will stop there , when the PPT is already in place at the primary dealers and ready to PUMP up the stock market , providing the illusion of stability ?
Take a look at this chart from Dennis Gartman at the www.thegartmanletter.com and from Trim Tabs which illustrates saving and investment flows :
This chart makes the rally even more suspicious .
The PPT I believe has never been more active in its history .
The current denizens of WASHINGTON , D.C. just got tired of the market taking nose dives any time one of them speak , so it appears the order went out to HIT THE BUY button every time they do in order to create the ILLUSION of support from people with MONEY on the line .
They will STOP at NOTHING in pursuing power and the crisis is their cover .
Today when Obama started speaking , the tic went from negative 600 to positive 1200 in less than a minute .
It would appear it is relentless .
At no time during my career have I seen the things I have seen in the last 60 days ; it is mesmerizing .
Any time the market tries to correct , they would appear to stand in the way of healthy corrective activity , setting the stage for a debacle when their interference with NATURE ultimately fails .
Fundamentally , the market should fall another 50 % , at least if Mauldin is correct in his work .
AND HE IS !
Of course , the money on the line to buy the markets is created with a keystroke and the purchasing power is subtracted from the money you have in the bank by debasement .
The bank stress tests are a joke and the conclusions were known before they began .
Whatever is most POLITICALLY beneficial is to be expected , as practical solutions fall prey to the corruption of the present Congress and executive ambitions .
Turner Radio Network has obtained a copy of the results as follows :
The Turner Radio Network has obtained the stress test results .
They are very bad .
The most salient points from the stress tests appear below .
1 ) Of the top nineteen ( 19 ) banks in the nation , sixteen ( 16 ) are already technically insolvent .
( Based upon the “ alternative more adverse ” scenario which had a 3.3 percent contraction of the U.S. Economy in 2009 , accompanied by 8.9 percent unemployment , followed by 0.5 percent growth of the U.S. Economy but a 10.3 percent jobless in 2010 . )
2 ) Of the 16 banks that are already technically insolvent , not even one can withstand any disruption of cash flow at all or any further deterioration in non-paying loans .
( Without further government injections of cash )
3 ) If any two of the 16 insolvent banks go under , they will totally wipe out all remaining FDIC insurance funding .
4 ) Of the top 19 banks in the nation , the top five ( 5 ) largest banks are under - capitalized so dangerously , there is serious doubt about their ability to continue as ongoing businesses .
5 ) Five large U.S. banks have credit exposure related to their derivatives trading that exceeds their capital , with four in particular - JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , HSBC Bank America and Citibank - taking especially large risks .
6 ) Bank of America`s total credit exposure to derivatives was 179 percent of its risk - based capital ; Citibank`s was 278 percent ; JPMorgan Chase`s , 382 percent ; and HSBC America`s , 550 percent .
It gets even worse : Goldman Sachs began reporting as a commercial bank , revealing an alarming total credit exposure of 1,056 percent , or more than ten times its capital !
( HSBC is NOT in the top 19 banks undergoing a stress test , but is mentioned in the report as an aside because of its risk capital exposure to derivatives )
7 ) Not only are there serious questions about whether or not JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citibank , Wells Fargo , Sun Trust Bank , HSBC Bank USA , can continue in business , more than 1,800 regional and smaller institutions are at risk of failure despite government bailouts !
The debt crisis is much greater than the government has reported .
The FDIC`s " Problem List " of troubled banks includes 252 institutions with assets of $ 159 billion .
1,816 banks and thrifts are at risk of failure , with total assets of $ 4.67 trillion , compared to 1,568 institutions , with $ 2.32 trillion in total assets in prior quarter .
Put bluntly , the entire US Banking System is in complete and total collapse .
Look no further than the unfolding WASHINGTON consensus to convert the Preferred to Common Equity , which in effect makes the government the largest shareholder in the respective TARP recipient .
With effective voting control , the government will probably direct lending to politically important priorities , rather than economically sound efforts .
Mortgage cram - downs are now supported by Citigroup vis-a - vis the Preferred to Common exchange now taking place .
The banking industry is suffering from wholesale loss of employees as top talent leaves to avoid the compensation restrictions and the unfolding WITCH hunts by your elected representatives , leaving the least qualified personnel to deal with ALWAYS emerging NEW PROBLEMS .
A total of 10 people at the US Treasury are overseeing / supervising the banks and now they propose to micromanage them .
Barney Frank and Chris Dodd are preparing to direct these HUGE operations as they are now doing with AIG , GM , Chrysler , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac , ad infinitum .
While we are speaking about Congressman Frank , on May 5th he is going to explore the possibility of the FEDERAL government GUARANTEEING municipal and state bonds .
Congressman Frank insists , like he did with Fannie and Freddie , that they are economically sound .
On the state level , tax revenues have fallen much faster than the federal level .
Trillions of dollars of spending budgeted during the credit bubble are now spiraling out of control on the spending side , while revenues are in FREEFALL as every assumption underlying the budgets and bond issuance proves FALSE .
The most liberal states are in the most distress and danger , and the GANG of 535 works to implement their failed policies on a national level .
Cap and Trade energy legislation was dead on arrival as no Public Servant in their right mind would send that bill to their constituents ( once implemented a rise in energy costs of almost 1000 % ) .
So quietly last Friday afternoon , the EPA Czar and Al Gore radical Lisa Jackson declared carbon dioxide ( the air you exhale ) a danger to your future !
YOU ARE A PART OF NATURE NOT A VIRUS TO IT .
There is no CONSENSUS on climate change except in the back rooms of the G7 governments , which have RUN OUT of NEW taxes to impose , reasons to take your freedom away and TO PROTECT YOU ; they need fresh funds for political boondoggles .
The president is speaking about energy policy as I write this missive .
One of his boasts is that we need to take the path that California has taken , telling the poorly - informed illiterates among us a fairy tale .
California has to IMPORT its energy as NO ONE will build any kind of energy business there except government mandated ethanol .
It is an unfolding DISASTER , just like their economy .
Morally , intellectually and fiscally bankrupt Public Servants .
Jonathan Hoenig of Fox Business
News sums up where we have come to nicely :
“ It has been described as socialism , fascism or communism .
In various contexts , all are true , but let 's refine it .
From loans to the automakers to the bailouts for the banks , the taxation , spending and control , the primary philosophy that 's powering the country now is collectivism .
Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights .
Your life and the product of your labor now belong to the group .
If the group wants a bailout , heath care , green cars , low mortgage rates , a job , an education - anything at all , it now becomes your responsibility to provide it , whether you want to or not .
You see it in taxes that take money from people who 've earned it and give it to those who have not .
You see it in the language itself .
Phrases like " we 're all in it together " , " I am my brother 's keeper " and " shared sacrifice " all speak to the same idea : you are here to serve .
And unlike charity of volunteerism , the " will of the people " is implemented by force , not by voluntary trade .
This is a profoundly un-American ideal .
From the original Boston Tea Party came the Declaration of Independence which put forth the morality of individual rights .
In this country , you are born free , not with a duty to serve the King but with a moral right to live your own life .
" Life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " refers to your life , your liberty and your happiness .
You do not owe society a thing .
For socialists , collectivists , and others who support a high tax , high spending , government controlled economy , sacrifice is an absolute .
You 're expected to sacrifice for your neighbor , your government , for AIG or Citigroup , or deadbeat homeowners or poorly run municipalities , whomever the geniuses in Washington decide deserves your money .
This is wrong .
The Founding Father 's view of government was that its scope was limited and clearly defined .
Is the purpose of government to own and run a car company ?
An insurance firm ?
A bank ?
A mortgage company ?
Of course not .
We 've become one of the state - owned basket case European economies we used to make fun of in this country .
This country was the once land of " rugged individualism . "
Now America is controlled by and home to , the government dependant : “ something for nothing ” , poorly informed and functionally illiterate .
Fooled by the mainstream media to believe the RICH do n’t pay their FAIR share .
Take a look at this recent chart from Dennis Gartman at www.thegartmanletter.com illustrating the FACTS of the matter :
In my mind , this CANNOT , by any stretch of the imagination , be called shirking your duty to society ; but the illiterate masses , Public Servants and elite ’s mainstream media prey on the most productive people in society using this lie .
The productive portions of the economy are just meat at the buffet table for these VAMPIRES .
They believe they have a right to the property of others .
Have a RIGHT to FREE healthcare , housing and welfare at the expense of people who work for their money .
It is slavery personified in EVERY sense of the word .
The unproductive as masters of the productive ; it is a recipe for disaster .
Thinking of all the debt in relation to GDP and projected deficits is frightening in and of itself .
But then you must REALIZE that G7 currencies are debt and IOU ’s , not REAL money , so any PAPER fiat currencies held globally should actually be ADDED to the total debt .
I am ending this missive with a quote from “ Atlas Shrugged ” by Ayn Rand , as it fits what is unfolding :
“ " Whenever destroyers appear among men , they start by destroying money , for money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence .
Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper .
This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values .
Gold was an objective value , an equivalent of wealth produced .
Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist , backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it .
Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs ; upon the virtue of the victims .
Watch for the day when it bounces , marked : Account Overdrawn .
In conclusion : Benedict Arnolds are firmly in control in America and much of the G7 , pursuing the demise of these once great nations .
There is no escaping what has been put in place and the only exit is the PRINTING press .
The destination is that of a BANANA republic , and a quiet coup ( http://www.theatlantic.com/..), as outlined by Ex-IMF executive Simon Johnson , has occurred .
Martin Feldstein echoes his comments in a recent Financial Times article entitled ” Inflation is Looming in America ’s Future ” , available at : http://www.ft.com/cms/..
But it is broader than what he outlines and extends to ALL the OLIGARCH sectors of the economy .
The US and G7 have become Fascist corporate states .
The captive victims , also known as citizens and debt slaves , are too busy trying to survive instead of revolting .
As they become increasingly DESPERATE , civil unrest LOOMS .
Nothing can stop the developed world collapse that is occurring .
The internet is now emerging as a threat to Washington because it exposes their lies .
They are going to try to SHUT IT DOWN and REGULATE it and call it a NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT as their excuse , because foreign governments may attack us .
To SAVE you …
The emerging world will recover much sooner as they are savers and capitalists and the developed G7 are rapidly becoming what they once were : socialist command economies and BANANA republics .
Look no further than the President ’s EMBRACE of Hugo Chavez and Raul Castro to see the future of the United States .
They are heroes of the President and preside / rule over workers ’ paradises , just as he and the beltway aspire to do .
Today the CFO of Freddie Mac was found dead ( 41 years old and in the prime of his life ) and they are calling it a suicide .
I say : HE KNEW TOO MUCH !
And was probably about to “ blow the whistle ” … .
Do you really believe anyone in government can produce more healthcare for all , for less ?
UNBELIEVABLE claims .
How about green energy ?
Recent studies indicate one green energy job kills two jobs in the regular economy .
In his speech on Cap and Trade and energy , the President stated “ the countries that make the correct choices will thrive ” .
He ’s right .
The ones that choose cheap and practical sources will thrive and the US and G7 will fail , as they FORCE impractical energy policies on already impaired economies .
The US Government is now the major shareholder and controlling partner in the world ’s largest mortgage companies , insurance company and automobile manufacturer , and has its site set on the energy , banking and healthcare industries .
It is only a matter of time until they control them as well .
To save you .
It is ILLEGAL for the government to own these companies ; it makes a mockery of the constitution .
In France , anyone making more than 50,000 Euros a year is RICH , and in reality , that is where the US and the G7 are headed .
But with the printing presses fully engaged , it will actually be POVERTY level .
Gordon “ Sold the gold ” lowered the definition of rich today and raised the level of taxes on anyone making 150,000 pounds to 50 % , Can you say slave to the government ?
There is only one ray of sunshine to this and that is EVERY market in the world will erupt in VOLATILITY to re-price to these rapidly changing REALITIES , and “ Volatility is Opportunity ” for the prepared Investor .
Absolute return investments are the key to the future , as they have the potential to thrive in UP and down markets .
The opportunities are enormous !!
There is not enough money in the world to fund the deficits , spending and rescuing the financial system , so once again , hi ho , hi ho , it ’s off to the printing press they go .
Look for quantitative easing to supply the juice for these reckless Public Servants and their elite masters , so they will steal it out of your bank accounts while you sleep at night with their printing press .
We truly are in the hands of the “ Ship of Fools ” and everything you have known and loved is set for destruction at their hands .
The only growth you can expect this year and next will be a mirage , courtesy of lying bureaucrats .
The Obama administration has ushered in an EXPANDED era of parasites and they are bent on killing the host private sectors , and I believe they will succeed .
The President and Congress are the most anti-growth , anti-American government in history .
If you think the collapse that is unfolding now is a passing phase , next year will be worse .
WE WILL BE AFLOAT ON A SEA OF WORTHLESS COUPONS and call it MONEY .
Hyperinflation anyone ?

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac was found dead at his home Wednesday morning in an apparent suicide .
David Kellermann , acting chief financial officer at the government - controlled mortgage company , was found dead at his home in Fairfax County , Va .
Kellermann was named acting CFO in late September , three weeks after the government took charge of Freddie Mac .
He had previously been senior vice president and corporate controller there .
His death came as staff from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department were probing the home - finance company about issues including possible accounting violations .
Freddie FRE , +0.69 % disclosed the investigation in a March 11 filing , and the firm said it was " cooperating fully in these matters . "
According to the SEC filing , Freddie said it received a federal grand jury subpoena Sept. 26 from the U.S. attorney 's office for the southern district of New York .
The subpoena sought documents related to accounting , disclosure and corporate - governance matters , according to the filing .
But that subpoena was later withdrawn and the investigation was taken over by the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia .
According to the filing , on Oct. 21 , Freddie said the SEC had begun its own investigation , asking Freddie for documents .
Specifically , on Jan. 23 , Jan. 30 and Feb. 25 , the SEC issued subpoenas for documents .
The agency also began its own interviews of company employees , Freddie said in the filing .
In addition to the investigation , Freddie Mac received a request from the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations on Oct. 20 seeking documents for a hearing it held on Dec. 9 .
Freddie Mac has received more than $ 30 billion in government support as the mortgage and credit crisis intensified .
Kellermann 's apparent suicide surprised some key regulators in Washington , who expressed their condolences .
" On behalf of the Treasury family , we are deeply saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann 's death , " said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in a statement .
" Our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at Freddie Mac during this difficult time . "
The Federal Housing Finance Agency issued this statement : " For many years , we have known David as a person of the utmost ethical standards who was hardworking and knowledgeable in his field .
As the Acting Chief Financial Officer of Freddie Mac during particularly challenging times , David was an inspiration to his staff and many others who were privileged to work with him .
We extend our condolences to his family , friends and colleagues . "
Kellermann 's apparent suicide would be the latest of several putatively motivated by the financial crisis .
French financier Rene - Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet killed himself in December after losing roughly $ 1 billion of his own and clients ' money to the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard Madoff .
Seventy - four - year - old German billionaire Adolf Merckle in January committed suicide after the conglomerate he controlled , with investments in pharmaceuticals , cement and other sectors , experienced problems related to the global financial crisis .
In 2002 , J. Clifford Baxter , a former Enron Corp. vice chairman , was found dead in his car in Houston , in an apparent suicide , after the company collapsed in a massive corruption scandal and bankruptcy filing .
Court rules detainees in Afghanistan can challenge imprisonment
By Bill Van Auken
4 April 2009
In another rebuke to the arrogation of power by both the Bush and the Obama administrations to imprison so - called enemy combatants indefinitely without charges or trials , a federal judge in Washington ruled that three detainees held at a US prison at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan have the right to challenge their detention in a US court .
The case is one of a number in which the Obama administration has continued the defense begun by the Bush administration of extra-constitutional policies and practices introduced over the past eight years on issues ranging from " extraordinary rendition " to torture and domestic spying .
This case involves four individuals who were seized by US security forces and transported against their will to Afghanistan for imprisonment in the Bagram detention facility .
Some of them report first being held and tortured in secret CIA prisons , so - called " black sites . "
None of them had any involvement in the ongoing war being waged by the US military against Afghan forces resisting foreign occupation .
The four include : Fadi al Maqaleh , a Yemeni citizen who was captured by US forces outside of Afghanistan in 2003 ; Haji Wazir , an Afghan citizen who was seized in Dubai in 2002 ; Amin al Bakri , a Yemeni citizen , grabbed by US operatives in Thailand in 2002 ; and Redha al - Najar , a citizen of Tunisia who was captured in Pakistan in 2002 .
All of them have been held under brutal conditions for more than six years without ever being tried or even allowed to hear the supposed evidence against them .
The Bush administration declared all those held at Bagram " enemy combatants , " claiming that they had no right to judicial review in the US , nor any protection under the Geneva Conventions governing treatment of prisoners of war .
The practical effect of this classification was to turn Bagram into a center of torture , where at least two detainees have died under interrogation .
The Bagram facility has received far less public attention than the Guantánamo Bay detention camp , with its 600 detainees denied any contact with lawyers , family members or indeed anyone outside of their American jailers and the International Committee of the Red Cross , which is bound by its agreement not to make public statements about conditions in specific prisons .
Every bit as much as Guantánamo or Abu Ghraib , the Bagram facility embodies the lawlessness and brutality that led much of the world to see the US as a pariah state under the Bush administration .
After the change in administrations , Judge John D. Bates of the US District Court for the District of Columbia scheduled a hearing to allow the new president and his Justice Department to change the position taken under Bush .
But on February 20 , Obama 's lawyers went into court to announce that " the government adheres to its previously articulated position " — i.e. , the Bush administration 's position , of seeking the dismissal of the appeal by the detainees for the right to file habeas corpus petitions in US district courts .
In a 55 - page ruling issued Wednesday , Judge Bates rejected the government 's move to have three of the detainees ' petitions dismissed .
In the case of the fourth , the Afghan citizen Haji Wazir , he reserved judgment pending the filing of further briefs by the government and his lawyers .
All four of the detainees have been represented by the International Justice Network .
Bates based his ruling largely on the June 2008 US Supreme Court decision in the case of Boumediene et al v. Bush , in which the high court ruled that the " enemy combatants " held at Guantánamo had the right to file habeas corpus petitions in US courts challenging the legality of their imprisonment .
The 5 - 4 decision held that the 2006 Military Commissions
Act setting up military commissions to try the detainees represented an unconstitutional usurpation of power in categorically denying them habeas corpus rights .
It found the legislation in violation of the so - called Suspension Clause in the US Constitution , which states : " The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . "
Bates , a conservative judge appointed by George W. Bush , stressed that his ruling was " quite narrow " and applied only to the four detainees .
Nonetheless , he stressed , as did the Supreme Court majority in Boumediene , the fundamental character of the right of habeas corpus .
The judge quoted Alexander Hamilton 's observation that habeas corpus constituted an essential bulwark against tyranny : " [ C ] onfinement of the person , by secretly hurrying him to jail , where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten , is a less public , a less striking , and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government . "
The government — under both Bush and Obama — essentially argued that , because the individuals detained at Bagram were not US citizens and were not abducted on US soil , the writ of habeas corpus had no bearing , and they had no right to challenge their imprisonment in a US court .
Moreover , they insisted that because the detainees were being held outside of the United States , the courts had no jurisdiction .
However , the Supreme Court majority in its Boumediene ruling on Guantánamo rejected these arguments , finding that these issues of nationality did not automatically settle the question , particularly given that the " enemy combatants " were being imprisoned for the open - ended duration of the " global war on terrorism " and were being held on a military base where the US exercised full effective control .
The government has since argued that Bagram is fundamentally different from Guantánamo because of the " sovereignty " of the Afghan puppet regime , formally recognized in the Status of Forces Agreement it signed with Washington .
Moreover , they insist that as Bagram is in a " theater of war , " there are insurmountable barriers to extending habeas rights to the detainees held there .
" The military 's mission clearly would be compromised if the civilian courts of the United States can review the military 's detention of enemy combatants it captures , " stated the government 's brief .
Judge Bates rejected these arguments , holding that the status of the detainees at Bagram was " virtually identical " to that of those held at Guantánamo .
" They are non-citizens who were ( as alleged here ) apprehended in foreign lands far from the United States and brought to yet another country for detention , " the judge wrote .
Moreover , he stated that under the procedures established by the military at Bagram , detainees had " significantly less " ability to challenge their designation as enemy combatants than even those imprisoned at Guantánamo .
As for Bagram itself , Bates stated that the " effective degree of control " exercised by the US military was no different than at Guantánamo .
Finally , in relation to the " practical difficulties " posed by Bagram 's location in a " theater of war , " Bates stressed that this was a problem of the government 's own making , given that the four detainees " were all apprehended elsewhere and then brought ( i.e. , rendered ) to Bagram for detention now exceeding six years . "
He stressed that such an act of rendition " resurrects the same specter of limitless Executive power the Supreme Court sought to guard against in Boumediene — the concern that the Executive could move detainees physically beyond the reach of the Constitution and detain them indefinitely .
In the case of the fourth detainee , the Afghan citizen Haji Wazir , Bates employed the case - by - case , " multi- factor " basis established by the Supreme Court for determining the applicability of habeas rights to those held in the US detention centers .
He found that the government 's argument that granting him such rights could provoke " friction " with the Afghan government " possible — if not likely " — and employing the " balance of factors " scheme elaborated in Boumediene , ruled that he could not invoke habeas rights under that decision .
Bates deferred ruling on the dismissal of Wazir 's appeal , however , ordering both sides to submit briefs on an alternative separation of powers argument made by the detainee 's lawyers .
They argued that the executive branch 's determination of enemy combatant status combined with the congressional legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear enemy combatants ' habeas petitions represented an unconstitutional abridgement of the power of the judiciary .
The Bagram case represents a damning indictment of the Obama administration .
In an attempt to improve Washington 's dismal image on the world stage , it has pledged to close the Guantánamo detention center and has released some of those held there — while continuing to hold others indefinitely without trials .
At the same time , however , it is fighting in court to maintain the same conditions of imprisonment , rendition and torture — or worse — at Bagram .
While dropping the " enemy combatant " designation at Guantánamo , it has gone into federal court to clarify that it reserves the right to continue using it whenever it sees fit .
Meanwhile , under conditions in which the administration is escalating the war in Afghanistan , doubling the number of US troops deployed there , it is also carrying out a major expansion of the Bagram detention center , spending $ 60 million so that the facility can hold more than 1,100 prisoners .
Also significant in the decision issued by Bates on Wednesday , sections of the ruling were redacted at the demand of the government — in particular , information on how many of those now detained at Bagram were captured outside of Afghanistan and " rendered " there for interrogation and torture .
The attempt by the Obama administration to keep this information from the American and world public can only mean that these practices are continuing .
The BBC Trust 's report on Jeremy Bowen 's dispatches from the Middle East is pusillanimous , cowardly , outrageous , factually wrong and ethically dishonest .
But I am mincing my words .
The trust – how I love that word which so dishonours everything about the BBC – has collapsed , in the most shameful way , against the usual Israeli lobbyists who have claimed – against all the facts – that Bowen was wrong to tell the truth .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Let 's go step by step through this pitiful business .
Zionism does indeed instinctively " push out " the frontier .
The new Israeli wall – longer and taller than the Berlin Wall although the BBC management cowards still insist its reporters call it a " security barrier " ( the translation of the East German phrase for the Berlin Wall ) – has gobbled up another 10 per cent of the 22 per cent of " Palestine " that Arafat / Mahmoud Abbas were supposed to negotiate .
Bowen 's own brilliant book on the 1967 war , Six Days , makes this land - grab perfectly clear .
Anyone who has read the history of Zionism will be aware that its aim was to dispossess the Arabs and take over Palestine .
Why else are Zionists continuing to steal Arab land for Jews , and Jews only , against all international law ?
Who for a moment can contradict that this defies everyone 's interpretation of international law except its own ?
Even when the International Court in The Hague stated that the Israeli wall was illegal – the BBC , at this point , was calling it a " fence " !
– Israel simply claimed that the court was wrong .
UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 called upon Israel to withdraw its forces from territories that it occupied in the 1967 war – and it refused to do so .
The Americans stated for more than 30 years that Israel 's actions were illegal – until the gutless George Bush accepted Israel had the right to keep these illegally held territories .
Thus the BBC Trust – how cruel that word " trust " now becomes – has gone along with the Bush definition of Israel 's new boundaries ( inside Arab land , of course ) .
The BBC 's preposterous committee claims that Bowen 's article " breached the rules [ sic ] on impartiality " because " readers might come away from the article thinking that the interpretation offered was the only sensible view of the war " .
Well , yes of course .
Because I suppose the BBC believes that Israel 's claim to own land which in fact belongs to other people is another " sensible " view of the war .
The BBC Trust – and I now find this word nauseous each time I tap it on my laptop – says that Bowen did n't give evidence to prove the Jewish settlement at Har Homa was illegal .
But the US authorities said so , right from the start .
Our own late foreign secretary , Robin Cook – under screamed abuse from Zionists when he visited the settlement– said the same thing .
The fact that the BBC Trust uses the Hebrew name for Har Homa – not the original Arab name , Jebel Abu Ghoneim – shows just how far it is now a mouthpiece for the Israeli lobby which so diligently abused Bowen .
Haaretz gave considerable space to the BBC 's findings yesterday .
I 'm not surprised .
But why is it that Haaretz 's top correspondents – Amira Hass and Gideon Levy – write so much more courageously about the human rights abuses of Israeli troops ( and war crimes ) than the BBC has ever dared to do ?
Whenever I 'm asked by lecture audiences around the world if they should trust the BBC , I tell them to trust Amira and Gideon more than they should ever believe in the wretched broadcasting station .
I 'm afraid it 's the same old story .
If you allow yourself to bow down before those who wish you to deviate from the truth , you will stay on your knees forever .
And this , remember , is the same institution which said that to broadcast an appeal for medicines for wounded Palestinians in Gaza might upset its " neutrality " .
Legless Palestinian children clearly do n't count as much as the BBC 's pompous executives .
How do we solve this problem ?
Well I can certainly advise viewers to turn to Sky TV 's infinitely tougher coverage of the Middle East and – I admit I contribute to this particular station – I can recommend the courage with which Al - Jazeera English covers Gaza and the rest of the Palestinian - Israeli war .
I can well see how BBC executives will say that this article of mine today is " over the top " .
Jeremy Bowen may indeed think the same .
But the First World War metaphor would be correct .
For Bowen and his colleagues are truly lions led by BBC management donkeys .
A weekly comic strip , covering politics , pop culture , and the absurd .

Subject : Second Thoughts
Dear Bob ,
I found an interview with you online - ' Coilhouse magazine + blog ; Normal Bob Smith Knows What He Knows '.
Having read it , your answers to the questions totally changed my view of you .
Like I said I did n't hate you ( that would be a very harsh and horrible attitude ) - but I was a little bit scared of you !
That 's changed now , and actually I agree with many points you make about the values of human life .
You are very obviously much saner than many people who post you hate mail .
Just as many religious people seem to have a hatred for atheists , many atheists seem to have a threatening tone to religious people .
You clarified why that is really well in the interview - I no longer feel threatened .
Thinking back over your hate mail responses , you have almost never actually attacked a person any more than they attack you , and your comment " I don ? t have a hatred for religion or religious people " was reassuring .
It appears you have no patience with people who make no effort to consider other peoples ' perceptions of the world ; that 's intended as a compliment .
As a matter of fact , although I believe in God / Christ , it 's a personal thing for me , and I 'm not out to convert anyone or lord it over people ( pun intended ) .
But it 's good to have belief challenged and be able to come up with answers - a strength you have in my opinion , and one I 'm cultivating - hopefully .
God and Christ fit in my mind and give me personal rails to follow that make sense for me .
If my view of the central message of all religions is correct ( admittedly it differs from yours ) , then it does make me angry how much it 's been botched up as a direct result of humans trying to carry it out .
That 's why it 's a personal thing for me - easier to cut through the crap that way .
If you are doing the things you do to try to bring happiness and peace to the world as it is , then that 's something for people to admire , not to send you hate mail for !
Probably enough rambling from me anyway .
Your friend ,
Laura Guthrie

Subject : hypocrite
You say that you lump Jesus and Santa together because they are both created by man .
Yet you dress up like satan , looking like an idiot with horns on your head .
If you dont believe in Jesus then how in the world can you believe in a satan ?
I feel sorry for you , because you dont live in reality .
It seems like you live in your own little , imaginary world where you are just trying to make money off of disgusting merchandise all the while playing the part of a worldly hypocrite .
PS ...
Go ahead and pick apart my sentence structure and spelling , i really could care less that you know how to write a Ryan Warren
sothrnbull3@yahoo.com
How does dressing up as Satan mean that I believe in him ?
Do the people who dress up as Santa believe Santa 's real ?
Do people who believe in Jesus go around dressed like him ?
You 'll have to pardon me for saying so , but you 're the one who 's sounding like the babbling weirdo here .
Please let me know the thoughts you 're trying to force out of your mouth .
Bob “ Since you do n't believe in satan , why not have a dress up satan page ? ”
Dressing up like satan for Halloween is one thing , but dressing up for every photo i saw on your website is a little wierd .
It seems you dressing up like satan , and not believing in him , is just a cover for something or a part that you play for merchandising , am i right ?
Since you do n't believe in satan , why not have a dress up satan page ?
As it is right now , you are discriminating against believers of Jesus or Muhammad by specifically picking on our religious beliefs .
If you do n't believe in Jesus then why not just move on with your life rather then mock people who do believe ?
You seem like a very petty man with too much time on your hands .
Why not just have respect for others and their beliefs one way or another ?
You can believe what you want , but why make fun of peoples beliefs with these ignorant dress up magnets ?
Ryan Warren
sothrnbull3@yahoo.com
A dress up Satan page ?!?!?
I 'm sorry but that sounds more offensive than any of the other pages I 've even dreamed of !
OMG !
A game where you can play around with Satan .
Wow !
YOU ARE SERIOUSLY ASKING FOR SOME MAJOR TROUBLE , AREN'T YOU ????
Have you no fear of the wrath of Satan and his mighty demon armies ??
Not to mention the Satanist cult churches that 'd come after me .
I can already see myself on a slab in between two sacrificial virgins staring up at that flaming pentagram .
NO THANK YOU , RYAN !!
You 're so brave with Jesus protecting you at every corner , why do n't YOU make a dress up Satan page ???
Huh ??
Chicken ?!?
Or do you believe Satan 's real too , and he 'll come to get you in your sleep ?!!
You need to practice what you preech , Ryan .
Respect for people 's beliefs goes BOTH ways !
Bob Ryan CC 'd about 6 ( as opposed to BCC ) of his friends on his original email to me .
This is one of them .
I 'm assuming a relative .
( Oh , and here 's two different Satan Dressups I 've made ! # 1 & # 2 ) “ Bob , you are right , dressing up like a character does not make you that character .
Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny have always been fantasy characters , but to a Christian , God , Jesus and the Bible are real ”
The problem here is communication .
Ryan , you are correct , if Bob wants to portray himself as evil than he has that right .
Bob , you are right , dressing up like a character does not make you that character .
Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny have always been fantasy characters , but to a Christian , God , Jesus and the Bible are real .
And if we believe in God than this concept , in turn , makes Satan real .
Whether for halloween or just on a website the portrayal of him becomes offensive to a Christian .
At this point it is personal preference .
You choose what you feel is right and Christians will choose what they feel is right .
We are accountable for our individual choices .
The issue is not dress preference , it is perception .
I am on Ryan 's side on this one .
Anyone who portrays himself as an evil character is either trying to attract controversy or appeal to evil followers .
Either way , it is not an area I want to be associated with .
So for me I would prefer no response or additional email on this subject .
Thanks ,

Well Danny , of course everyone 's dream world is to be able to make blanket statements , state a whole bunch of personal beliefs to a captive audience , then withdraw from the conversation .
But if you truly do n't want to be associated with all of this you 'd best just stay out of the kitchen all together .
But since you seem to be standing next to the stove here is where I would say you 're the one who 's incorrect , Danny .
Satan too has frequently been a fantasy character .
He 's been portrayed over and over again in fictional movies , books , television shows , Off Broadway Theater and even historical mythology .
Saying he 's not portrayed as a fantasy character is just plain incorrect .
Of course I 'm speaking from first hand experience too .
One of the things I 've found that 's most enjoyable about dressing up as a make - believe Satan ( because clearly I am not him ) is the Pavlovian response it triggers from the religious .
I 've often compared it to the reaction you get from your dog if you approach it with a paper bag over your head .
But I also have to add that I just really think I make a cool looking Satan .
There 's no holding me back .
I 'm thrilled to see so many people included in this conversation .
Ryan 's a good friend to you all , it 's clear .
Thank you for the feedback .
I 'm taking it all into consideration .

“ I am in the kitchen and willing to cook but ... ”
I am in the kitchen and willing to cook but the difference is I do not willing to waist my time with your rhetoric .
I have no problem sharing an ongoing conversation with everyone is this audience , but you .
Your quest , as you admit , is to create controversy and that is a waist of my time .
I never said satan was not portrayed by persons .
Hollywood , Broadway and people have done a lot things that I think are offensive .
I said , whether at halloween or on a website depiction of satan is offensive to a Christian .
Most Christians would find it offensive in movies , plays or holloween characters .
But , if you choose to portray satan or anything else that is your choice .
My choice is not to waist my time and breath on such nonsense .
Your second paragraph explains just my point .
You like controversy and seeing how tight you can spin people up .
To me that is a waist of intelligence that could be used for something positive .
But , you get to choose the game you play and I get to choose whether I play .
You have chosen to play a game that has absolutely NO value to me .
Ryan is a good friend and honest in his heart .
You on the other hand are unpredictable and dangerous .
Your desire is to argue and provoke .
My analogy would be the other way around .
You are like the dog that sees a man with a bag over his head .
You could either bite or wet on yourself .
I do want to associate with that kind of person .
You do not have to take anything I say in consideration .
You do not know me nor do I know you .
You choose your path .
If you fall it was your choice .
I will choose my path .
If I fall it was my choice .

danny.warren@earthlink.net
To me is sounds like you 're close to the activities room , or out back in the tool shed .
Or someplace else a long ways from the kitchen .
And you 've installed an intercom system that lets you turn down the volume on what everyone else in the house says , but your volume is turned way up .
And we have a Saint Bernard named " Teeny . "
And I work in a factory that makes candy .
A candy making factory .
And every month I get a paycheck for a million dollars .
And you 're a part time vet .
My game , my rules .
You make a game and we 'll play by your rules .

ART ATTACK : Russian performance art group Voina shakes up the establishment with stunts such as throwing a live cat across the counter at McDonalds .
Carrying bags of stolen groceries , Oleg Vorotnikov takes out the batteries of his mobile phone before entering the secret headquarters of his underground art collective on the outskirts of Moscow .
" This is to prevent the cops from listening in , " said Vorotnikov , a 29 - year - old art graduate , who with other politically conscious artists co-founded the Voina , or War , collective in 2007 .
" Once a drunk artist introduced us to bystanders as ' Russia 's main radical group ' – that 's when I understood that we have to do something together , " Vorotnikov said .
In a country where traditional opposition to the government has been dulled by public apathy and a diet of pro-Kremlin television news , these artists take a different approach : they poke fun at the establishment , and the more absurd the better .
They hunch over laptops in their headquarters – a garage – editing video of their latest piece of guerrilla street theater : an impromptu tea party in a police station .
For the lack of chairs they sit on chests of drawers and a TV set .
Cameras , camcorders and books of poetry are scattered over the floor .
" We always do things that violate rules .
We combine art and politics to achieve something new , " said Kotyonok , a slightly built young woman who teaches physics at a Moscow university and who only gave her nickname , which means kitten .
" People watch us and are simply shocked . "
Voina became a household name in the Russian blogger scene with a stunt intended as a wry commentary on the handover of power – decried by opponents as undemocratic – from former President Vladimir Putin to his successor , Dmitry Medvedev .
A day before the presidential election that Medvedev won by a landslide , five couples , including one heavily pregnant woman who gave birth four days later , secretly undressed in Moscow 's Biological Museum .
With video cameras rolling , they had sex in front of a banner calling for copulation in support of " the bear cub - successor " - a pun on Medvedev 's family name , which is derived from the Russian word for bear .
EVICTED
Blogs carrying photos and videos of the event shot to No 1 in Russian internet rankings within 24 hours .
Some users called the participants " freaks , " " sh–eaters " or " animals . "
One blogger suggested they should be shot .
When the mother of the pregnant woman saw her having sex on television , she threw her out of home .
Voina said they had to leave their old headquarters under pressure from the authorities but few members have yet to face the full weight of the law for their activities .
The group is most vulnerable to the catch - all " hooliganism " charge that could lead to a short prison term , but only one member is currently facing prosecution for throwing cats during one performance .
Voina 's actionist art draws on Moscow Conceptualism , a movement that started in the 1970 with performances subverting socialist ideology .
Given the repressive nature of the Soviet state , these happenings had to take place secretly .
Only when state control over the arts receded during Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika reforms in the 1980s could artists take their events into the public sphere .
In April 1991 members of a group around Anatoly Osmolovsky , a Russian artist , art theorist and curator , lay down on Red Square forming the word " khui , " Russian for cock , with their naked bodies .
Voina members describe the happening as inspiring but add that it would be impossible today in an " authoritarian Russia " where , nevertheless , they have earned the respect of some in the mainstream art scene .
" In the '90s art fell under the influence of a society that was becoming more and more bourgeois : artists happily turned into conformists , " said Andrei Yerofeyev , who until last month was head of modern art procurement at the state - run Tretyakov Gallery .
" Only in the last year a strain of protest art reappeared , one that takes a critical line , reflects , takes a step back and sometimes cynically , sometimes comically , describes what is going on in our society . "
Back in the Voina headquarters the activists scramble around a laptop computer trying to improve the sound of their latest video to make it fit for internet publication .
Shaky images , filmed with a hidden camera the day before Medvedev 's inauguration , show the artists dishing out cream cakes and tea in a police station .
Watched by a stunned officer , they pin Medvedev 's portrait to a wall .
" We invite you to celebrate with us the inauguration of the new president , " one activist can be heard saying .
Attempting to remove the intruders , the officer resorts to verbal abuse .
" We have to fix the sound , you can't hear anything , " said Kotyonok , twitching the dials on the video- editing software .
UNDERGROUND WAKE
In another piece of performance art , the group rigged up a table in a metro carriage , brought out food and vodka and held a wake for absurdist poet Dmitry Prigov .
They also marked international workers ' day by going in to a McDonald 's restaurant and throwing live cats at the counter staff .
The idea , they said , was to help snap the workers out of the dull routine of menial labor .
Behind the bizarre stunts , the artists who make up Voina have a serious political agenda .
" If the authorities say 'we are building a strong state , ' an artist should show that this is not the case .
If they say 'we are improving the lives of the people , ' an artist should show that this is a lie , " said Vorotnikov over dinner , tearing off a hunk of the chicken he earlier stole from a supermarket .
But they say their work is also a journey of self - discovery , to see how far they can push their own boundaries as artists and radicals .
" We hate cops but if we just attacked them like that , they would jail us immediately .
So we hide our hatred behind art so they can't get us and we achieve our aim quicker , " said Kotyonok .
The authorities have dealt harshly with overtly political opposition but to date there has been no sign of a crackdown on Voina .
Acting under the aegis of art protects them to a large extent , she said .
" We 've had sex in public and are no longer scared of it .
We 've invaded a police station and are no longer scared of it .
What else is there to scare us ? , " asked Kotyonok .
" Death we will deal with in the future .
Soon we will be completely fearless . "
The markets are continuing on an unrelenting upward movement since their March 9th lows .
This is a strong rally that has now seen the S&P 500 jump up by 25 percent in the matter of a few weeks !
This kind of market volatility is reserved for highly volatile and troubled markets .
It is a rare occurrence to see this kind of quick burst to the upside in more stable and solid bull markets .
In addition , the rally is being spurred on by “ not so bad ” news while the core economic fundamentals are still horrible .
Take unemployment for example .
This is probably the best indicator of how people and families “ feel ” the actual recession .
The fact that the market is now up 25 percent does very little for the average American family .
Let us take a look at jobless claims :
As you can see from the chart above , jobless claims are moving up on a continual basis .
Unemployment insurance claims are at the highest ever .
On a percentage basis , we are already getting into the 1982 recession territory which signals that this has further to go .
But there is a new mindset making the rounds .
And that is an assumption that the stock market always rebounds and bottoms before the unemployment scene .
This is the case for many previous recessions but that is assuming that this recession is standard and falls in line with those historical trends :
* Source : Zero Hedge
That is n’t always the case necessarily .
Take a look at the above chart which has recessions measured with unemployment and the S&P 500 .
In most cases , it is true that the S&P 500 hits bottom first and unemployment keeps rising before topping out .
Yet this can mean many different things .
We already expect unemployment to be at least 9 percent nationwide and we already know the U - 6 which is a more accurate measure already has unemployment near 15 percent .
So the argument that unemployment is a lagging indicator is true but the way the market is reacting is that the 2nd half of the year will have us in full recovery and assuming this recession is one of your typical bread and butter recessions .
It is not .
This is at levels unseen since the Great Depression and there are many reasons to believe we have yet to see the actual bottom even in stocks .
The market is currently rallying because of :
-$ 1 trillion via the Private Public Investment Program
-$ 700 + Billion Stimulus Program
-$ 700 Billion TARP
-$ 10 + Trillion in commitments to the markets through various programs
Yet the fundamentals are still lagging .
If this plan does n’t work , we have just assured ourselves of a Japanese style decade long stagnation .
The above chart is very telling .
But let us look at the Dow during the Great Depression :
* Source : StockBlogs
This chart helps put things into a nice perspective .
Keep in mind unemployment was extremely low in 1929 , peaked in 1933 and remained high ( +15 % ) until our involvement in World War II in 1941 .
And even though the market rallied off those 1932 lows , it took almost 25 years for the Dow to see that 1929 peak once again .
Are you willing to wait 25 years to see the S&P 500 back up to 1576 or the Dow hitting 14,000 again ?
That is the perspective you need to take .
And we are still in that period where unemployment IS rising .
We have yet to see any peak in that regard .
And it would be too early to say that the 676 S&P 500 of March 9th was the actual low of lows .
Who really knows ?
Yet first quarter earnings are coming out soon and with the mark to market accounting being eased , we can expect some major fudging to go around .
So we may see companies firing people left and right yet earnings will somehow be mysteriously good .
Keep an eye on the fundamentals .
This time is different .

Twitch started in 2007 as a 24 - hour live stream of co-founder Justin Kan ’s life ( he coined the term “ lifecasting ” ) called Justin.tv , but it became very clear very quickly that live gaming content was more popular than pretty much anything else .
In 2011 , Twitch spun off gaming - centric channels as Twitch.tv , and it grew exponentially as online games and the technology to broadcast them live on the internet became more widespread and popular .
Amazon is known today not just as the everything store , but as the creator of Alexa , one of the most pervasive digital voice assistants on the market today .
As an extension of Alexa , Amazon has become more than just a seller of other people ’s products .
It ’s now a hardware maker ( Fire Phone aside ) , having embarked on its boldest product play since the original Kindle when it decided to develop its own line of smart speakers to house its artificial intelligence software .
Once again , the division responsible for this piece of hardware was Lab126 , Amazon ’s hardware arm that gave it the tools to dominate the e-reader market nearly a decade prior .
Although the company did raise the minimum wage for all of its employees earlier this month , it ’s plowing ahead on warehouse robotics and automation in a way that could fundamentally reshape how its lowest - paid employees perform work — and how many of those employees it needs to retain .
Amazon now uses more than 100,000 robots in warehouses around the world to help move and organize products , according to The New York Times , and it also sponsors an annual robotics competition to help spur innovation in AI that could result in more dexterous and intelligent robots capable of performing complex physical tasks .
Amazon Studios , which was founded in 2010 to compete with Hulu and Netflix in original programming , has become a powerhouse in Hollywood , taking home both Emmys and Oscars and growing into a staple of the modern entertainment diet of many Americans .
Rounding out its position in digital media is the FireTV streaming device , which Amazon first launched in 2014 to compete with Apple , Roku , and other set - top box makers .
The product has since been shrunk into a skinny HDMI stick —
Amazon still sells the box and now also a small , square - shaped Fire TV Cube — and it remains one of the best - selling consumer electronics devices on Amazon.com .
On May 5 , 2014 , Amazon unveiled a partnership with Twitter .
Twitter users can link their accounts to an Amazon account and automatically add items to their shopping carts by responding to any tweet with an Amazon product link bearing the hashtag # AmazonCart .
This allows customers to never leave their Twitter feed and the product is waiting for them when they go to the Amazon website . [ 146 ]

Honey ’s Parsi says that for their users , spending peaked at 4 p.m. PST in Los Angeles and 11 p.m. EST in New York City last year .
“ On Cyber Monday , there is less pressure to get an early start because retailers are often better stocked online , where they store items in large warehouses — not on shop shelves with limited space — and can ship items from different locations to make up for shortfalls , ” Palmer agrees .
“ Plus , many Cyber Monday sales actually start on Sunday . ”

do n’t use @import
In Chapter 5 of High Performance Web Sites , I briefly mention that @import has a negative impact on web page performance .
I dug into this deeper for my talk at Web 2.0 Expo , creating several test pages and HTTP waterfall charts , all shown below .
The bottomline is : use LINK instead of @import if you want stylesheets to download in parallel resulting in a faster page .
LINK vs. @import
There are two ways to include a stylesheet in your web page .
You can use the LINK tag :
< link rel= ' stylesheet ' href= 'a.css '>
Or you can use the @import rule :
< style > @import url ( 'a.css ' ) ; </ style >
I prefer using LINK for simplicity — you have to remember to put @import at the top of the style block or else it wo n’t work .
It turns out that avoiding @import is better for performance , too .
@import @import
I ’m going to walk through the different ways LINK and @import can be used .
In these examples , there are two stylesheets : a.css and b.css .
Each stylesheet is configured to take two seconds to download to make it easier to see the performance impact .
The first example uses @import to pull in these two stylesheets .
In this example , called @import @import , the HTML document contains the following style block :
< style > @import url ( ' a.css ' ) ; @import url ( ' b.css ' ) ; </ style >
If you always use @import in this way , there are no performance problems , although we ’ll see below it could result in JavaScript errors due to race conditions .
The two stylesheets are downloaded in parallel , as shown in Figure 1 .
( The first tiny request is the HTML document . )
The problems arise when @import is embedded in other stylesheets or is used in combination with LINK .
LINK @import
The LINK @import example uses LINK for a.css , and @import for b.css :
< link rel=' stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='a.css '> < style > @import url ( 'b.css ' ) ; </ style >
In IE ( tested on 6 , 7 , and 8 ) , this causes the stylesheets to be downloaded sequentially , as shown in Figure 2 .
Downloading resources in parallel is key to a faster page .
As shown here , this behavior in IE causes the page to take a longer time to finish .
LINK with @import
In the LINK with @import example , a.css is inserted using LINK , and a.css has an @import rule to pull in b.css :
in the HTML document :
< link rel=' stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href= 'a.css '>
in a.css :
@import url ( 'b.css ' ) ;
This pattern also prevents the stylesheets from loading in parallel , but this time it happens on all browsers .
When we stop and think about it , we should n’t be too surprised .
The browser has to download a.css and parse it .
At that point , the browser sees the @import rule and starts to fetch b.css .
LINK blocks @import
A slight variation on the previous example with surprising results in IE : LINK is used for a.css and for a new stylesheet called proxy.css .
proxy.css is configured to return immediately ; it contains an @import rule for b.css .
in the HTML document :
< link rel=' stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='a.css '> < link rel='stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='proxy.css '>
in proxy.css :
@import url ( 'b.css ' ) ;
The results of this example in IE , LINK blocks @import , are shown in Figure 4 .
The first request is the HTML document .
The second request is a.css ( two seconds ) .
The third ( tiny ) request is proxy.css .
The fourth request is b.css ( two seconds ) .
Surprisingly , IE wo n’t start downloading b.css until a.css finishes .
In all other browsers , this blocking issue does n’t occur , resulting in a faster page as shown in Figure 5 .
many @imports
The many @imports example shows that using @import in IE causes resources to be downloaded in a different order than specified .
This example has six stylesheets ( each takes two seconds to download ) followed by a script ( a four second download ) .
< style > @import url ( ' a.css ' ) ; @import url ( ' b.css ' ) ; @import url ( 'c.css ' ) ; @import url ( ' d.css ' ) ; @import url ( 'e.css ' ) ; @import url ( ' f.css ' ) ; </style > < script src='one.js ' type='text/javascript '></ script>
Looking at Figure 6 , the longest bar is the four second script .
Even though it was listed last , it gets downloaded first in IE .
If the script contains code that depends on the styles applied from the stylesheets ( a la getElements ByClassName , etc. ) , then unexpected results may occur because the script is loaded before the stylesheets , despite the developer listing it last .
LINK LINK
It ’s simpler and safer to use LINK to pull in stylesheets :
< link rel=' stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='a.css '> < link rel='stylesheet ' type='text/css ' href='b.css '>
Using LINK ensures that stylesheets will be downloaded in parallel across all browsers .
The LINK LINK example demonstrates this , as shown in Figure 7 .
Using LINK also guarantees resources are downloaded in the order specified by the developer .
These issues need to be addressed in IE .
It ’s especially bad that resources can end up getting downloaded in a different order .
All browsers should implement a small lookahead when downloading stylesheets to extract any @import rules and start those downloads immediately .
Until browsers make these changes , I recommend avoiding @import and instead using LINK for inserting stylesheets .
Update : April 10 , 2009 1:07 PM
Based on questions from the comments , I added two more tests : LINK with @imports and Many LINKs .
Each of these insert four stylesheets into the HTML document .
LINK with @imports uses LINK to load proxy.css ; proxy.css then uses @import to load the four stylesheets .
Many LINKs has four LINK tags in the HTML document to pull in the four stylesheets ( my recommended approach ) .
The HTTP waterfall charts are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 .
Looking at LINK with @imports , the first problem is that the four stylesheets do n’t start downloading until after proxy.css returns .
This happens in all browsers .
On the other hand , Many LINKs starts downloading the stylesheets immediately .
The second problem is that IE changes the download order .
I added a 10 second script ( the really long bar ) at the very bottom of the page .
In all other browsers , the @import stylesheets ( from proxy.css ) get downloaded first , and the script is last , exactly the order specified .
In IE , however , the script gets inserted before the @import stylesheets , as shown by LINK with @imports in Figure 8 .
This causes the stylesheets to take longer to download since the long script is using up one of only two connections available in IE 6&7 .
Since IE wo n’t render anything in the page until all stylesheets are downloaded , using @import in this way causes the page to be blank for 12 seconds .
Using LINK instead of @import preserves the load order , as shown by Many LINKs in Figure 9 .
Thus , the page renders in 4 seconds .
The load times of these resources are exaggerated to make it easy to see what ’s happening .
But for people with slow connections , especially those in some of the world ’s emerging markets , these response times may not be that far from reality .
The takeaways are :
Visteon employs 600 people across three plants in the United Kingdom Employees are continuing their protest at a factory in west Belfast .
More than 100 workers have staged a sit-in , the Unite trade union has said .
Earlier , it was announced that 565 staff would go at Visteon car components plants across the UK .
Most of the jobs have been lost with immediate effect .
Two hundred jobs will go at the Belfast factory .
KPMG said it had no alternative but to close the factory and two others in Basildon and Enfield in England .
Administrators have been called in to the factory which is the former Ford plant .
Visteon has a total workforce of 600 in the United Kingdom .
Unite convenor John Maguire said the workers at the plant had " been treated disgracefully " .
" We have been left with no choice but to occupy the factory to save our jobs and to defend jobs for the people of Belfast , " he said .
Ford have a moral responsibility to these people and they are avoiding any responsibility
Davy McMurray
Unite trade union
The company in the UK had been waiting to hear if Visteon in America would continue to prop up its three plants .
West Belfast MP Gerry Adams expressed his " deep disappointment " .
" Sinn Féin has been liaising closely with the management of Visteon and with the local workforce .
" Ford are directly implicated in the future of the Belfast plant , as its sole customer and former owner .
If the local workforce is to be told that the plant no longer has a future , Sinn Féin will insist that the management of Ford explain this fate , " he said .
Davy McMurray , regional organiser for Unite , said he understood that a handful of workers would be kept on to run the plant down before they too lose their jobs .
Mr McMurray said the way the job cuts were announced was " brutal . "
" The administrators just came in , told them they were in administration and their employment was terminated .
These people are going to be put out on the street tonight . "
He called on Ford , as the " sole recipient " of Visteon parts , to show generosity .
' Body blow '
" Ford have a moral responsibility to these people and they are avoiding any responsibility , " he said .
He added that they should receive Ford redundancy packages . "
Ford is the sole customer and former owner of the Visteon plant SDLP MLA for west Belfast Alex Attwood said it is a " body blow to the area " .
" The loss of 210 jobs , part of our much needed manufacturing base , is not the news we want to hear , " he said .
Visteon took over the Ford plant in west Belfast in 2000 .
It said the remaining employees would assist the administrators in " the orderly wind down of the business " .
It added that the UK business had not been profitable " since its incorporation in 2000 " and Visteon UK 's reported losses totalled £ 669 m .
John Hansen , joint administrator , said : " The entire automotive supply chain has been under pressure for a number of years . "

“ Connectivity is poverty ” was how a friend of mine summarized Sterling ’s bold theme .
Only the poor — defined broadly as those without better options — are obsessed with their connections .
Anyone with a strong soul or a fat wallet turns his ringer off for good and cultivates private gardens that keep the hectic Web far away .
The man of leisure , Sterling suggested , savors solitude , or intimacy with friends , presumably surrounded by books and film and paintings and wine and vinyl — original things that stay where they are and cannot be copied and corrupted and shot around the globe with a few clicks of a keyboard .
Nice , right ?
The implications of Sterling ’s idea are painful for Twitter types .
The connections that feel like wealth to many of us — call us the impoverished , we who treasure our smartphones and tally our Facebook friends — are in fact meager , more meager even than inflated dollars .
What ’s worse , these connections are liabilities that we pretend are assets .
We live on the Web in these hideous conditions of overcrowding only because — it suddenly seems so obvious — we ca n’t afford privacy .
And then , lest we confront our horror , we call this cramped ghetto our happy home !

Twitter is no longer new .
It ’s nearly three years old .
Early enthusiasts who used it for barhopping bulletins have cooled on it .
Corporations , institutions and public - relations firms now tweet like maniacs .
Google has been rumored to be interested in buying the company .
The “ ambient awareness ” that Twitter promotes — the feeling of incessant online contact — is still intact .
But the emotional force of all this contact may have changed in the context of the economic collapse .
Where once it was “ hypnotic ” and “ mesmerizing ” ( words often used to describe Twitter ) to read about a friend ’s fever or a cousin ’s job complaints , today the same kind of posts , and from broader and broader audiences , seem . . . threatening .
Encroaching .
Suffocating .
Twitter may now be like a jampacked , polluted city where the ambient awareness we all have of one another ’s bodies might seem picturesque to sociologists ( who coined “ ambient awareness ” to describe this sense of physical proximity ) but has become stifling to those in the middle of it .
A typical hour on my Twitter account , which I use to follow the updates of about 250 people , has some wonderfully cryptic tweets from Murray Hill , a drag - king entertainer , and Touré , the novelist and critic , alongside some less - inspired posts from P.R. people and cultural institutions trying to pass as normal Twitterers .
I myself mostly post links to this column , hoping that the self - promotion is transparent enough that people can easily ignore a link or click it if they ’re curious .
But do n’t get me wrong : I ’m also just shouting my name the livelong June to a subscribing bog .
RWE - " Kreativagentur " droht Atomkraftgegnern mit " geistigen Eigentumsrechten " Peter Muehlbauer
Anlass ist die Grafik " Der hohe Preis bleibt " , in der eine Werbekampagne persifliert wird
Werbespots eignen sich potentiell gut für Parodien .
Das liegt zu einem
Teil daran , dass sich die in ihnen getroffenen Behauptungen mit Gegebenheiten in der Realität konfrontieren lassen .
Einen solchen Aufhänger nutzten auch zwei atomstromkritische Gruppen .
In der RWE - Kampagne " Der Preis bleibt " werben drei ausgemottete Deutschrockstars mit einem Song und T - Shirts für das Angebot " ProKlima " , mit dem der Konzern nach Ansicht von Kritikern Atomstrom überteuert als Ökostrom verkauft .
Die Vereine urgewald und .ausgestrahlt parodierten diese Kampagne auf eine denkbar einfache und doch extrem effektive Weise : Sie machten aus " Der Preis bleibt " den neuen Slogan " Der hohe Preis bleibt " .
Verbreitet wurde er mittels einer Grafik , auf der auch Karrikaturen der Musiker zu sehen sind , die statt dreier Jahreszahlen die Wörter " teuer " , " gefährlich " und " dreckig " auf ihren Hemden stehen haben .
Daraufhin erhielten die Schöpfer des neuen Slogans ein Schreiben der " Kreativagentur " Jung von Matt , die sich die RWE - Kampagne ausdachte .
In den 1980er Jahren hätte solche ein Schreiben wahrscheinlich ein hochdotiertes Stellenangebot für die frischen Talente enthalten , die mit so wenig Aufwand einen so wirksamen Effekt erzielten .
Doch seither hat sich offenbar auch in der Werbebranche viel geändert - und so enthielt der Brief lediglich die Aufforderung zur Abgabe einer Unterlassungserklärung , weil die Agentur ihre " geistigen Eigentumsrechte " verletzt sieht .
Würde die Unterlassungserklärung nicht fristgerecht abgegeben , dann , so die RWE - Werber , wolle man die Atomkraftgegner nicht nur zivilrechtlich verklagen , sondern sogar Strafanzeige erstatten .
Die so bedrohten vermuten hinter den Aktivitäten der Agentur jedoch weniger verletzte Künstlerseelen , als ein Anliegen des Auftraggebers : " Es ist offensichtlich " , so Heffa Schücking , die Geschäftsführerin von urgewald , in einer Pressemitteilung , " dass hier die Meinungsfreiheit eingeschränkt und wichtige Kritiker des Konzerns eingeschüchtert werden sollen . "
Der Aufforderung der " Kreativagentur " werde man deshalb nicht nachkommen .

Awesome !
Hand transplants are eventually “ accepted ” by the brain , a study shows , raising the prospect of full movement being recovered .
Surprisingly , it seems that in right - handed people , the left hand is accepted sooner .
The motor cortex – the part of the brain responsible for muscular movement – maintains a physical map of the body , with different areas registering sensations in different body parts .
When the brain is deprived of sensory input from a limb , such as after a hand amputation , that region goes unused .
To stop prime real estate going to waste , the brain rewires itself , with areas representing the face and upper arm “ creeping in ” to take over the region formerly dominated by the hand .
To find out if a transplanted hand can reclaim these brain regions , Angela Sirigu and colleagues at the Institute for Cognitive Science in Lyon , France , used magnetic pulses to stimulate these areas in two people who had undergone double hand transplants .
They found that muscles in the new hands responded to the stimulation , suggesting that the brain had fully accepted them .
Previous research had shown that stroking a transplanted hand triggered brain activity in the same region as in non-amputees , but this is the first demonstration that the hand muscles are actually represented in the brain .
“ We can see the brain directly activating the new transplanted muscles , ” says Sirigu .

Head start
In both patients , the left hand was quicker to get this space back – and regain movement – than the right .
In one case , the left hand re-acquired a significant “ presence ” in the brain after 10 months ; the right hand took 26 months .
One explanation , say the researchers , is the varying flexibility of the brain regions responsible for each hand .
They believe that because both subjects were right - handed , the brain regions dominated by the right hand were more active prior to amputation and therefore not as flexible to rearrangement .
In contrast , the areas corresponding to the left hand were commandeered to a greater extent by other body parts .
This may have led to greater flexibility in the left - hand region , Sirigu says , allowing signals from the transplanted left hand to be integrated faster .
Amputees waiting for a transplant should still use prosthetic limbs , though .
Before the transplant , both patients had prosthetics , which Sirigu believes helped to keep the original brain representation of the hand alive .
“ Prosthesis reduces the chronic pain experienced by patients so we ca n’t ask them to go without , ” she says .

Past few days have been for the most part uneventful .
I think the most entertainment I had was flying my cov-ops 30 jumps through 0.0 to meet up with a corp mate .
He was wanting to get his Dominix class battleship out of the w - system ... but the only exit they were finding was deep in AAA territory .
So I hopped in the trusty frigate , Dare U2 Blink , and headed out .
It was around 65 jumps from my nearest clone and again , roughly 30 of that through nullsec .
I had no problems getting to him and fortunately , most of the trip was quiet .
We really had no confrontations up until the last system , HED - GP .
This is the last 0.0 system in the Catch region before you jump straight into high security space in the Khanid region .
As expected , it was a very busy , and very heavily camped system .
My corpmate however was already feeling a bit frisky .
He was bored out of his mind in the w - system and really wanted out so it had been either pod himself , make a suicide run through nullsec in his battleship , or chance the possibility of actually making it all the way to empire with me scouting .
Given he 'd almost gone with one of the first two choices , he did n't really care too much if he lost his ship .
And then again , he was given the nickname " Leroy " by the corp directors ....
Anyway ... jumping into HED , I initially saw a Crow interceptor as well as a Rook on my overview .
Fortunately , the bubble nearby was set up to snare anybody that escaped the camp at the high sec gate , so I was well out of its reach .
I shoved the ships engines into gear and hit the cloak before aligning to a planet and punching the warp to 0 button .
Not the smartest thing I realize but I was in a jump clone , in a ship I 'd bought with full expectation of losing and little care for my own life .
As I exited warp at the planet , I was a tad shocked to see I 'd landed right at the edge of another warp bubble .
These guys certainly were n't playing any games !
It 's fortunate my cloak held , because it was only a second after I exited warp , the crow exited about 4 km off my starboard .
Seems
I 'd aligned perhaps a bit too soon and given away my direction .
Ah well .
I burned away from the bubble and warped back to the safe spot I 'd created immediately after entering warp from the gate .
From this point , it became a waiting game .
For some time , my corp mate sat in the emptiness of space at his own safe spot a short distance away from the gate in the other system .
In the meantime , I spammed the scanner , keeping an eye on any ships coming and going at the gate from my side .
The system was fairly small so it had n't taken me long to realize the situation we were in .
Sitting at the gate to high sec were about 20 interceptors and a handful of slightly heavier hitters .
This was going to be difficult .
Trying to get a battleship through the gate and into warp before the interceptors could arrive and lock him down .... oye vay !
The timing had to be just right .
Believe it or not that moment came when I believe someone else somehow got past their camp and they 'd all rushed to the gate I was sitting near to , hoping to catch their prey .
Whether they killed it or not I do n't know or if that was n't the case , why they 'd come rushing to the gate in the first place I just do n't know .
Either way , they all lingered at the gate for a bit before they finally one by one went back to their original camp .
At this point , all I could pick up on my own scanner was the Rook and one interceptor towards the direction of the gate .
This time , I decided to move in for a closer look and warped in to the gate at 100 km cloaked .
Surprisingly , all that was actually there was the rook !
The interceptor must be sitting just off grid somewhere .... but it appeared to be just the window we needed .
Quickly , I punched the comm button and ordered my mate into action .
" Go ! Now !
Now !
Now , " I nearly screamed into the comm , knowing this might be his best chance .
Within moments he was jumping in , immediately breaking gate cloak to align for a warp out .
Of course , only a moment after his arrival , the interceptor appeared but he was too far and too late .
Before it could get a scram on him , my mate was in warp , his ship disappearing into the distance .
The interceptor immediately gave chase and I do n't know how my corp mate did it but after going to a planet himself , he was able to turn his ship about and get back into warp barely half a second before the interceptor landed at his location .
So with nerves still on fire , I took a moment to calm myself and him as well before making my way to the exit gate for part two .
It seemed luck was still on our side though .
Amongst all the wreckage the interceptor wolf pack had created ( and believe me there was a lot of it ) , not a single warp bubble was still in place .
To top it all off , the pack of interceptors had moved off for some reason or other , leaving the entire gate clear !
Once again , I urged my companion into warp and within moments he landed at the gate , quickly activating it and with a poof of light , he was free .
So .... strike one up for good scouting on my part , good reaction time on my battleship flying corp mate , a little bit of luck or .... well ... possibly just some horrible AAA interceptor pilots .

Believe it or not , a third person has been ticketed for cursing in public in Galveston County .
First it was Kathryn Fridge , arrested for dropping an F - bomb in a La Marque Wal - Mart .
Then it was the guy from Queens , ticketed for talking like a guy from Queens , in a Galveston diner .
Now it 's a Texas City man , who neighbors say constantly " used the S - word " in discussing how he did n't like their cats defecating in his yard .
Joesph Loflin was cited for disorderly conduct by Texas City police after the dispute , the Galveston County Daily News reports .
Loflin , a former cop , says he 's baffled and was n't shouting during the exchange .
The neighbor -- who happens to deliver papers for the News -- says Loflin kept using the word , even though the neighbor 's 13 - year - old daughter was present .
Apparently the two neighbors have been feuding for a while .
Loflin is demanding his day in court .
" I was a cop seven years , with the Galveston County Sheriff 's Office and College of the Mainland , and I would have never written that stupid ticket , " Loflin told the News .
That 's " stupid fucking ticket , " Loflin .

In Asia , the OpenSUSE community invited to the party in Bandung , Indonesia which included several presentations .
South America saw several events in major cities such as Buenos Aires , Salvador and São Paulo .
North American KDEers got together in the Washington DC area at Piratz Tavern with some familiar faces from the local LUG and Ubuntu Loco communities and also several new faces .
Piratz and ninjas alike had a good time drinking grog , singing pirate songs , and passing around laptops with the latest and greatest .
Many events were hosted in Europe , the biggest one taking place in Ljubljana , Slovenia .
Not far from there , the FSFE occupied the Metalab in Vienna , Austria .
Both Denmark and Norway had parties in their respective capitals , one of them with a slightly higher number of Trolls .
In Spain , the folks in Barcelona met up .
Germany had a bunch of parties as well , for example in Stuttgart , also co-located with an FSFE meeting and attracting about 40 people and presentations on e.g. the new Amarok .
In Frankfurt , people met close to the KDE e.V. office with a mix of current and potential future contributors .

CONCORD — Medical marijuana advocates urged a New Hampshire Senate committee Tuesday to allow residents with crippling ailments to use small amounts of the drug , saying such legislation would show compassion to the severely ill .
CONCORD — Medical marijuana advocates urged a New Hampshire Senate committee Tuesday to allow residents with crippling ailments to use small amounts of the drug , saying such legislation would show compassion to the severely ill .
" What they 're asking from us is , ' Please do n't treat us as criminals .
Treat us as patients , ' " said Nashua Rep. Cindy Rosenwald .
Rosenwald , chairwoman of the House Health , Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee , helped win the bill 's passage last month in the House .
Portsmouth Sen. Martha Fuller Clark told her colleagues that passing the legislation would show that lawmakers are empathetic to residents who are suffering in pain .
But critics — mostly law enforcement — blasted the idea as unworkable because it carves out an exception in the criminal statute which will invite abuse and be difficult to regulate .
State Police Maj .
Russell Conte said deciding who legally possessed marijuana in the allowable amounts would be difficult to determine at a traffic stop .
" I 'm not here to say people who are sick and dying are criminals , " he said .
The bill would allow severely ill patients or their caregivers to grow and possess six marijuana plants , six seeds and two ounces of the drug .
It requires doctors to certify a patient has a debilitating medical condition and would benefit from the therapeutic or palliative benefit from using marijuana .
Only patients in constant pain , having seizures or severe , persistent muscle spasms or having severe nausea or vomiting and who are n't helped by legal medications for at least three months would qualify for the drug .
Opponents pointed out that growing , possessing and using the drug would still be illegal under other state and federal laws .
" This bill is a stealth drug legalization measure , " said Assistant Attorney General Karin Eckel .
Lancaster Rep. Evalyn Merrick , a Democrat and the lead sponsor , acknowledged that patients would have no legal way to buy marijuana under terms of the bill .
She said they would have to get the drug from other patients , family members or dealers until the state opted to regulate distribution .
Merrick said she has multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer , and used marijuana to quell queasiness from chemotherapy in 2002 .
Thirteen states now allow medical marijuana use .
Federal drug agents have raided dozens of medical marijuana dispensaries , mainly in California .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that the Obama administration would end such raids .
" Simply allowing patients to grow a few plants in their closets is not going to invoke the wrath of the federal government , " said Matt Simon , executive director of the New Hampshire Coalition for Common Sense Marijuana Policy .
The Senate could vote on the bill before the end of the month .
Gov. John Lynch has only said he has concerns about it .
The highly detailed satellite images provided by Google Earth opened a unique window on the world when it was launched in 2005 , one that proved all too enticing for roofer Tom Berge ; he used the website to hunt down a fortune in scrap metal on the roofs of historic buildings near his home in London .
Berge , 27 , stole lead worth £ 100,000 from schools , churches , museums and other large buildings during a six - month spree that began in September last year .
He used the website to identify the lead roofs by their darker colour .
He was sentenced to eight months in prison – suspended for two years – after confessing to more than 30 offences .
" The properties hit included Sutton High School for Girls and the Honeywood museum , Carshalton , where £ 10,000 - worth of lead was removed from the roof of each building , " said a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police .
" Another building hit was Croydon parish church where the theft of lead from its roof let in the rain and caused extensive damage . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sutton magistrates court was told that Berge , of Rosehill , Sutton , would meticulously plan each raid .
Last summer , scrap lead was worth about £ 700 a tonne , although that has since slumped to £ 350 because of falling demand in the construction industry .
Berge and his accomplices used ladders and abseiling ropes to strip the roofs and took the lead away in a stolen vehicle .
But he was stopped by police and later confessed .
Detective Sergeant Chris Grant said Berge 's arrest had had a noticeable effect on crime in the area .
" He was a prolific offender up until the time he was arrested .
Since then , our crime figures for theft of lead have reduced significantly . "
Acoustic gunshot detectors have become common in the past few years , and some have been reduced in size to where a single soldier can wear one on his uniform and be cued - in to an enemy 's location as soon as he fires .
Engineers in Tennessee , however , are touting the idea of tieing a unit of footsoldiers ' acoustic shot - spot sensors together in a wireless net .
They think this would offer several benefits : the system would n't be confused by echoes or multiple enemies firing at once , and it would be able to locate gunmen who were n't in line - of - sight from an individual soldier .
Perhaps even more impressively , the networked sonic system is able to distinguish the calibre of weapons fired , and even in some cases identify different weapons firing the same kind of ammunition .
Vanderbilt University 's inhouse Exploration mag reported last week on the gunshot - locator net developed by the uni's Institute for Software Integrated Systems ( ISIS ) .
It involves mounting a small electronics package on each soldier 's helmet , running on four AA batteries .
In each package is a wireless network node , of a type dubbed a " smart - dust mote " for its small size and cheapness .
There are also four separated microphones , for picking up the acoustic signatures of flying bullets , and a GPS satnav location system .
The GPS is n't accurate enough to act as a basis for properly pinning down opposing gunmen , so the Vanderbilt boffins added a crafty radio interferometry enhancement system of their own - apparently of such cunning that it has attracted as much interest as the rest of the system on its own .
The system works by picking up the distinctive conical shockwave trailing behind a passing supersonic bullet - the same phenomenon which produces a sonic boom behind a plane at Mach 1 + .
This is then related to the muzzle blast from the weapon which fired it , trailing slightly behind ( the two noises are heard by people under fire as " crack - thud " , or " crack - bang " ) .
A software algorithm in the unit can work out a range and bearing to the enemy weapon 's muzzle .
So far , so ordinary : a system much like the Qinetiq - America " Ears " or others already under trial with US forces .
But then various special sauces developed by ISIS prof Akos Ledeczi and his team kick in .
All the smart - dust node hats in the squad or platoon net pass their information back and forth , and a special patented filter strips out false muzzle - blast reports - the great bugbear of such technology .
The supersonic bullet - booms are very distinctive , it seems , but the muzzle blasts are much harder to distinguish from random banging sounds or echoes - especially with lots of guns firing at once in a built - up area .
As every node has a good idea exactly where it is , owing to its embedded radio - interferometry - enhanced GPS , the combined reports can thus be boiled down to locate all the guns firing nearby within a metre or two - enough to pinpoint which window , corner or whatever each enemy is shooting from .
Apparently it still works even in the case of crafty snipers lurking well back from windows - the usual method favoured by the pros .
Nor is the system bothered by guns firing out of line of sight - hidden behind walls or buildings or whatever .
Funny homeless signs
Being homeless is definitely not funny , but some of those poor people still have sense of humor .
Here are 10 memorable homeless pictures with some you probably have n’t seen .
Can you imagine how unhealthy we'd be if we did n't have large organizations spending millions on public health campaigns ?
If we did n't have them to herd us around with their slogans and posters , our lives would be a nightmare of illicit drugs and bad choices .
5 The D.A.R.E. Program May Increase Drug Use
Damn near every school kid in the United States has been forced to sit through the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program ( D.A.R.E. ) at least once .
Good ol ' Officer Friendly shows up once a month or so and leads the class through obnoxious skits intended to give them an idea what peer pressure is like and how to avoid it .
Spoiler alert !
You avoid it by just saying " no ! "

Apparently , that works for everything from drugs to unwanted sexual advances to strong - armed robbery .
But it 's more than just saying no , the program aims to equip young people with " creative " ways by which to say it .
For the record , we generally incorporate some sort of interpretive dance when we spurn unwanted offers of sex and drugs .
But we do n't dance that often , if you know what we mean , ladies .
On the surface , encouraging kids to say no to drugs seems like a fine idea .
What could go wrong ?
Whoops !
It would be hard to actually know how well a program like D.A.R.E. was working unless you , say , kept track of a thousand or so kids who went through the program and then caught up with them 10 years later .
So that 's exactly what some people did .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Two separate studies , the results of which were prominently reported by TIME , indicated that at the very least D.A.R.E. was ineffective , but at its worst actually pushed kids toward drug use and lowered self esteem .
Researchers suspect that the overstated , " peer pressure is around every corner , because EVERYONE IS DOING DRUGS BUT YOU ! " message made some kids actually want to get high as a way of fitting in .
If everyone else is doing it , why should n't they ?
Look at you , just saying no to drugs , and friends , and a well - adjusted childhood .
The studies argued that the program 's use of " drugs are everywhere , fucking run ! " type of messages amounted to hyperbole , and kids do n't like hyperbole .
All it takes is the kid having one drug - using friend for him to recognize that , no , a single bong hit can't make your brain go running out of your ears like strawberry jam .
And if that part is wrong , hell , maybe the whole thing is .

Bilderberg will continue to push for world government at the May 14 - 19 secret meeting in Vouliagmeni , Greece , according to a participant .
Alice Rivlin , who has represented the Brookings Institution at Bilderberg , smiled and nodded when asked if the agenda this year includes “ world government , a world without borders and an American Union . ”
These have been Bilderberg goals for many years but have been blocked by what participants refer to sneeringly as “ nationalism . ”
Bilderberg intends to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement throughout the Western Hemisphere as a prelude to establishing an “ American Union ” similar to the European Union .
The ultimate goal is a world government under the UN .
Her greatest Bilderberg thrill ?
“ Sitting next to the queen , ” she replied , referring to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In a separate Bilderberg development , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tripped over his mouth and let the truth escape while addressing the Council on Foreign Relations in New York .
The CFR is heavily represented at Bilderberg meetings .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Geithner expressed support for a proposal to replace the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency with a basket of currencies that would be managed by the Inter – national Monetary Fund .
“ We ’re actually quite open to that , ” he said .
Publicly , both Geithner and President Obama say they are opposed to the idea .

Vinh Moc Tunnel ( Địa đạo Vĩnh Mốc ) – an underground miniaturized village – is the largest historical tunnel in the DMZ of Vietnam .
Deep beneath the dark earth , hidden from screeching bombers and harbouring desperate soldiers , the people of Vinh Linh , Quang Tri lived for many years in the now famous Vinh Moc Tunnel .
They survived , and even prospered in their makeshift underground community .
During that time , 17 children were born in the tunnels , each of whose lives is a testament to just how perfect the complex network of caves and warrens were at protecting those forces within .
As time goes by , it has become both a historical evidence and a tourist destination for discovering a heroic period of Vietnam ’s history .
Where is Vinh Moc Tunnel Located ?
The DMZ ( a tunnel complex of Vietnam ) , lies on the south of China Sea , north of Ben Hai River .
Within this complex , Vinh Moc tunnel is located in Vinh Moc , Vinh Thach Commune , Vinh Linh District , Quang Tri Province .
The complex in Vinh Linh has as many as more than 60 tunnels such as Tan My , Mu Giai , Tan Ly tunnels , among which Vinh Moc is the most solid and firm village tunnel , with 3 floors and round staircase , still remaining as in its past days .
Geographical Features of Vinh Tunnel Gate

The tunnel soil is a dense clay , allowing easy hands digging of the tunnels .
Air caused the clay to harden , making the walls extremely strong .
The tunnel network ’s total length is nearly 2 km , structured into three floors with the first 13 m beneath the ground , the second 15 m , and the third , 23 m .
The village tunnel was built in over two years and required approximately 6,000 cubic metres of earth to be dug out .
The main inner axis is 2,034 m long , 1 - 1.2 m wide , and 1.5 - 4.1 m high .
The two side cliffs are moulded into small temporary houses every 3 m .
The tunnel center has a 150 seated hall , clinics and maternity place .
It is linked to the sea by seven exits , which also function as ventilators , and to a nearby hill by another six .
History of Vinh Moc Tunnel
Those known of Vietnam ’s heroic historical war must have some understanding of the tunnel network in Quang Tri citadel – a witness of the severe war .
The Vinh Moc spectacular tunnel network within the zone stands as a testament to the endurance , wisdom and bravery of the local people in their fight for independence .

The Vinh Moc tunnel complex was built to shelter the people of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of Quang Tri Province .
It was constructed in several stages , beginning in 1966 and coming into use until 1971 .
The complex grew to consist of wells , kitchens , rooms for each family and clinics .
Around 60 families lived in the tunnels ; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels as well .
Finally , the tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives thanks to them .
The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode , the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft .

1. Historical Name
“ Their real name is Son Vinh Tunnels , ” one designer witnessing this said , “ From the very beginning we called it Son Vinh tunnels .
Son means mountain and Vinh not only refers to Vinh Moc , but to the Vinh Linh people .
The people of Son Trung and Son Ha communes and the men of border - post also helped build the tunnels . ”
Ten years after the war had ended , I heard that the Vinh Moc Tunnels were opened to tourists .
Arriving at the tunnels tourists always put their hands on the wooden planks to feel how cold they were .
These days , the government is striving to preserve their existence .
2. Historical Story
In the mid-1960s , the area was a burnt and blackened wasteland , constantly under attack from the US .
During a meeting of the local Vietnamese soldiers to discuss on how to stop all the constant casualties and protect the community better , some put forth the idea of moving the people underground .
For them , it would be meaningless if the local people could not be protected since without the people their post would cease to exist .
After the meeting , an initial plan to construct a U - shaped tunnel on the seaside cliff was put forward .
The US had not yet begun using the infamous B - 52 bombers at Vinh Linh , but it was only a matter of time .
As the plan manifested , the soldiers followed up with two A - shaped tunnels , connecting them with the U - turn and forming a connected chain of tunnels and bomb shelters .
This initial network also acted as a base to retaliate against the enemy if they landed at Vinh Linh and conveniently as an entry point for supplies to the Con Co Island nearby .
Yet , of course it was n’t that simple .
The tunnels needed 5 m - deep ventilation openings , and as the community within expanded , they had to develop wells , kitchens , bedrooms and health - stations .
The tunnels also had to store provisions for the army and locals , and had to be able to house as well as transport hundreds of tonnes of rice .
The tunnels are not just famous for the uniqueness of the constructors ’ endeavor , but for the meticulous ingenuity of their design .
All the kitchens required chimneys , which had to be able to disperse their smoke without attracting enemy planes , no easy feat for a designer who was trying to fight a war .
Architecture of Vinh Moc Tunnel

When the underground channels were designed , the designers had the foresight to consider their protection as well as their construction .
They must be well against damage long , tropical rains , and monsoon .
Architects would like to visit this historical and solid shelter to figure out how their elders could succeed in constructing such a complex , huge , but firm and sufficient place of living .
The tunnel is accurately a miniaturized image of a deep underground village with all necessary services ( houses for all families , birthplace , health - stations , etc. ) , but can stand still firmly until now .
The answer may be revealed in a heroic mentality and great endeavor of the people in that historical period .
Today , people no longer need the tunnel to shelter but consider it as one of the top destinations of some history - discovering tour .
You are fond of history , and you prefer adventure , the foremost suggestion is a visit to Vinh Moc tunnel !
How to Get to Vinh Moc Tunnel
Vinh Moc tunnel is usually included in tour itinerary for DMZ tour from Hue city at most travel agencies .
As the local transportation from Hue to this area is not very easy for foreigners to navigate , it is recommended that tourists planning to visit this area book a tour .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Media helicopters hovered overhead and photographers camped out in front of Japan ’s top talent agency on Thursday after one of television ’s cleanest - cut stars was arrested for public indecency .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of the pop group SMAP was found drunk and naked in a public park in Tokyo in the early hours of the morning , his agency said in a statement .
He was alone and shrieking at the top of his voice , media reports said .
“ What ’s wrong with being naked ? ” he demanded of a police officer who tried to question him after receiving a complaint about the noise , Kyodo news agency said .
Kusanagi , 34 , shot to fame almost 20 years ago as a member of SMAP , the popular boy band whose five members have gone on to monopolize Japanese TV screens in everything from drama to variety and even cookery shows .
The slender Kusanagi is seen as perhaps the most serious of the five , known for his acting skills and fluency in Korean , which brought him fame in South Korea .
“ He has such a clean image , ” one woman told commercial broadcaster TBS .
“ He does n’t seem like that kind of person . ”
But Thursday ’s incident risks damaging the commercial juggernaut of SMAP , whose members , especially heart throb Takuya Kimura , are popular with advertisers .
Corporations including Toyota Motor Corp said they were pulling commercials starring Kusanagi .
Even Communications Minister Kunio Hatoyama expressed anger , because the actor was the face of a government campaign to get the public to switch to digital television .
Kusanagi ’s agency , Johnny & Associates , a big name in the Japanese entertainment world , issued an apology .
“ We apologize deeply for the trouble and worry caused to everyone , especially his fans , ” the agency said in a faxed statement , adding that it would make a further announcement on Kusanagi ’s future career .
Tokyo police declined to comment on the case .

A new arrival sails into stormy waters
AT FIRST the fishing boat crammed with 47 asylum - seekers , mostly Afghans , seemed like similar vessels turning up lately in north - western Australia 's waters .
Then , on April 16th , it exploded .
Three asylum - seekers drowned fleeing the inferno .
Two are still missing .
Together with another boat arrival on April 22nd , the drama has inflamed a political conflict on a subject many Australians thought they had put to rest : their tolerance for refugees escaping strife in countries to the north .
The explosion also posed the first test of the promise by Kevin Rudd , the Labor prime minister , of a more humane approach to refugees .
Reports soon emerged of fuel being poured on deck .
Speculation followed that the fire was either an accident , or sabotage by people alarmed that hovering Australian navy ships might send them back to Indonesia , where they embarked .
Mr Rudd said such guesses compromised possible prosecutions of people smugglers .
Earlier , he had called them “ the lowest form of life ” .
Police in the Northern Territory say their report on the case could take months .
Mr Rudd 's main target , though , was a turbulent legacy left by John Howard , his conservative predecessor .
Mr Howard exploited public anxiety about boat arrivals to help win an election in 2001 .
He and his ministers claimed asylum - seekers on one boat had thrown their children into the sea to intimidate the authorities .
The claim was later proved false .
The Rudd government has dropped two of Mr Howard 's approaches : sending people to camps in Pacific island - nations while their asylum bids were assessed ; and granting approved refugees restrictive , three - year visas .
Since the changes , the number of arriving boats has climbed : 14 in 2008 - 09 compared with three the previous year .
But boat people comprised only a fraction of the 4,750 asylum applications Australia received last year , a small enough number compared with those in some other rich countries .
In any case John Gibson , president of the Refugee Council of Australia , an NGO , argues the old temporary visas drew more , not fewer , boat people .
He says many of the 353 people who drowned on one boat in October 2001 were Afghan and Iraqi women and children trying to reach men in Australia whose temporary visas shut their families out .
There are signs Australians ' attitudes have softened since then .
In an opinion poll on April 20th , 57 % thought tougher policies would not deter boat people .
Pictures of doctors treating 40 - odd people from the blazing boat have humanised their plight .
Much improved relations with Indonesia should promise stronger action against people smugglers .
Indonesia agreed this week to extradite Hadi Ahmadi , whom Australia wants to prosecute for his alleged involvement in four boat arrivals involving 900 people in 2001 .

A strange man broke into Revision3 COO David Prager 's home last night .
Did David call the police ?
No , he updated Twitter and turned on a live video stream at Ustream .
This is someone who needs to get out of Silicon Valley .
Just so we 're clear , we do not recommend you try this at home .
Call the police when you find someone you do n't know in your apartment .
We 've pasted David 's updates below :
ok , maybe I should lock my door - I swear a random dude just walked into my bathroom and I can't believe I have n't freaked out and I can't believe I 'm tweeting about it while he is still in there -- in wonder of he is sleep walking - or if maybe I should freak out ok - he 's still in the bathroom and Im now thinking a combo of hobo and drunk and sleepwalking dude - he seems late 20s - hmmm what next ?
I 'm thinking the hobo part cause I can smell BO - and I really am wondering why I have n't freaked the F out maybe I should mention I live in a relatively rustic studio apartment in SF there is no TP in my bathroom - wonder if that is complicating things for him - was gonna wait for him to come out and kick him out hmmm -- should I call the cops like you guys have recommended ?
find a blunt object before opening the door ?
my gut tells me he 's harmless but ...
I could be wrong about the harmless assumption I 'm now thinking maybe he 's passed out in my bathroom -- I guess that 's better than violent -- but I have no idea .
time to freak out ??

Update :
We have video !
The state Senate Public Health Committee has given the go - ahead for a bill that would legalize marijuana for medical use in Illinois .
Senate Bill 1381 is a companion to a similar bill introduced in the House .
The next step is a vote of the full General Assembly .
One of the bill 's supporters , Rep. Lou Lang ( D - Skokie ) , said the vote wo n't be called " until I am sure I have enough votes to pass it . "
Julie Falco has tried so many medications and injections , she can't begin to count them .
Falco has multiple scleloris .
The one treatment that has eased her symptoms is medical marijuana .
" I do n't take this to get high ; I have a better quality of life during the day , " she said .
Falco now eats a cookie laced with cannabis three times a day .
She 's encouraged by the Illinois General Assembly moving the medical marijuana bill through both the House and Senate health committees .
Law enforcement is wary .
Organizations like the South Suburban Police Chiefs Association said more research by the FDA is needed .
" We think it is going too far too soon .
While 12 states have passed medical marijuana bills , 38 have n't .
They have problems with it , " Orland Park Police Chief Tim McCarthy said .
The Senate committee passed the bill Wednesday on a 6 - 3 vote .
It would require patients be diagnosed with a " debilitating medical condition " and have a doctor 's recommendation for using pot as a treatment .
Qualified patients and their primary caregiver would have to register with the Illinois Department of Public Health for an ID card .
They'd then be able to possess up to seven pot plants and 2 ounces of dried pot .
The act would automatically be repealed three years after it goes into effect unless lawmakers renew it .
Are vampires sucking the life out of your household energy budget ?
Almost every household has at least one electricity vampire that sucks up power and costs you money .
“ You need to do a home energy audit , ” said William Tauber , chief executive of Progressive Lighting & Energy Solutions Inc. in Tustin and host of “ The Green Energy Show ” on KRLA - AM ( 870 ) .
“ Things in your house are draining energy and you ’re not even aware of them , but they cost you hundreds of dollars . ”
The good news is that an energy audit is a lot easier than it sounds .
Many utility companies , including Southern California Edison , will do it for you for free .
However , it may take some time to get an auditor to your door , so here are a few things you can do now .

Unplug .
About 15 % of the average household ’s electricity use is from electronic devices such as televisions , computers , printers and DVD players .
A good portion of that is what energy experts call “ vampire ” use , devices sucking the power grid when you ’re asleep , said Vanessa McGrady , a spokeswoman for Southern California Edison in Rosemead .
What is vampire use ?
It ’s when the TV is still on when you ’re dozing , or when certain electronics are plugged in even if they ’re not in use .
( You might notice it when you touch a cellphone charger that ’s not plugged into the phone but is plugged into the wall , and you realize that it ’s warm . )
It ’s easy to take the cellphone charger out of the wall , but few people want to pull out the entertainment center and unplug each component at night , McGrady admits .
The solution : Buy a $ 10 power surge strip and plug your electronics into it .
Flip the off switch when they ’re not in use .

Got a spare refrigerator in the garage or attic that ’s holding a six - pack of your favorite beer ?
It ’s probably costing you about $ 300 annually to keep it cold , McGrady said .
In addition to being unnecessary , old refrigerators are often energy hogs , she said .
But what if that six - pack -- or a case of soda -- wo n’t fit in the house fridge ?
If it ’s not going to spoil , it does n’t need to be refrigerated until a few hours before you want to drink it .
Unplug the refrigerator until you need it .
That saves about $ 25 a month .
If you realize that the extra fridge is no longer needed , Edison will recycle it and provide a credit on your electric bill .
Or if you do need it , keep it full .
An empty or nearly empty refrigerator uses way more power than a full one because all that cold food and drink helps keep the thing cool , lessening the need for electricity .
Tauber maintains that his bill went from $ 150 to $ 60 a month by just filling the refrigerator .
If you have a central air - conditioning system , a $ 2 filter and a hose can save you energy costs along with wear and tear on your air conditioner , said Kathleen Kuhn , chief executive of HouseMaster , a New Jersey home inspection company .
Air - conditioning filters in the house get clogged with dust and lint , forcing the air - conditioning unit to work longer and harder to push cool air through the dirty filter .

You do n’t need a handyman to fix it , Kuhn added .
Just open the screen , pull the filter out and bring it to Home Depot to find a matching replacement .
It will take 10 minutes and cost about $ 2 .
On the outside of your home , there ’s also a compressor unit .
You should clear the area around it of brush and hose it off to make sure it ’s clear of clogging debris too , she said .
A drafty house loses heat in the winter , but it also loses air conditioning in the summer .
Kuhn suggests that you inspect all window frames to make sure there are n’t gaps .
If you ca n’t tell where the draft ’s coming from , close the doors and windows and light a candle .
Follow the flicker and caulk the leaks .
Fans can make a room feel about 5 degrees cooler and are far cheaper to run than an air - conditioning unit , McGrady said .
Advertisement
It ’s also important to set the timer on your air - conditioning unit .
It makes little sense to cool an empty house .
If you ’re gone during the day , a programmable thermostat can turn on the unit an hour before you get home .
Many experts also urge consumers to replace incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs , maintaining that the fluorescent bulbs will save energy and last longer .
This reporter ’s experience belies that advice , though .
I saw little savings from switching to fluorescent bulbs , but that may be because I found them to be too dim and turned on more lights .
Utility companies all over the country are willing to help you save power , McGrady said .
Some perform energy audits over the phone , asking a series of detailed questions about your use to make suggestions about how to save .
Others do audits over the Web or will send representatives to your home .
Edison does all three .
McGrady makes no promises about savings .
But Tauber maintains that most consumers can save 30 % to 40 % on their energy bills by taking all the suggestions to heart .
If you ’re trying to cut costs because you ’ve lost a job , make sure you call your local utility and see whether it has a cut -rate plan for low - income families , McGrady added .
Most do .
These plans are not new , but people who have never been out of work before probably are n’t familiar with them , she said .
Those who qualify save 20 % or more .

“ We ’re really trying to reach out to people in these tough economic times , ” McGrady said .
“ It ’s really kind of funny how much money we spend telling people how not to buy our product . ”

Blackout curtains Europe have some of the best designs and fabrics available .
This is especially true of blackout blinds from Italy which is famous for its textiles .
For US and Canadian residents looking to buy blackout curtains Europe though , it is important to keep in mind that the standard European window size is different from the North American standard . [… ]
I recently saw a few minutes of a Nightly Business Report program on PBS in which a Florida broker was observing that homes which once commanded $ 350,000 at the bubble top were selling briskly now at $ 169,000 to investors from every part of the globe .
In other words : " These homes are half off !
They 're screaming bargains !
They can't get any cheaper than this ! "
The psychology behind this euphoria is accessible to us all .
It 's easy to forget where housing prices were before the bubble and focus instead on how much they 've dropped from the bubble peak .
The same is true in any bubble , be it collectables , real estate , stocks , or tulip bulbs .
But valuation realities have no relation to bubble top pricing .
Thus we should ground our analysis of housing valuations and what constitutes a " bottom " in metrics other than " it 's 50 % off it 's top price . "
Let 's start by considering just how high the bubble took housing valuations :
This chart reveals that housing in California more than tripled at the bubble top .
A fall of 50 % from that peak ( i.e. $ 275,000 ) is still 60 % above the starting point .
Let 's consider a model of all bubbles , regardless of the asset or the era :
No model can predict the timing , highs or lows of any bubble , but bubbles tend to follow a pattern traced in human psychology :
1 . As euphoria grabs hold , prices rise in a steep ascent to a point at which " everyone " believes there is no end to the trend .
2 . The initial descent from the bubble peak is a " shock " which leaves the bubble mentality intact , i.e. the Bull Market in tulip bulbs , real estate , tech stocks , etc. is only suffering a standard retracement / indigestion ; the trend higher is still in place .
3 . In housing , this psychology is embedded in such chestnuts as " they 're not making any more land , " " real estate always rises over time , " " population growth means demand for housing will always rise , " " the house is the foundation of middle class wealth appreciation , " and so on .
4 . At some point speculators who were left out of the initial explosive rise jump in because " prices are a real bargain now . "
5 . This buying pushes demand above supply briefly , and prices start rising again .
6 . But the realities beneath price action have changed , and this bargain - hunting burst soon fades as demand falters , supply rises and prices renew their descent .
7. Speculators and investors ' memory of the tremendous profits made on the way up remain firmly embedded , forming an " investment memory " which locks them into the view that the upward trend will resume at some point .
This drives wave after wave of bottom fishing in which speculators buy into an apparent bottom only to be disappointed / wiped out by a renewal of the downtrend .
8 . At some point , all the bottom fishers have expended their capital and prices retrace to the pre-bubble levels , or even lower .
This is what can be called " the real bottom . "
9 . But the memory of past glories still remains in the minds of speculators / investors , and so a subdued uptrend starts as " hope springs eternal " buying kicks in .
10 . Eventually this institutional / cultural " memory of an uptrend " fades as the " recovery " in prices fails .
The truisms which fed the brief bubble and long post - bubble decline and recovery -- that tech stocks were the future , real estate only goes up , the South Seas is the epic investment of all time , etc. are repudiated and lose favor .
This is the ultimate bottom .
Can a 10 - year bubble reach this " ultimate bottom " in a mere two years ?
History suggests not .
Then there 's the preponderance of other evidence that the underpinnings of the housing bubble have irrevocably shifted .
Let 's review some charts :
Household balance sheets are in terrible shape :
This chart only reflects the extreme reached in 2006 ; it 's undoubtedly even worse now .
Personal savings rates have risen recently , but Americans will need to start saving roughly a trillion dollars a year to return to historic savings rates : and that means not borrowing a spending a trillion but withdrawing it from consuming .
Meanwhile , the equity extraction game is over , and the stands are littered with broken dreams and busted bets :
Mortgage debt has tripled from $ 4.2 trillion in 1997 to over $ 12 trillion :
This explosion of debt is economy - wide , and is not limited to residential housing :
How an economy foundering beneath stupendous debt can forcefeed housing prices higher via ever greater debt is unknown .
Just as a refresher on the extremes the housing bubble reached even when adjusted for inflation :
A significant percentage of this debt comes due in the years just ahead :
Another standard measure of valuation , the price - to - rent ratio , also reached historic highs .
In some areas of the nation , this might have already returned to the mean , but with property taxes skyhigh and the cost of renting dropping , it may well be the cost of renting is still significantly cheaper than owning .
While this graph is a few years old , the trend to historic highs in property taxes is clearly illustrated .
Yes , you can petition your county to lower your appraisal , but unless your state is protected from fast - rising property taxes via a Prop 13 - type law , then brace yourself for local governments to make up their declinign tax revenues on the backs of property owners -- plummeting prices be darned .
With reports of banks holding some 600,000 foreclosed or distressed properties on their books and off the market in the news , it is a foregone conclusion that any blip up in demand for homes will be met with a tide of new supply .
After the current " bargain buying " dries up , inventory will exceed demand and prices will resume their fall .
And last but not least , let 's note that we 're dealing not just with the aftermath of one historically extreme bubble , but three : one in stocks ( shown here ) , one in housing ( shown above ) and another in bonds which have skyrocketed as yields drop to near - zero .
The net result of declining asset values across all asset classes but gold is that there will be a global reduction in borrowing against assets .
So add up the financial contexts which control real estate valuations :
1. Extreme bubble valuations must eventually retrace to the starting point , and in many cases they drop below the starting point .
2. Housing and real estate are based on the availability of cheap , plentiful debt .
As economy - wide debt loads are at historic extremes , it is prudent to ask what conditions will enable trillions more in debt to be issued to buy inflated housing .
3 . As the Federal government borrows trillions of dollars on the open market to fund its mega-stimulus - bailout debts ( in the trillions and counting ) , then the government is competing with private borrowers for a dwindling pool of capital / savings .
That will drive up rates , making mortgages more expensive .
And since prices drop as rates rise , this global push on interest rates is a profound headwind for housing prices globally .
4 . Paying a mortgage requires steady income , which for most citizens means a steady job .
Rapidly rising unemployment reduces the pool of potential buyers and adds to the inventory as those losing their incomes also lose their homes .
In short : with the national and household balance sheets at historic extremes of indebtedness it is difficult to see what fundamental financial foundation exists for higher housing prices .
The only conclusion to be drawn from the above charts is that those currently buying " at bargain prices " will very likely be disappointed as prices renew their downtrend in the near future .

He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

What ’s a Task Queue ?
Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or machines .
A task queue ’s input is a unit of work , called a task , dedicated worker processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to perform .
Celery communicates via messages , usually using a broker to mediate between clients and workers .
To initiate a task a client puts a message on the queue , the broker then delivers the message to a worker .
A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers , giving way to high availability and horizontal scaling .
Celery is written in Python , but the protocol can be implemented in any language .
In addition to Python there ’s node - celery for Node.js , a PHP client , gocelery for golang , and rusty - celery for Rust .
Language interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks in such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker .
What do I need ?
Celery version 5.0.0 runs on , Python ( 3.6 , 3.7 , 3.8 )
PyPy3.6 ( 7.6 ) This is the next version to of celery which will support Python 3.6 or newer .
If you ’re running an older version of Python , you need to be running an older version of Celery : Python 2.6 : Celery series 3.1 or earlier .
Python 2.5 : Celery series 3.0 or earlier .
Python 2.4 was Celery series 2.2 or earlier .
Python 2.7 : Celery 4.x series .
Celery is a project with minimal funding , so we do n’t support Microsoft Windows .
Please do n’t open any issues related to that platform .
Celery is usually used with a message broker to send and receive messages .
The RabbitMQ , Redis transports are feature complete , but there ’s also experimental support for a myriad of other solutions , including using SQLite for local development .
Celery can run on a single machine , on multiple machines , or even across datacenters .
Get Started
If this is the first time you ’re trying to use Celery , or you ’re new to Celery 5.0.0 coming from previous versions then you should read our getting started tutorials :
First steps with Celery Tutorial teaching you the bare minimum needed to get started with Celery .
Next steps A more complete overview , showing more features .
Celery is …
Simple Celery is easy to use and maintain , and does not need configuration files .
It has an active , friendly community you can talk to for support , like at our mailing - list , or the IRC channel .
Here ’s one of the simplest applications you can make : from celery import Celery app = Celery ( ' hello ' , broker= ' amqp://guest@localhost//') @app.task def hello( ) : return ' hello world '
Highly Available Workers and clients will automatically retry in the event of connection loss or failure , and some brokers support HA in way of Primary / Primary or Primary / Replica replication .
Fast A single Celery process can process millions of tasks a minute , with sub- millisecond round - trip latency ( using RabbitMQ , py- librabbitmq , and optimized settings ) .
Flexible Almost every part of Celery can be extended or used on its own , Custom pool implementations , serializers , compression schemes , logging , schedulers , consumers , producers , broker transports , and much more .
It supports …
Message Transports RabbitMQ , Redis , Amazon SQS
Concurrency Prefork , Eventlet , gevent , single threaded ( solo )
Result Stores AMQP , Redis memcached SQLAlchemy , Django ORM Apache Cassandra , IronCache , Elasticsearch
Serialization pickle , json , yaml , msgpack .
zlib , bzip2 compression .
Cryptographic message signing .
Framework Integration Celery is easy to integrate with web frameworks , some of which even have integration packages : Django not needed Pyramid pyramid_celery Pylons celery - pylons Flask not needed web2 py web2 py - celery Tornado tornado - celery
The integration packages are n’t strictly necessary , but they can make development easier , and sometimes they add important hooks like closing database connections at fork .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s Sony Corp will likely suffer an annual operating loss of about $ 1.1 billion , its first such loss in 14 years , due to sluggish sales and a stronger yen , a person with knowledge of the matter said .
Shares of Sony tumbled 9 percent , slicing $ 2 billion off its market value to $ 22 billion , while rival Toshiba Corp dropped more than 8 percent after Japanese media said it too was headed for a big loss this financial year .
The global economic slump has dampened demand for electronics products , causing inventories to pile up and prices to tumble , and Sony is feeling the pinch of the downturn in every corner of its operations , which range from semiconductors to movies and insurance .
If it posts such a loss , management could come under pressure to pursue bolder restructuring than the plan unveiled last month that called for curbing investment , exiting businesses and cutting 16,000 jobs .
That included 8,000 regular workers , or roughly 4 percent of its global workforce .
“ I think there ’s a good chance the company will further accelerate its restructuring from what has been announced in December , ” said Daiwa Institute of Research analyst Kazuharu Miura .
Sony will likely need to pursue more drastic measures , such as laying off more full - time employees and selling its financial unit which has been hurt by falling stock prices , market participants say .
Sony may post an operating loss of 100 billion yen ( $ 1.1 billion ) in the business year to March 31 , instead of its previously estimated 200 billion yen profit , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because Sony has not yet revised its forecasts .
The Nikkei business daily had reported earlier that the loss could double to around 200 billion yen depending on the extent of inventory build - up in the January - March quarter .
Analysts on average see an annual profit of 18.5 billion yen , a poll of 18 brokerages by Reuters Estimates showed .

Sony spokeswoman Mami Imada said the loss figure was speculation and declined to comment further .
Similar reports appeared in other media .
The company is scheduled to announce its quarterly earnings results on January 29 .
The severe downturn has also pushed rival Panasonic Corp to slash its outlook and step up restructuring measures , while media said Toshiba would likely plunge into an annual operating loss for the first time in seven years because of its deteriorating chip business .
The Nikkei newspaper said Toshiba ’s operating loss will likely be around 200 billion yen , against the company ’s October forecast for a 150 billion yen profit and a projection of a 31 billion yen profit in a poll of 16 brokerages by Reuters Estimates .
Toshiba also suffers from weak demand for flat TVs and personal computers .
Toshiba spokeswoman Kaori Hiraki said the loss estimate was not issued by the company , which is still reviewing its earnings forecasts .
MORE RESTRUCTURING
Sony , the maker of Bravia flat TVs , Cyber - shot digital cameras and PlayStation game machines competes with Samsung Electronics in TVs , Canon Inc in digital cameras , and Microsoft Corp and Nintendo in video games .
Some analysts have predicted Sony will post an operating loss in the current year to March 31 while Sony itself had said in October that it may fall short of its forecast for a 200 billion yen profit due to the yen ’s strength .
But the news has nevertheless fueled speculation that Sony may have to undertake further restructuring steps as its $ 1.1 billion savings plan has been seen as insufficient .
“ Sony could reduce the number of products it offers , and it may also have to consider selling off its financial unit , ” JPMorgan analyst Yoshiharu Izumi said .
“ Even though external factors are the main reason ( for the likely loss ) , the management team is partly the cause for the long delay in turning around its TV business , ” he added .
“ They may have to take responsibility for that since the company is cutting personnel now . ”
The Times of London newspaper said earlier this month that Sony planned to announce closures of Japanese factories and major divisions next month , though the company denied any such plan existed .
The expected loss this business year would be only the second since Sony went public in 1958 and the first caused by troubles in its mainstay electronics business , the Nikkei said .
A one - time charge related to the company ’s U.S. film studio business was primarily responsible for the previous operating loss , reported for the year that ended in March 1995 , it said .
Apart from restructuring charges and possible further losses on exchange rates , Sony is expected to write down roughly 50 billion yen of its holding in Sony Life Insurance Co , the newspaper said .
The company has assumed the yen at 100 yen per dollar and 140 yen per euro , compared with the current dollar / yen level of 89 yen and euro / yen level of 119 yen .
A firm yen cuts into the value of its profits and makes its products less competitive in overseas markets .
Sony shares ended down 8.9 percent at 2,000 yen , compared with a 4.8 percent slide in the benchmark Nikkei average .
The company ’s shares fell 1.9 percent to $ 23.10 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday .
Toshiba closed down 8.6 percent at 385 yen .
( $ =89.12 yen )

Seems like Madonna has no time for her young boyfriend Jesus Luz at all .
The singer has dumped Brazilian model .
Madonna supposedly called it quits after Luz spent romantic weekend with lingerie model Luciana Costa in his home city of Rio de Janeiro .
Luciana , 31 , is nine years senior Jesus .
It seems that rising star of model business has a thing for older women .
Hollywood gossipers never understood what the latest Madonna ’s relationship was about .
Most of them think it was to drum publicity .
Daily Star ’s insider explains : “ Madonna has just come out of a very long and difficult relationship .
How could it be serious ?
It was a bit of fun and she ’s enjoyed herself ” .
Others say Madonna is being preoccupied with plans to adopt a Malawian child .
And baby Jesus is just too much for her now .
What ’s more , rumors circulated that this public misalliance could ruin her adoption plans .
Madonna met Jesus at the photoshoot for W magazine in December , 2008 , soon after she divorced from Guy Ritchie .
The couple showed up in public often since then .
Now Jesus Luz is known around the globe .

Just got off the phone with Dallas Independent School District spokesman Jon Dahlander , who , moments ago , announced that the district is closing Daniel Webster Elementary from tomorrow till May 11 due to one confirmed case of the swine flu at that campus .
( It will remain open throughout today to accomodate working parents who may not be able to pick up their kids . )
As a DISD parent myself , I was curious how the district 's handling all this -- which is to say , does DISD have any intention of following the Fort Worth ISD 's route and shutting down all schools should more confirmed cases show up on several other campuses ?
To which Dahlander responded : Hard to say .
" We 're continuing to monitor it with the county , " he says .
" We 're taking our orders from them . "
But in this case , he acknowledges , Dallas County health officials did not order the campus shutdown .
That was done by district officials , who opted this morning to close the school and order its immediate disinfection .
The problem with shutting down all 228 campuses , he says , are myriad : Students are in the middle of TAKS testing , so when would that be rescheduled ?
And there 's the issue of paying teachers and administrators , who'd have to work well into June to cover the make - up days .
And how about air - conditioning all those schools well into the summer ?
That 's expensive .
And while the Texas Education Agency is working with districts to offset some of those costs , the money will have to come from somewhere .
" Any kind of major decision is not going to be taken lightly , " Dahlander says .
" You always want to err on the side of caution , no doubt , but at the same time , when you make a decision that 's that large , there are consequences down the road you 'll have to consider .
Every school distict in Texas and the country is in uncharted territory .
We have n't been through something like this before , so everyone 's proceeding with caution as best we can and trying to do the right thing .
What I 've been pleased with personally is I have n't seen people really panicking .
Everyone 's response has been very measured , and that 's very refreshing . "
Update at 2:14 p.m. : Dallas County Health Director John Carlo called with some further details .
Yes , he 's consulting with area school districts concerning potential closures , but he 's concerned about them making the call too quickly : " If we close now and nothing happens , and if we really do need to close them down later , how will we do that ?
This is difficult , and there are challenging considerations ...
We 're making sure they have the best information to make their decisions .
Closing DISD would have a huge impact .
These are tough calls and tough decisions , and this is my process .
We need to talk about the risk and get people 's eyes and ears open , but we do n't want to cause undue alarm at the same time . "
Why DO babies turn so many brilliant women into slummy mummies ?
The other week , an old friend arrived at our house for dinner .
She is a feisty Oxford graduate who was once beautiful , but she was wearing a skirt that was way too tight - because she had filled out - and she had n't bothered to redo her highlights .
My heart sank when I saw her because I realised that here was yet another clever , pretty woman who had chosen to sacrifice herself and her marriage to motherhood .
Why is it that when so many women become mothers they turn into boring frumps with one - track conversational minds that rarely stray from the oh - so fascinating subjects of nurseries , nappies and ( lactating ) nipples .
These women infuriate me .
They think they are doing what 's best for their children when , really , they are committing the worst form of self - neglect , and insulting their marriage into the bargain .
Most of the women who think having a child entitles them to become unattractive , undesirable and uninteresting are , inevitably , British .
Happy family : Victoria Beckham has managed to maintain her figure and looks for herself and her husband while being a good mother to her three sons
Somehow , women in the rest of the Western world manage to maintain their weight and minds while raising happy children .
And they are also more likely to keep their husbands .
When I had the first of my two sons 15 years ago , I could have abandoned the gym and hairdresser , opted for baggy clothes and ceased to have adult conversations , boring my husband rigid with baby talk .
But I was sensible enough to know this would be the road to disaster .
I instinctively knew it would be better to wait for him to come home for dinner than to succumb to the temptation to eat with the children at 6 pm .
Yes , it is hard work to maintain your looks and interests when you have small children , but it is something women just have to do .
It might sound brutal , but this is a short , but crucial juncture in any relationship .
Women have to see that their marriage matters as much as their children .
At a time when divorce is on the rise and families are breaking up , it seems even more important for women to consider their other halves .
Men have a profound interest in their own children , but they also have adult sexual human urges - women ignore them at their peril .
When a woman puts her child first , she is making a choice .
Close : Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt say they have a fulfilling relationship with plenty of sex - and still manage to be good parents to their five children
For every mother with greasy hair and a flabby bum ( even though she can afford gym membership ) who has lost interest in herself and the world , there is a husband ready to go on the prowl .
Why do men sleep with their secretaries ?
Because they really do want to talk about work .
Children are part of a family .
But they are not the family .
They are not an excuse to drop standards .
Women who prefer the company of children need to ask : ' What am I avoiding ? '
They are avoiding life and opting out of adulthood .
Yes , children need stimulating , but they are not entertainment .
Nor are they an excuse to let yourself go .
Happy mothers groom !
Show me a slob and I 'll show you a depressed mother .
Recently , a male writer suggested that something resembling a lobotomy happens to even the smartest of women when they reproduce .
He complained that his wife , who once performed in a competitive arena , dressed to kill and kept in shape - who even liked sex now and then - morphed into a frumpy , middle - aged , asexual , insanely dull woman after having their first baby .
These complaints were met with an avalanche of vitriol .
Criticise a mother and you might as well thwack a defenceless , sick animal with a baseball bat for the reaction you can expect .
Trouble is , you might just have a point .
I have many girlfriends who started life in the fast lane , got degrees , landed big jobs and great men , got pregnant - and then it all went pear - shaped .
Many never lost the baby fat ( they did n't try ) .
The slinky underwear and heels never came out of the wardrobe again .
And husbands who had to work twice as hard so their wives could pursue a full - time career in babies could not even look forward to having dinner with their wives .
The women had started eating with the children and then ( to make the babies sleep ) , some even got into bed with them .
It came as a huge shock when their husbands started to stay away or , in some cases , found someone who would stay up past 8.30 pm .
I remember the point ten years ago at which children became a cult .
Women started going to pre-natal , toddler , organic baking , yoga and parenting classes .
If you were in the sect , you had no shortage of friends , but anyone who suggested there might be a whole ( normal ) world outside ( including me ) got shot down .
Men just cowered and complained ( to each other ) .
But when women give everything to their children , they lose part of themselves .
The truth is - and no one will admit this - that men dread talking to these sorts of women , let alone be married to one .
My husband is one of them .
Adults gather together in the evenings to discuss grown - up things .
Though our children are a huge part of our lives , they are an intimate and private part - and should remain that way .
In my parents ' day , women were expected to join in conversations about politics and literature ( they could talk babies afterwards with the other women ) .
Mothers today consider children a topic that must be discussed at all times and in all places .
I call it narcissism .
When a mother talks to me about her children beyond the polite five minutes - unless it is for important reasons - I consider it insulting .
Women bond through intimacy .
The new school of sloppy mothers are n't sharing : they 're bragging .
They 're saying we have no time to brush our teeth or comb our hair because we have such an important job .
We 're better than you .
Sorry , but how is it that European women manage to raise non-violent , happy , confident children and still look fantastic ?
I recently went to a retreat called the Hoffman Process where no one was allowed to discuss their real identity .
For seven days we did n't utter a word about our children .
We had to start conversations based on our life experiences , ideas and feelings .
I left knowing these people better than some female acquaintances of 20 years .
Many women use children as a shield to keep other people from getting too close .
It looks benign because the subject ( babies ) is cuddly , but it 's almost a hostile act .
I also know women who only discuss children with their husbands to avoid dealing with the real relationship they have .
Children are not oblivious to being used as an excuse for not getting on with other things .
We live in a society where children are pushed to the brink in a host of ways .
Meanwhile , their mothers check out of normal adult society altogether .
Living through someone else is a psychological illness , not a badge of honour .
Topic 357 – Tax Information for Parents of Kidnapped Children
You may claim a kidnapped child as your dependent if the following requirements
are met :
The child must be presumed by law enforcement to have been kidnapped by
someone who is not a member of your family or a member of the child 's family ,
and
The child had , for the taxable year in which the kidnapping occurred ,
the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one - half of
the portion of such year before the date of kidnapping .
If both of these requirements are met , the child may meet the requirements
for purposes of determining :
The dependency exemption

We are big fans of u-pick or pick your own fruit and berries .
U - pick means you go to the farms and pick the fruit yourself .
It is good in many ways :
buying locally
the freshest produce
reducing rubbish ( with byo containers )
money goes direct to the farmer , no middleman
fruit tastes great without time spent in refrigerators
low food mileage attached , provided you do n’t travel for hours to the farms
great outing and fun for the kids
cheaper produce – buying in bulk .
Farmgate buying is similar : you buy fruit or veggies at the farm , but already picked , mostly freshly that same day .
We usually combine u-pick and farmgate .
Our two favourite areas for u-pick in Melbourne region are the Dandenongs ( blueberries , cherries , peaches , beans , raspberries ) and Kinglake ( raspberries , strawberries ) .
If you are a reader from Australia , you might have guessed the connection between frozen raspberry yogurt and bushfires .
As mentioned , we often went to Kinglake for raspberries u-pick .
Kinglake is a small town burned in the February bushfires .
The famous Kinglake raspberry farm has been partly destroyed , but several plots have survived and now have autumn raspberries for u-pick .
We went there last week .
The idea was to support farms and business that have survived and / or reopened .
We had to brace ourselves for what we were about to see : vast areas of burned trees and houses .
Hard to describe .
We were the only people picking on the farm that afternoon : weird feeling knowing that on such a beautiful , school holiday day the farm would be so busy .
However , people still are n’t sure if it ’s OK to come .
Talking to the locals , they would love to see more people coming , to boost the local business activity .
So , if you live in the Melbourne area , it would be great to visit the bushfire affected communities and spend some money : pick the fruit , have a lunch or coffee , support business running .
See on the internet or call first to check if the roads are open to where you intend to go .

The freshly picked raspberries at our place have almost disappeared : we ate most of them , froze some and made a batch of frozen raspberry yogurt .
Homemade raspberry frozen yogurt recipe :
Ingredients :
1 1/2 cup natural yogurt
300 g ( 0.6 lb ) fresh raspberries
150 g ( 0.3 lb ) caster sugar or icing ( confectionery ) sugar
Method :
Mash or puree the raspberries .
Sieve to remove the pips , optional Add sugar and yogurt to the raspberries and mix together .
Pour into the ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer instructions .
Optional : add grated white chocolate when the mixture starts to freeze .
Transfer to a freezer safe container and keep in the freezer .
Frozen yogurt is healthier alternative to ice cream .
Our kids love it as much as ice cream and are happy with a serve of frozen yogurt ( especially if it has white chocolate bits ) .
If you do n’t have the ice cream machine , you can freeze the yogurt in the freezer , but have to mix it several times during the freezing process with a hand blender or fork to break the ice crystals .
Use frozen raspberries if fresh are n’t in season .
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have raided a Dallas ISP , knocking the company and almost 50 of its clients offline .
The early morning Thursday raid closed down the operations of Core IP Networks , which operated out of two floors of a Telx collocation facility at 2323 Bryan Street in Dallas .
The raid had to do with the activities of a former customer , according to Matthew Simpson , Core IP 's CEO .
" The FBI is investigating a company that has purchased services from Core IP in the past , " he wrote in a note posted to a Google Sites page .
" This company does not even collocate with us anywhere , much less 2323 Bryan Street Datacenter . "
He did not name the company that is allegedly at the center of the FBI investigation .
FBI spokesman Mark White confirmed that agents had executed a search warrant at the 2323 Bryan Street address on Thursday , but declined to comment further on the matter .
" Currently nearly 50 businesses are completely without access to their e-mail and data , " Simpson wrote .
" Citizen access to Emergency 911 services are being affected , as Core IP 's primary client base consists of telephone companies . "
Simpson said that his company was not involved in any kind of illegal activity .
He could not be reached immediately for comment .
It is unusual for the FBI to shut down an entire hosting provider because of the activity of a single customer .
As reported in yesterday ’s New York Times , a South Carolina chapter of Habitat for Humanity prohibited a group of Secular Humanist volunteers from wearing their “ Non- Prophet Organization ” T - shirts ; a Charleston - area teacher “ came out ” as a nonbeliever after years of church dinners and demurrals ; and Humanist Loretta Haskell struggled over her role as a church musician .
While such stories remain commonplace , a related story with a substantial bearing on these anecdotes is one of America ’s best - kept secrets .
A recent Newsweek cover — in a bid to ( finally ) match the celebrated 1966 “ Is God Dead ? ” cover of Time — read , in the shape of a cross : “ The Decline and Fall of Christian America . ” Editor Jon Meacham ’s story highlights
Newsweek ’s latest poll results showing that 10 % fewer Americans identify as Christian today than twenty years ago .
But more importantly , and mentioned only in passing , is the growth among atheists and secularists of all stripes .
According to the latest American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) of more than 54,000 adults , between 2001 and 2008 the number willing to identify themselves as atheist and agnostic has gone from under 2 million to 3.6 million .
Small numbers compared to the whole , of course , but most notably it ’s a rise of 85 % of those willing to describe themselves as living without God during the years of our most overtly religious presidency !
Even more newsworthy , when the widely - scorned labels “ atheist ” and “ agnostic ” are replaced with specifics about beliefs ( “ There is no such thing ” as God , “ There is no way to know , ” or “ I ’m not sure , ” and added to those who refused to answer ) it turns out that over eighteen percent of Americans do not profess belief in a God or a higher power .
According to ARIS , then , there could be as many as 40 million adult nonbelievers in the United States !
Personal God Going the Way of the Dodo ?
Consider :
If these numbers are correct , nonbelievers amount to more than the highest estimates of African Americans or gays .
Secularists are one of America ’s largest minorities .
It is no longer possible to proclaim , as the Gallup Poll announced fifty years ago : “ Nearly all Americans believe in God . ”
That is today ’s most significant change .
So what explains the impressive increase among those willing to identify as atheist or agnostic ?
For those who think that books and ideas simply do n’t matter , it is dramatic tribute to the success of the “ new atheist ” writers — including Sam Harris , Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett , and Christopher Hitchens .
To paraphrase the title of Dennett ’s book , their goal has been to “ break the spell ” of religion — and they have evidently helped more Americans “ achieve ” that goal .
If a new confidence is in the offing it is also visible in the American Humanist Association ’s scandalous Christmastime bus ads in Washington DC ( “ Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ’ sake . ” ) .
No less striking is the “ Out ” campaign ( “ Come Out , ” “ Reach Out , ” “ Speak Out , ” “ Keep Out , ” “ Stand Out , ” ) especially among students and young people .
One of the few writers who has paid attention to these phenomena , Konstantin Petrenko , writing for Religion Dispatches , does so in order to dismiss them [ see “ Godless America ?
Say Hello to the ‘ Apatheists ’ , ” March 19 , 2009 ] .
He stresses the discrepancy between those embracing the “ atheist ” or “ agnostic ” label and those who describe themselves as not believing in God .
“ It appears that most of the unaffiliated individuals are not atheistic or anti-religious in any activist sense , but are rather apathetic toward organized religion and reluctant to join any particular denomination or sect . ”
True enough , but the same can be said of most religious believers .
This is no reason to downplay the fact that so many have clearly fallen away from religion — that is , they live their lives without any sort of God .
Nor can we ignore ARIS ’s statement that the six percent of Americans who refuse to answer the question about their beliefs “ tend to somewhat resemble ‘ Nones ’ in their social profile and beliefs . ”
Which means , according to ARIS ’s most striking conclusion : “ The U.S. population continues to show signs of becoming less religious , with one in five Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008 . ”
Furthermore , among those who do , over 12 % of the total sample describe their belief in ways that ARIS concludes are “ deistic ( a higher power but no personal God ) . ”
One in eight American believers are as religious as… Thomas Paine .
Those who continue to believe in a traditional Jewish , Christian , or Muslim personal god have dropped to under seventy percent of the American population .
Despite all efforts to ignore or minimize this , it is big news .
Moments of Prayer into Moments of Silence
And the discrepancy between those willing to be public and open about their religious disbelief and those who are not is also big news .
Among nonbelievers , judging from my discussions with hundreds of them over the past several months , many are not “ new atheists ” ( militantly doing battle with religion ) but are , in Peter Steinfels ’ terminology , “ new new atheists . ”
These people are not primarily concerned with arguing against the belief in God , but are trying to find ways of coexisting in a society in which both nonbelievers and believers can expect to be around for a long time to come .
They shy away from labels as they seek their own bearings and their own comfort zone in today ’s America .
Secularists welcomed President Obama ’s shout - out to nonbelievers during his inaugural address , but are painfully aware that when launching his campaign he criticized them for trying to keep religion out of the public square , but not the religious right for its attempts to erase the line between church and state .
They worry , along with Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , that Obama ’s renewal of the Bush Faith - Based Initiative in the new Office of Faith - Based and Community Partnerships has not ruled out proselytizing and discriminatory hiring for religious social service programs that are granted Federal dollars .
And they wince when recalling that he subjected himself to the informal religious test of being drilled like a catechism pupil by Rick Warren on his own particular way of believing in Jesus Christ ( the same Rick Warren who announced that he would never vote for an atheist for president ) .
Above all , rather than combating religious belief at every turn , many nonbelievers would cheer if the President initiated a genuinely multicultural approach to both believers and secularists in today ’s America .
This might entail , as was not done at the Democratic National Convention last August , inviting secularists as well as believers to platforms that normally exclude the irreligious ( i.e. the “ values and unity ” event preceding the Convention that was exclusively for religious believers ) .
It might entail as much political attention being paid to nonbelievers as believers at public events — transforming moments of prayer into moments of silence .
In other words , it would mean abandoning the implicit assumption of so much of American public and private life that religious values , norms and practices apply to everyone — and show respect to American ’s enormous nonreligious minority .

Last week , we pointed out that one of the newly released Bush - era memos inadvertently confirmed that the CIA held an al - Qaeda suspect named Hassan Ghul in a secret prison and subjected him to what Bush administration lawyers called " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
The CIA has never acknowledged holding Ghul , and his whereabouts today are secret .
But Ghul is not the only such prisoner who remains missing .
At least three dozen others who were held in the CIA 's secret prisons overseas appear to be missing as well .
Efforts by human rights organizations to track their whereabouts have been unsuccessful , and no foreign governments have acknowledged holding them .
( See the full list . )
In September 2007 , Michael V. Hayden , then director of the CIA , said " fewer than 100 people had been detained at CIA 's facilities . "
One memo ( PDF ) released last week confirmed that the CIA had custody of at least 94 people as of May 2005 and " employed enhanced techniques to varying degrees in the interrogations of 28 of these " . ”
Former President George W. Bush publicly acknowledged the CIA program in September 2006 , and transferred 14 prisoners from the secret jails to Guantanamo .
Many other prisoners , who had " little or no additional intelligence value , " Bush said , " have been returned to their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments . "
Bush did not reveal their identities or whereabouts -- information that would have allowed the International Committee for the Red Cross to find them -- or the terms under which the prisoners were handed over to foreign jailers .
The U.S. government has never released information describing the threat that any of them posed .
Some of those prisoners have since been released by third countries holding them .
But it is still unclear what has happened to dozens of others .
" Making the Justice Department memos on the CIA 's secret prison program public was an important first step , but the Obama administration needs to reveal the fate and whereabouts of every person who was held in CIA custody , " said Joanne Mariner , director of the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch .
" If these men are now rotting in some Egyptian dungeon , the administration can't pretend that it's closed the door on the CIA program . "
The Red Cross has had access to and documented ( PDF ) the experiences of only the 14 people who were publicly moved out of the CIA program and into the prison at Guantanamo Bay .
Former officials in the Bush administration , speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information , said that the CIA spent weeks during the summer of 2006 -- shortly before Bush acknowledged the CIA prisons and suspended the program -- transferring prisoners to Pakistani , Egyptian and Jordanian custody .
The population inside the program had been shrinking since the existence of the prisons was detailed in a Washington Postarticle in November 2005 .
Renewed diplomatic relations between the United States and Libya in May 2006 made it possible for the CIA to turn over Libyan prisoners to Moammar Gadhafi 's control .
One example may be the case of Saud Memon , a Pakistani national suspected of belonging to al - Qaeda and wanted in connection with the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
Memon , who allegedly owned the shed where Pearl was killed , disappeared in March 2003 .
Four years later , he was dropped off , emaciated and near death , at the doorstep of his family home in Lahore , Pakistan , and died two weeks later of tuberculosis .
Investigators at Human Rights
Watch believe he was held in CIA custody before being turned over to Pakistani intelligence agents .
Marwan Jabour may be an example of the type of prisoner Bush described as no longer having any intelligence value .
Jabour , a Palestinian who spent two years in the CIA 's prison system , was turned over to Jordanian intelligence agents , then to Israeli and Palestinian intelligence agencies , when the CIA began to empty out its prisons in 2006 .
Until he was visited by the Red Cross in Jordan , and then provided with legal counsel in Israel , Jabour was a ghost detainee in the hands of the CIA .
The agency has never publicly acknowledged holding him , but intelligence officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that Jabour was jailed for allegedly helping al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters evade capture .
In June 2007 , six human rights groups released the names of three dozen people ( PDF ) whose fates remained unknown .
We 've updated that list based on the most current information available to Human Rights Watch .
We asked the CIA whether any of the people on the list were in CIA custody , whether any of them were among those detainees whom the CIA transferred to other countries for prosecution or detention , as former President Bush said had been done when he publicly acknowledged the program in September 2006 , and whether the CIA is aware of and can disclose the current locations of any of these people .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano sent the following response : " The agency has not , as a rule , commented on these kinds of lists , which are typically flawed . "
We invited him to clarify those flaws but have not yet heard back .
" Until the U.S. government clarifies the fate and whereabouts of these individuals , these people are still disappeared , and disappearance is one of the most grave international human rights violations , " said Margaret Satterthwaite , a law professor at New York University .
" We clearly do n't know the story of everyone who has been through the program .
We need to find out where they are and what happened . "

Panetta providing cover for advisers complicit in CIA torture : investigator Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009
Print This Email This
In light of the revelations in the Red Cross torture report , one private investigator is speculating that the CIA director 's continuing argument that the Justice Department should n't release three Bush - era torture memos is seeming more and more like an attempt to provide cover to CIA advisers who were likely complicit in the formulation of agency torture policies .
Writing in the Daily Beast Wednesday , John Sifton , a private investigator and attorney , says Leon Panetta is giving cover to two of his subordinates by pleading with the Obama administration to not release three torture memos by a former Office of Legal Counsel attorney that the American Civil Liberties Union has sued to gain access to .
" Take Stephen Kappes , " writes Sifton .
" At the time of the worst torture sessions outlined in the ICRC report , Kappes served as a senior official in the Directorate of Operations the operational part of the CIA that oversees paramilitary operations as well as the high - value detention program .
( The directorate of operations is now known as the National Clandestine Service . )
Panetta has kept Kappes as deputy director of the CIA  the number two official in the agency . "
Michael Sulick , a deputy of Kappes from 2002 - 2004 , is now the director of the agency 's National Clandestine Service , another very senior position at the CIA .
" Since the basic facts about their involvement in the CIA interrogation program are now known , Panettas actions are increasingly looking like a cover - up , " asserts Sifton .
Earlier this week , The New York Review of Books published the full contents of a confidential International Committee of the Red Crosss 40 - page report on torture practices at Guantanamo Bay and at black site prisons abroad .
The reports leaking has made waves with its gruesome descriptions of interrogation practices such as suffocation by water , beatings by collar , assaults by dog and forced isolation .
While the ICRC did not give the names of any of the CIA officials involved in the harsh interrogation practices , as Sifton notes , the ICRC was told by former CIA Director Michael Hayden , that interrogation plans for detainees were submitted to CIA headquarters were approved by the  Director or Deputy Director of the CIA . 
It can be inferred then , that knowledge ( and acceptance ) of the interrogation practices was held at the highest levels of the CIA and would likely include Panettas deputies .
Panetta himself is new to the intelligence field and was not involved in the creation of the criticized interrogation practices .
Prior to President Obama 's appointment of him as CIA director , Panetta held positions as President Clinton 's Chief of Staff and as a member of the House of Representatives .
The Department of Justice has until April 16 to decide to disclose the three OLC torture memos , authored by Steven Bradbury in 2005 .
The ACLU agreed to the extension in its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the government after the DOJ promised to also consider releasing an additional torture memo .
This memo , written by OLC attorney Jay Bybee in August 2002 , is believed to provide the first framework for the CIA 's interrogation program .

17 Book Review Examples to Help You Write the Perfect Review
It ’s an exciting time to be a book reviewer .
Once confined to print newspapers and journals , reviews now dot many corridors of the Internet — forever helping others discover their next great read .
That said , every book reviewer will face a familiar panic : how can you do justice to a great book in just a thousand words ?
As you know , the best way to learn how to do something is by immersing yourself in it .
Luckily , the Internet ( i.e. Goodreads and other review sites , in particular ) has made book reviews more accessible than ever — which means that there are a lot of book reviews examples out there for you to view !
In this post , we compiled 17 prototypical book review examples in multiple genres to help you figure out how to write the perfect review .
If you want to jump straight to the examples , you can skip the next section .
Otherwise , let ’s first check out what makes up a good review .
Are you interested in becoming a book reviewer ?

What must a book review contain ?
Like all works of art , no two book reviews will be identical .
But fear not : there are a few guidelines for any aspiring book reviewer to follow .
Most book reviews , for instance , are less than 1,500 words long , with the sweet spot hitting somewhere around the 1,000 - word mark .
( However , this may vary depending on the platform on which you ’re writing , as we ’ll see later . )
In addition , all book reviews share some universal elements .
These include :
A concise plot summary of the book .
An evaluation of the work .
A recommendation for the audience .
If these are the basic ingredients that make up a book review , it ’s the tone and style with which the book reviewer writes that brings the extra panache .
This will differ from platform to platform , of course .
A book review on Goodreads , for instance , will be much more informal and personal than a book review on Kirkus Reviews , as it is catering to a different audience .
However , at the end of the day , the goal of all book reviews is to give the audience the tools to determine whether or not they ’d like to read the book themselves .
Keeping that in mind , let ’s proceed to some book review examples to put all of this in action .
Book review examples for fiction books
Since story is king in the world of fiction , it probably wo n’t come as any surprise to learn that a book review for a novel will concentrate on how well the story was told .
That said , book reviews in all genres follow the same basic formula that we discussed earlier .
In these examples , you ’ll be able to see how book reviewers on different platforms expertly intertwine the plot summary and their personal opinions of the book to produce a clear , informative , and concise review .
Note : Some of the book review examples run very long .
If a book review is truncated in this post , we ’ve indicated by including a [ … ] at the end , but you can always read the entire review if you click on the link provided .

Kirkus Reviews reviews Ralph Ellison ’s The Invisible Man :
An extremely powerful story of a young Southern Negro , from his late high school days through three years of college to his life in Harlem .
His early training prepared him for a life of humility before white men , but through injustices - large and small , he came to realize that he was an " invisible man " .
People saw in him only a reflection of their preconceived ideas of what he was , denied his individuality , and ultimately did not see him at all .
This theme , which has implications far beyond the obvious racial parallel , is skillfully handled .
The incidents of the story are wholly absorbing .
The boy 's dismissal from college because of an innocent mistake , his shocked reaction to the anonymity of the North and to Harlem , his nightmare experiences on a one - day job in a paint factory and in the hospital , his lightning success as the Harlem leader of a communistic organization known as the Brotherhood , his involvement in black versus white and black versus black clashes and his disillusion and understanding of his invisibility - all climax naturally in scenes of violence and riot , followed by a retreat which is both literal and figurative .
Parts of this experience may have been told before , but never with such freshness , intensity and power .
This is Ellison 's first novel , but he has complete control of his story and his style .
Watch it .
Lyndsey reviews George Orwell ’s 1984 on Goodreads :
YOU .
ARE .
THE .
DEAD .
Oh my God .
I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book .
It completely blew my mind .
It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected .
Or in Newspeak " Double Plus Good . "
Let me preface this with an apology .
If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review , I can't help it .
My mind is completely fried .
This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings , with its richly developed culture and economics , not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak , or rather more of the anti-language , whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it .
The world - building is so fully fleshed out and spine - tinglingly terrifying that it 's almost as if George travelled to such a place , escaped from it , and then just wrote it all down .
I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens .
At the time , I remember really wanting to read 1984 , although I never managed to get my hands on it .
I 'm almost glad I did n't .
Though I would not have admitted it at the time , it would have gone over my head .
Or at the very least , I would n't have been able to appreciate it fully . [… ]
The New York Times reviews Lisa Halliday ’s Asymmetry :
Three - quarters of the way through Lisa Halliday ’s debut novel , “ Asymmetry , ” a British foreign correspondent named Alistair is spending Christmas on a compound outside of Baghdad .
His fellow revelers include cameramen , defense contractors , United Nations employees and aid workers .
Someone ’s mother has FedExed a HoneyBaked ham from Maine ; people are smoking by the swimming pool .
It is 2003 , just days after Saddam Hussein ’s capture , and though the mood is optimistic , Alistair is worrying aloud about the ethics of his chosen profession , wondering if reporting on violence does n’t indirectly abet violence and questioning why he ’d rather be in a combat zone than reading a picture book to his son .
But every time he returns to London , he begins to “ spin out . ”
He ca n’t go home .
“ You observe what people do with their freedom — what they do n’t do — and it ’s impossible not to judge them for it , ” he says .
The line , embedded unceremoniously in the middle of a page - long paragraph , doubles , like so many others in “ Asymmetry , ” as literary criticism .
Halliday ’s novel is so strange and startlingly smart that its mere existence seems like commentary on the state of fiction .
One finishes “ Asymmetry ” for the first or second ( or like this reader , third ) time and is left wondering what other writers are not doing with their freedom — and , like Alistair , judging them for it .
Despite its title , “ Asymmetry ” comprises two seemingly unrelated sections of equal length , appended by a slim and quietly shocking coda .
Halliday ’s prose is clean and lean , almost reportorial in the style of W. G. Sebald , and like the murmurings of a shy person at a cocktail party , often comic only in single clauses .
It ’s a first novel that reads like the work of an author who has published many books over many years . [… ]
Emily W. Thompson reviews Michael Doane 's The Crossing on Reedsy Discovery :
In Doane ’s debut novel , a young man embarks on a journey of self - discovery with surprising results .
An unnamed protagonist ( The Narrator ) is dealing with heartbreak .
His love , determined to see the world , sets out for Portland , Oregon .
But he ’s a small - town boy who has n’t traveled much .
So , the Narrator mourns her loss and hides from life , throwing himself into rehabbing an old motorcycle .
Until one day , he takes a leap ; he packs his bike and a few belongings and heads out to find the Girl .
Following in the footsteps of Jack Kerouac and William Least Heat - Moon , Doane offers a coming of age story about a man finding himself on the backroads of America .
Doane ’s a gifted writer with fluid prose and insightful observations , using The Narrator ’s personal interactions to illuminate the diversity of the United States .
The Narrator initially sticks to the highways , trying to make it to the West Coast as quickly as possible .
But a hitchhiker named Duke convinces him to get off the beaten path and enjoy the ride .
“ There ’s not a place that ’s like any other , ” [ 39 ]
Dukes contends , and The Narrator realizes he ’s right .
Suddenly , the trip is about the journey , not just the destination .
The Narrator ditches his truck and traverses the deserts and mountains on his bike .
He destroys his phone , cutting off ties with his past and living only in the moment .
As he crosses the country , The Narrator connects with several unique personalities whose experiences and views deeply impact his own .
Duke , the complicated cowboy and drifter , who opens The Narrator ’s eyes to a larger world .
Zooey , the waitress in Colorado who opens his heart and reminds him that love can be found in this big world .
And Rosie , The Narrator ’s sweet landlady in Portland , who helps piece him back together both physically and emotionally .
This supporting cast of characters is excellent .
Duke , in particular , is wonderfully nuanced and complicated .
He ’s a throwback to another time , a man without a cell phone who reads Sartre and sleeps under the stars .
Yet he ’s also a grifter with a “ love ‘em and leave ‘ em ” attitude that harms those around him .
It ’s fascinating to watch The Narrator wrestle with Duke ’s behavior , trying to determine which to model and which to discard .
Doane creates a relatable protagonist in The Narrator , whose personal growth does n’t erase his faults .
His willingness to hit the road with few resources is admirable , and he ’s prescient enough to recognize the jealousy of those who cannot or will not take the leap .
His encounters with new foods , places , and people broaden his horizons .
Yet his immaturity and selfishness persist .
He tells Rosie she ’s been a good mother to him but chooses to ignore the continuing concern from his own parents as he effectively disappears from his old life .
Despite his flaws , it ’s a pleasure to accompany The Narrator on his physical and emotional journey .
The unexpected ending is a fitting denouement to an epic and memorable road trip .
The Book Smugglers review Anissa Gray ’s The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls :
I am still dipping my toes into the literally fiction pool , finding what works for me and what does n’t .
Books like The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls by Anissa Gray are definitely my cup of tea .
Althea and Proctor Cochran had been pillars of their economically disadvantaged community for years – with their local restaurant / small market and their charity drives .
Until they are found guilty of fraud for stealing and keeping most of the money they raised and sent to jail .
Now disgraced , their entire family is suffering the consequences , specially their twin teenage daughters Baby Vi and Kim .
To complicate matters even more : Kim was actually the one to call the police on her parents after yet another fight with her mother . [… ]

The Book Hookup reviews Angie Thomas ’ The Hate U Give :
♥ Quick Thoughts and Rating : 5 stars !
I ca n’t imagine how challenging it would be to tackle the voice of a movement like Black Lives Matter , but I do know that Thomas did it with a finesse only a talented author like herself possibly could .
With an unapologetically realistic delivery packed with emotion , The Hate U Give is a crucially important portrayal of the difficulties minorities face in our country every single day .
I have no doubt that this book will be met with resistance by some ( possibly many ) and slapped with a “ controversial ” label , but if you ’ve ever wondered what it was like to walk in a POC ’s shoes , then I feel like this is an unflinchingly honest place to start .
In Angie Thomas ’s debut novel , Starr Carter bursts on to the YA scene with both heart - wrecking and heartwarming sincerity .
This author is definitely one to watch .
♥ Review :
The hype around this book has been unquestionable and , admittedly , that made me both eager to get my hands on it and terrified to read it .
I mean , what if I was to be the one person that did n’t love it as much as others ?
( That seems silly now because of how truly mesmerizing THUG was in the most heartbreakingly realistic way . )
However , with the relevancy of its summary in regards to the unjust predicaments POC currently face in the US , I knew this one was a must - read , so I was ready to set my fears aside and dive in .
That said , I had an altogether more personal , ulterior motive for wanting to read this book . [… ]
The New York Times reviews Melissa Albert ’s The Hazel Wood :
Alice Crewe ( a last name she ’s chosen for herself ) is a fairy tale legacy : the granddaughter of Althea Proserpine , author of a collection of dark - as - night fairy tales called “ Tales From the Hinterland . ”
The book has a cult following , and though Alice has never met her grandmother , she ’s learned a little about her through internet research .
She has n’t read the stories , because her mother , Ella Proserpine , forbids it .
Alice and Ella have moved from place to place in an attempt to avoid the “ bad luck ” that seems to follow them .
Weird things have happened .
As a child , Alice was kidnapped by a man who took her on a road trip to find her grandmother ; he was stopped by the police before they did so .
When at 17 she sees that man again , unchanged despite the years , Alice panics .
Then Ella goes missing , and Alice turns to Ellery Finch , a schoolmate who ’s an Althea Proserpine superfan , for help in tracking down her mother .
Not only has Finch read every fairy tale in the collection , but handily , he remembers them , sharing them with Alice as they journey to the mysterious Hazel Wood , the estate of her now - dead grandmother , where they hope to find Ella .
“ The Hazel Wood ” starts out strange and gets stranger , in the best way possible .
( The fairy stories Finch relays , which Albert includes as their own chapters , are as creepy and evocative as you ’d hope . )
Albert seamlessly combines contemporary realism with fantasy , blurring the edges in a way that highlights that place where stories and real life convene , where magic contains truth and the world as it appears is false , where just about anything can happen , particularly in the pages of a very good book .
It ’s a captivating debut . [… ]
James reviews Margaret Wise Brown ’s Goodnight , Moon on Goodreads :
Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown is one of the books that followers of my blog voted as a must - read for our Children 's Book August 2018 Readathon .
Come check it out and join the next few weeks !
This picture book was such a delight .
I had n't remembered reading it when I was a child , but it might have been read to me ... either way , it was like a whole new experience !
It 's always so difficult to convince a child to fall asleep at night .
I do n't have kids , but I do have a 5 - month - old puppy who whines for 5 minutes every night when he goes in his cage / crate ( hopefully he 'll be fully housebroken soon so he can roam around when he wants ) .
I can only imagine !
I babysat a lot as a teenager and I have tons of younger cousins , nieces , and nephews , so I 've been through it before , too .
This was a believable experience , and it really helps show kids how to relax and just let go when it 's time to sleep .
The bunny 's are adorable .
The rhymes are exquisite .
I found it pretty fun , but possibly a little dated given many of those things are n't normal routines anymore .
But the lessons to take from it are still powerful .
Loved it !
I want to sample some more books by this fine author and her illustrators .
Publishers Weekly reviews Elizabeth Lilly ’s Geraldine :
This funny , thoroughly accomplished debut opens with two words : “ I ’m moving . ”
They ’re spoken by the title character while she swoons across her family ’s ottoman , and because Geraldine is a giraffe , her full - on melancholy mode is quite a spectacle .
But while Geraldine may be a drama queen ( even her mother says so ) , it wo n’t take readers long to warm up to her .
The move takes Geraldine from Giraffe City , where everyone is like her , to a new school , where everyone else is human .
Suddenly , the former extrovert becomes “ That Giraffe Girl , ” and all she wants to do is hide , which is pretty much impossible .
“ Even my voice tries to hide , ” she says , in the book ’s most poignant moment .
“ It ’s gotten quiet and whispery . ”
Then she meets Cassie , who , though human , is also an outlier ( “ I ’m that girl who wears glasses and likes MATH and always organizes her food ” ) , and things begin to look up .
Lilly ’s watercolor - and - ink drawings are as vividly comic and emotionally astute as her writing ; just when readers think there are no more ways for Geraldine to contort her long neck , this highly promising talent comes up with something new .
Examples of genre fiction book reviews
Karlyn P reviews Nora Roberts ’ Dark Witch , a paranormal romance novel , on Goodreads :
4 stars .
Great world - building , weak romance , but still worth the read .
I hesitate to describe this book as a ' romance ' novel simply because the book spent little time actually exploring the romance between Iona and Boyle .
Sure , there IS a romance in this novel .
Sprinkled throughout the book are a few scenes where Iona and Boyle meet , chat , wink at each , flirt some more , sleep together , have a misunderstanding , make up , and then profess their undying love .
Very formulaic stuff , and all woven around the more important parts of this book .
The meat of this book is far more focused on the story of the Dark witch and her magically - gifted descendants living in Ireland .
Despite being weak on the romance , I really enjoyed it .
I think the book is probably better for it , because the romance itself was pretty lackluster stuff .
I absolutely plan to stick with this series as I enjoyed the world building , loved the Ireland setting , and was intrigued by all of the secondary characters .
However ,
If you read Nora Roberts strictly for the romance scenes , this one might disappoint .
But if you enjoy a solid background story with some dark magic and prophesies , you might enjoy it as much as I did .
I listened to this one on audio , and felt the narration was excellent .
Emily May reviews R.F. Kuang ’s The Poppy Wars , an epic fantasy novel , on Goodreads :
“ But I warn you , little warrior .
The price of power is pain . ”
Holy hell , what did I just read ??
➽ A fantasy military school
➽ A rich world based on modern Chinese history
➽ Shamans and gods
➽ Detailed characterization leading to unforgettable characters
➽ Adorable , opium - smoking mentors
That 's a basic list , but this book is all of that and SO MUCH MORE .
I know 100 % that The Poppy War will be one of my best reads of 2018 .
Is n't it just so great when you find one of those books that completely drags you in , makes you fall in love with the characters , and demands that you sit on the edge of your seat for every horrific , nail - biting moment of it ?
This is one of those books for me .
And I must issue a serious content warning : this book explores some very dark themes .
Proceed with caution ( or not at all ) if you are particularly sensitive to scenes of war , drug use and addiction , genocide , racism , sexism , ableism , self - harm , torture , and rape ( off - page but extremely horrific ) .
Because , despite the fairly innocuous first 200 pages , the title speaks the truth : this is a book about war .
All of its horrors and atrocities .
It is not sugar - coated , and it is often graphic .
The " poppy " aspect refers to opium , which is a big part of this book .
It is a fantasy , but the book draws inspiration from the Second Sino - Japanese War and the Rape of Nanking .
Crime Fiction Lover reviews Jessica Barry ’s Freefall , a crime novel :
In some crime novels , the wrongdoing hits you between the eyes from page one .
With others it ’s a more subtle process , and that ’s OK too .
So where does Freefall fit into the sliding scale ?
In truth , it ’s not clear .
This is a novel with a thrilling concept at its core .
A woman survives plane crash , then runs for her life .
However , it is the subtleties at play that will draw you in like a spider beckoning to an unwitting fly .
Like the heroine in Sharon Bolton ’s Dead Woman Walking , Allison is lucky to be alive .
She was the only passenger in a private plane , belonging to her fiancé , Ben , who was piloting the expensive aircraft , when it came down in woodlands in the Colorado Rockies .
Ally is also the only survivor , but rather than sitting back and waiting for rescue , she is soon pulling together items that may help her survive a little longer – first aid kit , energy bars , warm clothes , trainers – before fleeing the scene .
If you ’re hearing the faint sound of alarm bells ringing , get used to it .
There ’s much , much more to learn about Ally before this tale is over .
Kirkus Reviews reviews Ernest Cline ’s Ready Player
One , a science - fiction novel :
Video - game players embrace the quest of a lifetime in a virtual world ; screenwriter Cline ’s first novel is old wine in new bottles .
The real world , in 2045 , is the usual dystopian horror story .
So who can blame Wade , our narrator , if he spends most of his time in a virtual world ?
The 18 - year - old , orphaned at 11 , has no friends in his vertical trailer park in Oklahoma City , while the OASIS has captivating bells and whistles , and it ’s free .
Its creator , the legendary billionaire James Halliday , left a curious will .
He had devised an elaborate online game , a hunt for a hidden Easter egg .
The finder would inherit his estate .
Old - fashioned riddles lead to three keys and three gates .
Wade , or rather his avatar Parzival , is the first gunter ( egg - hunter ) to win the Copper Key , first of three .
Halliday was obsessed with the pop culture of the 1980s , primarily the arcade games , so the novel is as much retro as futurist .
Parzival ’s great strength is that he has absorbed all Halliday ’s obsessions ; he knows by heart three essential movies , crossing the line from geek to freak .
His most formidable competitors are the Sixers , contract gunters working for the evil conglomerate IOI , whose goal is to acquire the OASIS .
Cline ’s narrative is straightforward but loaded with exposition .
It takes a while to reach a scene that crackles with excitement : the meeting between Parzival ( now world famous as the lead contender ) and Sorrento , the head of IOI .
The latter tries to recruit Parzival ; when he fails , he issues and executes a death threat .
Wade ’s trailer is demolished , his relatives killed ; luckily Wade was not at home .
Too bad this is the dramatic high point .
Parzival threads his way between more ’ 80s games and movies to gain the other keys ; it ’s clever but not exciting .
Even a romance with another avatar and the ultimate “ epic throwdown ” fail to stir the blood .
Too much puzzle - solving , not enough suspense .

The Washington Post reviews David Grann ’s Killers of the Flower Moon :
The arc of David Grann ’s career reminds one of a software whiz - kid or a latest - thing talk - show host — certainly not an investigative reporter , even if he is one of the best in the business .
The newly released movie of his first book , “ The Lost City of Z , ” is generating all kinds of Oscar talk , and now comes the release of his second book , “ Killers of the Flower Moon : The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI , ” the film rights to which have already been sold for $ 5 million in what one industry journal called the “ biggest and wildest book rights auction in memory . ”
Grann deserves the attention .
He ’s canny about the stories he chases , he ’s willing to go anywhere to chase them , and he ’s a maestro in his ability to parcel out information at just the right clip : a hint here , a shading of meaning there , a smartly paced buildup of multiple possibilities followed by an inevitable reversal of readerly expectations or , in some cases , by a thrilling and dislocating pull of the entire narrative rug .
All of these strengths are on display in “ Killers of the Flower Moon . ”
Around the turn of the 20th century , oil was discovered underneath Osage lands in the Oklahoma Territory , lands that were soon to become part of the state of Oklahoma .
Through foresight and legal maneuvering , the Osage found a way to permanently attach that oil to themselves and shield it from the prying hands of white interlopers ; this mechanism was known as “ headrights , ” which forbade the outright sale of oil rights and granted each full member of the tribe — and , supposedly , no one else — a share in the proceeds from any lease arrangement .
For a while , the fail - safes did their job , and the Osage got rich — diamond - ring and chauffeured - car and imported - French - fashion rich — following which quite a large group of white men started to work like devils to separate the Osage from their money .
And soon enough , and predictably enough , this work involved murder .
Here in Jazz Age America ’s most isolated of locales , dozens or even hundreds of Osage in possession of great fortunes — and of the potential for even greater fortunes in the future — were dispatched by poison , by gunshot and by dynamite . [… ]
Stacked Books reviews Malcolm Gladwell ’s Outliers :
I ’ve heard a lot of great things about Malcolm Gladwell ’s writing .
Friends and co-workers tell me that his subjects are interesting and his writing style is easy to follow without talking down to the reader .
I was n’t disappointed with Outliers .
In it , Gladwell tackles the subject of success – how people obtain it and what contributes to extraordinary success as opposed to everyday success .
The thesis – that our success depends much more on circumstances out of our control than any effort we put forth – is n’t exactly revolutionary .
Most of us know it to be true .
However , I do n’t think I ’m lying when I say that most of us also believe that we if we just try that much harder and develop our talent that much further , it will be enough to become wildly successful , despite bad or just mediocre beginnings .
Not so , says Gladwell .
Most of the evidence Gladwell gives us is anecdotal , which is my favorite kind to read .
I ca n’t really speak to how scientifically valid it is , but it sure makes for engrossing listening .
For example , did you know that successful hockey players are almost all born in January , February , or March ?
Kids born during these months are older than the others kids when they start playing in the youth leagues , which means they ’re already better at the game ( because they ’re bigger ) .
Thus , they get more play time , which means their skill increases at a faster rate , and it compounds as time goes by .
Within a few years , they ’re much , much better than the kids born just a few months later in the year .
Basically , these kids ’ birthdates are a huge factor in their success as adults – and it ’s nothing they can do anything about .
If anyone could make hockey interesting to a Texan who only grudgingly admits the sport even exists , it ’s Gladwell . [… ]
Quill and Quire reviews Rick Prashaw ’s Soar , Adam , Soar :
Ten years ago , I read a book called Almost Perfect .
The young - adult novel by Brian Katcher won some awards and was held up as a powerful , nuanced portrayal of a young trans person .
But the reality did not live up to the book ’s billing .
Instead , it turned out to be a one - dimensional and highly fetishized portrait of a trans person ’s life , one that was nevertheless repeatedly dubbed “ realistic ” and “ affecting ” by non-transgender readers possessing only a vague , mass - market understanding of trans experiences .
In the intervening decade , trans narratives have emerged further into the literary spotlight , but those authored by trans people ourselves – and by trans men in particular – have seemed to fall under the shadow of cisgender sensationalized imaginings .
Two current Canadian releases – Soar , Adam , Soar and This One Looks Like a Boy – provide a pointed object lesson into why trans - authored work about transgender experiences remains critical .
To be fair , Soar , Adam , Soar is n’t just a story about a trans man .
It ’s also a story about epilepsy , the medical establishment , and coming of age as seen through a grieving father ’s eyes .
Adam , Prashaw ’s trans son , died unexpectedly at age 22 .
Woven through the elder Prashaw ’s narrative are excerpts from Adam ’s social media posts , giving us glimpses into the young man ’s interior life as he traverses his late teens and early 20s . [… ]
Book Geeks reviews Elizabeth Gilbert ’s Eat , Pray , Love :
WRITING STYLE : 3.5/5
SUBJECT : 4/5
CANDIDNESS : 4.5/5
RELEVANCE : 3.5/5
ENTERTAINMENT QUOTIENT : 3.5/5
“ Eat Pray Love ” is so popular that it is almost impossible to not read it .
Having felt ashamed many times on my not having read this book , I quietly ordered the book ( before I saw the movie ) from amazon .in and sat down to read it .
I do n’t remember what I expected it to be – maybe more like a chick lit thing but it turned out quite different .
The book is a real story and is a short journal from the time when its writer went travelling to three different countries in pursuit of three different things – Italy ( Pleasure ) , India ( Spirituality ) , Bali ( Balance ) and this is what corresponds to the book ’s name – EAT ( in Italy ) , PRAY ( in India ) and LOVE ( in Bali , Indonesia ) .
These are also the three Is – ITALY , INDIA , INDONESIA .
Though she had everything a middle - aged American woman can aspire for – MONEY , CAREER , FRIENDS , HUSBAND ; Elizabeth was not happy in her life , she was n’t happy in her marriage .
Having suffered a terrible divorce and terrible breakup soon after , Elizabeth was shattered .
She did n’t know where to go and what to do – all she knew was that she wanted to run away .
So she set out on a weird adventure – she will go to three countries in a year and see if she can find out what she was looking for in life .
This book is about that life changing journey that she takes for one whole year . [… ]
Emily May reviews Michelle Obama ’s Becoming on Goodreads :
Look , I 'm not a happy crier .
I might cry at songs about leaving and missing someone ; I might cry at books where things do n't work out ; I might cry at movies where someone dies .
I 've just never really understood why people get all choked up over happy , inspirational things .
But Michelle Obama 's kindness and empathy changed that .
This book had me in tears for all the right reasons .
This is not really a book about politics , though political experiences obviously do come into it .
It 's a shame that some will dismiss this book because of a difference in political opinion , when it is really about a woman 's life .
About growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago ; about getting married and struggling to maintain that marriage ; about motherhood ; about being thrown into an amazing and terrifying position .
I hate words like " inspirational " because they 've become so overdone and cheesy , but I just have to say it -- Michelle Obama is an inspiration .
I had the privilege of seeing her speak at The Forum in Inglewood , and she is one of the warmest , funniest , smartest , down - to - earth people I have ever seen in this world .
And yes , I know we present what we want the world to see , but I truly do think it 's genuine .
I think she is someone who really cares about people - especially kids - and wants to give them better lives and opportunities .
She 's obviously intelligent , but she also does n't gussy up her words .
She talks straight , with an openness and honesty rarely seen .
She 's been one of the most powerful women in the world , she 's been a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School , she 's had her own successful career , and yet she has remained throughout that same girl - Michelle Robinson - from a working class family in Chicago .
I do n't think there 's anyone who would n't benefit from reading this book .

After suffering humiliation at the hands of a hacker in 2007 , the future of anti-piracy company MediaDefender is in serious doubt .
The stock price of its parent company has plunged , and the two founders of MediaDefender have now left the sinking ship .
Founded in 2000 , MediaDefender made a name for itself by polluting file - sharing networks and BitTorrent sites with fake files .
Their methods were especially effective on sites that had little or no moderation and the company ’s success did n’t go unnoticed .
In mid 2005 , MediaDefender founders Randy Saaf and Octavio Herrera were paid $ 43 million for their anti-piracy company when it was acquired by ARTISTdirect .
This seemed to be a good deal , particularly since the big movie studios were paying millions for MediaDefender ’s services – but that situation did n’t last .
In August 2007 disaster struck when a database of MediaDefender ’s internal emails leaked to the public .
Every juicy detail of their anti-piracy campaigns were out in the open , including the tools they used .
The hacker said that he initially did n’t plan to make the info public , but when he found out what MediaDefender were up to he was determined to “ destroy them ” – and so he did .
The emails were published on the web at MediaDefender - Defenders.com but now the site just diverts to The Pirate Bay .
Despite the damage control efforts of MediaDefender , however , the emails are still available for download on some BitTorrent sites .
This must have helped give the large movie studios the impression that MediaDefender is not the most capable company to entrust with the protection of their blockbuster titles .
MediaDefender Founders Randy Saaf and Octavio Herrera
A few months after the leak it became known that the data breach was proving exceptionally expensive , with MediaDefender ’s parent company losing almost $ 1,000,000 because of the hack .
As a result , their stock price plunged and is now valued at a measly two cents per share and the company ’s activities have noticeably decreased .
BitTorrent site administrators told TorrentFreak that MediaDefender are not as active as they used to be .
Many times we have predicted the downfall of MediaDefender but on paper the company is still alive .
Its founders are no longer on board though .
According to a SEC filing last month , MediaDefender has terminated the employment of Randy Saaf and Octavio Herrara .
Why the two left is not clear , but it ’s the end of an era for sure .
It would n’t surprise us if the company ceases to exist in the near future .
Meanwhile , the two anti-piracy partners were elected to the Board of Directors of Jibro , Inc. a relatively unknown mobile entertainment company where they will continue to work together .
We wish them all the best .
Weekly journey unwrapping pop songs .
Writing just about the music .
Not about fashion , whether the music is good or bad or about the video or what the pop star had for breakfast .
Not praise or flattery .
Just observations about the music , and an analysis of the form to help find out how different parts of the song work with each other , and about what the song means .
Frank Rich and I use our Sunday columns to make the same core point .
Rich :
The report found that Maj .
Paul Burney , a United States Army psychiatrist assigned to interrogations in Guantánamo Bay that summer of 2002 , told Army investigators of another White House imperative : “ A large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful . ”
As higher - ups got more “ frustrated ” at the inability to prove this connection , the major said , “ there was more and more pressure to resort to measures ” that might produce that intelligence .
In other words , the ticking time bomb was not another potential Qaeda attack on America but the Bush administration ’s ticking timetable for selling a war in Iraq .
Yours truly :
The problem with torture is the enormous damage it does to the possibility of finding the truth .
Torture forces a victim to tell his interrogator anything to stop the pain .
There may be some truth in the confession but there is also untruth  and no way to tell the two apart .
Every experienced interrogator knows this , which is why governments that are concerned with getting at the truth do not use it ...
The reason totalitarian states use the torture techniques that Bush did is to produce false confessions to create a reality that buttresses their ideology .
The Bush and Cheney ideology was that Iraq needed to be invaded because Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and had an operational relationship with Al - Qaeda that put America under an intolerable risk .
When the facts could not be found to defend that idée fixe , they skewed the intelligence .
When there was no intelligence to skew , they tortured people to get it .
Or , to put it more simply : on March 27 , 2007 , when Zubaydah went before his combatant status review tribunal at Guantanamo , the judge asked him : “ So I understand that , during this treatment , you said things to make them stop and then those statements were actually untrue .
Is that correct ? ”
Zubaydah replied : “ Yes . ”
This is partly how the entire war was justified : on a tortured lie .
And this much we now know for sure .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Do you ever stop to realize that another human being carefully conceived and designed every object you will touch today ?
It 's a pretty amazing thought , and after Objectified , you 'll be thinking it more often .
Advertisement
And that 's exactly the point .
Like Helvetica , director Gary Hustwit 's previous documentary triumph about the most prevalent typeface on earth , Objectified sings the praises of those very people who , while not necessarily under - appreciated , definitely operate in the background — they design your stuff .
It 's a secret little world , and through Objectified , we get to live in it .
Take this lamp I bought at a flea market last weekend .
I Googled the only thing on the bottom that would identify it ( " WINDSOR L - 10 " ) and got zero relevant results .
It 's old , pre-internet for sure , so I was n't surprised .
But who designed it ?
It 's so tiny and Wall-e like ( essentially a hybrid of Wall -e himself and the task lamp Pixar uses in their logo ) — I want to know more !
Someone designed this , and I love imagining the moment of its conception .
Advertisement
My lamp only cost $ 15 , so odds are it was n't designed by any of the überheavyweights featured in Objectified : There 's Apple 's Jonathan Ive , Smart Design ( of Flip Video fame ) founders Davin Stowell and Dan Formosa , the legendary Dieter Rams of Braun , the folks at IDEO ( who designed the first laptop , among many other things ) , Naoto Fukusawa ( father of the Infobar ) , Chris Bangle , the infamous ( and former ) chief designer of BMW , and many others .
It 's a star - studded group .
Also featured prominently is Rob Walker , who writes my favorite New York Times column " Consumed " in the magazine every Sunday — he is a joy in every scene he is in , including where he dreams of an ad campaign encouraging people to got out and use and be satisfied with the stuff they already own .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
But what 's great ( and where Helvetica also ruled ) is that Hustwit is a master interviewer .
He gets his subjects to speak about what can be a jargon and marketing - voodoo laden industry with total clarity and comfort that folks that did n't go to design school can comprehend freely .
Ive , holding up the single aluminum block from which a unibody MacBook is hewn while trying to control his massive biceps , speaks about how designers are ultimately obsessive , borderline neurotic people .
He can't look at an object anywhere without seeing the multiple layers of intent involved - who designed it , who it 's designed for , what it does well .
To Ive , it 's an illness .
Advertisement
To others , it 's desire .
Marc Newson , who designs everything but is famous especially for aviation - related like the EADS spaceplane , puts it this way : " I want to have things that do n't exist yet , " which I think we can all relate to here .
Advertisement
One place where Objectified gets somewhat tripped up is in its hesitance to boldly define the inherent conflict of the designer , especially now : good design should last and improve with time , which is often directly opposed to the interests of a commercial designer 's clients who want people to keep buying things .
This theme does come up in the film , but where Helvetica had the postmodernism vs. modernism conflict - in - a - bubble at its heart , which served as the perfect organizational structure to not only be entertaining , but to also school everyone in design theory , Objectified lacks a similar conflict by which everything can be defined .
Advertisement
I was disappointed to not see more of the good design vs. capitalism conflict mainly because it 's going to be the most important concept in gadget design over the next few decades — not only for the environmental concerns , but because software is more than ever the representation of a gadget 's heart and soul .
This is not a new concept : when fondling the Grid Compass ( the world 's first laptop computer he helped design ) , Bill Moggridge of IDEO says it only took a few seconds for the user experience to be completely about the software interface on its 320x200 screen , with the hardware dropping away almost completely .
And he designed it !
As an interesting contrast , Naoto Fukasawa explains that in Japan , interactions with a tangible object are much more important , culturally , to the Japanese .
Which makes sense when you see the horrid software being run by such a beautiful phone as the Infobar .
Advertisement
This concept also fits snugly in with a designer 's environmental concerns — since software does n't fill up a landfill , having hardware that can be re-upped to latest and greatest status over the web makes the earth happy too .
This choice to not hang the whole film on this idea was of course a conscious one , and it probably ensured a broader , more appealing film in the end .
I just missed the elegance of everything fitting together into nice ideological halves in Helvetica .
Advertisement
But when judged alone , Objectified gets the job done beautifully and does for industrial designers what Helvetica did for graphic designers : lets us step into their frame of reference and greater appreciate , or at the very least notice , their omnipresent work .

OTTAWA–The head of CTV had a dire warning for MPs on Wednesday – network television in Canada will disappear soon unless the government takes action to help .
Ivan Fecan told the House of Commons heritage committee that there must be regulatory reforms to boost revenue and reduce programming obligations .
But the president of cable provider Shaw Communications Inc. countered that private broadcasters are responsible for their own troubles and taxpayers should n't be forced to bail them out .
Fecan insisted CTV is not seeking a bailout .
However , he said broadcasters must be able to charge cable TV providers for the right to carry their over - the - air signals – known as fee - for - carriage .
Alternatively , he said , networks should be relieved of their obligation to provide specified amounts of local news and Canadian content .
That would be a less desirable solution , Fecan added , since there 's not much point in providing local television stations if there 's little local content on it .
Without a solution , Fecan predicted there will be no future for conventional television .
" So what we are saying now to the regulator is : please give us new revenue sources or reduce the obligations or some mix of both .
Otherwise , we do n't believe there is a business there in the future .
" As a private broadcaster , we exist to make a profit based on the services we provide .
If we do n't see a way to make money , we cease to exist or exit that service . "
In an interview later , Fecan said the doomsday scenario is imminent for some local TV stations , such as CTV's A Channel properties , but " it 's not necessarily far away for CTV either . "
Without local stations , he added , there will eventually be no network .
" Over time , you go out of business . "
Fecan 's dire warning was echoed by Peter Viner , president and CEO of Canwest Television .
" The crisis is real .
The conventional television business model is broken and it's been broken for some time , " he told the committee .
" Given the current state of local television , fee for carriage is not just a matter of fairness .
It has become a matter of survival . "
However , Shaw president Peter Bissonnette scoffed at such ``Chicken Little " warnings and accused broadcasters of trying to pressure politicians into giving them a bailout .
Bissonnette told the committee that broadcasters got into financial trouble by going on corporate shopping sprees and buying expensive American shows and they now want regulatory changes that would amount to forcing consumers to bail them out .
" Broadcasters made business decisions to spend more than $ 700 million annually on American programming and , in one case ( Canwest ) , amass a $ 4 - billion debt from the purchase of non-Canadian TV stations and publishing properties , " Bissonette said .
" They should be held accountable for these decisions . "
Like other cable providers , Bissonnette said fee for carriage would force cable and satellite providers to pass on the extra cost to consumers , who would end up paying more without getting any additional service .
" The harm to consumers , the harm across the entire broadcasting system , and the harm to the Canadian economy would far outweigh any perceived benefits that would be enjoyed by broadcasters alone . "
MPs on the committee expressed concern about the potential demise of local television but Bissonnette contended that someone else would fill the void if networks were to abandon local stations .
However , Fecan said CTV has offered to sell several of its money - losing stations for a nominal fee of $ 1 .
It 's had no takers .
" That speaks volumes , " he said .

Some committee members , who are examining the evolution of the television industry , seemed exasperated by the apocalyptic warnings , contradictory testimony and the inability of networks and cable providers to agree on a solution .
" I get the impression this is a type of blackmail , " Liberal heritage critic Pablo Rodriguez complained at one point .

A number of folks have asked me what tools and techniques I use to reverse engineer Cocoa executables .
I thought it would be worth taking some time out from documenting undocumented APIs to show you how easy it is to do the same thing for yourself .
My number - one favorite tool is class - dump , a command - line utility written originally by Steve Nygard .
You can feed an executable to class - dump , and it will print out all the Objective - C class declarations contained within the file .
This information alone is often enough to get you started with an undocumented API .
But class - dump is not without its wrinkles .
First , you need to be aware that class - dump can have problems with Objective - C 2.0 files .
To fix that , there 's a variant of class - dump available called class - dump-x .
Just search online , and you 'll find it .
The latest version of class - dump is 3.1.2 .
The next problem is that class - dump can get very confused if the executable contains any references to C++ classes , spewing out all sorts of junk to stderr .
The workaround is simply to pipe class - dump 's output to a file , separating the garbage from the class - declarations you want to see .
Finally , class - dump can get confused by certain " fat " binaries , especially recent ones that contain 64 - bit executables .
The workaround here is simply to use the lipo or ditto tools to create a single - architecture executable that class - dump will then accept .
You can read more about class - dump here .
OK , you 've got your class declarations , but you want to look at the code itself , right ?
Another favorite tool is otx , which you can find here .
You might already be familiar with otool , a command - line utility that 's bundled with OS X. otool generates a code disassembly ( either PowerPC or Intel ) of a specified executable , but the output generated is not very user friendly .
otx is effectively an " otool after - burner " that drastically improves the output of otool .
Amongst other things , it annotates the code listing by placing Objective - C style comments alongside method calls .
If you 're working with C++ code , otx will also try to " unmangle " C++ symbols to their original state .
This is very useful when examining certain Apple frameworks such as CoreUI , much of which is implemented using C++.
For more on CoreUI , see my earlier article here .

Here is an in depth look at Dave Ramsey ’s Baby Steps plan for getting out of debt , building wealth and giving .
The plan really is a pretty simple one , some might say it ’s common sense , but it brings home a lot of concepts that a lot of us do n’t normally think about .
I thought it might be helpful to go over the baby steps and see how they can help you .
Baby Step 0 : Getting Started , Making A Decision To Change
Before getting started on the Baby Steps plan you may not have ever thought about working on your finances before .
You just kind of let your money happen to you .
To get started on this plan you have to make a conscious decision to care about where your money is going , and to live responsibly and within a budget .
For many of us , this will be a quite the shift .
For some people they wo n’t want to make a change until they ’ve hit rock bottom , facing a foreclosure or bankruptcy .
Hopefully you ’re getting started before reaching that point .
Whatever point you ’re at , just remember that you ’re not alone , and you ’re making this change to make your family ’s lives better .
It wo n’t be easy , but nothing worth having ever is !
Commit yourself to living within a budget , and to creating no more consumer debt !
As long as you ’re creating new debt , none of this plan will work !
Once you ’ve made the decision to make a change , cut up the credit cards , get on the same page with your significant other ( if you have one ) , and move on to step 1 !
Baby Step 1 : Save A $ 1,000 Baby Emergency Fund
Baby step one is where you start building up an emergency fund for your family to cover any incidental and emergency expenses that might come up while you ’re paying off all the debt you ’ve created .
Some people do n’t feel secure with only $ 1,000 , and depending upon your circumstances , you may need slightly more .
But $ 1,000 is a good starting point , and for most families will be more than adequate to cover the little expenses that come up for every family .
Get “ gazelle intense ” about saving that first $ 1,000 .
Most people will get it saved in the first 1 - 2 months of the plan .
Baby Step 2 : Pay Off All Debt Using The Debt Snowball
In baby step 2 the family starts their debt reduction portion of the plan .
This is often the hardest part of the plan for most families , especially if a large amount of debt has been created .
To get rid of the debts Ramsey has put together what he calls the “ Debt Snowball ” .
In this plan you setup a debt repayment plan where you pay your necessities first ( food , clothing , shelter , transportation ) , and then you pay the minimums on all of your debts .
Once the minimums are paid , you pay as much extra as you can on the smallest debt .
You continue doing that every month until the smallest debt is paid off .
Once that debt is paid you “ snowball ” all the extra money created by paying that debt off into the next smallest debt .
You continue doing that until all of your debts are paid off .
Some people can get the debt paid off within a few months , where others can take a few years .
In either case it will sometimes be helpful to get part time jobs , sell stuff and do other things to temporarily create extra income to help pay off the debts .
Once the debts are paid off you can quit those part time jobs because you ’re debt free except the house !
Baby Step 3 : 3 - 6 Months of Expenses In Savings
In baby step 3 you continue building that emergency fund that you started in baby step 1 .
Starting from the baby emergency fund of $ 1,000 you build your reserves until you have 3 - 6 months of expenses saved in an easily accessible savings account .
Depending upon your family ’s expenses , the amount you ’re saving up will be different , and some people will prefer to build up more than 6 months of expenses depending on their desired level of risk , and what they feel comfortable with .
Remember , you ’re saving up this money to help eliminate much of the risk that comes from the “ little murphies ” or life ’s unexpected events that just seem to pop up .
Things like car troubles , medical expenses and job losses .
When you have the emergency fund buffer , it makes these life events seem more like bumps in the road instead of horrible car wrecks .
Baby Step 4 : Invest 15 % Of Income in Roth IRAs And Other Pre-Tax Investments
After you ’ve saved up your 3 - 6 months of expenses it ’s time to get cracking on investing and saving for your retirement .
Dave Ramsey suggests saving at least 15 % towards retirement , and saving it in a Roth IRA or other pre-tax investment .
The order he suggests saving for retirement is this :
Company 401k or other plan up to the match
Roth IRA for you and your spouse
Back to the 401k or other plan
Some people debate on whether 15 % is enough to invest , or what types of investments are the best .
For me I believe the key is just to get started investing , and do it now !
Baby Step 5 : College Funding For Children
After saving 15 % of your income for your retirement , it ’s time to save for your child ’s education !
Some people think that this step should come before step 4 , but Ramsey stresses the point that your child will have other options to help fund their education if they need to including scholarships , grants , working part time and other things .
If you do n’t fund your retirement , however , you ’ll never be able to get that money back !
Fund retirement first , and then your children ’s college .
Some good places to save for your kid ’s education include :
Education Savings Account ( ESA ) :
529 Plan
Other options exist as well , but the above options are the best .
Baby Step 6 : Pay Off Your Home Early
Once the children ’s college is paid for , it ’s time to start making extra payments on your house !
There are a lot of good reasons to pay off the house , including :
Less Risk :
With no house payment and a fully funded emergency fund , there are n’t many things that can happen ( like a job loss ) that can threaten your well being .
: With no house payment and a fully funded emergency fund , there are n’t many things that can happen ( like a job loss ) that can threaten your well being .
Peace Of Mind :
With no house payment you ’ll be free to do a lot of things with your time and money that you might not have been able to otherwise .
: With no house payment you ’ll be free to do a lot of things with your time and money that you might not have been able to otherwise .
Interest Savings :
By paying off the house early you ’ll save thousands in interest .
The earlier in the life that you pay the mortgage off , the better you ’ll do !
: By paying off the house early you ’ll save thousands in interest .
The earlier in the life that you pay the mortgage off , the better you ’ll do !
Less Stress :
With no worries about losing a house , paying off debt , or small expenses coming up , you can live a more stress free life !
Paying off your house will free you up to do so many things with your time and money !
It ’s like getting a raise since you ’ll have all that extra money every month .
With that extra money you can save , give and live like no one else !
Baby Step 7 : Build Wealth And Give
The last step of the baby steps is the one that gets me the most excited – building wealth and giving !
When you are debt free and you have no large payments like a mortgage , it frees you up to begin building wealth , and it allows you the freedom to help others with the blessings that you ’ve received .
As a Christian I feel called to give to others , and getting to baby step 7 is something I look forward to because it will allow my wife and I the ability to help others out even more than we are now !
We are stewards of everything that God has given us , and God wants us to give because giving to others makes us less selfish people , and better in every aspect of our lives .
Less selfish people are more successful in relationships , business and in life in general .
Plus , we are happiest when we are serving and giving !
Conclusion
Thanks for taking the time to look at Dave Ramsey ’s 7 baby steps with me , it has truly been a lot of fun for me .
I really do believe that his plan is a good one , and can help others as it has helped my wife and I .
If you ’re looking at your checkbook and accounts and you have a mountain of debt – do n’t delay !
Get started on getting out of debt today !
Step one is only a decision away !
Live like no one else today so that tomorrow you can live like no one else !
He misses interaction with colleagues .
It hinders efficiency , slows work .
He is physically drained from travel .
He is frustrated that he cannot put down roots in America , and maybe start his own company , because he cannot leave Google , his visa sponsor .
He says he feels , on one hand , great gratitude that America gave him extraordinary opportunity .
But he says he fulfilled his side of the bargain by striving and succeeding .
“ Dude , I love this country , ” he said .
But he does n’t feel loved back : “ My devotion is unrequited . ”
To Stay or to Go
On each of Mr. Mavinkurve ’s twice - monthly visits to the United States ( he keeps a room not far from Google ) , he meets with two friends at the Red Mango frozen yogurt shop on University Avenue in the heart of Palo Alto .
Over scoops of green tea yogurt , they brainstorm for their next venture .
But he is not sure he can start a company  at least in America .
Unless he gets his green card and his wife can work , he would be the only breadwinner , risking his savings , and he says they would be unhappy .
“ Quitting Google means saying goodbye to my green card , ” he said .
If America will not have him , he might have to stay in Canada .
The proof is on the wall of the two - bedroom high - rise apartment he shares with his wife  who is pregnant  and his parents , who have moved in with them .
On the living room wall is a Canadian flag .
“ Quality stitching , ” he said , fingering it .
Mr. Mavinkurve , who once hung American flags in his dorm room and then in Google ’s hallway , still loves America .
But the Internet - era immigrant , who moves so quickly between worlds , cannot decide where to land .
Where is Sanjay ?
Even he is not sure where he belongs .
“ I ’m not sure I want to go back , ” he said of the possibility of moving back to the United States .
“ I ’m not sure I can . ”
As The New York Times Co. tries to bask in the glory of having bagged five Pulitzers , the company is facing a cash crunch that could put it on the path toward insolvency .
According to its first - quarter earnings report , the Times said it had cash and cash equivalents totaling $ 294 million .
However , $ 260 million of that is earmarked to pay off debt that matures in March 2010 , effectively leaving the company with $ 34 million .
That ’s a particularly precarious position to be in , given the Gray Lady posted a wider - than - expected , first - quarter loss of $ 74.5 million amid worsening advertising declines , and is scrambling to raise cash as it labors under a $ 1.3 billion debt load .
On top of that , the company finds itself on the hook for a $ 625 million shortfall in its pension and benefit obligations , and could be forced to spend millions to shore it up starting next year .
To be sure , the company made clear that it has room under its credit facility to pay off $ 44.5 million in debt due at the end of the year .
But the Times is having a rough time raising cash , and has few other options .
The company ’s lifeblood — advertising — got walloped in the first quarter , plunging 27 percent , or $ 124 million , and Times CEO Janet Robinson gave a bleak outlook for the second quarter .
However , she said things were looking up for the second half of the year .
“ We do see signs and we hear comments from advertisers that lead us to believe that they are saving dollars in the first half to do possibly more in the second half , ” she said during a conference call .
Yesterday ’s results pummeled the stock .
Shares of the Times fell 16 percent , or 91 cents , to close at $ 4.94 .
The Times lost $ 74.5 million , or 52 cents a share , in the first quarter compared with a loss of $ 335,000 , or break - even on a per - share basis , a year ago .
The results included several one - time items , including severance costs tied to layoffs the company made earlier this year .
Overall revenue fell nearly 19 percent , to $ 609 million .
While most of the drop is concentrated in print , the company ’s Internet businesses , including NYTimes.com and About.com , also took a hit .
Internet ad sales declined 6.1 percent , reflecting the downturn in display advertising .
At About.com , the company ’s information portal , revenue fell 4.7 percent .
Earlier this month , the Times laid off 100 people on the business side and cut pay for many of its newspaper employees by 5 percent .
Last week , the Times said it would eliminate some weekly sections to save money .
The Times is trying to sell its stake in the Boston Red Sox and cut costs at the Boston Globe .
The company , which said the Globe is on track to lose $ 85 million this year , has threatened to close the paper unless the unions agree to $ 20 million in concessions .
In the past year , the Times cut its dividend , mortgaged its headquarters and borrowed $ 225 million at a hefty interest rate from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim .

Advertisement The Tamil Tigers have accused the Sri Lankan government of killing about 1,000 civilians and injuring many more during its latest military offensive .
The government has denied the allegations , in turn accusing the rebel group of targeting civilians .
It said by midday ( 0630 GMT ) nearly 50,000 civilians had fled the rebel - held area in the north of the island .
Meanwhile government forces say they have made inroads into the sliver of territory still held by the Tigers .
They have entered two villages in the zone and in effect control the north - west third of it .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said it was " extremely worried " about civilians still trapped in the zone .
See map of the region " The situation is nothing short of catastrophic .
Ongoing fighting has killed or wounded hundreds of civilians who have only minimal access to medical care , " said Director of Operations Pierre Kraehenbuehl .
Offensive continued A deadline for the rebels to surrender or face a final assault expired at 0630 GMT with no word from the Tigers .
Tough search for truths " The [ Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ] has not responded to the government 's call to surrender , so we are keeping up our offensive to rescue the civilians , " said army spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara .
The Tamil Tigers said in a statement that more than 1,000 civilians had been killed and 2,300 injured during bombardments by government forces on Monday .
The rebel TamilNet website said the territory they still controlled was littered with bodies of civilians .
Video released by Tamil supporters shows mutilated bodies , but it is not clear when the recording was made .
They said it was filmed on Monday , but this can not be verified .
It follows footage released by the government showing civilians fleeing the war zone .
One man who said he spoke for the Tigers , who gave his name as Thileepan , told the BBC a hospital , an orphanage and many houses had been hit .
He said people had been reduced to hiding under logs and trees and using makeshift bunkers dug into the sand .
' Human avalanche '
The Sri Lankan military has denied shelling civilians inside the rebel - held area .
Brig Nanayakkara told the BBC that only small - arms had been used .
He said the Tigers were targeting civilians because they knew that if non-combatants left , the rebels would be " sitting ducks " .
The army says three rebel suicide bombings had targeted fleeing civilians , killing 17 .
Thousands of civilians are leaving the conflict zone One Tamil man who had just left the conflict zone said the rebels tried to shoot anyone planning to escape .
Local newspapers are covered with pictures of large numbers of people leaving rebel territory , says the BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo .
One calls the process a " human avalanche " .
Reports suggest hospitals in the fighting zone were struggling to cope .
" We 've had lots of dead bodies brought to the hospital , others are on the road , " a health worker at Matalan hospital told the BBC World Service .
" Lots of the injured who are taken to the hospital die from blood loss - there is no blood - bank and a lot of people are anaemic because there is no food .
People are suffering . "
People escaped after troops broke through a fortification which had been blocking their advance into the Tigers ' last stronghold , the army said on Monday .
TAMIL TIGER DEFENCES BREACHED BY SRI LANKA ARMY 1 . 12 km - long defensive earthworks constructed by Tamil Tigers using mechanical diggers 2 . Sri Lankan army uses explosives to destroy a 3 km section 3 .
Gap allows thousands of refugees to flee Tiger - held territory
Aerial video showed thousands of people filing out of the combat zone .
Tens of thousands remain in the area , which has seen heavy fighting for months .
The government says more than 49,000 have now left , more than 2,000 of them by sea on fishing boats .
They are on their way to government - run transit camps which Western media have no access to , it adds .
The pro-rebel TamilNet website said several hundred civilians were feared killed and injured after troops advanced into the zone .
Tamil protesters held angry demonstrations in Paris and London on Monday against the army operations .
About 180 people were arrested in Paris as the protest there turned violent .
' Nightmare ' Sri Lanka 's defence ministry said on Tuesday troops were advancing into what was previously designated by the government as a safe zone .
It said another 3,000 civilians left the conflict zone on Tuesday .
Each side accuses the other of killing civilians in the long running civil conflict .
Foreign reporters are not allowed into the combat zone , making it impossible to independently verify the claims .
The Tigers are restricted to a 20 sq km ( 12.4 sq miles ) coastal patch .
Gordon Weiss , the UN spokesman in Sri Lanka , said it was not known how many civilians remained there but that the UN had been working off a figure of some 150,000 to 200,000 people in recent months .
The government is not giving the ICRC access to the landward side of the zone .
So it can only evacuate people by sea , with two or three ships per week each carrying 400 or 500 of the sickest , oldest and most badly wounded people .

The big brother of the MPAA has Newzbin , the world 's most prominent newsgroup indexer , firmly in its sights .
Newzbin , which indexes Usenet and offers its members NZB files , is being sued by the MPA , the global lobby group for the movie industry .
The pair are set to fight it out in court , possibly before the end of the year .
While most media attention is focused on the mighty BitTorrent , availability of just about every type of copyrighted digital media continues unabated on Usenet , otherwise known as ‘ the newsgroups ’ .
Downloads from Usenet are fast – very fast – with most transfers maxing out the user ’s Internet connection .
Add to this the excellent security offered by Usenet ( people do n’t get infringement notices when downloading ) and Usenet can prove very attractive , even to the hardened BitTorrent user .
Like most things , however , Usenet has its drawbacks .
The main problem lies with its complexity – the learning curve can be a little steep – but with amazing little things called .
NZB files , downloading is made almost as easy as BitTorrent .
NZB files contain meta -data and without splitting too many hairs , they function in a very similar way to .torrent files .
Download an NZB , load it into a news client such as Grabit and very quickly the download is complete .
Newzbin is one of the original Usenet indexing sites and the creator of the NZB “ >.
NZB format , which opened Usenet downloading to the masses .
In May 2008 it received a threatening letter from the Motion Picture Association ( MPA ) .
In the letter , the MPA claimed that some of Newzbin ’s editors were listing NZBs which linked to movies on Usenet which infringed their member ’s copyright .
In October 2008 , ‘ Caesium ’ , the owner of Newzbin made an announcement .
“ Newzbin has recently received two serious complaints regarding the indexing we perform , and raising doubts as to its legality .
It is likely that we will in the coming weeks be presented with a court case and have to defend our rights . ”
Noting that Newzbin would defend itself vigorously against the complainants , Caesium said he believed that linking to content on Usenet is entirely legal and that the site ’s procedures for dealing with unlawful content is appropriate .
“ We believe that , or we would n’t still be here , ” he added .
At the start of December 2008 , Newzbin confirmed that it had indeed been removing NZB files that link to infringing movies on Usenet .
However , this was n’t enough for the MPA , who filed an injunction against Newzbin .
Now , four months later , the site is still operating as normal but has received more details about its upcoming battle with the movie companies .
“ The latest we ’ve heard is that there will be an interim hearing ( to hash out administrative details ) sometime in the next couple of months , and the case itself will be heard in court sometime between November 2009 and January 2010 , ” said Caesium in an announcement .
It is far from clear how the legal system will view the operations at Newzbin – no other site of its type has ever appeared in court in the UK , or elsewhere in the world .
Newzbin has already been considering that in order to be completely sure of staying within the law it may have to automate its operations and remove human intervention in the creation of its NZB files .
While Newzbin has never , ever hosted any copyright infringing material , previously another newsgroup - related company Usenet.com was sued by the RIAA for actually hosting illicit content .
Usenet.com was also criticized over its advertising , which is alleged to encourage piracy .
( Warning , explicit content : the video below shows a man being shot to death ) .
In the early hours of New Year 's Day , 27 - year - old BART police officer Johannes Mehserle shot and killed 22 - year old Oscar Grant .
A number of people who were riding the BART train that night witnessed the shooting , and shot video or photos on handheld cameras or phones .
The victim 's family today filed a lawsuit for $ 25 million .
Five days after the shooting , the accused officer still has not given a statement .
He is said to be have received death threats and authorities are apparently moving him from place to place to protect him from harm .
Some people are speculating the shooting may have been an accident — the officer may have grabbed his gun by mistake because he thought he was instead grabbing a Taser device .
I have operated both devices , though certainly not in those extreme stress conditions , and I find that argument hard to understand .
The weapons are so different .
Snip from SF Chron article , to that point :
[ Use - of - force training and research firm founder Bruce Siddle ] said changes in how the brain processes information in a stressful situation might have led the officer to mistake the butt of his service weapon for the Taser .
But other experts found the idea that the shooting resulted from such a mix - up hard to believe .
" That 's as reflexive as you getting in on the driver 's side of the car ( instead of ) the passenger side if you want to drive it , " [ Florida criminologist George ] Kirkham said .
" There 's no remote similarity to a conventional firearm . …
The Taser is just like apples and oranges . "
The fact that so many videos and images are surfacing in this case is significant , because each set of images provides a different view of the killing , with different visual information .
Snip from that same SF Chron article :
Roy Bedard , who has trained police officers around the world , advanced a different theory after his first viewing of the video : that the shooting was a pure accident , a trigger pulled because of a loss of balance or a loud noise .
But in an indication of how the videos might move the investigation , Bedard reached a different conclusion after viewing the shooting from a different angle .
" Looking at it , I hate to say this , it looks like an execution to me , " he said .
" It really looks bad for the officer . …
We have to get inside his head and figure out what he was thinking when he fired the shot . "
I first heard about the story from Jake Appelbaum 's blog : BART Police ( in Oakland ) murdered a man on NYE .
Here is one video ( nsa.org ) .
Here is another released by a Bay Area CBS affiliate — first , we see the entire , raw footage a 19 year old eyewitness shot on her camcorder , then we hear her explain what she saw and experienced — she says a female BART police officer tried to forcibly confiscate her camcorder .
Here is still another video ( You Tube ) , and many YouTube users are annotating and re-uploading video to offer amateur opinions on what 's going on , and who did what , why .
How can you write a Haskell predicate that detects ( without diverging ) that both of these two infinite trees are unsorted ?
The fair - predicates library gives an answer .
There are comments on reddit .
A year and a half of debate over filtering pornography out of San Jose public library computers came to a head late Tuesday when the City Council rejected spending money on the technology .
After a lively debate that lasted hours , the council voted 7 - 3 to approve a proposal by the vice mayor and two councilmen that would remind computer users of existing policies to be courteous to others .
Mayor Chuck Reed and council members Pete Constant , who led the push for the filters , and Pierluigi Oliverio were opposed , favoring filters in children ’s areas .
“ There are a lot of different ways to protect our children , ” said Councilman Sam Liccardo who sponsored the approved proposal along with Vice Mayor Judy Chirco and Councilman Ash Kalra .
The proposal argued the city should first find more money to expand library hours , school crossing guards and sex - crime detectives .
Liccardo compared filtering to “ fighting a global naval strategy by deploying all our ships to Lake Tahoe . ”
At Tuesday ’s meeting , dozens of residents lined up to speak , with advocates arguing filters will protect kids from easy access to porn in the libraries .
Debbie Mendez said that on a visit to her local branch library last summer , a man seated next to her and her son and daughter was viewing pornography , and the librarian said there was not much she could do about it .
“ I was blown away , ” Mendez said .
Critics argued filtering technology still is too costly and too crude to avoid blocking legitimate research , as it was when the council rejected filters as ineffective in 1997 .
They claim the problem is being exaggerated .
“ The fear is not based on fact , ” said Tina Morrill .
“ We can use this money to keep our library hours longer . ”
Constant , who suggested porn filters in October 2007 after news surfaced that men were viewing sexually explicit images on city library computers , proposed along with Reed that the city adopt a policy similar to Santa Clara County libraries .
Under Constant ’s proposal , library computer users would have been told when they log in to be mindful that children may be present and to act responsibly .
The city would have installed technology to filter Internet content on computers in children ’s areas at city branch libraries .
Pending additional funding , the technology would have been installed on other computers in branch libraries , with users having the option to disengage it .
The city also would have discussed computer policy with San Jose State University for the jointly run Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. main library downtown .
The head librarian said it would cost $ 90,000 to install filters in children ’s areas , although filtering advocates offered to raise $ 40,000 toward startup costs and Constant said ongoing annual cost would be about $ 5,000 .

ISS and Astronaut
Credit & Copyright : Ralf Vandebergh
Explanation :
These two frames , taken with a video camera and a telescope , reveal remarkable details of the International Space Station ( ISS ) orbiting some 350 kilometers above planet Earth .
Recorded during last month 's visit by the crew of shuttle orbiter Discovery on mission STS - 119 , the pictures show extended solar arrays glinting in bright sunlight against a dark sky .
They also likely capture the blurred image of a spacewalking astronaut during the mission 's EVA - 2 ( Extravehicular Activity - 2 ) !
The astronaut is installing equipment along one of the station 's truss assemblies .
Astronomer Ralf Vandebergh , who often images the ISS during its favorable passes through Dutch skies , comments that no other bright ISS structures occupy the position indicated in the inset , and that a reflective , white - suited astronaut would be visible against the truss and correspond to the bright blur .
Vandebergh notes that the timing and location further suggest the spacewalker is STS - 119 astronaut Joseph Acaba .

RUNS EUROPE
On May 22 2009 I will begin a run from Amsterdam to Athens .
The run will carry me over 2,300 miles through 7 countries and will take about 4 months to complete .
I will be completely unsupported , carrying only the bare necessities on my back .
I will average almost 20 miles per day .
Sounds crazy right ?
Well , add to that no reservations and no money for lodging and you ’ve got ... one sweet adventure .
In order to meet new people , I ’m nixing the hotel and hoping that I can depend on hospitality as frequently as possible .
Every day I ’m going to wake up , put on my gear , and run for a few hours .
When I get to the next town , I ’ll have the whole day to : recuperate / find food / practice my French , German , and Italian ( or pick up some Dutch or Greek ) / discover something new / see some architecture / make new friends / wash up / update my log / find somewhere to sleep / do whatever else comes up .
Then I ’ll go to sleep , and the next day I ’ll wake up and do it again ... for four months .
This website is devoted to this trip : to allowing my friends and family to follow my run and to spreading the word to anyone who might want to help make this dream become reality .
The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of " a few bad apples " acting on their own .
The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees .
Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies , and compromised our moral authority .
-- From the Executive Summary of the Senate Armed Services Committee Armed Services Committee Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody .
The report on abuse of captured terrorist suspects that the Senate Armed Services Committee completed last November has now been declassified .
All 263 pages with light redacting can be read on - line here .
( Warning : pdf. )
As Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin said in a press release , the report " connects the dots . "
It points out , among other things , that the Defense Department was involved in developing CIA interrogation methods .
Mark Benjamin , who has long covered torture and related issues for Salon.com , writes :
The Senate Armed Services Committee has just released an exhaustive review of torture under the Bush administration that , among other revelations , torpedoes the notion that the administration only chose torture as a last resort .
Bush officials have long argued that they turned to coercive interrogations in 2002 only after captured al - Qaida suspects would n't talk , but the report shows the administration set the wheels in motion soon after 9/11 .
The Bush White House began planning for torture in December 2001 , set up a program to develop the interrogation techniques by the next month , and the military and the CIA began training interrogators in coercive practices in early 2002 , before they had any high - value al - Qaida suspects or any trouble eliciting information from detainees .
As the report puts it , " The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees . "
The report undercuts the Obama administration 's case for leniency against the CIA , since the agency was pursuing abusive techniques even before Department of Justice lawyers had issued their supposed legal justification for the techniques in August 2002 .
In another piece at Salon , Mike Madden reports :
" The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not simply a result of a few soldiers acting on their own , " the Senate report says .
" Interrogation techniques such as stripping detainees of their clothes , placing them in stress positions and using military working dogs to intimidate them appeared in Iraq only after they had been approved for use in Afghanistan and at [ Guantánamo ] ...
Rumsfeld 's authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques and subsequent interrogation policies and plans approved by senior military and civilian officers conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in U.S. military custody .
What followed was an erosion in standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely . "
The Bush administration , including Rumsfeld , all treated Abu Ghraib as the actions of a few rogue soldiers .
Eleven enlisted personnel were convicted of crimes because of the way they treated Iraqis held there ; the longest sentence , 10 years , went to former Cpl. Charles Graner .
( One officer , Lt. Col .
Steven Jordan , was convicted of disobeying an order not to discuss the case , but acquitted on more serious charges . )
But the Senate investigation , completed last fall but only released this week , found the abuses there -- forcing prisoners into " stress positions , " stripping them naked , menacing them with dogs -- were directly inspired by similar behavior top administration officials had already approved elsewhere .
" Rumsfeld 's authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at Guantánamo Bay was a direct cause of detainee abuse there , " the report says .
The approval from the defense secretary " influenced and contributed to the use of abusive techniques , including military working dogs , forced nudity and stress positions , in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Salon reported on Rumsfeld 's early involvement in the development of the interrogation programs in 2006 .
A matter - of - fact narrative with a clinical tone , the Senate report runs through exactly when various military and civilian officials knew about and authorized what kinds of behavior .
And it adds a bitter irony to Rumsfeld 's claims that he only learned about Abu Ghraib after the worst abuses had already happened ( he later called the day he heard about the prison scandal " the worst day " of his tenure at the Pentagon ) .
SASC also takes on the use of psychologists in devising , implementing and participating in torture .
As was reported by Katherine Eban in the July 17 , 2007 , issue of Vanity Fair , two psychologists , James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , " reverse - engineered " a program the Pentagon uses to prepare American pilots and others in the military for the torture they may face if captured by the enemy .
That is , the two men used techniques employed to help Americans endure captivity to create a torture regimen for use against prisoners at Guantánamo and secret CIA prisons scattered across the globe .
Other psychologists also participated in torture as part a Behavioral Science Consultation Team , including torture of at least one juvenile .
Six months after Eban ’s story appeared , a public affairs officer at Joint Task Force Guantánamo " interviewed " Army Col.
Larry James , director of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team :
Since the guards here are so well trained and motivated before they arrive in Guantanamo Bay , James said BSCT training serves as a refresher for skills already ingrained in many of these Troopers .
" When I walk through the camps , I ca n’t tell you that I have stumbled across a lot of things that are wrong .
During my time here , I am proud to say that I have not seen a guard or interrogator abuse anyone in any shape or form , " said James .
As a consequence of the psychologists ’ participation in torture , the American Psychological Association underwent a three - year - long internal rebellion as the old leadership sought to give its imprimatur to psychologists working with the military and a large majority of the membership eventually voting in a referendum to stop it .
The SASC report released tonight spurred Physicians for Human Rights , the advocacy organization that has been in the forefront in the fight against torture for years , to call for
... the psychologists who justified , designed , and implemented torture for the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Department of Defense ( DoD ) , to lose their professional licenses and to face criminal prosecution .
" Long before Justice Department lawyers were tasked to justify torture , US psychologists were busy actually perpetrating it , " said Stephen Reisner , PhD , Advisor on Psychological Ethics at PHR .
" These individuals must not only face prosecution for breaking the law , they must lose their licenses for shaming their profession ’s ethics . " ...
" The Senate Armed Services Committee confirms what we have long known — health professionals were the agents that spread the virus of torture , " said Nathaniel Raymond , Director of PHR ’s Campaign Against Torture which brings together thousands of health professionals who oppose torture in all circumstances .
" Now is the time for those who violated our laws and our values to be held to account . "
PHR is renewing its call to Congress and the White House to immediately create a non-partisan commission to investigate the Bush Administration ’s use of torture , with a specific focus on the role that psychologists and medical professionals played in its design , justification , supervision , and use .
PHR has produced three horrifying reports on torture , Break Them Down : Systematic Use of Psychological Torture by U.S. Forces , Leave No Marks : Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality , and Broken Laws , Broken Lives : Medical Evidence of Torture by the US .
Senator Levin said Tuesday night :
In my judgment , the report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration ’s interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse – such as that seen at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay , and Afghanistan – to low ranking soldiers .
Claims , such as that made by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the unauthorized acts of a " few bad apples , " were simply false .
The truth is that , early on , it was senior civilian leaders who set the tone .
Other stories about the declassified report can be read at Time – Report Details Pentagon Role in Torture Tactics ; The Atlantic – Military 's Interrogation Techniques : A History ; the Washington Post – Harsh Tactics Readied Before Their Approval , and McClatchy - Report : Abusive tactics were used to find Iraq -al Qaida link .
Django Techblog markup system
Django Tech Blog is now running my blog .
It is only fitting that my first post on the new system is about the technology behind it .
I never intended to compete with Wordpress on number of features , and Techblog was never intended to be an all - things - to - everyone type of web application , but I can boast a few features that set it apart .
I 'll cover some of those features in future posts , for now I would like to go over the light - weight markup language I use for posts .
I 've noticed that when working on ITProPortal.com , and other content driven sites , that adding additional content to a page was always a major under - taking .
Adding a new content area to a page typically required adding a field to the model and some interface work .
I figured it would be nice to build a generic system where the various pieces of content are stored in a single field in the database and created as required .
I guess that XML would be the obvious choice for such a system , but writing XML is best left to machines – in my opinion .
Rather , I settled on a simple markup that I call extended - postmarkup .
In an extended - markup post , the text is divided up in to sections , which are ultimately transformed in to HTML and inserted in the page .
Each section consists of one or more chunks , which are a collection of lines that are passed through a specified Django template .
The default chunk template passes the lines to a bbcode filter and turns each line in to a paragraph , but any other kind of text processing could be done .
A line in the markup is parsed as an extended - markup directive if it begins with a { character and ends with a } character .
A new section is introduced with a directive that begins with a .
character followed by the name of the section , chunks are introduced with two .
characters .
The name of a chunk maps directly to the name of a Django template .
For instance the {.. code} chunk directive causes the subsequent lines to be rendered with markupchunks / code . html which does syntax highlighting .
Here 's an example of some simple extended markup :
{.main}
This is the [ b ] main body [ / b ] of the post , and will be turned in to paragraphs .
{..code}
{..language=python}
print " Hello , World ! "
{..}
Back to paragraphs again .
{..html}
< blink > There is also raw HTML if you must !</ blink >
{.column2}
This goes in the second column .
{.footer}
This goes in the footer .
The code above introduces some other abilities of extended markup .
The {.. language =python} directive sets a chunk variable , which is also passed to the chunk template ; in the code above it is the name of the language to do syntax highlighting , but there can be any number of key / value pairs set for chunks .
There is also a chunk directive with no name ( {..} ) , this sets the chunk type back to the default .
… this simple system means I can create ad - hoc features in a post such as pull - quotes
That 's all there is to authoring extended - markup , but this simple system means I can create ad - hoc features in a post such as pull - quotes , and even use different markups such as markdownand reStructuredText .
Here is another example , used in this post to create the list of links you should be able to see at the top of the right - hand column .
{..linkslist}
{..priority =200}
{..title=An example links list}
My blog
|http://www.willmcgugan.com
Planet Python
|http://planet.python.org
The markup is not limited to the visible parts of the site ; in this blog there are sections marked out for CSS and Javascript , so I can make style tweaks and demonstrate Javascript techniques without having to link to an external page .
This is a techblog after all …
If you want to play with the code , head over to the django - techblogproject page on Google Code .
It is completely lacking in documentation or comments , but that may improve in the future .
That 's all for now , I 'll write up more techblog features in the coming days .
I 'll also be doing a lot more blogging on other topics , as I need to be able to justify to myself , spending 4 months of spare - time on this !
This page grew out of a conversation on the Usenet comp.os.linux.hardware newsgroup .
It can be frustrating for Free Software users to buy a new graphics card because there is very little information available about 3D / OpenGL graphics support and performance in the Free Software community .
Some users opt to install proprietary graphics card drivers because of the limited support available in current free software drivers .
X. Org includes Direct Rendering Infrastructure ( DRI ) support for a variety of 3D graphics hardware but often does n't support every feature or does n't offer performance as fast as that of the proprietary drivers .
This website was created for those of us who prefer to use only Free Software or Open Source software .
It provides information about video cards with 3D acceleration support and benchmarks to give an idea of their performance .
We also provide performance information for cards that rely solely on software emulation for 3D support .
Based on our results to date , this card represents the highest 3D / OpenGL performance currently available in the Free Software community .
DISCLAIMER
Please see the FAQ before basing a purchasing decision on this recommendation , particularly if you have very specific 3D acceleration needs .
To find general information on the status of DRI support for other hardware , check the Freedesktop DRI Status page and the Mesa DRI CVS .
While not always up to date , the best overview of DRI support is the Freedesktop DRI Feature Matrix .
If you 're looking for general technical information on the hardware itself , a good starting place is the 3D Chipset Specs website .
Wacco Project VGA is working on a more minimal Free Hardware design for a PCI graphics card that meets the complete VGA specification for around $ 100 .
Once done , they may work on a PCI -E card and 2D acceleration .
The Open - Graphics project is attempting to develop an Free Hardware design for a graphics card with 3D acceleration and drivers that fully support X 3D / OpenGL acceleration .
They need help with hardware design review , documentation , driver development and more .
To find out more or volunteer to help , visit one of these sites :
The UtahGLX project has some older code supporting the nVidia Riva , TNT , and GeForce hardware .
This could could be ported to DRI and used in the nv driver , perhaps in conjunction with the nouveau project .
No one is currently working on this .
A volunteer familiar with X and DRI is needed .
See the DRI nVidia page for details .
The users that have installed the proprietary driver can help the development of Nouveau , by sending information about their cards , see http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/REnouveauDumps
The nouveau project is attempting to reverse engineer nVidia 3D acceleration and develop working DRI support for Xorg .
They have developed a number of tools to assist with the process and need help primarily from software developers familiar with X and DRI .
The r300 project has developed an experimental driver for ATI cards based on the R300 series of chips ( including the Radeon 9500 and newer cards ) .
The R300 code has been moved into the Mesa CVS but still needs additional work .
The X. Org Wiki Intel i810 driver page needs to be updated with more information about what hardware is supported , who maintains the code , links to the GIT or CVS archives , and any other helpful info you can think of .
Anyone is welcome to sign in and edit the page .
See the X .
Org nv page for ideas .
The X. Org Wiki Radeon driver page needs to be updated with more information about what hardware is supported , who maintains the code , links to the GIT or CVS archives , and any other helpful info you can think of .

To gather the results in the table below , a simple shell script was proposed Henrik Carlqvist in a comp.os.linux.hardware discussion and subsequently revised by Michael Mauch and others .
This script uses glxgears to get a frame rate for 3D rendering .
We are aware glxgears is n't intended as a benchmark .
It 's been compared to bogomips for graphics cards .
But it is readily available on almost every computer running Xorg and provides an interesting , if non-accurate baseline for comparing hardware .
If you can propose something better that will run on as many systems without needing to download and compile special benchmarking tools , please let us know .
But see the FAQ before emailing to complain that you think glxgears sucks as a benchmark .
We already know that .
This is the current version of the script :
grep VGA / proc / pci || lspci | grep VGA | colrm 1 4 ; \ egrep " model name | MHz " / proc / cpuinfo ; \ xdpyinfo | egrep " version : |dimensions|depth of " ; \ glxinfo | egrep - A2 " direct rendering | OpenGL vendor " ; \ uname - sr ; \ vblank_mode=0 glxgears & sleep 30 ; killall glxgears
You can help by running this script on your hardware and reporting the results in the table below .
The goal is to keep the list sorted in descending order by performance based on the glxgears FPS rating .
If you 're familiar with Wiki syntax , feel free to create an account and add your results directly to the table below .
Otherwise , you can email them to me and I 'll add them .
Please note that we are only interested in the results produced by Free Software or Open Source Software .
If you are using a proprietary driver your results will not be helpful to us .
Note 1 : on newer versions of glxgears , it may be necessary to add - printfps to get the FPS number .
Note 2 : on recent versions of X. Org ( 7.2 and newer ) xdpyinfo reports the XServer version instead of the X.
Org version .
So X. Org 7.2 == XServer 1.3 , X. Org 7.3 == XServer 1.4 etc .
Do n't worry about it , just send us the output . :)
Note 3 : Occasionally some distros do n't report everything properly .
Looks over your results and if you see some information missing that 's in all the other results reported in the table below , try to look it up manually and include it .
Thanks !
Note 4 : The above script will run glxgears at the default priority on your system .
It has been suggested that running it at a higher priority will be more accurate .
While this will generate higher numbers , it probably does n't reflect how your system is used in the real world .
If you 'd like to try this , the following commands will do it .
su root nice -n - 19 sh -c ' glxgears& sleep 30 ; kill $!'
Realistically though , we 'd prefer you report the numbers you get at the default priority for two reasons , 1 ) it makes it easier to compare with the existing data and 2 ) it better reflects real world usage .
Note 5 : It turns out that the Linux kernel version does play a role .
E.g. , the system that achieved 6295 fps with Linux - 2.6.17 achieves over 8000 fps with 2.6.25.5 ( everything else stayed the same ) ; so you might want to mention the version of the kernel in the Notes column .
Note 6 : It is no longer possible to determine what video driver your system uses from looking at the xorg.conf file on either Fedora or Ubuntu distros of GNU / Linux .
We expect this to be the case with more distros soon .
At present we 're not aware of any easy way for an end user to determine what video driver they 're using on newer GNU / Linux distros .
If anyone else knows a way to do this , please enlighten us .
Meanwhile , the best we can suggest is to grep / var / log / Xorg.0.log ( of Fedora systems at least ) for the term “ autoconfigured ” .
You should get a result such as “ (= Matched ati for the autoconfigured driver ” - this means you 're using the ATI video driver .
Others see the pervasiveness of the inexpensive sweetener as a symbol of the ill effects of government subsidies given to large agribusiness interests like corn growers .
But the most common argument has to do with the rapid rise of obesity in the United States , which began in the 1980s , not long after industrial - grade high - fructose corn syrup was invented .
As the amount of the sweetener in the American diet has expanded , so have Americans .
Although the price differential has since dropped by about half , high - fructose corn syrup came on the market as much as 20 percent cheaper than sugar .
And it was easier to transport .
As a result , the sweetener soon turned up in all kinds of products , including soda , bread , yogurt , frozen foods and spaghetti sauce .
But with sugar newly ascendant , the makers of corn syrup are fighting back .
Last fall , the Corn Refiners Association mounted a multimillion - dollar defense , making sure that an advertisement linking to the association ’s Web site , sweetsurprise.com , pops up when someone types “ sugar ” or “ high - fructose corn syrup ” into some search engines .
In one television advertisement , a mother pours fruit punch into a cup while another scolds her because the punch contains high - fructose corn syrup .
When pressed to explain why it is so bad , the complaining mother is portrayed as a speechless fool .
Audrae Erickson , president of the Corn Refiners Association , said consumers were being duped .
“ When they discover they are being misled into thinking these new products are healthier , that ’s the interesting angle , ” Ms. Erickson said in an interview .
Although researchers are looking into the effects of fructose on liver function , insulin production and other possible contributors to excess weight gain , no major studies have made a definitive link between high - fructose corn syrup and poor health .
The American Medical Association says that when it comes to obesity , there is no difference between the syrup and sugar .
Flash SSDs Can Suffer From Power Saving Features
We were in the middle of setting up a new storage test system to replace our aged platform when we noticed something really strange : Intel ’s top - of - the - line X25 - E flash solid state disk ( SSD ) delivered less throughput on the new test system than it did on the old one .
It took us a few days to isolate the reason , and our findings are noteworthy , as they illustrate the first practical bottleneck for flash SSDs .
Mainly , they cannot provide their maximum performance if you take advantage of processor and platform power saving features .
We further explored our findings by enabling and disabling various power saving options , using two X58 motherboards from Gigabyte and Supermicro .
Updating The Storage Testing Platform
We ’ve been using our storage reference platform for more than four years , as it has allowed us to compare test results of drives and controllers since the introduction of the system .
All hard drive tests , such as the recent budget drive roundup , our short stroking analysis or some testing on acoustic management , together with all tests for our 3.5 ” Desktop HDD charts , 2.5 ” Notebook HDD charts , Flash SSD charts and Enterprise HDD charts , were conducted on this platform .
It was based on an Intel Xeon Nocona single - core processor with 3.6 GHz and 1 MB L2 cache ( Prescott generation ) and the E7520 server platform , which was the first to offer PCI -X and PCI Express .
Both the platform and the storage controller — a Promise SATA 300TX4 controller — are rather outdated now , so we decided to switch to a Supermicro X8SAX and a Core i7 920 processor .
The Issue : Performance Numbers Were Off
The new system is fast , and it comes with the latest Intel ICH10R southbridge .
But its throughput using our fastest SATA drive — an Intel X25 - E enterprise flash SSD — was lower than on our old storage system .
Instead of reaching 200 MB/s , the new Core i7 system was limited to 182 MB/s .
At this point , we have to underscore that the X25 - E is capable of delivering 230 MB/s , and it was only limited to 200 MB/s on our prior storage reference system by the old controller .
Since all of our tests were performed on this controller , results were comparable at all times , but this performance drop made us scratch our heads .
Isolating The Performance Break
A BIOS update by Supermicro did not solve the issue , so we began our analysis by trying a second motherboard , which was a Gigabyte EX58 - UD4P , so we could see whether or not the issue was related to the Supermicro motherboard .
This was n’t the cause , as the throughput on Gigabyte ’s X58 motherboard was also somewhat bottlenecked .
We measured a maximum read throughput of 186 MB/s ; better , but still miles away from the expected 230 MB/s maximum .
So we went on and disabled all unwanted components and BIOS features , until we were able to find the culprit : the bottleneck begins as soon as you start using processor and platform power saving features .
6 Reasons Why Twitter is the Future of Search – Google Beware
This past week the tech world was abuzz with news of Twitter incorporating search functionality into its site .
What this means is that you can now easily obtain trending data for popular keywords , take a deeper look at the topics people are talking about in real time , and find answers to pressing questions that others have already written about .
So is this really significant ?
It depends on who you ask .
Some think that Twitter is a Google killer while others argue that Twitter is n’t even a search engine at all .
Regardless of which side of the fence you stand , there ’s no doubt that Twitter has a bright future with its eyes set on the search market .
In fact , Twitter continues to receive millions in funding and recently turned down a $ 500 million offer from Facebook because of its planned business model of Q&A features and search ads .
Who knew status updates could be so valuable ?
Meanwhile , Facebook has been adding Twitter - like features to try and keep up …
So really , what ’s the big deal about Twitter ?
Is n’t it just a social media site used to socialize with friends ?
Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google , goes as far as to call it the “ poor man ’s email system ” .
But the people who really get it understand the huge potential that lies within Twitter .
Not only is it a way to connect and interact with others , but it also represent a huge pool of information based on everyday human life that ’s ready to be mined to extract real value .
Adding search functionality is just the first step in this process .
Not to mention that Twitter already has an impressive track record with various uses .
For example , it helped President Barack Obama with his presidential campaign , got a student out of an Egyptian jail , documented plane crashes in real time , and made Dell a million dollars .
Twitter has a huge cultish following and is promoted through a grassroots movement that we have n’t seen since …well , the beginning of Google .
Despite all of the hype , Twitter is still in its infancy and it ’ll be years , maybe even a decade , before it develops the technology to accurately display search results and put a dent in Google ’s market share .
But regardless of all that , the point I want to make in this article is that Twitter has what it takes to get there .
In other words , Twitter represents the future of search .
Still not convinced ?
Let me explain …
6 Reasons Why Twitter is the Future of Search
1 . Takes social to a whole new level
Twitter is essentially a continuous conversation that takes place online between millions of people .
Imagine the insights you could gain if you were able to record and search through everyone ’s conversations .
Of course , it ’s a lot less creepy than that but that ’s the kind of tool Twitter is becoming as more and more people take part and share parts of their lives .
Twitter search is the ultimate social media platform and will enable people to get the opinions of others and add context to relevant information .
Searchers do n’t just want facts .
They want to learn more about the experiences of real people they can relate to .
For example , rather than doing a search in Google for “ best restaurants in new york ” and getting a bunch of review sites , you can do a search on Twitter to see which restaurants people are talking about in New York .
If you do n’t like the results , you can easily ask your network and get personalized answers in real time – which will then show up in future searches on the same topic .
Compare that to Google .
They ’ve been unsuccessful thus far in implementing social factors into the search results via Search Wiki .
If you do a search in Google and ca n’t find what you ’re looking for , what are you going to do ?
Probably ask around on Twitter .
2. Combats information overload
With millions of new web pages springing up every day on the Internet , who has the time or attention span to read through it all ?
We need filters , and that ’s what Twitter provides in 140 characters or less .
Twitter is great for searching for quick information and even if you ’re looking for long articles , there are plenty of people who post links to relevant pages they like .
3. Real - time content
In this day and age , nobody wants to wait for anything .
We live in a society where we get everything fast and ca n’t stand for anything else .
The same applies to information and news .
Until recently , we had to wait for journalists to write up reports and publish them online .
Google would then index the pages and show them in the search results , but not after at least a couple of hours .
Good , but not good enough .
Twitter displays real time streams of news and information .
There ’s no need to wait , and short of actually being there to experience the events , it ’s the next best thing .
Twitter has been a great tool for people to broadcast news live from their laptops and mobile phones ( e.g. plane crash rescue in the Hudson River ) .
4. Represents the masses
Twitter levels the playing field and gives everyone a voice online .
In the “ Twitterverse ” , information is a lot more representative of the masses rather than of big corporations and personalities who manipulate people with their ideas .
Power is transferred from the controllers of the web ( e.g. Google , big news companies , powerful Wikipedia editors , online publishers ) to millions of everyday social media users .
We ’d be able to rely less on big news sources and drill down to the micro level ( i.e. experiences of individuals rather than just in aggregate ) .
5 . More trustworthy results
A big advantage Twitter has over Google is that it has the potential to be both a social media platform and a search engine .
Users have the option of getting answers from their network of people who they actually trust .
On the other hand , Google gives you a page of links compiled by their quality algorithm .
Sure , Google returns pretty good search results most of the time , but they ’re impersonal and sometimes irrelevant to what you really want .
Getting in touch with your network via Twitter is the best way to get reliable information you can trust .
For example , if you had a question about life in the NBA , would you rather ask Shaquille O’Neal on Twitter or type a question in Google ?
6 . Better targeted for location
How does Google know whether or not a page is relevant to a local geographic region ?
Unless the page is labeled correctly , Google has no idea .
Twitter , on the other hand , can easily tie content to a location by using user profile settings or GPS ( as technology advances on mobile phones ) .
This in turn means more relevant information and ads in Twitter search .
So what are your thoughts on Twitter as a search engine ?
Does it have a chance to get in the ring with Google ?

We are on the edge of two potent technological changes : Clouds and Memory Based Architectures .
This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper .
Google is the master of disk .
You can't beat them at a game they perfected .
Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts , typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change .
The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed .
The tipping point will be soon .
Let 's take a short trip down web architecture lane :
It 's 1993 : Yahoo runs on FreeBSD , Apache , Perl scripts and a SQL database
It 's 1995 : Scale - up the database .
It 's 1998 : LAMP
It 's 1999 : Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN
It 's 2001 : In - memory data - grid .
It 's 2003 : Add a caching layer .
It 's 2004 : Add scale - out and partitioning .
It 's 2005 : Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system .
It 's 2007 : Move it all into the cloud .
It 's 2008 : Cloud + web scalable database .
It 's 20 ?? : Cloud + Memory Based Architectures
You may disagree with the timing of various innovations and you would be correct .
I could n't find a history of the evolution of website architectures , so I just made stuff up .
If you have any better information please let me know .
Why might cloud based memory architectures be the next big thing ?
For now we 'll just address the memory based architecture part of the question , the cloud component is covered a little later .
Behold the power of keeping data in memory : Google query results are now served in under an astonishingly fast 200 ms , down from 1000 ms in the olden days .
The vast majority of this great performance improvement is due to holding indexes completely in memory .
Thousands of machines process each query in order to make search results appear nearly instantaneously .
This text was adapted from notes on Google Fellow Jeff Dean keynote speech at WSDM 2009 .
Google is n't the only one getting a performance bang from moving data into memory .
Both LinkedIn and Digg keep the graph of their network social network in memory .
Facebook has northwards of 800 memcached servers creating a reservoir of 28 terabytes of memory enabling a 99 % cache hit rate .
Even little guys can handle 100s of millions of events per day by using memory instead of disk .
With their new Unified Computing strategy Cisco is also entering the memory game .
Their new machines " will be focusing on networking and memory " with servers crammed with 384 GB of RAM , fast processors , and blazingly fast processor interconnects .
Just what you need when creating memory based systems .
Memory is the System of Record What makes Memory Based Architectures different from traditional architectures is that memory is the system of record .
Typically disk based databases have been the system of record .
Disk has been King , safely storing data away within its castle walls .
Disk being slow we 've ended up wrapping disks in complicated caching and distributed file systems to make them perform .
Sure , memory is used as all over the place as cache , but we 're always supposed to pretend that cache can be invalidated at any time and old Mr. Reliable , the database , will step in and provide the correct values .
In Memory Based Architectures memory is where the " official " data values are stored .
Caching also serves a different purpose .
The purpose behind cache based architectures is to minimize the data bottleneck through to disk .
Memory based architectures can address the entire end - to - end application stack .
Data in memory can be of higher reliability and availability than traditional architectures .
Memory Based Architectures initially developed out of the need in some applications spaces for very low latencies .
The dramatic drop of RAM prices along with the ability of servers to handle larger and larger amounts of RAM has caused memory architectures to verge on going mainstream .
For example , someone recently calculated that 1TB of RAM across 40 servers at 24 GB per server would cost an additional $ 40,000 .
Which is really quite affordable given the cost of the servers .
Projecting out , 1U and 2U rack - mounted servers will soon support a terabyte or more or memory .
RAM = High Bandwidth and Low Latency Why are Memory Based Architectures so attractive ?
Compared to disk RAM is a high bandwidth and low latency storage medium .
Depending on who you ask the bandwidth of RAM is 5 GB /s .
The bandwidth of disk is about 100 MB/s. RAM bandwidth is many hundreds of times faster .
RAM wins .
Modern hard drives have latencies under 13 milliseconds .
When many applications are queued for disk reads latencies can easily be in the many second range .
Memory latency is in the 5 nanosecond range .
Memory latency is 2,000 times faster .
RAM wins again .
RAM is the New Disk
The superiority of RAM is at the heart of the RAM is the New Disk paradigm .
As an architecture it combines the holy quadrinity of computing :
Performance is better because data is accessed from memory instead of through a database to a disk .
Scalability is linear because as more servers are added data is transparently load balanced across the servers so there is an automated in - memory sharding .
Availability is higher because multiple copies of data are kept in memory and the entire system reroutes on failure .
Application development is faster because there ’s only one layer of software to deal with , the cache , and its API is simple .
All the complexity is hidden from the programmer which means all a developer has to do is get and put data .
Access disk on the critical path of any transaction limits both throughput and latency .
Committing a transaction over the network in - memory is faster than writing through to disk .
Reading data from memory is also faster than reading data from disk .
So the idea is to skip disk , except perhaps as an asynchronous write - behind option , archival storage , and for large files .
Or is Disk is the the new RAM
To be fair there is also a Disk is the the new RAM , RAM is the New Cache paradigm too .
This somewhat counter intuitive notion is that a cluster of about 50 disks has the same bandwidth of RAM , so the bandwidth problem is taken care of by adding more disks .
The latency problem is handled by reorganizing data structures and low level algorithms .
It 's as simple as avoiding piecemeal reads and organizing algorithms around moving data to and from memory in very large batches and writing highly parallelized programs .
While I have no doubt this approach can be made to work by very clever people in many domains , a large chunk of applications are more time in the random access domain space for which RAM based architectures are a better fit .
Grids and a Few Other Definitions
There 's a constellation of different concepts centered around Memory Based Architectures that we 'll need to understand before we can understand the different products in this space .
They include :
Compute Grid - parallel execution .
A Compute Grid is a set of CPUs on which calculations / jobs / work is run .
Problems are broken up into smaller tasks and spread across nodes in the grid .
The result is calculated faster because it is happening in parallel .
Data Grid - a system that deals with data — the controlled sharing and management of large amounts of distributed data .
In - Memory Data Grid ( IMDG ) - parallel in - memory data storage .
Data Grids are scaled horizontally , that is by adding more nodes .
Data contention is removed removed by partitioning data across nodes .
Colocation - Business logic and object state are colocated within the same process .
Methods are invoked by routing to the object and having the object execute the method on the node it was mapped to .
Latency is low because object state is not sent across the wire .
Grid Computing - Compute Grids + Data Grids
Cloud Computing - datacenter + API .
The API allows the set of CPUs in the grid to be dynamically allocated and deallocated .
Who are the Major Players in this Space ?
With that bit of background behind us , there are several major players in this space ( in alphabetical order ) :
Coherence - is a peer - to - peer , clustered , in - memory data management system .
Coherence is a good match for applications that need write - behind functionality when working with a database and you require multiple applications have ACID transactions on the database .
Java , JavaEE , C++ , and .NET .
GemFire - an in - memory data caching solution that provides low - latency and near - zero downtime along with horizontal & global scalability .
C++ , Java and .NET .
GigaSpaces - GigaSpaces attacks the whole stack : Compute Grid , Data Grid , Message , Colocation , and Application Server capabilities .
This makes for greater complexity , but it means there 's less plumbing that needs to be written and developers can concentrate on writing business logic .
Java , C , or .
Net .
GridGain -
A compute grid that can operate over many data grids .
It specializes in the transparent and low configuration implementation of features .
Java only .
Terracotta - Terracotta is network - attached memory that allows you share memory and do anything across a cluster .
Terracotta works its magic at the JVM level and provides : high availability , an end of messaging , distributed caching , a single JVM image .
Java only .
WebSphere eXtreme Scale .
Operates as an in - memory data grid that dynamically caches , partitions , replicates , and manages application data and business logic across multiple servers .
This class of products has generally been called In - Memory Data Grids ( IDMG ) , though not all the products fit snugly in this category .
There 's quite a range of different features amongst the different products .
I tossed IDMG the acronym in favor of Memory Based Architectures because the " in-memory " part seems redundant , the grid part has given way to the cloud , the " data " part really can include both data and code .
And there are other architectures that will exploit memory yet wo n't be classic IDMG .
So I just used Memory Based Architecture as that 's the part that counts .
Given the wide differences between the products there 's no canonical architecture .
As an example here 's a diagram of how GigaSpaces In - Memory - Data - Grid on the Cloud works .
Some key points to note are :
A POJO ( Plain Old Java Object ) is written through a proxy using a hash - based data routing mechanism to be stored in a partition on a Processing Unit .
Attributes of the object are used as a key .
This is straightforward hash based partitioning like you would use with memcached .
You are operating through GigaSpace 's framework / container so they can automatically handle things like messaging , sending change events , replication , failover , master - worker pattern , map - reduce , transactions , parallel processing , parallel query processing , and write - behind to databases .
Scaling is accomplished by dividing your objects into more partitions and assigning the partitions to Processing Unit instances which run on nodes -- a scale - out strategy .
Objects are kept in RAM and the objects contain both state and behavior .
A Service Grid component supports the dynamic creation and termination of Processing Units .
Not conceptually difficult and familiar to anyone who has used caching systems like memcached .
Only is this case memory is not just a cache , it 's the system of record .
Obviously there are a million more juicy details at play , but that 's the gist of it .
Admittedly GigaSpaces is on the full featured side of the product equation , but from a memory based architecture perspective the ideas should generalize .
When you shard a database , for example , you generally lose the ability to execute queries , you have to do all the assembly yourself .
By using GigaSpaces framework you get a lot of very high - end features like parallel query processing for free .
The power of this approach certainly comes in part from familiar concepts like partitioning .
But the speed of memory versus disk also allows entire new levels of performance and reliability in a relatively simple and easy to understand and deploy package .
NimbusDB - the Database in the Cloud Jim Starkey , President of NimbusDB , is not following the IDMG gang 's lead .
He 's taking a completely fresh approach based on thinking of the cloud as a new platform unto itself .
Starting from scratch , what would a database for the cloud look like ?
Jim is in position to answer this question as he has created a transactional database engine for MySQL named Falcon and added multi-versioning support to InterBase , the first relational database to feature MVCC ( Multiversion Concurrency Control ) .
What defines the cloud as a platform ?
Here 's are some thoughts from Jim I copied out of the Cloud Computing group .
You 'll notice I 've quoted Jim way way too much .
I did that because Jim is an insightful guy , he has a lot of interesting things to say , and I think he has a different spin on the future of databases in the cloud than anyone else I 've read .
He also has the advantage of course of not having a shipping product , but we shall see .
I 've probably said this before , but the cloud is a new computing platform that some have learned to exploit , others are scrambling to master , but most people will see as nothing but a minor variation on what they 're already doing .
This is not new .
When time sharing as invented , the batch guys considered it as remote job entry , just a variation on batch .
When departmental computing came along ( VAXes , et al ) , the timesharing guys considered it nothing but timesharing on a smaller scale .
When PCs and client / server computing came along , the departmental computing guys ( i.e. DEC ) , considered PCs to be a special case of smart terminals .
And when the Internet blew into town , the client server guys considered it as nothing more than a global scale LAN .
So the batchguys are dead , the timesharing guys are dead , the departmental computing guys are dead , and the client server guys are dead .
Notice a pattern ?
The reason that databases are important to cloud computing is that virtually all applications involve the interaction of client data with a shared , persistent data store .
And while application processing can be easily scaled , the limiting factor is the database system .
So if you plan to do anything more than play Tetris in the cloud , the issue of database management should be foremost in your mind .
Disks are the limiting factors in contemporary database systems .
Horrible things , disk .
But conventional wisdom is that you build a clustered database system by starting with a distributed file system .
Wrong .
Evolution is faster processors , bigger memory , better tools .
Revolution
is a different way of thinking , a different topology , a different way of putting the parts together .
What I 'm arguing is that a cloud is a different platform , and what works well for a single computer does n't work at all well in cloud , and things that work well in a cloud do n't work at all on the single computer system .
So it behooves us to re-examine a lot an ancient and honorable assumptions to see if they make any sense at all in this brave new world .
Sharing a high performance disk system is fine on a single computer , troublesome in a cluster , and miserable on a cloud .
I 'm a database guy who 's had it with disks .
Did n't much like the IBM 1301 , and disks have n't gotten much better since .
Ugly , warty , slow , things that require complex subsystems to hide their miserable characteristics .
The alternative is to use the memory in a cloud as a distributed L2
cache .
Yes , disks are still there , but they 're out of the performance loop except for data so stale that nobody has it memory .
Another machine or set of machines is just as good as a disk .
You can quibble about reliable power , etc , but write queuing disks have the same problem .
Once you give up the idea of logs and page caches in favor of asynchronous replications , life gets a great deal brighter .
It really does make sense to design to the strengths of cloud ( redundancy ) rather than their weaknesses ( shared anything ) .
And while one guys is fetching his 100 MB per second , the disk is busy and everyone else is waiting in line contemplating existence .
Even the cheapest of servers have two gigabit ethernet channels and switch .
The network serves everyone in parallel while the disk is single threaded
I favor data sharing through a formal abstraction like a relational database .
Shared objects are things most programmers are good at handling .
The fewer the things that application developers need to manage the more likely it is that the application will work .
I buy the model of object level replication , but only as a substrate for something with a more civilized API .
Or in other words , it 's a foundation , not a house .
I 'd much rather have a pair of quad - core processors running as independent servers than contending for memory on a dual socket server .
I do n't object to more cores per processor chip , but I do n't want to pay for die size for cores perpetually stalled for memory .
The object substrate worries about data distribution and who should see what .
It does n't even know it 's a database .
SQL semantics are applied by an engine layered on the object substrate .
The SQL engine does n't worry or even know that it 's part of a distributed database -- it just executes SQL statements .
The black magic is MVCC .
I 'm a database developing building a database system for clouds .
Tell me what you need .
Here is my first approximation : A database that scales by adding more computers and degrades gracefully when machines are yanked out ;
A database system that never needs to be shut down ; Hardware and software fault tolerance ; Multi- site archiving for disaster survival ; A facility to reach into the past to recover from human errors ( drop table customers ; oops ; ) ; Automatic load balancing
MySQL scales with read replication which requires a full database copy to start up .
For any cloud relevant application , that 's probably hundreds of gigabytes .
That makes it a mighty poor candidate for on - demand virtual servers .
Do remember that the primary function of a database system is to maintain consistency .
You do n't want a dozen people each draining the last thousand buckets from a bank account or a debit to happen without the corresponding credit .
Whether the data moves to the work or the work moves to the data is n't that important as long as they both end up a the same place with as few intermediate round trips as possible .
In my area , for example , databases are either limited by the biggest , ugliest machine you can afford * or * you have to learn to operation without consistent , atomic transactions .
A bad rock / hard place choice that send the cost of scalable application development through the ceiling .
Once we solve that , applications that server 20,000,000 users will be simple and cheap to write .
Who knows where that will go ?
To paraphrase our new president , we must reject the false choice between data consistency and scalability .
Cloud computing is about using many computers to scale problems that were once limited by the capabilities of a single computer .
That 's what makes clouds exciting , at least to me .
But most will argue that cloud computing is a better economic model for running many instances of a
single computer .
Bah , I say , bah !
Cloud computing is a wonder new platform .
Let 's not let the dinosaurs waiting for extinction define it as a minor variation of what they 've been doing for years .
They will , of course , but this ( and the dinosaurs ) will pass .
The revolutionary idea is that applications do n't run on a single computer but an elastic cloud of computers that grows and contracts by demand .
This , in turn , requires an applications infrastructure that can a ) run a single application across as many machines as necessary , and b ) run many applications on the same machines without any of the cross talk and software maintenance problems of years past .
No , the software infrastructure required to enable this is not mature and certainly not off the shelf , but many smart folks are working on it .
There 's nothing limiting in relational except the companies that build them .
A relational database can scale as well as BigTable and SimpleDB but still be transactional .
And , unlike BigTable and SimpleDB , a relational database can model relationships and do exotic things like transferring money from one account to another without " breaking the bank . " .
It is true that existing relational database systems are largely constrained to single cpu or cluster with a shared file system , but we 'll get over that .
Personally , I do n't like masters any more than I like slaves .
I strongly favor peer to peer architectures with no single point of failure .
I also believe that database federation is a work - around
rather than a feature .
If a database system had sufficient capacity , reliability , and availability , nobody would ever partition or shard data .
( If one database instance is a headache , a million tiny ones is a horrible , horrible migraine . )
Logic does need to be pushed to the data , which is why relational database systems destroyed hierarchical ( IMS ) , network ( CODASYL ) , and OODBMS .
But there is a constant need to push semantics higher to further reduce the number of round trips between application semantics and the database systems .
As for I /O , a database system that can use the cloud as an L2 cache breaks free from dependencies on file systems .
This means that bandwidth and cycles are the limiting factors , not I /O capacity .
What we should be talking about is trans - server application architecture , trans - server application platforms , both , or whether one will make the other unnecessary .
If you scale , you do n't / ca n't worry about server reliability .
Money spent on ( alleged ) server reliability is money wasted .
If you view the cloud as a new model for scalable applications , it is a radical change in computing platform .
Most people see the cloud through the lens of EC2 , which is just another way to run a server that you have to manage and control , then the cloud is little more than a rather
boring business model .
When clouds evolve to point that applications and databases can utilize whatever resources then need to meet demand without the constraint of single machine limitations , we 'll have something really neat .
On MVCC : Forget about the concept of master .
Synchronizing slaves to a master is hopeless .
Instead , think of a transaction as a temporal view of database state ; different transactions
will have different views .
Certain critical operations must be serialized , but that still does n't require that all nodes have identical views of database state .
Low latency is definitely good , but I 'm designing the system to support geographically separated sub-clouds .
How well that works under heavy load is probably application specific .
If the amount of volatile data common to the sub - clouds is relatively low , it should work just fine provided there is enough bandwidth to handle the replication messages .
MVCC tracks multiple versions to provide a transaction with a view of the database consistent with the instant it started while preventing a transaction from updating a piece of data that it could not see .
MVCC is consistent , but it is not serializable .
Opinions vary between academia and the real world , but most database practitioners recognize that the consistency provided by MVCC is sufficient for programmers of modest skills to product robust applications .
MVCC , heretofore , has been limited to single node databases .
Applied to the cloud with suitable bookkeeping to control visibility of updates on individual nodes , MVCC is as close to black magic as you are likely to see in your lifetime , enabling concurrency and consistency with mostly non-blocking , asynchronous messaging .
It does , however , dispense with the idea that a cloud has at any given point of time a single definitive state .
Serializability implemented with record locking is an attempt to make distributed system march in lock - step so that the result is as if there there no parallelism between nodes .
MVCC recognizes that parallelism is the key to scalability .
Data that is a few microseconds old is not a problem as long as updates do n't collide .
Jim certainly is n't shy with his opinions :-)
My summary of what he wants to do with NimbusDB is :
Make a scalable relational database in the cloud where you can use normal everyday SQL to perform summary functions , define referential integrity , and all that other good stuff .
Transactions scale using a distributed version of MVCC , which I do not believe has been done before .
This is the key part of the plan and a lot depends on it working .
The database is stored primarily in RAM which makes cloud level scaling of an RDBMS possible .
The database will handle all the details of scaling in the cloud .
To the developer it will look like just a very large highly available database .
I 'm not sure if NimbusDB will support a compute grid and map - reduce type functionality .
The low latency argument for data and code collocation is a good one , so I hope it integrates some sort of extension mechanism .
Why might NimbusDB be a good idea ?
Keeps simple things simple .
Web scale databases like BigTable and SimpleDB make simple things difficult .
They are full of quotas , limits , and restrictions because by their very nature they are just a key - value layer on top of a distributed file system .
The database knows as little about the data as possible .
If you want to build a sequence number for a comment system , for example , it takes complicated sharding logic to remove write contention .
Developers are used to SQL and are comfortable working within the transaction model , so the transition to cloud computing would be that much easier .
Now , to be fair , who knows if NimbusDB will be able to scale under high load either , but we need to make simple things simple again .
Language independence .
Notice the that IDMG products are all language specific .
They support some combination of .
Net / Java/C/C++.
This is because they need low level object knowledge to transparently implement their magic .
This is n't bad , but it does mean if you use Python , Erlang , Ruby , or any other unsupported language then you are out of luck .
As many problems as SQL has , one of its great gifts is programmatic universal access .
Separates data from code .
Data is forever , code changes all the time .
That 's one of the common reasons for preferring a database instead of an objectbase .
This also dovetails with the language independence issue .
Any application can access data from any language and any platform from now and into the future .
That 's a good quality to have .
The smart money has been that cloud level scaling requires abandoning relational databases and distributed transactions .
That 's why we 've seen an epidemic of key - value databases and eventually consistent semantics .
It will be fascinating to see if Jim 's combination of Cloud +
Memory + MVCC can prove the insiders wrong .
Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing ?
We 've gone through a couple of different approaches to deploying Memory Based Architectures .
So are they the next big thing ?
Adoption has been slow because it's new and different and that inertia takes a while to overcome .
Historically tools have n't made it easy for early adopters to make the big switch , but that is changing with easier to deploy cloud based systems .
And current architectures , with a lot of elbow grease , have generally been good enough .
But we are seeing a wide convergence on caching as way to make slow disks perform .
Truly enormous amounts of effort are going into adding cache and then trying to keep the database and applications all in - sync with cache as bottom up and top down driven changes flow through the system .
After all that work it's a simple step to wonder why that extra layer is needed when the data could have just as well be kept in memory from the start .
Now add the ease of cloud deployments and the ease of creating scalable , low latency applications that are still easy to program , manage , and deploy .
Building multiple complicated layers of application code just to make the disk happy will make less and less sense over time .
We are on the edge of two potent technological changes : Clouds and Memory Based Architectures .
This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper .
Google is the master of disk .
You can't beat them at a game they perfected .
Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts , typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change .
The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed .
The tipping point is soon .

It 's Banksy 's first work we 've seen since October 2008 when he surprised New Yorkers with a wild and wacky pop-up store called The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill .
This time his work has been spotted in London .
The first piece , in Gillett Square , Dalston , is of a child that is dressed up in urban clothing carrying a boombox and a teddy bear .
Look closely and you 'll notice that he 's using an air vent in the wall to represent a stereo speaker and that he 's drawn in a breakdancing dance mat on the floor .
You have to wonder what Banksy was thinking about , perhaps how hip - hop society is negatively influencing our youth .

According to security researchers , the Conficker worm virus -- which has infected millions of machines since its discovery in October 2008 -- is set to wreak havoc next Wednesday , April 1st .
The problem is that nobody is sure exactly what the worm will do .
At the moment the virus , which exists in at least three different ' strains ' , does not actually do anything other than attempt to spread further across the webosphere .
Secret Methods of Communication
All that 's known at the moment is that on April 1st , PCs already infected with Conficker will contact a random website for instructions on what to do next .
Conficker 's creators have set - up a secret system of communication which tells the virus which website to visit for the update , but virus researchers do n't know which site it will be .
At the moment it appears that next week 's ' phoning home ' will use a total of 500 random website addresses from a potential list of 50,000 sites .
That 's because the system creates random website addresses , which the people behind the website buy up shortly beforehand .
( Source : cnet.com )
Airline Targeted By Mistake
The system has already hit one glitch : it randomly created an address belonging to Southwest Airlines which forwarded to its main website .
Fortunately the firm was able to temporarily disable the forwarding feature before millions of infected computers brought its servers down .
Though security researchers believe they 've figured how the virus phones home ( so to speak ) , the numbers make it impractical to continue with the original tactic of buying up all the potential addresses before the hackers strike .
What Happens Next ?
The worst case scenario is that the virus will either attempt to steal personal data from infected machines , or cause some other sort of damage .
However , security researchers say this is unlikely as this would risk weakening the overall network of infected machines which the virus creators have built up .
Another possibility is that the machines might be set to intentionally contact website addresses that are known to be active in an attempt to crash the servers and bring the site down through a Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attack .
But while nobody should be complacent , there are a couple of reasons to remain calm .
It 's possible that the April 1st schedule is a bluff and that the virus itself is n't capable of doing anything other than spreading .
Another possibility is that anything the virus does at this stage will simply be a small demonstration that it works as designed .
This would likely be the case if , as many have speculated , the virus creators are more interested in selling access to the network of infected machines to the highest bidder .

A bill that would make it easier for law enforcement to track down a missing person through a wireless device is on its way to the governor .
House members approved a compromise measure 125 - 0 on Thursday , a day after the Senate approved it 39- 0 .
The measure says cell phone companies must release caller location information promptly to police when asked .
Cell phone signals , known as pings , can be used to track a phone ’s location .
The bill was inspired by the 2007 kidnapping and slaying of 18 - year - old Kelsey Smith , of Overland Park .

Faking algebraic ( variant ) data types in Common Lisp
One of the things that really stuck me when I first learned Haskell was the concept of ML - style algebraic data types .
I had n't seriously played with any similar languages before , and the directness of the mapping between my intentions and the code that I was writing was striking .
No superfluous inheritance hierarchies , methods , accessors , or ( Jove preserve us ) hacks with C unions and structs .
Just show what the data looks like , and match values against patterns to make use of it .
If you have n't had the privilege of playing with these , here is a definition of a list - of - integer type in Haskell , with a length function :
data List = Nil | Cons Int List len Nil = 0 len ( Cons _ tail ) = 1 + len tail two = len ( Cons 1 ( Cons 2 Nil ) )
The data line says that values of type List have either the value Nil , or a value Cons holding an integer and another List value .
The integer part could be made polymorphic , but since we 're going to talk about Common Lisp , the static typing aspects do n't interest us .
The len function on this type is then defined by handling exactly these two cases .
The matching against a certain constructor ( as the ' options ' of an algebraic data type are usually called ) also implicitly does the binding of the variables ( tail ) that we need .
Finally , the bottom line shows that values of this type are created simply by invoking the constructor like a function .
Nil does n't take arguments , and Cons takes two of them .
For a lot of simple data types , creating and unpacking are the main use - cases , and it is great to be able to use such a tiny , straightforward data declaration instead of writing out a string of boilerplate classes , accessors , or initargs .
If we consider Common Lisp , algebraic types wo n't give us the invulnerable sense of compiler - checked correctness that we get in a statically typed language .
Still , their succinctness and clarity could really brighten up some programs — types for ASTs are a typical example .
In any case , I constantly find myself missing them when writing CL code , so let 's see what they might look like .
The first question is how to represent instances of our algebraic data types .
There are three sensible choices : classes , structs , or vectors .
Vectors would be the most conservative and efficient choice , but have the major drawback that you can not associate type information with them , so that it becomes impossible to specialise methods on these types .
' Playing nice ' with the type system would be a plus , so let 's try without vectors .
CLOS classes are awesomely flexible , whereas structs are kind of limited and stupid .
But in many cases you 'll want to use these types for tiny little objects , the kind that you will be creating by the millions .
Because of their simplicity , struct instances are significantly faster to create and access on every implementation I tested .
They have one really big drawback though — redefining them causes undefined behaviour .
This usually means you have to throw away your existing instances and recompile the code that depends on the type whenever you redefine a type .
I decided this was acceptable , but you could easily modify the code to use classes instead .
What kind of interface should an implementation of algebraic data types provide ?
Two constructs seem to go a long way : defining new types , and matching against types .
For the first , one can do ...
( variant _list _nil ( _cons car cdr ) )
( With variant being pleasantly shorter than algebraic - data - type and more readable than adt ) .
This creates three struct types , _list , _nil , and _cons ( underscores are there to prevent name clashes with standard symbols ) , with _list being an empty struct that just serves as a supertype for the other two and , more importantly , as a way to indicate what this data type is intended for .
Matching happens with what is basically a case statement :
( defun len ( lst ) ( vcase lst ( _nil 0 ) ( ( _cons cdr ) ( 1+ ( len cdr ) ) ) ) ) ( len ( _cons 1 ( _cons 2 ( _nil ) ) ) )
A vcase form works much like a typecase form ( and in fact expands to one ) , except that it allows extracting of member fields .
When the first element in a case is a symbol , that clause is treated exactly like a typecase clause , but when it is a list , the first element of this list is a struct type , and further elements are slot bindings .
Slots can be either a single symbol , in which case the bound variable has the same name as the slot , or a list of two symbols , the first being the variable name , the second the slot name .
You do n't have to extract slots you do n't use .
( If variant values were classes , this could simply expand to slot - value forms , but the standard does n't require slot - value to work on structs , so my implementation expands to regular struct accessors , taken from the package that defines the struct type , so that you do n't have to export the accessors .
There is a problematic corner case with structs that have a name that you imported from another package . )
vcase does not do nested patterns .
For serious pattern matching , struct - based variant values are trivial to use with cl-match .

The collapse of the U.S. economy has dominated the first months of Barack Obama 's presidency .
Obama ( second right ) at the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul during his bridge - building and sight - seeing trip to Turkey .
But after last week 's G - 20 summit in London , Obama was in Turkey and Iraq this week , underscoring a different point .
Once he 's taken care of problems at home , most of his biggest business is in the Muslim world .
Iraq : Obama owes his election in part to his opposition to the war in Iraq .
Now , he plans to withdraw U.S. combat troops .
But Iraq is still so dangerous that Obama had to keep his visit a surprise and be content with a quick look from behind U.S. barbed wire .
Will U.S. forces really be able to back out ?
Afghanistan : Obama has made this war his own , vowing to win , promising to keep terrorists from again taking refuge on Afghan soil .
Even after more than seven years of fighting , the challenge is daunting and some Americans are already musing about whether it will be ' Obama 's Vietnam ' .
Pakistan : The Obama administration sees Pakistan as both a base for insurgents in Afghanistan and a battleground in its own right .
Militants threaten the stability of the country and also potentially the security of its nuclear weapons .
What 's the best way for Obama to respond ?
Iran : Tehran is proudly pursuing a nuclear program .
It insists its intentions are peaceful , but Western experts are alarmed .
Obama has pledged to explore every option " including military , to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon " .
Will he have to make good on that threat ?
Turkey :
The only Muslim nation in NATO , Turkey represents moderate Muslim opinion that was troubled by the U.S. war on terror but still wants to work with the West .
America needs to win back mainstream Muslim support .
The Palestinians : Every conversation about Washington and the Muslim world eventually leads to the same place .
On the list of challenges , progress for the Palestinians is the challenge Muslims themselves are probably watching most closely .
Success may seem remote , but it would resonate for generations worldwide .
Obama has a big agenda to address during his presidency .
Put these half dozen close to the top .

Here 's a new article that 's part of my Health , Lifestyle & Culture series .
Water Is # 1
The quick answer to this question should be obvious .
Both during and after a workout , the most important thing to ingest is of course , water .
It facilitates digestion , aids in the transportation of nutrients and the elimination of waste products .
Water also lubricates the body 's joints and tissues , and helps to regulate body temperature .
And let 's face it , after a hard workout there 's nothing better than a nice tall glass of water .
But what about sports drinks and energy bars ?
Is there anything else essential to helping the body recover quickly after a workout ?
Electrolyte Balance & Glycogen Supply
When we sweat during exercise , water is n't the only thing the body loses .
We also sweat out electrolytes like sodium , potassium , phosphate and magnesium .
If these are n't replaced quickly after exercise you are likely to feel weak and it will take longer to properly recover .
This is where sports drinks come in .
They are specifically designed to provide an appropriate balance of electrolytes to the body .
The simple sugars in these drinks are also beneficial , especially for endurance athletes , as they help kick - start the body 's process of replenishing glycogen supply .
By the way , many nutritionists disagree on whether or not 100 % fruit juices are just as good or better for post - workout recovery as sports drinks .
Juice is lower on the glycemic index and therefore will restore glycogen more slowly .
Yet , most experts believe that the pros of drinking real fruit juice , like natural anti-oxidants and vitamins , outweigh the cons .
In the end , it 's complex carbs , like those found in breads and cereals , that are the most effective at replenishing glycogen stores .
Go ahead and drink sports drinks or juice after training .
But also consider eating something like a whole - grain bagel .
But what should you spread on your bagel ?
The Protein Issue
To keep the body healthy we need to eat a balance of macro-nutrients ( carbohydrates , proteins and fats ) .
For the athlete , adequate protein is important , as they are constantly breaking their bodies down .
Protein is needed to rebuild the body 's tissues .
The newest science reveals that consuming a complete protein meal post - workout ( that is one that contains all 20 essential amino acids , the building blocks of proteins ) is a great idea .
The body is signaled that you 've just ingested these useful amino acids and will consequentially begin manufacturing new proteins .
Stimulating the body in this way inevitably speeds up recovery , and is just a good all around routine for someone who exercises regularly .
Post - Workout Snacking
Danny Mackay , an M.S. in exercise physiology comments on snacking :
“ What to look for ... are foods with complete proteins .
All animal proteins are complete proteins , but it is not easy to put down a steak ( immediately a workout ) ... some plant proteins are complete like brewer 's yeast , certain nuts , soybeans , cottonseed , and the germ of grains ... energy bars should work , but combining foods is good to ... think whole wheat bread and peanut butter .
Just check out the label and the bar should note if it contains complete proteins . “
Here are a few simple snack ideas that are easy to pack into a gym bag :

British environmentalist David de Rothschild , author of Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook , met with the San Francisco Conservation Corps on Wednesday to talk about “ Plastiki , ” a 60 - foot catamaran made from recycled plastic ( except for the masts ) , which he ’ll use to sail from San Francisco to Australia : an 11,000 mile voyage !
The boat is made up of about 16,000 plastic bottles and is an “ effort to raise awareness of the recycling of plastic bottles , which he says are a symbol of global waste . ” says Rothschild .
Skin - like panels made from recycled PET , a woven plastic fabric , will cover the hulls and a watertight cabin , which sleeps four .
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials .
Two wind turbines and an array of solar panels will charge a bank of 12 - volt batteries , which will power several onboard laptop computers , a GPS and SAT phone .
He went on to say , “ It ’s all sail power .
The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere , or into our oceans for that matter , so everything on the boat will be composted .
Everything will be recycled .
Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish . ”
While as noble as that sounds , I ca n’t help but think that if this boat makes it …it will be on display for quite sometime .
Maybe never recycled ?
The plastic sailboat is taking shape in an old pier building not far from this city ’s famous Fisherman ’s Wharf .
Here , thousands of two - liter soda bottles are being stripped of their labels , washed , filled with dry-ice powder and then resealed .
The dry ice sublimates into carbon dioxide gas and pressurizes the bottle , making it rigid .
De Rothschild is something of an adventure nut himself .
He is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps .
In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology , an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues .
According to Adventure Ecology , Fifteen billion pounds of plastic are produced annually in the U.S. , but only 1 billion pounds are recycled .
A lot of the bottles that are n’t repurposed end up end floating out to sea .
The Great Eastern Pacific Garbage Patch , where ocean currents shepherd much of this debris , is twice the size of Texas .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/uDWzb-iKZE8&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1]
De Rothschild ’s vessel is scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April .
The crew is made up of three sailors and one scientist .
The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii , Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney , a trip estimated to take more than 100 days .
I hope they are more successful than those paper boat people .
I mean , c’mon …paper ?

In a speech for the history books , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a clear and uncompromising case for lifesaving role of international reproductive rights and health care access when testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday .
In a speech for the history books , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a clear and uncompromising case for lifesaving role of international reproductive rights and health care access when testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday .
Anti-choice New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith lectured Clinton about Margaret Sanger ’s supposed eugenic agenda , about the work of Planned Parenthood and then finally asked whether the adminstration sought to undo restrictive family planning policies in South America and Asia , AFP reports ( likely alluding to the reinstatement of funding for UNFPA ) .
Clinton did n’t mince words :
" Congressman , I deeply respect your passionate concern and views
which you have championed and advocated for over the course of your
public career , " Clinton told him .
" We , obviously , have a profound disagreement , " the chief US diplomat said .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

I ’ll include the rest of Clinton ’s quote in the AFP in full :
" When I think about the suffering that I have seen of women around
the world , I ’ve been in hospitals in Brazil where half the women were
enthusiastically and joyfully greeting new babies and the other half
were fighting for their lives against botched abortions , " said Clinton .
" I’ve
been in African countries where 12 and 13 - year - old girls are bearing
children .
I have been in Asian countries where the denial of family
planning consigns women to lives of oppression and hardship , " she added .
" It
is my strongly held view that you are entitled to advocate and everyone
who agrees with you should be free to do so anywhere in the world , and
so are we , " she said .
" We happen to think that family planning is
an important part of women ’s health and reproductive health includes
access to abortion , that I believe should be safe , legal and rare , "
Clinton added .
" I ’ve spent a lot of my time trying to bring down
the rate of abortions and it has been my experience that good family
planning and good medical care brings down the rate of abortion , " the
secretary of state said .
" Keeping women and men in ignorance and denied the access to services actually increases the rate of abortion . "
Clinton makes clear the connection between safe , legal , accessible abortion and maternal health , between family planning and women ’s socioeconomic level , between access to contraception and the need for abortion , and between abortion and the full spectrum of reproductive health care .
When put in context , it becomes obvious that abortion is not only , not even primarily , a contested medical procedure but the key to a wholesale paradigm shift in valuing women ’s lives .
The AP adds :
Congressman Jeff Fortenberry asked :
" Is forcing U.S. taxpayers to fund abortion in keeping with the highest
values of the United States of America ? "
Clinton said she had a " fundamental disagreement " with the Nebraska
Republican .
She said it ’s the administration ’s view that family
planning is an important part of women ’s health .
If preventing maternal deaths and ensuring women can live lives of dignity , then , yes , Congressman Fortenberry , funding abortion is in accordance with some of the highest values the United States could ever strive for .
Even CBN ’s David Brody had to concede , " It should be noted that the Secretary of State kept her composure and did n’t let the pro-life voices distract from her message . "
It looks as if we are in for a treat with upcoming Home Spaces from Insomniac Games .

The British - born actress is the daughter of stage and film great Vanessa Redgrave and the late director - producer Tony Richardson .
She also is the sister of actress Joely Richardson and the wife of Northern Irish actor Liam Neeson , her co-star in the 1994 movie " Nell . "
She has two sons with Neeson -- 13 - year - old Micheal and 12 - year - old Daniel .
Richardson appeared in the movies " Gothic , " " Blow Dry , " " The Parent Trap , " " Haven , " " Maid in Manhattan , " " Asylum " and " The White Countess . "
She won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway revival of the musical " Cabaret . "
" Batman Begins , " " Schindler 's List " and " Michael Collins " star Neeson can be seen in the current release " Taken . "
He left the Toronto set of his movie " Chloe " immediately to fly to Montreal where his wife was hospitalized after her accident Monday , a representative for the film told IrishCentral.com .
The Daily News said Neeson accompanied Richardson on the flight home from Montreal to New York where her family gathered Tuesday to say goodbye to the actress .
Richardson reportedly sustained her injuries while skiing on a beginners ' slope at a Quebec resort with at least one of her sons .
" ( Richardson has ) been on life support since this morning , " an unnamed source close to the family told the newspaper .
" She is brain dead . "
Today ’s Washington
Post has a must - read op - ed by Mark McKeon , who worked as a prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia :
In 2001 and the following few years , we at the international tribunal built a strong court case against Milosevic .
We presented evidence that he had effective control over soldiers and paramilitaries who tortured prisoners , and did worse .
We brought into court reports of atrocities that had been delivered to Milosevic by international organizations to show his knowledge of what was happening under his command .
And we watched as other heads of state were indicted for similar crimes , including Charles Taylor in Liberia and , of course , Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
At the same time , I watched with horror the changes that were happening back home .
The events are now well known : Abu Ghraib ; Guantanamo ; secret “ renditions ” of prisoners to countries where interrogators were not afraid to get rough ; secret CIA prisons where there appeared to be no rules .
I tried to answer , as best I could , the questions from my international colleagues at The Hague about what was happening in and to my country .
But as each revelation topped the last , I soon found myself without words .
I hope that the United States has turned the page on those times and is returning to the values that sustained our country for so many years .
But we cannot expect to regain our position of leadership in the world unless we hold ourselves to the same standards that we expect of others .
That means punishing the most senior government officials responsible for these crimes .
We have demanded this from other countries that have returned from walking on the dark side ; we should expect no less from ourselves .
To say that we should hold ourselves to the same standards of justice that we applied to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein is not to say that the level of our leaders ’ crimes approached theirs .
Thankfully , there is no evidence of that .
And yet , torture and cruel treatment are as much violations of international humanitarian law as are murder and genocide .
They demand a judicial response .
We cannot expect the rest of humanity to live in a world that we ourselves are not willing to inhabit .
McKeon makes a fundamental point about this entire torture “ debate ” .
The simple fact is that we are now faced with overwhelming evidence of illegal torture conducted during the Bush administration .
People can debate whether this technique or that technique amounted to “ torture ” ; or whether torture “ works ” ; or whether some Republicans are somehow sexually aroused by the idea of torturing people — but one fact remains : we have mountains of credible evidence that many people in the Bush administration broke US and international law .
If we just whitewash this , without conducting a full investigation , we will have absolutely zero moral standing in the world going forward with which to criticize rogue regimes and demand that they themselves investigate allegations of prisoner abuse .
What is the government of some terrorized African country going to say when we demand that they investigate and punish the torture and killings committed by their previous dictator ?
Why would they say anything other than “ Oh , that stuff does n’t happen anymore .
We prefer to keep walking and look forward , not backward .
Wo n’t happen again ; sorry … ” ?
We will never again be able to condemn others for the use of torture unless we now swallow the bitter pill and investigate ourselves .
The US deficit is well over $ 1tn , but how big is that ?
Use this guide to put the number in context .
If the area of a doormat is equal to one , the total area of the United Kingdom is a trillion times bigger - 1,000,000,000,000 Doormat area : 0.24 sq m
0.24 sq m United Kingdom total land area : 244,820 sq km

Susan Stanton , the former city manager of Largo , Florida , has been hired as the new city manager for Lake Worth .
Stanton was fired from her job as Largo 's city manager in 2007 , apparently when her gender transition became public knowledge .
Susan Stanton .
" We said all along that we 'd pick the best candidate regardless and that 's what it 's all about , we would n't be doing our job if we didn't , " said Jeff Clemons , the mayor of Lake Worth .
He added that the city 's commission voted in favor of Stanton 4 to 1 .
Stanton was the city manager of Largo for 14 years before she was fired by the city 's commissioners in 2007 .
Stanton alleged that when she went public , the commissioners voted to fire her .
Five of the seven city commissioners voted for Stanton 's termination .
According to the commission , Stanton was fired because " of poor judgment " and lack of trust .
After her termination , Stanton was in second running for the city manager position of Sarasota , but the commission instead voted in favor of Robert Bartolotta .
Stanton has applied for over 100 city manager positions in Florida since 2007 .
She also began a campaign to enact laws to protect transgender and homosexual people from discrimination in the workplace .

A striking satellite image released yesterday shows the moment North Korea launched a long - range rocket on Sunday in defiance of international pressure .
The image was taken from an altitude of 308 miles ( 496 km ) by the WorldView - 1 satellite moments after the rocket blasted off at 11.10 am local time .
North Korea 's official news agency said the Taepodong - 2 rocket placed a satellite in orbit that is now broadcasting revolutionary songs .
The Pentagon claimed the launch failed and the rocket broke up and fell into the Pacific Ocean .
The launch triggered an emergency meeting of the UN security council amid fears the launch was a covert military exercise .
The rocket is capable of carrying warheads and has a range of 4,160 miles , putting Alaska and Hawaii within its reach .
The WorldView - 1 satellite is operated by the US imaging company Digital Globe , which snapped the North Korean rocket on its launchpad last week using another satellite called Quickbird .
Allison Puccioni , a senior image analyst for IHS Jane 's , said it was the first time a satellite had captured a rocket mid-launch .
" The significance of this image is quite extraordinary , " she said .
" I have never seen anything like it . "
The image shows a long contrail left behind by the rocket as it reaches supersonic speeds over the Korean peninsula .
The rocket itself appears in white at the end of the contrail .
Puccioni said analysts are still studying the image , which appears to show the rocket at an angle .
" It looks as though there 's been a slight change in its trajectory , " she said .
The rocket may have been caught during a stage separation .
The camera aboard the WorldView - 1 satellite has a resolution of 50 cm and would have been over North Korea from 11 am to midday on the morning of the launch .
It travels at 17,000 mph and can only take one picture as it hurtles overhead .
Puccioni suspects
Pyongyang had timed the controversial launch to coincide with the satellite 's arrival , in the hope of maximising publicity of the launch .
I ’m fat .
( For the record : I do not use / identify with the euphemism BBW ( Big Beautiful Woman ) .
I respect those who do , it just is n’t my choice .
“ Large , ” “ Plus - Sized , ” “ Big ” are terms I occasionally use .
For me , I prefer fat . )
I am , unsurprisingly , ambivalent about it .
There is n’t a whole lot of acceptance around fatness today in the US .
And then , I ’m kinky .
Yay !
Oh , AND Black .
sigh
Today we will just rant about being fat and kinky .
Ahem !
< rant >
I came into the BDSM community , saw people all shapes sizes and body types in the Dungeon .
I thought “ Oh wow !
Fantastic !
A place where your body type does n’t matter , where you are accepted for who you are , and no one judges you ! ”
Well .
No .
I started paying more attention to kinky porn .
The models are still slender .
I look at photographs .
Tough to find someone not unsvelte .
Hrm .
So then I think “ Well , that is still mainstream , right ?
It ai n’t like Skin Two is gonna put fat people in there , they are pretty mainstreamy … ”
Then I started going to kink events .
Watching classes .
Seeing that almost all of the demo bottoms are petite .
The rope people claim to need slender models because it is easier to work with them .
You also hear it is tougher to find fat demo models because they are less likely to volunteer .
The bondage gear people hide behind the “ equipment limitation ” issue .
And so on .
And so on .
I recently saw a post on FetLife calling for demo bottoms .
Since this was for an event I ’m attending , I was eager to volunteer .
Then I read the post .
The instructor specifically asked for slender models , because ( and I am paraphrasing a bit ) fuller - figured people ’s skin does n’t clamp / pinch easily .
I was really angry .
And a bit stung .
Then I stopped myself .
How the fuck do we , an alternative outlier community , fail to see that all people being represented is far better then some people being represented ?
Then I sat there pinching myself .
Quite literally .
I found it was pretty easy to grab skin on some areas , tougher on others .
I imagine that to be the case with anyone .
To my jaundiced eye , this smacked of “ Look , I do n’t wanna play with fat girls so I ’ll say something about how it is critical for the class so that I do n’t have to reject a bunch of fat people . ”
I ’m fuming , thinking “ So …your class is on “ playing with thin people ” ?
You are specifically EXCLUDING an entire class of folks because of their size ?
What happens to the person in class who is fat , has a fat partner , or might play with a fat person ?
You have no info for them ?
Why not have a few demo bottoms ?
Why not just put your your fucking call for bottoms and pick who you want without being so OBVIOUSLY exclusionary ?
What if you were teaching a goddanmed class and said “ No brown skinned people because the marks do n’t show up as well on dark people . ” ?!?! ”
But then … I did n’t say anything .
Because I thought I was being hypersensitive .
Now , I wish I had .
If I run into this person at Beyond Leather , I will ask them about this situation .
I ’m willing to bet they will stick to their assertion that it is n’t prejudice , that it really is just utility !
And my response would be , “ No . ” As an instructor , as a representative of “ Our Community , ” you have an obligation to educate .
Not titillate .
That is for the dungeon .
We are responsible for helping people play safely and well .
How does limiting your pool of demo bottoms further this ?
I have to check myself , though .
The BDSM community is no different that the world at large , really .
It just has that self - segregating aspect to it .
It is a microcosm .
Not a utopia .
When BDSM porn producers consider a size 12 woman to be a “ large ” model , we have n’t made any strides towards inclusion .
The few classes I have seen that SPECIFICALLY include fat people and kink tend to approach it as an “ issue to be “ addressed ”
I do n’t have a fucking issue .
I ’m just fat .
And I want to be seen .
I do n’t want to be fetishized for being fat .
I do n’t want to be beautiful in spite of being fat .
I do n’t want to be beautiful because I am fat .
And I sure as hell do not want fat people sidelined and marginalized because we are n’t in your goddamned fetish magazines being held up as the ideal because we are n’t slender .
As beautiful as anyone can be , I want to be .
Years ago I had a lover grab hold of my belly during a fuck .
I , of course , instinctively elbowed him in the ribcage and hollered for him to stop grabbing my fat .
It made me uncomfortable .
I did n’t want him bringing attention to it .
Being him , he smacked my hand away and grabbed me with BOTH hands this time and continued to fuck me .
“ I like it .
So shut up . ”
Yeah I did .
Having been the fat girl that some men have “ gone outside of their physical ideal ” for , I am kind of tired of hearing “ Oh but you are so intelligent , so beautiful , we have such amazing chemistry ” and having them OVERLOOKING my size .
That is a lot to overlook .
I do n’t need for everyone on earth to think that fat girls are sexy , but I do need for my chosen family , the BDSM community , to take a look at our lock - stepping with mainstream ideas about beauty and own that shit .
Only then will it be OK for fat people to step forward and let ourselves be seen as part of the whole , and not set apart .
These photos in this post are from a photographer I ’m looking forward to working with soon .
The reason I chose to work with him is that he selects his subjects based on who he thinks is hot .
He had lots of women of varied body types in his photography .
You can see examples here .
But for this post I chose the beautiful ones with bodies that look like mine .
Because I needed to remember that I am beautiful .
And I WILL fucking be seen .

The Supreme Court dealt a defeat to the pharmaceutical industry and the Bush administration Wednesday , ruling that federal approval of a prescription drug does not provide a shield against lawsuits from injured patients .
The 6 - 3 decision upholds the traditional right of American consumers to sue the manufacturer if they are harmed by a defective product .
The ruling affirmed a nearly $ 7 - million jury verdict in favor of Diana Levine , a Vermont musician who had to have part of her right arm amputated after she was injected with an anti-nausea drug .
“ Next to getting my hand back , this is the best thing they can do , ” Levine said of the justices ’ decision .
“ I feel like something worthwhile has come out of a tragedy . ”
Advertisement
The ruling -- a rejection of one of the Bush administration ’s most far - reaching legal policies -- applies to the more than 11,000 drugs on the market in the U.S. , both over - the - counter and prescription medications .
Three years ago , the Bush administration switched long - standing Food and Drug Administration policy and announced that federal approval of a drug “ preempts ” or bars suits in state courts .
Last fall , the administration ’s lawyers joined the Levine case on the side of drug maker Wyeth and urged the high court to adopt the policy as federal law .
But Justice John Paul Stevens , speaking for the court , said the administration ’s view “ does not merit deference . ”
Congress has passed laws regulating drugs for a century , he said , yet lawmakers have never barred consumers from suing the manufacturers .
And for good reason , Stevens added .
Lawsuits not only compensate injured individuals , but they “ uncover drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly , ” he said .

Justices Anthony M. Kennedy , David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer agreed .
Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the result .
Thomas has been wary of the notion that federal regulations trump state law .
( It was the second defeat for manufacturers in this term on a preemption issue .
In December , the court cleared the way for smokers to sue the makers of “ light ” cigarettes for false advertising .
That 5 - 4 ruling rejected the industry ’s claim that the federal cigarette warning label barred such suits . )
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented in the drug case Wednesday .
“ This case illustrates that tragic facts make bad law , ” Alito wrote .
He called the result “ a frontal assault on the FDA ’s regulatory regime for drug labeling . ”

Levine ’s case began nine years ago , when she went to a clinic near her home for treatment of a migraine .
Besides a dose of Demerol to relieve the pain , she was given an injection of Phenergan for nausea .
What she did not know -- but the manufacturer knew full well -- was that the drug is extremely dangerous if it reaches an artery .
At least 20 other people had lost limbs this way .
Phenergan usually is administered orally or through an IV drip .
Wyeth told doctors and nurses that they could administer Phenergan by injection but said that they must use extreme care when doing so .

Levine said the injection was painful , and apparently reached an artery .
Gangrene soon developed .
She lost first her hand and then part of her arm .
She sued and won a settlement from the clinic , and then sued Wyeth for failing to fully warn her of the dangers of injecting Phenergan .
A Vermont jury agreed and awarded her $ 6.7 million in damages .
In its appeal , Wyeth said it had disclosed the risks to the FDA , which in turn had approved its warning label .
The Supreme Court took up the case of Wyeth vs. Levine to decide a far - reaching question of liability law in the pharmaceutical industry .

Had the court agreed that the FDA ’s approval shields the drug makers from lawsuits , the ruling likely would have ended tens of thousands of pending legal claims , industry experts said .
In a statement , the maker of Phenergan called the decision “ disappointing , not only for Wyeth , for patients and public health in general .
Patients are best served by a national standard for the labeling of prescription medication -- set by the medical and scientific experts ” at the FDA .
Consumer advocates said they were delighted and relieved .
Brian Wolfman , a lawyer for Public Citizen , said the FDA was overworked and understaffed .
“ Once a drug is marketed to thousands of people , we learn of things that we never knew in the clinical trials , ” he said , adding that private lawsuits act as an extra safety check for consumers .

With respect to the government ’s purpose of “ providing an institutional basis for defining the fundamental relational rights and responsibilities of persons , ” same–sex couples are similarly situated to opposite–sex couples .
THE 2012 Republican presidential caucuses just got infinitely more interesting .
The Iowa Supreme Court has upheld the right of same - sex couples to marry , with no restrictions .
An excerpt :
People to watch for comment : Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin , Mike Huckabee , Bobby Jindal , and the governors of South Carolina and Minnesota , Mark Sanford and Tim Pawlenty .
Opposition to gay marriage is falling rather dramatically , but in Iowa , where the Republican crown is given to the person who motivates the most evangelical , religious - right conservatives to caucus for him , there is no room for this decision .

Swine influenza
In response to cases of swine influenza A( H1N1 ) , reported in Mexico and the United States of America , the Director - General convened a meeting of the Emergency Committee to assess the situation and advise her on appropriate responses .
The establishment of the Committee , which is composed of international experts in a variety of disciplines , is in compliance with the International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) .
The first meeting of the Emergency Committee was held on Saturday 25 April 2009 .
After reviewing available data on the current situation , Committee members identified a number of gaps in knowledge about the clinical features , epidemiology , and virology of reported cases and the appropriate responses .
The Committee advised that answers to several specific questions were needed to facilitate its work .
The Committee nevertheless agreed that the current situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern .
Based on this advice , the Director - General has determined that the current events constitute a public health emergency of international concern , under the Regulations .
Concerning public health measures , in line with the Regulations the Director - General is recommending , on the advice of the Committee , that all countries intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza - like illness and severe pneumonia .
The Committee further agreed that more information is needed before a decision could be made concerning the appropriateness of the current phase 3 .
BRUSSELS --
The much - touted European " nuclear renaissance , " a key element in the European Union 's climate - change policy , still needs to overcome formidable obstacles to become a reality -- most notably in Germany .
This was one of the lessons learned at a two - day nuclear energy conference organized last week in Brussels by Marketforce , a public relations company .
Speakers claimed repeatedly that times have vastly improved for the nuclear industry , due to the specter of global warming and pledges made by various countries and regions to fight it .
" The future of the nuclear industry has not been this bright for 20 to 25 years , " noted Ralf Güldner , a member of the board of E.ON Kernkraft , the nuclear subsidiary of Germany 's utility E.ON Energie .
" Most European countries are thinking of having nuclear as part of their energy portfolios . "
Participants were reminded of the long list of nuclear power projects often mentioned as illustrations of Europe 's " nuclear renaissance . "
In France , a nuclear power reactor is under construction , a second is in the planning stages and a third may follow .
Finland is also building a power reactor .
Three are planned for Switzerland , two for the Czech Republic and one or two each for Poland and Lithuania .
Sweden has lifted its 30 - year ban on new nuclear plant construction .
More than 20 years after banning nuclear energy , Italy has just signed an agreement with France for at least four nuclear plants .
Debates on " new builds " are under way in Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands and Hungary .
A nuclear replacement program is starting up in the United Kingdom .
Robert Davies , U.K. country director at the French nuclear group Areva , lauded the " remarkable transformation " of the U.K. government 's nuclear policy over the last four years .
He predicted that the British nuclear market " will lead the European nuclear renaissance . "
Yet the overall tone of the conference was generally far less upbeat than Davies ' remarks .
Several speakers mentioned a fact with which all participants are all too familiar :
Though " global warming is good for nuclear energy , " as one speaker bluntly put it , the industry remains unpopular with most Europeans .
Public opinion : still thumbs down
" We are still the bad , and renewables are still the good , " lamented Koen Beyaert , director of communication at the Belgian Nuclear Forum , a pro-nuclear lobby .
He explained nuclear energy 's negative image as due to " decades of non-communication or purely scientific communication . "
The industry is keenly aware , however , that its poor image is largely due not to a lack of good PR but to a dearth of satisfactory solutions to the tricky problem of nuclear waste .
" To have public support , we need to solve the final disposal issue , " said E.ON 's Güldner .
Ute Blohm - Hieber , head of nuclear energy and waste management at the European Commission , agreed that waste is the " Achilles ' heel of the nuclear industry . "
Europeans are much more convinced of the risks attached to nuclear waste than they are of the potentially positive effects of nuclear energy on the climate -- a viewpoint the industry is promoting to polish its image .
A 2008 E.U. poll showed that radioactive waste remains a major obstacle to acceptance of nuclear energy , and that 4 out of 10 nuclear energy opponents would change their minds if a safe , permanent solution were found for waste management .
An earlier E.U. survey ( 2007 ) revealed that only a minority of Europeans ( 46 percent ) agreed or tended to agree that nuclear energy does help limit global warming .
By contrast , a strong majority ( 69 percent ) believed that nuclear energy decreases Europe 's energy dependency , and half of respondents felt that nuclear energy ensures lower and more stable energy prices .
The pollsters observed a high level of non-responses ( 23 percent ) for a statement to the effect that nuclear energy helps to limit global warming .
" This implies that not all Europeans are well aware of the low level of greenhouse gases emitted by nuclear energy as compared to many other energy sources , such as oil and coal , " concluded the E.U. pollsters .
The percentage of people who agree that nuclear energy helps limit global warming varied enormously among European countries , from a record 77 percent in Sweden to only 30 percent in Spain , which is focusing its energy policy on renewables .
In countries such as Belgium and Germany , the nuclear industry is striving to change public perception through public relations campaigns .
Little political support yet in Germany
The German nuclear industry has a big incentive for stepping up its public relations efforts :
It hopes to convince as many politicians and voters as possible of the advantages of nuclear energy before September 's German general election .
" So far , people have not really understood that nuclear energy can contribute significantly to solving the climate issue , " said E.ON 's Güldner in a sideline interview at Marketforce 's conference .
" We need to educate people ; this is something the industry will be working on in the months up until the election . "
Since last year , the German Nuclear Forum , another nuclear energy lobby , has been running a public relations campaign in Germany that employs innovative PR techniques to target not only decision - makers , but also women and the " young avant - garde . "
Since Germany made the decision to phase out its nuclear power plants by 2020 , the nuclear industry 's priority has been to win political acceptance for lifetime extensions for existing plants .
So far , acknowledged Güldner , this type of political support is nonexistent .
To create it , the nuclear industry needs to win over the public .
" And to do that , we need to solve the final disposal issue , " he added .
According to Güldner , no single party will hold an absolute majority after the forthcoming federal election , but if the votes produce a governing coalition , such as an alliance of conservatives and liberals more favorable to nuclear energy than the present one , the industry will have a shot at negotiating with the government to reverse the phase - out program .
" We are ready to do this , but if a completely adverse government comes to power , it 'll be very difficult , " predicted Güldner .
The Social Democratic Party officially opposes nuclear energy , and the Green and left - wing parties are absolutely against it and are " not moving at all " on the subject , according to Güldner .
But public acceptance is not the only major hurdle the European " nuclear energy renaissance " must overcome .
Another is financing .
Hopes may be soaring , but construction money is n't
Xavier de Rollat , director of corporate and investment banking at Société Générale , calculated that as of January 2009 , three dozen new reactors were being planned in Europe ( excluding Russia and Ukraine ) ; this means that a minimum of € 100 billion in investments will likely be required .
The problem , observed de Rollat , is that " all the major European utilities have taken a hit on their balance sheets " from the " brutal impact " of the economic crisis on the European economy .
He said there is much uncertainty , since " we do n't know if the energy markets -- oil , gas , European emissions rights and power prices -- have reached their lowest levels . "
De Rollat put the financing of the " renaissance " into a crude financial perspective : European banks , he says , are believed to have 75 percent as much exposure to U.S. toxic debt as American banks and have been slower to take write - downs ( $ 740 billion dollars in the United States versus $ 300 billion in Europe ) .
In addition , E.U. banks have $ 1,600 billion of exposure to Eastern Europe .
Added de Rollat , " European new - build projects face competition for access to [ financial ] resources " at a time when banks all over the world are much more selective in their lending because money is so scarce .
" Most new - build projects in Europe target grid connection in 2015 - 20 : How realistic is that ?
Can all announced projects be made at the same time ? " he asked , noting also that the limited number of nuclear technology suppliers may also risk slowing down the fledgling " nuclear renaissance . "
De Rollat predicted that of the many countries announcing their intentions to start nuclear programs , some will have a hard time raising the money for it .
Darius Montvila , strategic projects director at LEO LT , Lithuania 's national energy company , agreed : " We have chosen the technology , but financing will be difficult , given Lithuania 's size and the economic situation . "
LEO LT wants to build a new nuclear plant by 2018 to make up for the phasing - out of two Soviet - era reactors .

Jon Stewart looks at how conservative politicians and pundits are reacting to release of four Office of Legal Council Memos that explained the use of torture on detainees under President Bush .
Stewart notes that some pundits are disturbed more by then the release of the memos than by the fact that torture was used .
“ Apparently , everyone is not upset about the fact that we torture .
They are upset about the fact that we now know about it , ” said Stewart .
ADVERTISEMENT
Wall Street Journalist Columnist Peggy Noonan does n’t think the memos should have been released at all .
“ It ’s hard for me to look at a great nation issuing these documents and sending them out to the world and thinking , ‘ Oh , much good will come of that . ’
Sometimes in life you want to keep walking …
Some of life has to be mysterious , ” Noonan told a panel on ABC’s This Week .
“ Just keep walking , ” mocked Stewart .
Did Noonan also think we should “ keep walking ” past “ slavery , genocide , ” suggested Stewart .
The comedian had one final suggestion for Noonan as she strolled passed crimes of torture .
“ You know what else you want to do when you are walking , you might want to do this , ” Stewart said as he stuck his fingers in his ears .
“ Because the screams of torture might get loud , ” he explained .

YouTube still is n't making money for Google ( GOOG ) , and at last one analyst team thinks running the video sharing site will bleed $ 470 million over the course of 2009 .
Despite a 41 % share of the video market , Credit Suisse analysts Spencer Wang and Kenneth Sena project YouTube will only pull in $ 240 million in revenue this year .
That 's up 20 % from 2008 .
But Spencer and Kenneth say the costs of running YouTube are astronomical : About $ 711 million , with $ 360 million in bandwidth charges alone .
Technology.am ( Apr. 13 , 2009 ) — A pacemaker - like device aims to get victims to the hospital faster .
An implantable device that alerts high - risk patients when they show signs of a heart attack could shorten the time it takes for the wearer to seek medical attention .
“ Patients often take almost three hours to come to the hospital for a heart attack , and that number has n’t budged much despite patient - education efforts , ” says Michael Gibson , chief of clinical research in the Division of Cardiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , in Boston .
The device detects something called segment elevation , which causes an abnormality in the electrical current during the time that the heart is recharging between beats .
When the device detects signs of heart attack , it generates a buzz that the patient can feel on the skin .
A receiver outside the body , which wirelessly receives data from the implant , then tells the patient if the problem is severe–meaning he needs to go to the hospital immediately –or if it requires a more leisurely office appointment .
“ You can bring the device to the ER and show the doctor what was happening when the alarm went off , ” says Gibson .
While early tests show that it can detect heart attacks , the impact on a patient ’s long - term outcome is not yet clear : tests of other cardiac devices have found that detecting problems earlier does n’t always translate into better health for patients .
AngelMed ’s device , the Guardian , is similar to other implantable cardiac monitors , such as defibrillators .
Leads are attached to the patient ’s heart to record the electrical activity of the muscle .
While existing devices are designed to detect electrical problems in the heart , known as arrhythmia , the Guardian uses novel algorithms to detect problems with blood flow in the heart –the hallmark of heart attacks .
The device is already approved in Brazil and is now undergoing clinical test in the US .
It is , being developed by AngelMed , a medical - devices company in Shrewsbury , NJ .
According to Swedish National Radio , the judge in the Pirate Bay trial is a board member for a copyright industry lobbying group , and this conflict of interest may result in a mistrial .
The Swedish article has been translated into English on Freeform 101 by a Dane , and is a little rough :
There are different types of ____ ( ' jäv ' , translation help needed ) .
The most obvious case is if a judge is related to one of the inflicted parties .
This is not the case here .
But the concept of _____ ( ' delikatessjäv ' , translation help needed ) exists , and that means that you as a judge must not have any reason to be deemed partial .
" But I do not think that I can be deemed partial because of these engagements , " says Tomas Norström , judge in The Pirate Bay trial .
How do you explain that several law experts disagree with you ?
" You will have to ask them that yourselv .
Every time I am presented with a count , I access if I see myself as partial .
That I have not in this case , " says Tomas Norström .
But it does not matter what the judges thinks himself .
This thinks Erik Bylander , associate professor in law practice at the Gothenburg Business College .
" Regardless of the judge 's viewpoint , it can seem highly questionable .
In a high profile lawsuit such as this one , I am _____ ( ' förvåna ' , translation help needed ) that the court has not been more careful , " he says .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York state officials agreed on Friday to relax harsh 1970s drug laws that required prison sentences for nonviolent drug crimes in favor of laws that will let judges send addicts to treatment programs .

The new regulations will save the state about “ a quarter of a billion dollars ” a year in costs for housing prisoners , Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith said at a news conference in Albany , the state capital .
The existing laws -- known as the Rockefeller drug laws for Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller who in 1973 said they were needed to fight a heroin epidemic -- were considered among the nation ’s stiffest because they required prison terms for offenders and gave judges no discretion in sentencing .
They had been the target of Democrats for years but previous legislative efforts had produced only limited softening .
A joint release from Paterson , the state Senate and Assembly said the agreement eliminates mandatory prison sentences for many first - and second - time offenders and makes them eligible for probation that could include drug treatment .
“ This will probably be part of the budget because it does involve some funding , ” Paterson told reporters .
The Drug Policy Alliance , which has long campaigned against the state ’s tough drug laws , said New York ’s prisons hold approximately 12,000 drug offenders , representing nearly 21 percent of the prison population and costing New Yorkers hundreds of millions of dollars every year .
The new laws would create a drug “ kingpin ” offense for “ organized drug traffickers who profit from and prey on drug users . ”
They also would create new crimes for adults who sell drugs to children .
Paterson , saying that as a state legislator from New York City ’s Harlem neighborhood he saw “ first - hand the devastating effects ” of drugs , defended spending tens of millions of dollars of federal economic stimulus money to pay for new treatment programs .
He cited the example of a female drug addict who was arrested 60 times over 25 years .
After being successfully treated for her addiction , she became a drug counselor .
“ Rather than using public dollars while she was in prison , she is spending public dollars to conduct her life , ” he said .
Judges who preside over specialized drug courts will be able to decide whether to send first and second time offenders to these programs -- even if prosecutors object .
Judge Jonathan Lippman , chief judge of the Court of Appeals , called drug courts “ a tough - love regime . ”
“ ( Drug courts ) not only produce dramatic reductions in recidivism and great savings in social services costs but also serve to reunite families , and most critically ( increase ) public safety , ” he said .
Each prisoner costs the state about $ 45,000 a year and the recession has given the state ever - widening budget deficits .
Drug court judges , who will run the treatment programs , also will be able to dismiss all charges or seal all records if addicts successfully finish treatment .
They also can order extra monitoring and tests or penalties for those who fail .
So - called “ shock ” incarcerations are another option .
In addition to fights over whether judges should have to heed prosecutors ’ objections , there have been clashes over whether people serving sentences handed down under the old laws should now be offered the new treatment options .
Paterson estimated about 1,500 prisoners can apply , adding few would qualify because they either sold drugs for profit or have been violent .
The Board of Parole will now have to consider the new law ’s reduced sentences in deciding whether to grant parole .
Samuel Arbesman ( who may have a tad too much time on his hands ) has developed a transit system for the Milky Way :
It 's a cute idea , but I have some issues .
The biggest is differential rotation .
In much of the Milky Way , the tangential velocity is constant ( i.e. in km / s ) .
However , this means that the inner parts of the galaxy are rotating faster ( in degrees per second ) , such that the whole transit system will be winding up , making more and more unnecessary trips around the center in the inner regions -- this is the classic " winding problem " of spiral arm theory .
If you fight this by making your transit lines fixed , then they 'll go out of phase with the spiral arms , leaving a transit system that serves the thinly populated rural regions of the galaxy , with no regular service to the dense urban areas .
Finally , there are useful , well - populated regions above and below the plane of the Milky Way disk , so there needs to be a three dimensional component to the transit systems , definitely requiring some sort of bus -rail - submarine link plan .
But , we 've got a infrastructure - based stimulus package coming up , so maybe we 'll get lucky .
A prominent woman MP condemned the measure as a pre--election gesture to Shias , who make up an estimated 10 per cent of the population .
" I think this law is a shame for us , approving such a law in the 21st century . " said Shinkai Karokhial , an Afghan MP .
" It 's the same , what 's the difference ?
They also had child marriages and polygamy and women were not allowed out .
What 's the difference ? "
One crossroads – 16 traffic light !
This unbelievable crossroads can be seen in Poland city Poznan .
It would be very interesting to see how drivers behave there , and how many accidents happened ?
Which only makes sense , because game developers are clamoring to translate their virtual worlds to French .
The Toronto Star reports that a recent law passed in Quebec forbids the sale of English - only games if a French translation exists .
This has caused a certain amount of excitement among retailers , similar to that felt by the dinosaurs right before the meteorite hit .
“ I ’m afraid it ’s going to cost me my business , ” said game store owner Ronnie Rondeau , as quoted by the Star .
In a surprising turn of events , gamers just do n’t want to wait the months , or years , it might take for a translation of the latest games to appear , if one ever does .
Given that retailers already have to compete with online merchants who can carry a bigger selection and offer deep discounts , this law represents a butcher knife to the tender belly of traditional game stores .
Game developers likewise have reacted to this celebration of language purity in a predictable manner , as they collectively shrugged their shoulders and dropped Quebec from distribution lists .
The cost of translation and the resulting bug - testing simply is n’t worth selling to the small population of that twisted , backwards , xenophobic Canadian embarrassment of a province .
Even games slated to appear in France seldom meet the strict standards of Quebec ’s language laws , which only adds further cost and delays .
Although the goal of this new law is to protect and promote the French language , all it can do is serve to ram another spear into the side of the local game industry .
Meanwhile , Amazon watches with glee as a thin stream of bloody drool stretches down from its crooked smile .

It 's been a few minutes since we 've heard any news regarding color e-paper , and now Ricoh has announced that they 've taken a tip from their copier business to create a technology that displays hues fifty percent brighter than those currently available , retaining the graphics even when power is turned off .
Unlike other technologies , which use layers of red , green , and blue light separated by sheets of glass , this new iteration uses layered electrochromic compounds that turn cyan , magenta , and yellow variously when electricity is applied -- and if that were n't enough , the company 's gone and altered the molecular structure of the compounds to retain their color even when electricity is removed .
Rather than using glass , the layers are separated by some sort of clear insulation , resulting in a lighter device and a brighter appearance .
The company is looking to bring this to market within the next five years .

Enlarge By Ron Kuntz , Reuters John Demjanjuk is removed by immigration agents to an awaiting van from his Seven Hills , Ohio home on Tuesday .
CLEVELAND ( AP ) 
The return of alleged Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk to Germany for trial on war crimes was delayed again Tuesday by a federal court , shortly after six immigration officers removed the retired autoworker from his suburban home in a wheelchair .
A three - judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay until it could further consider Demjanjuk 's motion to reopen the U.S. case that ordered him deported , in which he says painful medical ailments would make travel to Germany torturous .
The government planned to continue its legal battle in court , said Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney .
An arrest warrant in Germany claims Demjanjuk , a native of Ukraine , was an accessory to some 29,000 deaths during World War II at the Sobibor camp in Nazi- occupied Poland .
Once in Germany , he could be formally charged in court .
Citing the need to act because of the possibility of Demjanjuk 's imminent deportation , the court issued the stay without addressing the U.S. government 's argument that the court had no jurisdiction to rule on Demjanjuk 's appeal .
Former son-in - law and family spokesman Ed Nishnic said the family was relieved the stay was granted .
" We 're delighted .
We 're prepared to make our arguments with the 6th Circuit , and it 's just a shame that Mr. Demjanjuk had to go through the hell that he went through once again this morning , " he said as he walked into a federal building in Cleveland where Demjanjuk was being held .
It was unclear whether Demjanjuk would be returned to his home in Seven Hills , a suburb of the industrial Midwestern city of Cleveland .
Nishnic was allowed access to Demjanjuk while he was in custody but was told that no decision had been made on whether he would be released .
As Demjanjuk 's wheelchair was loaded into a van at their home , his wife , Vera , sobbed and held her hands to her mouth .
As the van moved down the street , Vera turned and waved , sobbing in the arms of a granddaughter .
Several family members , including a 10 - year - old grandson , were in the home when the officers removed Demjanjuk .
Nishnic said Demjanjuk , a native of Ukraine , told his family , " I love you , " in Ukrainian and was aware that the officers were there to take him to Germany .
Nishnic said his former father - in - law moaned in pain as he was placed in the wheelchair .
" It was horrendous .
He was in such pain .
I would n't want to see anyone go through something like that , " said granddaughter Olivia Nishnic , 20 .
John Demjanjuk Jr. , who filed the appeal with the 6th Circuit earlier Tuesday , said the government had n't lived up to earlier understandings of how his father would be removed .
" They told me that they would have an ambulance .
They told me we would have three to five days ' notice , and obviously you can't believe everything the government tells you , " he told The Associated Press by phone while headed back to Cleveland from the federal appeals court in Cincinnati .
He predicted his father would not survive long enough in Germany to stand trial .
" If he is deported , if this madness and inhumane action is not stopped by the 6th Circuit , he will live out his life in a ( German ) hospital .
He will never be put on trial , " he said .
" It makes absolutely no sense that the Germans , after nearly killing him in combat , would try to kill him once again . "
The Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center said it was undeterred .
" We remain confident that John Demjanjuk will be deported and finally face the bar of justice for the unspeakable crimes he committed during World War II when he was a guard at the Sobibor death camp , " said Rabbi Marvin Hier , Wiesenthal Center founder .
" His work at the Sobibor death camp was to push men , women and children into the gas chamber .
He had no mercy , no pity and no remorse for the families whose lives he was destroying forever , " Hier said .
Deborah Dwork , a professor of Holocaust history at Clark University in Worcester , Massachusetts , said the Demjanjuk case illustrates that there is no statute of limitations on the crime of genocide .
" The issue is holding him accountable , no matter what his age , " she said .
Dwork said she believes German prosecutors acted cautiously and deliberately in bringing their case because they can't afford to run a weak trial .
Germany 's image in the eyes of the international community would be tarnished if Demjanjuk is acquitted , she said .
Demjanjuk has denied being a Nazi guard and claims he was a prisoner of war of the Germans .
He came to the United States after the war as a refugee .
Demjanjuk had been tried in Israel after accusations surfaced that he was the notorious Nazi guard " Ivan the Terrible " in Poland at the Treblinka death camp .
He was found guilty in 1988 of war crimes and crimes against humanity , a conviction later overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court .
A U.S. judge revoked his citizenship in 2002 based on Justice Department evidence showing he concealed his service at Sobibor and other Nazi-run death and forced labor camps .
An immigration judge ruled in 2005 he could be deported to Germany , Poland or Ukraine .

Webb puts marijuana legalization ' on the table ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday April 23 , 2009
Print This Email This Speaking to CNN on Thursday morning in an effort to whip up political support for his prison reform proposals , Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA ) insisted that marijuana legalization should be " on the table . "
His bill , introduced late March , aims to establish a presidential commission to study prison reforms and drug criminalization and make recommendations to Congress after 18 months .
Senator Webb 's bill is backed by Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) and has reportedly received " quiet encouragement from President Barack Obama . "
Some other stated supporters of Sen .
Webb 's reform proposals " include the current Judiciary panel head , Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate , Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , " noted the Times - Dispatch .
Advocacy group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition has also posted an electronic petition form in support of the Webb commission .
" With so many of our citizens in prison compared with the rest of the world , there are only two possibilities :
Either we are home to the most evil people on earth or we are doing something different -- and vastly counterproductive , " wrote Sen .
Webb in a March 29 editorial in Parade .
" Obviously , the answer is the latter . "
As a means of addressing the " national disgrace " -- as Webb says -- that is the US prison system , initial reports on the bill indicated that its authors intended for drug criminalization to be part of the study .
" Would you support perhaps legalizing marijuana ? " asked CNN's Kiran Chetry on Thursday morning .
" I think what we need to do is to put all the issues on the table , " said Sen .
Webb .
" You 're correct : if you go back to 1980 as a starting point , I think we had 40,000 people in prison on drug charges and today we have about a half a million of them .
A great majority of those are non-violent crimes , possession crimes or minor sales .
" At the same time , we 've got a situation with Mexican drug cartels conducting violence along the border , operating in 230 American cities , and we are n't getting our arms around that in a proper way so , we need to put it on the table .
That 's why we need a presidential commission to look at these things -- people who have high stature in these career areas -- and to report to the Congress on the best way to go forward .
But , nothing should be off the table . "
" And that includes , as you were saying , possibly looking at legalization ? " asked Chetry .
" Well , I think they should examine every aspect of drug policy to see what 's working and what 's not working ... " said Sen .
Webb .

Growing your social network .
So many are obsessed with it .
It 's fun to watch our numbers grow and to get all that attention .
But for those of us that rely on it for business , we must be constructive , targeted , and effective about how we approach social networking .
That 's because a well built social network becomes a fantastic channel for personal and business promotions .
I delved into more than 80 stories of people who have effectively grown their social network either in great numbers or strategically within their industry .
What follows are ten successful network growing techniques and the 12 inspiring stories of the people who made them happen .
Let art become life
Barret Swatek is the star of the online comedy series , " My Two Fans , " about an average single girl who rebounds from a broken heart with the help of her two fans .
Having blown all their budget on production , " My Two Fans " had no money for advertising , so off a friend 's recommendation , Swatek decided to start Twittering as her character , Kate Maxwell ( @KateMaxwell ) .
To get some fodder for Twittering and to find her audience , Swatek began following businesses and people that could relate to her show , such as dating sites , single women , girl power groups , fan clubs , etc .
In just six weeks , Kate Maxwell / Barret Swatek has collected more than 500 followers .
More importantly , she 's being followed by key industry players at Sony , Lionsgate , and NBC to name a few .
But Swatek
Twitters because she loves how people respond to her character and it really inspires her as a writer .
" The key to getting more followers and helping the show to grow is to constantly and consistently be funny and to always tweet in my character 's voice , " Swatek said .
Seed your network
For six months and with only 150 inactive members , the LinkToCharlotte Linked In group was languishing .
LinkToCharlotte 's goal has always been to connect local businesses and people in the Charlotte , NC area .
Founder Andrew Kaplan decided it was time to juice the membership of his group .
In June 2008 , he reached out to local influencers who could attract others to his local network .
Already having ties with professional sports teams , tourism , and political advisors , Kaplan sent out personal invites to their respective marketing departments to join the group .
Quickly seeing the benefits of being part of Kaplan 's local industry network , they in turn sent invites from their lists to join his network as well .
Today , LinkToCharlotte 's LinkedIn group has grown to 2,000 , plus it has expanded to include groups on the NING platform , Facebook , and Twitter .
Create super users
Glogster is a social network where users can create interactive posters , or " glogs . "
Glogs are very personal , and the Glogster team gets to know a lot about its users .
Realizing that some of their users are more avid and opinionated than others , Glogster decided to build a deeper connection with those users by creating a group of super users , or Glogster Commandos , explained Andrew Connelly , Glogster 's Director of Business Development .
After running a series of successful contests , Glogster offered regular users the opportunity to become a commando member .
Glogster views its commandos as partners with its development team .
Thoughts and ideas that have come from the group have included what prizes to give away ( iPods !
Glogster bought 100 of them ) to what they do n't like about the site ( Commandos hated the banner ads so Glogster took them down immediately ) .
" This is an exclusive group that is growing with us to help us make the best , most desirable product , " Connelly said .
Offer advice
Questions are asked to be answered .
And sometimes we can offer advice , thus answering questions that have yet to be formed .
Gary Unger , author of " How to Be a Creative Genius ( in five minutes or less ) " , began searching forum postings and Q&A on Linked In for ways he could help .
Asking for nothing in return , he provided unique advice for many people such as Francisco Hurtado of Spain who publicly asked in LinkedIn's Q&A forum , " How would you promote welding products ? "
Unger answered , " Build some structure like a really cool art piece at your facility using all your equipment and welding types .
Take photos of the process .
Put it in a brochure .
Mail it out .
Also , do a miniature one of that idea that can travel to trade shows . "
Hurtado and many others have been so appreciative of Unger taking the initiative to offer such thoughtful advice that Unger has received many connection requests and recommendations to connect .
Julie Isaac is also an advice maven .
When she joined Twitter ( @WritingSpirit ) she realized she needed to give people a reason to start following her , so she started tweeting daily creativity tips for writers .
With more than 15,000 followers , many of whom retweet her advice every day , Isaac 's parlayed that popularity into a larger mailing list , an upcoming ebook , and a live weekly writing salon called # writechat ( Sundays 12 p - 3 p PST ) .
For Isaac 's personal life , the Twitter interaction has resulted in an evolutionary leap .
" Twitter has n't just helped me connect with other people , it 's helped me connect more deeply with myself .
I 'm not the same shy and quiet woman I was when I first tiptoed onto Twitter .
I 'm more confident .
I 'm more me , " Isaac said .
Build your network before you launch your business
Before launching MyWorkButterfly , a site for working moms and moms wanting to return to the workforce , Bradi Nathan and Terry Starr conducted a National Moms Survey on Facebook .
The two women pushed the survey out to everyone they knew and asked those people to push it out to everyone they knew .
The goal of the survey was to find out what moms would want from a moms social network .
The feedback they got from that survey became the playbook for all the content and design of MyWorkButterfly .
Elements such as job listings , personalized welcome messages , and even the order of the drop down menu items came directly from that survey .
In addition , those initial survey takers became MyWorkButterfly 's first users and since they could see their voice was heard , they quickly became very supportive of the site .
After launching only three months ago , MyWorkButterfly claims 2,000 members and 40,000 + page views a month with over 6 minutes per visit .
Parlay your hobby into a business opportunity
Any good salesman will tell you the trick to getting trust is to get the potential client to like you first .
Life sciences attorney Libby Baney of B&D Consulting decided to build that trust by joining a dog lovers ' group on Facebook .
She became involved in the group by posting pictures of her dog and commenting on other users ' photos .
While she did enjoy participating in the group , she wanted Facebook to help her develop professional opportunities .
Baney mined users ' profiles and found many were in the fields of medical technology and pharmaceuticals .
Not wanting to infiltrate the dog related group with business pitches , Baney friended these people and then used her Facebook status update to let people know about her work as a life sciences attorney .
The updates seen by these new dog loving friends has resulted in more than ten different professional conversations .
One dog lover in particular turned out to be the CEO of a medical device company .
He saw her status update , asked to meet with her , and now her firm is representing his company .
Selective networking
Managing the marketing for Motion Golf , Sarah Greenwood was only interested in growing her client 's social network with golf enthusiasts .
She began searching for golf trade associations and non-profits that were on Twitter .
She mined the lists of people they were following looking for amateur golfers , golf pros , golf companies , golf blogs , golf writers , and media outlets .
This required a lot of research , clicking through and reading bios of many users .
To get followed back it was important for her to read posts , interact , and start a dialogue .
She quickly realized that those who chose not to follow her back were not interested in interacting with her .
So she unfollowed those people .
It 's been a lot of work says Greenwood , but after three weeks she 's set up four cross-marketing projects with other companies , and had conversations with two tour players , four national media writers , and many golf bloggers .
Today , the company 's Twitter account ( @MotionGolf ) has more than 1,400 highly targeted followers .
Give something away that 's customized for the user
One of my first experiences with this technique was when Andy Sernovitz , author of " Word of Mouth Marketing " sent me a luggage tag that had my business card laminated inside .
I had met Sernovitz a few weeks earlier at an event and had handed him my card .
I assumed he would just keep it .
I did n't expect him to send it back .
On the other side of the luggage tag ( the backside of my business card ) was an ad for his book and some advice that explained what he just did : " Word of Mouth Tip # 33 : Do something special and surprising . "
Another great example of personalized customization was what Dr. David Klein , a San Diego chiropractor did at a WordCamp conference in San Francisco .
He had a representative photograph people holding up a sign of their dream profession along with their Web address .
In turn , a cartoonist drew a caricature of that person in that profession .
Here 's mine : ( While I thought this was a great idea , since his business was local , he should have done it in San Diego , not San Francisco . )
Personally greet new members
Veronica Alvarez is the founder of FertilityTies , an online community for those trying to conceive or going through infertility .
Since fertility is a very sensitive and sometimes uncomfortable subject , Alvarez went out of her way to greet all new members personally through the site .
" I believe this was instrumental for new members to feel genuinely welcomed and to have a higher inclination to come back and visit the site , " said Alvarez .
Soon after , one of the site 's fertility doctors helped out with the personal greetings .
And a few months after that , the site 's veteran members continued the good will by greeting new members themselves .
The warmth of the community has become infectious and last Christmas , some members got together and surprised one of the site 's fertility doctors with a personalized gift , plus a gift basket to Alvarez for building the community to help them through their difficulty journey to conception .
With 85,000 + monthly visitors and 20 % monthly growth , Alvarez still makes as much time as possible to greet new members , plus gladly sees other members join in as well .
As Alvarez chimes , " We 'll continue to grow one warm greeting at a time ! "
Offer to give something away on YOUR birthday
" Native American culture - among others - has a custom of giving to others on your birthday , instead of receiving , " explained Leigh Shulman .
Continuing that custom , Shulman asked her blog readers , " How can I help ? "
She offered to help anyone in any way that did n't cost money .
And many readers took her up on it .
One asked for help planning a beach vacation .
A Spanish speaking person learning English wanted a writing assignment to improve her English .
And one person just wanted Shulman to smile at everyone she saw .
The net result has been more readers to her blog , new Twitter followers , and many new personal connections , which says Shulman is the main reason she engages in social networking .
Hungry for some more ?
I 've got more !
Read about two more bonus techniques : " Own a word " and " Participate in LinkedIn . "
But more importantly , I 'm sure you 've got some fantastic stories of your success with growing your social network .
I 'd love to hear it .
Please add it to the comments .
What I 've learned from all these stories is that success does n't need to be of the Ashton Kutcher 1 million followers level .
We can all gain success with much smaller numbers .
Success is about being able to make your service or product visible in times of need .
If you can do that just once , then you 've created an effective social network .

This guy is nuts , He is holding the forks to steer I think , and no helmet either .
The speedo says he is doing between 130 - 140 kph ( 80 - 86 mph .
The Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center showed that 45 percent of residents said they were more likely to vote for a Senate candidate who supports legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes .
The poll showed that 24 percent of residents said they would be less likely to vote for such a candidate .
Another 26 percent said it would make no difference .
[ WMUR ]
This new poll from New Hampshire casts further doubt on the rapidly unraveling notion that politicians must support harsh marijuana policies to get votes : Clearly , supporting medical marijuana legalization is by far the safest choice for New Hampshire politicians .
The margins are likely smaller in many states , but I bet you 'd see a clear preference for pro-medical marijuana candidates throughout most of the country .
It 's exactly this type of data that matters at this stage in our efforts .
We 've crossed a threshold in terms of educating our political culture about this issue .
They know who we are and what we want .
Our biggest challenge is demonstrating that political trends in fact favor reform decisively on certain issues and that opposition to something like medical marijuana will fairly reliably get you in trouble at the polls .
The numbers are already on our side , but I suspect we 'll have to start being more aggressive to drive the point home .
When we start launching vicious swiftboat - style attack ads accusing our opponents of wanting to arrest cancer patients , they 'll suddenly become a lot more interested in what the polls say .
The worlds best man with a sling shot .
Incredible skill .
The Weekly Momentum Planner is a planner that places the primary focus on the projects you need to do this week , rather than on the time you have to do those projects in .
It ’s great when you have a lot of autonomy about when and how you do the work , but still have a lot of projects to do .
The most up - to - date version of the Weekly Momentum Planner is on the Free Planners page – you might want to grab it there to follow along with this post .
Our other free worksheets are now over in the Content Library in our free Mighty Networks community .
The Big Idea
Many creative people have a different orientation to time and work than other people do .
We work from all over the place and often blur the lines between at - work and not - at - work .
On the other hand , there ’s a lot of pressure to get projects done , week by week .
Time is usually not the primary consideration – the work to be done is .
It ’s really easy for us to overestimate how much we can get done in a week , especially when we ’re continually juggling multiple projects .
Because individual projects take longer than estimated and we ’ve agreed to multiple projects , we end up with three options :
Stack projects ( thus working longer hours ) .
Renegotiate deadlines for agreed - to projects ( a Band - Aid , at best , that still drains credibility ) .
Drop agreed - to projects , either intentionally or unintentionally .
None of these options are particularly appealing .
So the idea behind this particular planner is to get all of your projects in the same space .
If you can see what you ’re doing and what you ’ve committed to , you have a better chance of working with a clear head and being able to commit with confidence .
Knowing that you ’ll be able to complete your current and proposed commitments , you can complete your projects with the clarity that you ’re working on what you should be working on .
You ’ll notice that this form is about constraints .
If you ’re juggling more than five projects at a time , you ’re doing a lot of shuffling .
If you ’re planning to work on five decent - sized deliverables or projects during a single day , you ’re probably planning too much .
Hopefully , the physical constraints of the planner help you gain the focus you need to do your best work .
Take a second to envision what it ’d be like to actually complete your projects with less stress rather than always working under the gun of a deadline and the stress of juggling too much at once – I hope this planner helps you get there .
How to Use This Planner
This planner serves as your weekly dashboard .
Use it when you ’re planning your week and review it throughout to make changes as needed .
Start with the left side of the planner first , as it ’s mostly about your constraints .
Monthly Objectives
Here is where you will look at the bigger picture to see what projects you ’d like to complete this month .
If you ’re also using the Quarterly Momentum Planner ( part of our Digital Momentum Planner Pack ) , you can simply transfer your Monthly Objectives from there to here .
This Week ’s Projects
This Week ’s Projects are simply the projects you ’re working on this week .
Yes , there are only five spots available – this is intentional .
Use the short name for your project , since you ’re probably using it with yourself anyway .
Also , use the number ( 1 –5 ) of the project as a reference throughout the planner .
If you ’ve completed your Monthly Momentum Planner , your active projects here are , hopefully , the same ones on your Monthly Momentum Planner .
If they ’re not , then remember , if you ’re planning effectively , you ’ll always be changing your plans .
Scheduled Events
If you ’re scheduled to be somewhere for a day , that ’s time you ca n’t use .
So mark down your scheduled events before you think about when you ’ll be working .
Deadlines
The purpose of this section is to organize the things that are coming up for the week that you need to focus on .
These are generally commitments you ’ve made with your clients and what you ’re used to working against .
Remember : the sooner you complete the project , the sooner you can focus on something else .
Note :
Think long and hard about whether you want to have multiple deadlines on one day .
Stagger them if at all possible and save yourself the stress of it all .
Weekly Dashboard
Now that you have the left column filled out , you should have a pretty good snapshot of when you should be working on what .
Be mindful of how much time you ’re planning on working on a deliverable and how much time you ’re actually working on that deliverable .
Notice trends so that you can better plan in the future .
Though I recognize that you may need every row on every line , do n’t feel like you have to have something on every line .
I would err on the side of under - committing rather than overcommitting until you have a good feel for how long you ’re actually working on your projects .
Lastly , be sure that you are practicing the 5 essential skills to do your best planning .

This sequence of three images , obtained by NASA 's Cassini spacecraft over the course of about 10 minutes , shows the path of a newly found moonlet in a bright arc of Saturn 's faint G ring , announced ny NASA on March 3 , 2009 .
In each image , a small streak of light within the ring is visible .
Unlike the streaks in the background , which are distant stars smeared by the camera 's long exposure time of 46 seconds , this streak is aligned with the G ring and moves along the ring as expected for an object embedded in the ring .
Cassini scientists interpret the moving streak to be reflected light from a tiny moon half a kilometer ( a third of mile ) wide that is likely a major source of material in the arc and the rest of the G ring .

The Cassini spacecraft wide - angle camera captured this view of Saturn at a distance of approximately 1.23 million kilometers ( 764,000 miles ) on January 19 , 2007 .
Taking in the rings in their entirety was the focus of this particular imaging sequence .
Therefore , the camera exposure times were just right to capture the dark - side of its rings , but longer than that required to properly expose the globe of sunlit Saturn .
Consequently , the sunlit half of the planet is overexposed .
This view is a mosaic of 36 images , 12 separate sets of red , green and blue images taken over the course of about 2.5 hours , as Cassini scanned across the entire main ring system .

PASADENA , Calif. , March 3 ( UPI ) --
The U.S. space agency says its Cassini spacecraft has found a moonlet within Saturn 's G ring that may be a main source of the G-ring and its single ring arc .
National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists analyzed images acquired by Cassini during the course of about 600 days and found the tiny moonlet , about one - third of a mile in diameter , embedded within a partial ring , or ring arc , previously found by Cassini in Saturn 's G ring .

" Before Cassini , the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon , which made it odd , " said Matthew Hedman , a Cassini associate at Cornell University .
" The discovery of this moonlet , together with other Cassini data , should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring . "
Saturn 's rings were named in the order they were discovered , scientists said .
The G ring is one of the outer rings and within it there is a relatively bright 150 - mile - wide arc of ring material that extends 90,000 miles , or one - sixth of the way around the ring 's circumference .
The discovery brings the number of Saturnian ring arcs with embedded moonlets found by Cassini to three .
The finding was announced Tuesday in an International Astronomical Union circular .
I am getting swamped with notes from folks saying that the new node to be put on ISS next year will be named " Colbert " .
But it 's not that simple .
As you may recall , NASA opened up a contest to name Node 3 , a connecting module to be put on the International Space Station next February .
The name " Serenity " ( awesome ! ) was doing very well , and then my arch - enemy Stephen Colbert started asking his Nation to send in votes .
Next thing you know , there were 230,000 votes for " Colbert " , 40,000 more than for " Serenity " .
But this is not over , because NASA was smart in the original contest .
Check out Contest Rule # 4 :
NASA will take into consideration the results of the voting .
However , the results are not binding on NASA and NASA reserves the right to ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency , its needs , and other considerations .
Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted - on candidate names .
NASA ’s decision shall be deemed final .
I 'll watch Colbert tonight , and I 'm sure he 'll claim victory .
But that clause means NASA does n't have to use the winning entry !
Of course , it would be smart in a PR way for NASA to name it " Colbert " -- and even if they do n't , I just bet the astronauts will , informally -- but we 'll see .
I 'm still holding out for the right choice .
After all , like the man said , you treat her proper , she 'll be with you for the rest of your life .

During his time in the university at Atlanta , he wrote his book : ” Los Ovnis .
Una de las Senales del Fin ” which sold several thousands in three editions .
Now he is writing a new book on this subject .
As he established in his book ; it was coming a day when UFO topic was a FACT , event or phenomena which nobody would deny because it was going to be observed for everybody around the world .
Now , you can see it all around the internet with new hundred of WEB pages about it .
Some testifying with truth about the subject , another trying to deny the events .
Another more radical wanting to discredited and erase totally from the public review this subject .
At opinion of this author , trying to cover the thousands of serious multinational witness is an absurd , ridiculus , and impossible task .
The British Intelligence and British government did important researches about this subject .
Do you believe that somebody can deny an investigation coming from Scotland Yard ?
British intelligence have technology , devices and instruments needed to get the truth , and they released it .
Also the British Royal family has a lot of interest on this subject , because everybody know about the circles with messages coming from heavens .
All the human efforts made to cover the UFO incidents have been unproductive , President Barack Obama is assuming the correct human position when he is appelling to the right that the public opinion at USA must be informed because it is a Constitutional right .
The question that author Flavio Farias is doing now :
Why the Chinese government is trying to hide the UFO phenomena ?
while the British are going to show the TRUTH ?
Any way the facts and coming global events are going to dramatically excibit the reality .

Saving Taiwan , one letter at a time
By Strong Chuang 莊秋雄
On Dec. 15 , 1978 , then - US president Jimmy Carter abruptly declared the switching of diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China ( ROC ) to the People ’s Republic of China .
This move shocked Taiwan and Taiwanese - American communities .
Many other Americans who cared for the US and its international relationships were also shocked .
Fortunately , less than four months later , on April 10 , 1979 , the US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act ( TRA ) .
The act effectively bridged and sustained the interrupted US - Taiwan relationship .
Section II -c of the TRA included an important paragraph concerning human rights in Taiwan .
This paragraph reads : “ Nothing contained in this chapter shall contravene the interest of the United States in human rights , especially with respect to the human rights of all the approximately eighteen million inhabitants of Taiwan .
The preservation and enhancement of the human rights of all the people on Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as objectives of the United States . ”
Many Taiwanese activists who subsequently struggled for democratization and were involved in the Kaohsiung Incident credited that paragraph for compelling the tyrannical Chiang Ching - kuo ( 蔣經國 ) — then - chair of the Chinese Nationalist Party ( KMT ) and Taiwanese president — to “ grant ” an open trial to the arrested activists , saving many of their lives .
I have also heard many say the existence of TRA ’s paragraph on human rights substantially emboldened Taiwanese freedom fighters to more courageously stand out in protest against Chiang ’s dictatorial rule to fight for Taiwan ’s democratization .
Therefore , replacing formal US - ROC diplomatic relations with the TRA might have actually expedited Taiwan ’s democratization process .
I believe it important to recall my own efforts to express my concern for human rights violations in Taiwan 30 years ago .
That concern led me to a person - to - person diplomatic action that may have encouraged the inclusion of the human rights paragraph in the TRA .
Hopefully , it will inspire Taiwanese - Americans today to undertake person - to - person diplomatic efforts to save Taiwan from being further betrayed and encroached upon by China .
When Carter ceased official recognition of the ROC in 1978 , I was working at Proctor & Gamble .
Owen Bradford Butler , then the company ’s vice chairman of the board , was one of the people worried about how this sudden change might affect the mutual interests of the US and Taiwan .
He was also the chairman of the policy / program committee of the National Association of Manufacturers .
Under this capacity , Butler quickly formed a fact - finding group including representatives , a senator , a state legislator , a lieutenant governor and individuals from religious , educational , veteran and business organizations .
He led this group on a weeklong fact - finding visit to Taiwan .
Upon his return , Butler wrote and published a very thorough report entitled “ U.S. cannot negotiate Taiwan out of existence ” published on Feb. 7 , 1979 , in the Cincinnati Enquirer .
Besides recounting the details of their Taiwan trip , Butler ’s article suggested and recommended how best for the US to sustain the relationship with Taiwan that had been elaborately built up over years .
I quickly responded to his article with a two - page letter .
Besides commending his concerns about the future of US - Taiwan relations , my letter also pointed out that the places they had visited and the people they had met in Taiwan were mostly pre-arranged by the KMT regime .
This meant that their visit did not allow them to truly see and understand the real views of the majority of Taiwanese .
My letter also gave a brief Taiwan history emphasizing the stark human rights violations of the KMT against the country ’s 85 percent ethnic - Taiwanese population .
As academic proof for my arguments , I attached an article that had recently been written by John Cantwell entitled “ Myth of Retaking the Mainland Still Fuels Taiwan ’s Repression . ”
I also mentioned my wish to meet him to provide more documents and materials related to the subject .
Soon after my letter , I was excited to receive an invitation to lunch with Butler on Feb. 27 , 1979 .
At that time , I was working with the Formosan Association for Human Rights to help Taiwanese prisoners of conscience .
I prepared many materials related to the KMT ’s human rights violations to present to Butler .
We had a very pleasant lunch for about two hours at Queen City Club and Butler treated me to a gorgeous meal .
During lunch , I almost over - enthusiastically and a little bit nervously described to him case after case of the KMT ’s human rights violations in Taiwan .
From the 228 Massacre in 1947 to the more recent cases at the time of Pai Ya - tsan ( 白雅燦 ) , Chen Min-chong ( 陳明忠 ) , Yen I - mo ( 顏伊謨 ) , Huang Hua ( 黃華 ) , Yang Chin -hai ( 楊金海 ) , Wang Sing - nan ( 王幸男 ) , Shih Ming - teh ( 施明德 ) and others .
In response , Butler promised that he would ask Ohio representative Bill Gradison to add a human rights paragraph to the draft of the congressional resolution related to the future of US - Taiwan relations .
Butler urged me to understand the hardships of the KMT government and defended the ROC a little .
He also contested my letter by saying that the visiting group to Taiwan had met people in religious and civilian commerce arenas .
He further claimed to have met one relatively young businessman who told him that the real future for Taiwan was to become an independent country .
After further inquisition , I believe it was at a dinner party given by Koo Chen - fu ( 辜振甫 ) and the young businessman may have been one of Koo ’s sons .
At the end of our lunch , before departing , Butler once again told me that he would ask representative Gradison to include a paragraph asking for the improvement of Taiwan ’s human rights in the soon - to - be - drafted TRA .
Finally , the TRA emerged , and it has a very powerful human rights paragraph indeed .
Soon after , the Kaohsiung Incident happened on Dec. 10 , 1979 .
I continued to send reports and materials to Butler concerning human rights violations in Taiwan .
I received a two - page letter from him dated Jan. 24 , 1980 .
In his letter , Butler said he would do his best , but he emphasized his limited ability to help .
He seemed to advise me not to be excessively demanding .
Butler also expressed his personal philosophy of avoiding excessive pursuit of “ personal fulfillment . ”
He reminded me there were worse human rights violations in many other Asian countries .
Butler was 57 then ( 17 years my senior ) .
In my interaction with him , he gave me the impression he was a compassionate , yet conservative person of integrity .
Two years later ( 1981 ) , he became chairman of Proctor & Gamble and eventually retired in 1986 .
He continued to serve society after retirement by asserting and promoting equal opportunity for education to all mankind .
I also remember reading an article in Moonbeam ( the Proctor & Gamble magazine ) reporting that in retirement , he and his wife were raising bison because his ancestors had killed too many of them .
The US government typically uses a “ passive approach ” when conducting human rights diplomacy .
In the case of the TRA , Washington seemed to be acting against its tradition , adopting an “ active approach ” in including the human rights paragraph in the act .
Thirty years later , I am still wondering whether or not my efforts really had some bearing on the inclusion of that paragraph .
The recent anniversary of the act has made me wonder even more whether my efforts to inform Butler of Taiwan ’s human rights violations at that time had an impact on the final appearance of the TRA .
If my input did in any way have some bearing on the inclusion of that paragraph , I hope my story will inspire Taiwanese - Americans today to put more energy into person - to - person diplomatic efforts to save Taiwan .

Google announced Friday that developers will soon be able to sell applications through the Android Market , and developers will receive 70 percent of the revenue from app sales — the rest will go to the carriers .
The Android Market is the primary distribution channel for Android applications .
It is tightly integrated with the platform and provides users with an easy way to obtain new software over the air .
Google publicly opened the Android Market when the G1 handset was released last year , but it initially carried a limited assortment of applications and offered no way for developers to sell their wares .
Everything in the Market is currently a free download , but this has n't stopped apps from appearing at a respectable pace .
The new support for priced applications opens the door to commercial software vendors who want to sell programs to Android users , and this could help to expand the availability of third - party software for Google 's nascent Linux - based mobile platform .
According to Google 's Eric Chu , who posted the announcement in the official Android Developers blog , payment processing will be handled by Google Checkout .
Developers will be able to set prices ranging from $ 0.99 to $ 200 .
Priced software will be available to users in the United States and the UK next week , and the feature will be rolled out incrementally to other regions .
Several other countries , including Germany , Austria , the Netherlands , France , and Spain will all have the feature by the end of Q1 .
The success of Apple 's iPhone App Store has unambiguously demonstrated the value of providing a user - friendly distribution channel for third - party software on mobile platforms .
Virtually every major mobile platform vendor is now adopting the strategy and preparing to offer similar services .
Palm launched its Software Store in December , Microsoft 's SkyCenter will go live later this year , RIM is preparing to launch a Blackberry Application Center in the near future , and Nokia 's new application store is expected to arrive next week in time for the Mobile World Congress .
Google 's platform is beginning to gain ground on Internet tablets and other consumer electronic devices .
A strong infusion of new , high - quality applications could make those products more appealing to consumers and help accelerate Android adoption .
Google 's mobile phone operating system , Android , made a big splash last year with the promise of many nifty phones from a slew of handset makers .
But six months later , only one Android phone is on the market : the HTC G1 .
Other than that , Google phones are scarcer than cabinet nominees who pay their taxes .
Several major handset makers have claimed they have Android devices in the works , but phones running the OS were largely missing at last week 's CTIA wireless trade show in Vegas and at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona last month .
Apart from a handful a new models this year , it appears the majority of models wo n't be out until 2010 .
" There is some loss of momentum in terms of perceived value , especially from a media and public perception point of view , " says Charles Golvin , an analyst with Forrester Research .
So what 's holding the Google phones back ?
Time to development , the lack of support from major U.S. carriers Verizon and AT&T , and some fears about how reliable Android is , say analysts .
Android is Google 's attempt to enter the packed — but presumably lucrative — market for smartphone operating systems .
Currently , that market is dominated by Apple 's iPhone , Nokia 's Symbian Series 60 , Research in Motion 's BlackBerry and Microsoft 's Windows Mobile .
Despite the economic slowdown , smartphones sales are expected to outpace the overall mobile industry growth and post double - digit annual revenue growth by 2011 .
Getting a chunk of this market is important for Google because it allows the company to play in a market that will potentially be even bigger than the PC - centric web .
With Android , Google is betting on an ambitious open source strategy that will put software written by it at the center of this business and help drive mobile access to its own apps .
This year , three or four new
Android - based phones are likely to be on the market , including the HTC - manufactured Vodafone Magic .
The touchscreen Magic will be similar to the G1 in looks , prompting some to dub it the " G2 , " though it lacks the G1's full keyboard .
Samsung will be the other major company to offer Android phones in 2009 , launching an Android phone outside the United States in June and another one in the works for later this year .
The company did not share any specific details about the devices .
Struggling cellphone maker Motorola has also promised an Android phone toward the end of the year .
" I think the bulk of Android devices will come next year , " says Chetan Sharma , a telecom analyst who has his own consulting firm .
The biggest promise of Android has been that it is a free and open platform that device manufacturers could take and customize to suit their own needs .
Since its launch , a number of major handset manufacturers , including LG , Samsung , Motorola and Garmin , have said they are working on Android devices , hoping to slap the inexpensive OS
onto their devices .
The move could bring down their costs in the long run and offer smaller companies a chance to fight larger rivals such as
Nokia and Research In Motion .
" Android is all about the long term payoff in terms of simplification of the platform and operating system for manufacturers , "
says Golvin .
" But it you look at the G1 , it is a very good device for a first effort .
But it has some rough edges , which is a reflection of the software . "
Compare that to Apple 's iPhone OS , a closed and proprietary system that is about to go into its third version .
The iPhone 3.0 OS is expected to be available this summer along with a new version of the device .
The new iPhone will offer several interesting new features for users and developers , including global search and the ability to sell additional content through third party applications .
The iPhone OS is also the de facto standard — because of its place in popular perception — for other manufacturers to better .
The longer it takes for Android devices to come to market , the more likely it is that developers and users will shift to competitors such as Apple , Research In Motion or even Palm .
That 's where Android faces the real threat .
One reason for the delay in new Android phones could be that it takes time for companies to customize a new platform to their needs .
" It 's a completely new platform and it takes time to customize it to the hardware , " says Michael Gartenberg , vice president of strategy for
Los Angeles - based analytics firm Interpret .
To get the first Android phone out , Google appears to have focused on working with one handset maker , HTC , says Tim Bass , senior manager of strategy for Samsung Telecom America .
" That created a bit of a gap for other companies , " says Bass .
" Now we are seeing equal support from
Google for all devices . "
LG , meanwhile , says it is looking at the Android platform , but the company says it has its hands full with new hardware that showcases its proprietary S - class 3 - D user interface .
" We are exploring Android but nothing 's locked down yet , " says Tim O'Brien senior director of marketing for LG Electronics Mobile U.S .
For other handset makers , such as Garmin and Asus , finding telecom carriers to pick up their Android devices wo n't be easy .
Major U.S. carriers — Verizon and AT&T in particular — are n't exactly clamoring for Android phones .
The duo are not a part of the Open Handset Alliance , the group that advocates Android .
And AT&T already has a runaway smartphone hit with the iPhone , while Verizon 's BlackBerry Storm is a respectable success , too .
" The big carriers are worried that if they launch something that is not fully baked , they will have to risk an expensive recall of the devices , " says Sharma .
" It takes time to work out the kinks with any new operating systems , so it would be fair to say the major carriers are adopting a wait - and - watch attitude . "
The next Android devices in the United States will be on T - Mobile and Sprint , the only two carriers that are part of the Open Handset Alliance .
And
Sprint 's hands are pretty full for now with the upcoming Palm Pre phone .
The Pre is expected to launch exclusively on the Sprint network by the end of June .
" Right now Sprint is very focused on Palm as a partner and has put most of its marketing dollars around it , " says Golvin .
" Even if there were an Android device waiting to be activated on the Sprint network ,
Sprint would probably say , ' let 's hold off so we can get full bang for the buck from the Pre . ' "
Still , all this is no reason to write off the Android , say analysts .
" In the grand scheme of things , small delays are not going to take away from Android 's attractiveness as a platform for handset makers , " says
Golvin .

MANILA ( Reuters ) - Southeast Asia is one of the world ’s most vulnerable regions to climate change and could face conflict over failing rice yields , lack of water and high economic costs , a major Asian Development Bank report shows .

The region ’s economies could lose as much as 6.7 percent of combined gross domestic product yearly by 2100 , more than twice the global average loss , according to the ADB ’s report on the economics of climate change in Southeast Asia .
“ By the end of this century , the economy - wide cost each year on average could reach 2.2 percent of GDP , if only market impact is considered ...( to ) 6.7 percent of GDP when catastrophic risks are also taken into account , ” the British - government funded report said .
This compared with an estimated global loss of just under 1 percent of GDP in market impact terms , the Manila - based ADB said .
The global economic downturn could delay funding for climate change mitigation measures by regional governments .
Yet this was the time to offer incentives for green investment schemes in the energy and water sectors , said the study focusing on Indonesia , Philippines , Thailand and Vietnam .
These schemes could involve the shift to renewable and clean energy options for the power and transport sectors across Southeast Asia , home to nearly 600 million people .
In particular , cutting carbon emissions from forest fires and deforestation was crucial since these were major contributors to the region ’s total emissions , it said .
Renewable energy such as wind , solar , biomass and geothermal also offered great potential in slashing emissions .
VULNERABLE
But if nothing was done globally to fight climate change , Southeast Asia could suffer a decline in rice output potential of about 50 percent on average by 2100 against 1990 levels .
The yield drop ranged from 34 percent in Indonesia to 75 percent in the Philippines , with the fall forecast to start in 2020 for the four nations .
Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change because of the high economic activity along its long coastlines , and its heavy dependence on agriculture , forestry and other natural resources .
Unless the pace of climate change was checked , millions of people in the region would be left unable to produce or purchase sufficient food .
“ More people will be at risk of hunger and malnutrition , which will cause more deaths .
The possibility of local conflicts may increase , ” said the report .
Annual mean temperature in the four countries could also rise by an average 4.8 degrees Celsius by 2100 from 1990 levels if global emissions keep growing .
This would intensify water shortages in the dry season and raise flooding risks during wet periods .
The report says an increase in extreme weather events , such as droughts , floods and storms , and forest fires arising from climate change would also jeopardize export industries .
It said the region , which contributed 12 percent of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 , had made significant efforts to counter climate change , but most steps were reactive and offered short - term benefits with implementation patchy .
Raising public awareness of climate change and its impact , increased funding and enhancing policy coordination , were crucial , it added .
Stepping up measures to adapt were also needed .
These included scaling up water conservation and management , developing heat - resistant crop varieties , more efficient irrigation systems and enhanced awareness - raising programs to prepare for more forest fires .
The Milk of Sorrow is director Claudia Llosa 's second feature film Peruvian film The Milk of Sorrow has won the Berlin Film Festival 's coveted Golden Bear award for best picture .
The first Peruvian film in the festival 's main competition , it tells the story of a young woman who was born of her mother 's rape in the 1980s .
It beat hotly - tipped The Messenger , starring Woody Harrelson , and My One and Only , with Renee Zellweger .
The runner - up Silver Bear was shared by Uruguay 's Gigante and Germany 's Everyone Else .
" This is beautiful ... this is such an honour , " said The Milk of Sorrow 's director , Claudia Llosa , on receiving the award .
" This is for Peru .
This is for our country . "
Hit picker The Messenger , which sees Harrelson play an army officer assigned to inform the next of kin about soldiers killed in combat , won the Silver Bear for best script for writers Oren Moverman and Alessandro Camon .
The Messenger , starring Woody Harrelson , won best script Sotigui Kouyate from Mali won the Silver Bear for best actor for his turn in London River as a French Muslim waiting for news of his son after the deadly bombings in London in July 2005 .
The film also stars Brenda Blethyn and is directed by French - Algerian Rachid Bouchared .
The best director Silver Bear went to Iranian Asghar Farhadi for About Elly , the story of middle - class Iranians whose trip to the Caspian Sea turns to tragedy as they try to uphold their social customs .
British actress Tilda Swinton was this year 's jury president .
The Berlin Film Festival is in its 59th year .
Part of its appeal is its reputation for often picking out future hit films .
Last year 's winner of the Golden Bear was The Elite Squad , a violent tale of corrupt drug - squad officers in Brazil .
The UK's Sally Hawkins was best actress for Happy - Go - Lucky .
Last month she also won the Golden Globe for best comedy actress for the same role .
Iran 's Reza Naji won best actor at Berlin last year for The Song of Sparrows .
US film - maker Paul Thomas Anderson took the prize for best director for There Will Be Blood .
Its star Daniel Day - Lewis went on to win an Oscar for best actor .

The main DVD commentary track for the Futurama episode Roswell That Ends Well briefly discusses the immensely complicated situation created in Philip J. Fry 's DNA when he accidentally becomes his own grandfather , by travelling back in time to 1947 and sleeping with his paternal grandmother , thereby conceiving his father , Yancy Fry .
Here 's
Fry 's family tree .
Fry = Mildred | | Yancy =
Fry 's mother , first name unknown , maiden name Gleisner | | Fry
Figuring out Fry 's genetic makeup
Pick any one of Fry 's genes and follow it forwards in time .
Call this Gene A .
When Fry sleeps with Mildred in 1947 , there is a 50 % chance that Gene A gets carried on to Yancy , and a 50 % chance that Gene A is discarded .
That means Yancy 's genetic makeup is 50 % Fry 's genes and 50 % Mildred 's genes .
Assume that Gene A did make it to Yancy .
Now go forward another generation .
We know that Fry is made up of 50 % Yancy 's genes and 50 % Fry 's mother 's genes .
But we also know for a fact that Gene A is present in Fry 's genetic makeup .
That means , for Gene A , either :
Fry inherits Gene A from Yancy and it becomes a causal loop :
Yancy inherits it from Fry , Fry inherits it from Yancy , and so on forever .
Let 's say X % of Yancy 's genes do this .
Yancy does NOT pass Gene A on to Fry - but Fry receives an identical Gene A from his mother instead anyway .
Then ( 50 - X ) % of Yancy 's genes do this .
Explain that again ?
50 % of Fry 's genes are regular genes , inherited from his mother
X % of Fry 's genes are eternal genes with no origin , inherited from Yancy
( 50 - X ) % of Fry 's genes are regular genes , inherited from Yancy , who originally inherited them from Mildred .
When Fry sleeps with Mildred , the eternal genes are among those Fry passes on :
50 % of Yancy 's genes are regular genes , inherited from Mildred
X % of Yancy 's genes are eternal genes with no origin , inherited from Fry
( 50 - X ) % of Yancy 's genes are eternal genes with no origin , inherited from Fry , who originally inherited them from his mother .
When Yancy sleeps with his wife and conceives

APRIL 28 -- Meet Stacey Anvarinia .
The North Dakota woman , 26 , is facing a child neglect charge for allegedly breastfeeding while drunk , according to court records .
Anvarinia , a Grand Forks resident , yesterday pleaded not guilty to the criminal count , which stemmed from a police visit to her home in February .
While responding to a domestic disturbance call , Grand Forks Police Department officers watched as an ' extremely intoxicated '
Anvarinia ' began breast feeding her infant in front of us , ' according to an incident report .
Since alcohol can pass from mother to child via breast milk , Anvarinia was arrested for neglecting her six - week - old infant ( the felony information filed against Anvarinia in District Court can be found here ) .
The baby was transported to Altru Hospital for examination , while Anvarinia was booked into the county lockup , where her mug shot was snapped .

He is one of rock music 's most principled stars , nobly fighting poverty in Africa , lobbying for world peace , and saving the planet .
But U2's David Evans may have finally picked a fight too far : against America 's wealthiest Nimbys .
The guitarist , better known by his stage name The Edge , has upset residents of Malibu , the seaside city north of Los Angeles , by attempting to build five new luxury homes on a pristine hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean .
Neighbours in Sierra Canyon , an exclusive district inhabited by the likes of Dick Van Dyke , Kelsey Grammer , and James Cameron , have launched a noisy campaign against the development , which they claim will " permanently scar " the landscape .

Evans , a supposed environmentalist , is accused of wanting to flatten the top of a mountain , put a road through slide - prone areas , and move 70,000 cubic yards of earth for construction of the " McMansions " which will boast views of the world - famous Surfrider Beach .
Critics claim his construction will harm wildlife , cause noise and dust pollution , add to land erosion and run a water pipe through pristine wilderness .
" The downside of this is a permanently scarred mountainside , for the benefit of a very few , that for many years all will view , " Jefferson Wagner , a Malibu councilman , told the Los Angeles Times .
" For somebody so revered even to be orchestrating this type of development in such a sensitive area is hypocritical . "
Evans intends to live in one of the new properties , a four - bedroom house called " Leaves in the Wind " .
Another will go to his partner in the construction project , the Irish property developer Derek Quinlan .
The three that remain will be sold on the open market .
That , however , will require it to get rubber - stamped next month by the California Coastal Commission , who admit to " significant concerns " about the development after receiving a raft of complaints from worried locals .
" All of us believe [ U2 ] is a band that 's going to save the world , that has brought attention to so many disasters on the planet .
Then , when it comes to the little things , they would just tip - toe around and do stuff that 's not quite right , " a resident , Candace Brown , said .
She said bad blood had existed between Evans and his neighbours since the local archery club , " an institution in Malibu " , was evicted from its practice grounds on the property , which he'd brought for $ 15 m in 2006 .
Another neighbour , Scott Wilder , told the LA Weekly that he objected to aspects of The Edge 's rock - star lifestyle .
" There was one occasion when his enormous tour bus stopped dead on the road to my house , blocking it , " he said .
" I asked the driver to move , but he said I 'd have to wait , as he did n't want to interrupt The Edge and Axl Rose [ a fellow Malibu resident ] , who were in an intense discussion at the back of the bus . "
Evans has owned a different home in Malibu for a decade .
With his wife , Morleigh Steinberg , he also keeps properties in Manhattan , the south of France , and Dublin .
Like the rest of U2 , he controversially chooses to pay taxes in the Netherlands .
" These homes will be some of the most environmentally sensitive ever designed in Malibu , or anywhere , " Evans said , in response to critics .
" I 'm disappointed that certain critics either do n't have the facts or have ulterior motives . "
Kate Moss has wrought much magic during her nine - season spell of working alongside Topshop , their ingredients being alluring dresses and tight jeans leather - and suede - adorned for a smack of good old rocky feeling .
Some knitwear thrown in for a good measure and well - calculated novelty striped out the composition to a perfection and her characteristic sunny inspiration was very much in evidence .
As if it was n’t enough , we are having extra touches this season .
This time prints have stepped in , for which Kate Moss professed a long - standing liking .
Sure of their captivating qualities , she sorted through a huge collection of her old ones and enjoyed anew the sweet sensation of some of the prints from Liberty archive samples .
And hence the ideas for her spring - summer 2009 Topshop display spawned .
The print studio proved only too eager to play along and handle all her ideas to the supermodel ’s satisfaction , leaving her beaming with delight at their highly professional collaboration .
Poppy , Kate Nouveau and Lilabell , whose name rings the bell for Kate ’s daughter Lila , are priming to do justice to her set of cotton and chiffon dresses and camisoles complete with exclusive coloring .
This time Kate decided she would n’t do without underwear , and 2009 will witness her very first staggering offering of lace and cotton bras and pants with flowers - against - black background design .

The python dragged him up a tree , but when it eased its grip , Mr Nyaumbe said he was able to take a mobile phone out of his pocket and ring for help .
Weighing everything , President Obama got it about as right as one could when he decided to ban the use of torture , to release the Bush torture memos for public scrutiny and to not prosecute the lawyers and interrogators who implemented the policy .
But there is nothing for us to be happy about in any of this .
After all , we ’re not just talking about “ enhanced interrogations . ”
Lawrence Wilkerson , the former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , has testified to Congress that more than 100 detainees died in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan , with up to 27 of those declared homicides by the military .
They were allegedly kicked to death , shot , suffocated or drowned .
Look , our people killed detainees , and only a handful of those deaths have resulted in any punishment of U.S. officials .
The president ’s decision to expose but not prosecute those responsible for this policy is surely unsatisfying ; some of this abuse involved sheer brutality that had nothing to do with clear and present dangers .
Then why justify the Obama compromise ?
Two reasons : the first is that because justice taken to its logical end here would likely require bringing George W. Bush , Donald Rumsfeld and other senior officials to trial , which would rip our country apart ; and the other is that Al Qaeda truly was a unique enemy , and the post - 9/11 era a deeply confounding war in a variety of ways .
First , Al Qaeda was undeterred by normal means .
Al Qaeda ’s weapon of choice was suicide .
Al Qaeda operatives were ready to kill themselves  as they did on 9/11 , and before that against U.S. targets in Saudi Arabia , Kenya , Tanzania and Yemen  long before we could ever threaten to kill them .
We could deter the Russians because they loved their children more than they hated us ; they did not want to die .
The Al Qaeda operatives hated us more than they loved their own children .
They glorified martyrdom and left families behind .
For a warrior king who had conquered most of the known world by the age of 33 , Alexander the Great never flinched when it came to a fight .
But even he might have been left powerless by a row in Greece over the location of a statue , carved in his likeness in 1972 .
Seventeen years after its acquisition by the Greek culture ministry , the rendition of the military commander has been gathering dust in a basement storeroom because of fierce controversy over where to put the sculpture .
Nationalist - minded politicians , on both sides of the spectrum , believe the statue " rightfully " belongs to a prominent square in the heart of ancient Athens .
There , they say , the Macedonian king would not only receive maximum viewing but the reverence he deserves from a people who see themselves as his rightful descendants .
Had it not been for archaeologists , that might have happened .
But the purveyors of Greece 's past - a powerful lobby in this antiquities - rich country - have strongly resisted the move , saying Alexander came to the capital " as a conqueror " .
The row might have gone unnoticed had it not been for the recently reinvigorated intensity of the name dispute between Athens and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
Since it proclaimed independence in 1991 , Greece has contended that its neighbour 's determination to call itself Macedonia has concealed territorial ambitions over its own province , which bears the same nomenclature .
Relations between the two reached a new low last year when the ex-Yugoslav republic named its international airport and highway after Alexander the Great .
They plummeted further when Athens blocked Macedonia 's membership of Nato - and threatened to use its right of veto , again , to stop the ex-communist nation joining the EU .
Raising the bar further , a mayor in Skopje proposed last week that the Macedonian capital 's main square be adorned with a " singing " statue of Alexander mounted on a horse .
By erecting the statue in a fountain that belted out tunes of the late Toše Proeski - the nation 's most famous crooner who was killed in a car accident in Croatia in 2007 - the nation , she said , would give celebration to its two most famous sons , in a way that Greece never could .
Last weekend , I started a 4E campaign for my son Nolan and his friends .
The plan is to take them through the entire Keep on the Shadowfell module , and then probably into Thunderspire Labyrinth , with possible detours into various level - appropriate Delves , or something from Monte Cook 's awesome new project , Dungeon - a- Day , if it makes sense to incorporate it into the campaign .
All week , I 've been posting about the session , and today I thought I 'd wrap the whole thing up with some thoughts about what I learned from my first time behind the screen as a Fourth Edition DM .
As you can probably tell from my posts this week , I had a lot of fun running this game for my son and his friends , and I can't wait for our next session , which is when we 'll actually begin The Keep on the Shadowfell .
If you 've followed along in the comments this week , you know that I made a lot of rookie DM mistakes .
Luckily , none of them were the kind that broke the game or ruined anyone 's good time , but I sure made them .
I knew that would happen , which is why I started us all out in a 3 - encounter dungeon delve instead of diving right into the module that will be the starting point for our campaign .
All this week , with the benefit of hindsight and without the pressure of players at the table , I 've gone over the things I learned , and the mistakes I made during the session .
Today , I wanted to share some of the things that came to mind , as well as some other things from a lifetime of gaming that I had n't thought about until this week .
My hope is that this will be useful for DMs and players alike .
I 'd love it if you 'd add your own comments , if anything related comes to your mind while you read this post .
First of all , in spite of our mistakes , we all had a lot of fun .
As far as I 'm concerned , the session was a HUGE SUCCESS as a result .
The whole point of playing an RPG is to have fun while engaging the imagination , right ?
Mission accomplished , and not in the fake George Bush way .
Mostly , this session reaffirmed some of the core concepts that all DM guides share , from GURPS to T20 to D&D and beyond .
Among them are surprise !
Fear !
Ruthless Efficie – wait .
Sorry .
That 's wrong .
Put down the soft cushions and I 'll try again .
Among those concepts are such diverse ideas for DMs as ...
Whenever you can , say yes .
D&D is essentially a collaborative storytelling effort , and the best way to encourage everyone to contribute to the the effort is to take their input , and say Yes , and ...
This is something we drill into beginning improv comedy students , for a good reason : nothing derails someone 's creativity faster than telling them , directly or indirectly , that their idea is stupid .
You take their idea , say " Yes , that is a lovely hat , and it also has something tucked into the hat band ! "
This keeps the story moving forward and encourages everyone to feel safe taking risks , and just suggesting an idea can feel very risky to more people than you 'd think .
Now , I do n't mean that you let the players push you around , and you certainly do n't let them do things that are dangerous or risky without serious consequences , but you nobody likes being stuck on rails and pushed around in the cart .
Example :
At the beginning of our session , one of Nolan 's friends wanted to climb a tree and look around .
There was no need to do that , but the tree was there and it seemed like something for him to do , so I let him do it .
I even had him roll athletics to see how high he could climb , and let him make a perception check when he got up there .
He did n't roll very well , but one of the kobold slingers in the tower saw him , and told his allies about the intruders .
This leads into ...
Everything is important to the PCs .
Do n't mention it , do n't put it on the map , do n't even bring it into their minds unless you 're ready for them to do something with it .
Think about this from their point of view : they 're trying to build the world in their heads , and you never know what 's going to grab their attention .
If there 's one thing I 've learned over the years , it 's this : they will ignore bookcase you 've spent a ton of effort stocking with cleverly - titled tomes of great knowledge and a hidden lever that activates the secret door , so they can focus with laser precision on the box you put in the corner , because you had a cool tile with a box on it or something .
Of course , it 's not the end of the world when they do that ; you can either nudge them toward the bookcase , or simply move the lever next to the box .
This is even more important when you have NPCs .
I keep a little folio of NPCs handy , just in case the blacksmith I thought would do nothing more than sell them an axe ends up being someone they decide to visit all the time for some reason or another .
SPOILER ALERT : In this campaign , I 'm using the missing mentor hook .
I built more of a backstory for Douven Staul and his connection to the PCs than the text for Keep on the Shadowfell provides , and I have a feeling they 'll want to interact with him if they find and release him .
In case they decide to cut his bonds before all the bad guys in that encounter are dispatched , I 've stuck a 3rd level NPC warlord into my bag of tricks , so they can enjoy the thrill of fighting by his side , if they want to go that way .
Listen to your players , and they will tell you what they want to do .
Even if they do n't come out and say it directly , they will reveal a lot to you with their actions , and you can tailor the game a little bit to make them happy .
Nolan wanted his dwarf fighter to mow down lots of bad guys , so I sent lots of minions toward him whenever I could .
His friend who played the rogue wanted to do rogue-y things , so I turned a set of closed doors into a set of closed , locked doors .
His other friend , who played the wizard , was excited to play , but seemed intimidated by the complexity of the whole thing .
I remember feeling that way the first few times I played , and I was certainly anxious to be simultaneously running my first 4E game ever and sitting behind the DM screen for the first time in years , so I could relate .
I made a concerted effort to put him at ease , and after we'd been playing for a little while , I could see him settle down and relax .
As a bonus , it helped me relax , too .
Reward clever thinking .
As a player , I want to feel like I 'm a mythical , heroic character who can do things in a fantasy world that I 'd never be able to do in the real world .
When Nolan 's friend wanted to leap around the wyrmling , I could have simply told him that was impossible , but since nothing is impossible in D&D , I just made it very difficult .
Had he failed , he was going to find himself dazed and prone at the feet of a very angry creature .
You can also use rewards , like little XP bonuses and NPC reactions , to encourage roleplaying , if that sort of thing is important to you ( like it is to me . )
Keep it simple , especially if you 're just getting started .
I have this idea for an epic campaign , where the forces of Darkness and Evil are gathering to invade the world .
Yes , it 's as original as the color blue , but it gives me a reason for everything to happen .
The events of Keep on the Shadowfell are tied to it , and it 's simple enough to modify other modules to reflect this larger story that I have in mind .
I love the idea of foreshadowing , and while there 's a little bit of that built into Shadowfell and Thunderspire , the farthest I was willing to go with my first session was the suggestion that some of Coppernight 's companions were kidnapped .
( Irontooth may mean something to some of you , if you catch my drift . )
I could have overdone it with harbingers of doom and stuff , but I 'm saving that for later in Shadowfell , when the cultists really get going .
I 'll drop hints if it seems appropriate , but mostly I 'm keeping this simple until I have more experience running things .
Know where you 're going , but be flexible .
By having some idea about where we 're all going , but not overdoing it , I leave myself a lot of room to branch out into delves or other adventures , like the totally awesome Rescue at Rivenroar from Dungeon Magazine # 156 .
In fact , depending on how Shadowfell goes , I may slide the PCs into the Scales of War campaign at some point , because it 's a pretty awesome story .
The more descriptive , the better .
But did n't I just say keep it simple ?
Yes , but these things are n't mutually exclusive .
While I can keep the story simple , I can still work hard to make the encounters more than moving figures around and rolling dice .
For example , Nolan used a power to rip his maul through a pair of minions who were adjacent to him .
He hit them both , but instead of just saying that , I told him , " your maul crashes through its head , streaming blood and gore behind it as the power of your swing carries into the other one .
Their bodies fall to the ground with a wet thud . "
When the rogue rolled particularly well with a ranged attack , I told him , " your dagger whistles through the air toward your target , and catches it in the throat as it lunges toward you .
Its eyes widen and glaze over as it falls down , dead . "
I also added smells , sounds , and anything else I could do to make the tower they were in really feel old and decaying .
It helps that I 've read more fantasy genre fiction than I 'd like to admit .
Do n't be afraid to improvise .
When it looked like the final encounter , which should have delivered the greatest challenge , was going to be a cakewalk , I just looked at some stat blocks and added a few more creatures to the encounter so it would feel more climactic .
I knew I had the cleric back in the cell , and if things got really , really bad , he could figure out a way to race in and save the day ( as a general rule , though , I do n't recommend doing things like this too frequently , or your players will figure it out and act accordingly . )
Preparation is key .
I could improvise , stay flexible , and say " yes , and ... " because I 'd spent a lot of time preparing the session .
When you decide to DM a game , you 're in for a whole lot of fun , but you 're also assuming a tremendous responsibility .
A good DM can overcome a bad system or module , the saying goes , but nothing can overcome a bad DM .
The best way to ensure you do n't become the dreaded " bad DM " is by taking this responsibility seriously , and investing - that 's right , investing - time to prepare your sessions .
Read all about your monsters , understand their roles ( Brute , Lurker , Controller , etc. ) and pay attention to the tactics the module 's author tells you to use .
In our third encounter , it says that the wyrmling is willing to catch a few kobolds in her breath weapon , if it means getting all the PCs .
When she did , the kids were all surprised , and realized that she meant business .
Without the tactics that told me to do that , I probably would n't have done it .
Get an official DM Screen .
I think it 's worth getting an official DM Screen , because it 's filled with useful charts and tables .
I saved a lot of time that I would have spent digging through the DMG and PHB because I had that right in front of me .
I recommend making index cards for each player and group of monsters , and using them to keep track of initiative order .
On the PC cards , I wrote the player 's name , and the character 's class , race and name .
It 's a little thing , but when you use character names and descriptions instead of a player 's name , it makes a difference and keeps the world alive , while encouraging the players to think of their characters as actual people , instead of stats and minis .
Never forget that you 're doing this to have fun .
' nuff said , true believers !
Finally :
The first couple of times you play , keep notes when you 're unsure about things , and spend some time with the DMG and PHB after the session to see if you could have done anything differently .
After you 've done that , write about it in your blog so other people who are more experienced than you will share their own insights .
I hope you 've enjoyed this week of D&D posts ; they were a lot of fun to write .
Now seems like an appropriate time to sponsor myself , and plug my shirt .

LONDON 
In his first full day in Europe , President Obama conceded Wednesday that the United States had “ some accounting to do ” for failures that led to the world ’s financial crisis , even as he tried to brush past heavy pressure from Germany and France to accept global financial regulations that could reach well inside American borders .
Speaking on the eve of a summit meeting here to address the financial crisis , Mr. Obama acknowledged that regulatory failures in the United States had a role in the meltdown , but he urged world leaders to focus on solutions rather than on placing blame .
He also cautioned that the United States was unlikely to return to its role as a “ voracious consumer market , ” and he urged other nations to do more to revive growth in their home markets .
Despite calls for unity from Mr. Obama and the British prime minister , Gordon Brown , the host of the Group of 20 meeting that will formally begin Thursday , a rift intensified over Anglo - American calls for greater fiscal stimulus spending and French and German demands for more intrusive global regulation of financial institutions .
While President Nicolas Sarkozy of France did not repeat an earlier threat to walk out of the conference 
“ I just got here , ” he joked  he made it clear he would reject an agreement that puts off stringent new regulations on banks , tax havens , and hedge funds .
Remember that Ducati Monster transformed into a dual sport , called Terra Mostro ?
It looks like you can do the same thing with an old Suzuki GSX - R 1100 if you ’re sufficiently motivated .
All you need is a healthy mix of KTM and Ohlins suspension pieces , some engine mods that take the original 1100 cc engine out to 1200 cc , fab up some body parts and there you go , flying down the firetrails on your GSX - R MX .
RM Racing in Italy did the conversion , because … well , just because .
Maybe not the perfect off road motorcycle but it looks like loads of fun and power would never be an issue .

Remember The Game of Life ?
You played it waaaay back when .
There were those cute little pegs you put on your car … and that spinny wheel .
Anyway , there ’s an online version of it .
And one conservative mom hates it .
Listen to the reason why :
“ You know how kids are , ” the mother told WND .
“ My daughter noticed right away ( even before I did ) and clicked on one of the girls instead of one of the men and then asked , ‘ Mom , how come I can marry a woman ? ’
And then that led into a lot more questions that , quite frankly , I was not ready to talk to my 6 - year - old about . ”
WND followed the mother ’s example and played a game as “ Jennifer , ” who chose to marry another woman .
The course of the game eventually added four children to WND ’s lesbian couple .
What ?!
Lesbians are allowed in the Game of Life ?!
And they can have children ?!
That ’s unpossible .
And why is that a hard conversation ?
You tell your child : Women can love women , just like men .
( Damn , I ’m good at this child - raising thing ! )
And how * dare * they make the couple look happy and adorable ?!
WorldNetDaily goes on :
The redesign also included car game pieces that could be filled with plastic pegs representing a player ’s growing “ family . ”
The board game did not prevent players in any way from placing two pink or two blue pegs in the front seat , thus depicting a homosexual couple .
As we all know , conservatives get very nervous when “ pegging ” is mentioned …
Jen raises another fantastic point about the mother not wanting to discuss homosexuality with her daughter :
While I personally think there ’s nothing wrong with young children knowing about homosexuality , why ca n’t this mother just dodge the question like parents do with other things they do n’t want their children knowing about ?
How many little kids ask their parents where babies come from before their parents want them to know the grisly facts of life ?
Granted , I do n’t think we should lie to children about that either … but the fact is , blaming an online game for something that ’s everywhere is just downright silly .
Why not blame Life for including babies in the game ?
Excellent point .
You would think the Religious Right would love this game .
After all , this is the one time you can actually “ choose to be gay . ”

I ’m sure everyone is thrilled to know that the high rollers on Wall Street are bouncing back .
With profits on the rebound , the big shots at the biggest institutions are on track , as The Times reported Sunday , to make as much money this year as they were hauling in before the mega- recession began .
The growing legions of the unemployed can be forgiven for not shouting hallelujah .
It ’s a little like watching the drunken driver who plowed into your family car and caused untold havoc and heartache , suddenly pulling up one morning , no worse for the wear , in a sparkling new vehicle .
The folks who led the nation to this financial abyss are the ones being made whole on the taxpayers ’ dime .
We can look after them , all right .
But we ca n’t seem to get credit flowing in any normal way again ; we ca n’t stanch the terrible flow of home foreclosures ; and we ’re not doing nearly enough to address the most critical need of all : putting people back to work .
While Wall Street is breaking out the Champagne yet again , the rest of the economy is beyond terrible , and will be for the foreseeable future .
I ’ve mentioned before on the blog that I have a history of depression .
There was a point , for about 4 or 5 months , where it was so bad all the time that I frequently thought about killing myself .
Frequently as in every day , most of the day .
I even made what one might call suicidal gestures ( doing dangerous things , but not actually getting to the point ) .
I got past it with therapy and medication ( which I ’ve been able to come off now ) and loads of support .
When I look back and remember who I was then , how I felt then , I do n’t blame myself for wanting what I did .
Depression is a terrible illness , it eats away at your mind and your reasoning and shows you things clearly but without perspective .
Yelling at a depressed person , telling them to cheer up , is like telling someone who ’s been in an accident to learn to walk again without giving them physical therapy .
Watching this week ’s House episode ( no spoiler in this article , but you knew from its teaser that someone would die ) , I decided to do something that I ’ve thought about for a while but never concretized .
Sometimes , when something very good happens or when I ’m just feeling supremely calm and happy with the way things are , I think to myself , “ Good .
If I were dead , I could n’t have done that / be here right now . ”
So I thought I ’d list some of the things , very big and very small , that I would n’t have been able to do if I ’d killed myself at 19 .
Parents and relatives I know you read this blog and I want to warn you that the list may make you cry , as it made me when I wrote it .
I would never have gotten married –there ’s so much I would have missed .
Micah would also not have had a wife , at least probably not for a while .
I never would have gotten to see my mom ’s resiliance and will to live in the face of the cancer that crushed my own will to live .
I would never have started this blog and formed some amazing relationships .
I would never have learned the difference between a 401 ( k ) and a Roth IRA .
I would never have started consulting on blogs and learned / done so much .
I would never have seen two of my friends start dating and get married–and it might not have happened , as I was very involved in the beginning of their relationship .
I would never have started the beautiful quilt I ’m about to finish and that I ’m enjoying so much .
I would never have installed Ubuntu Linux dual boot on my old laptop .
I would never have made it to a point where I was n’t crying for hours every night .
I would never have seen my roommate go to Palestine .
I would never have met so many people whose friendship I now treasure .
I would never have seen my little sister graduate from highschool .
I would never have seen how beautiful my mom looked at my wedding .
I would never have seen how happy Micah looked at our wedding .
I would never have sewn two wedding gowns .
I would never have cut my own hair .
I would never have written my senior project .
I would never have been to San Diego or Seattle or Michigan or Massachusetts or New Hampshire .
I would never have visited my friend Danielle ’s grave .
I would never have written over 16,000 words of fiction and counting .
I would never have seen so many movies I enjoyed .
I would never have seen the tv series Firefly , Buffy , Angel , Torchwood–all of which I ’ve totally geeked out over .
I would never have reread Middlemarch or read Harry Potter , Maurice , The Berlin Stories , Season of Migration to the North … I would never have listened to the musicals Notre Dame de Paris , Avenue Q , Wicked , Rent , Hairspray …
I would never have lived with most of my college roommates / housemates .
I would never have learned any PHP or heard of WordPress .
I would never have heard the new Foo Fighters album or Weezer album .
And they ’re both fantastic !
I would never have sung Rutter ’s Requium ( or even heard it ! ) .
I would never have used a hair clip .
I would never have bought my awesome hat .
I would never have graduated from college ( summa cum laude , baby ! )
I would never have had pillow talk about Plato ’s Republic ( yes , this happens when you marry a philosopher ) .
I would never have seen my cousin ’s baby , who , I contend , is the sweetest , cutest baby ever born .
( And I would not have seen her sister ’s baby overcome a condition that nearly killed him an hour after birth . )
I would never have learned that I like yogurt .
I would never have completed National Novel Writing Month .
I would never have donated bone marrow stem cells which may have saved a life .
Some of those have been big moments in my life , some have been tiny ones that I ’m glad I was here for .
There are so many more that I can’t even write because the thought of missing them is so painful .
There are others that are n’t coming to mind right now but that would make me say , if I remembered , “ yes , I ’m glad I was there for that . ”
Little things like lovely walks along the college creek with friends , teatime at with my housemates .
Even painful things , because they have meaning too .
If you ’re reading this and have been thinking of killing yourself , I ’m asking you to hold on for at least one more day .
You ’ve held on for so many , hold on for a few more while you get help .
It wo n’t fix everything right away , but things are fixable –there are ways to be happy , even for short periods , despite the nothing and the ridiculousness of it all .
And I ’ve found that those periods get longer and longer .
I ’m not going to say “ there ’s so much to live for ” because that ’s trite and it ’s hard to see that it ’s true until afterward .
But 4 years later I am so very glad that I lived .

Rarely does one find an article as sober and compelling as Evgeny Morozov ’s Texting Toward Utopia : Does the Internet spread democracy ?
published in the Boston Review .
The article ’s echoes Smriti Daniel ’s conclusion in an article on Facebook activism in Sri Lanka published recently in Sri Lanka ’s Sunday Times , which ended by suggesting that “ while it has the potential to be a powerful democratic tool , Facebook simply needs many more Sri Lankans online and engaged before it can be used as such . ”
I have in many previous posts addressed the issue of using the Internet and web under repressive regimes , and how blogs , web based tools and services as well as mobiles and SMS are shaping new public discourses around democracy and governance .
These vital interrogations are n’t new , but the manner in which they are conducted , communicated and disseminated are in many countries undergirded by developments in telecoms .
Countries like Sri Lanka today are no longer outside the glare of domestic and international scrutiny , despite the government ’s best efforts to clamp down on all information flows from the embattled Vanni region , precisely because channels of communication are pervasive and impossible to curtail .
This was witnessed in Myanmar as well , when the only really effective measure the junta could take to control the Saffron Revolution was to shut down all communications in the country .
And that was a measure which could not be sustained .
There are already a plethora of ways , some of them under the radar of traditional media , that the Internet and web are helping prop up democratic governance , human dignity and humanitarian aid .
Yet Morozov makes an important point ,
The idea that unfettered access to the Internet will bring democracy suggests one of the worst fallacies of cyber–utopianism .
Once they get online unsupervised , do we expect Chinese Internet users , many of them young , to rush to download the latest report from Amnesty International or read up on Falun Gong on Wikipedia ?
Or will they opt for The Sopranos or the newest James Bond flick ?
Why assume that they will suddenly demand more political rights , rather than the Friends or Sex in the City lifestyles they observe on the Internet ?
Morozov ’s essential thesis is interesting .
“ Yet , investing in new media infrastructure might also embolden the conservatives , nationalists , and extremists , posing an even greater challenge to democratization .
A brief look at the emerging cyber–nationalism in Russia and China provides a taste of things to come . ”
The Sri Lankan blogosphere is littered with trolls and hate speech directed against individuals and organisations currently perceived to be partial to the LTTE , the UNP , peace negotiations with the LTTE , federalism , human rights , humanitarian concerns of the Tamil civilians in the Vanni and partial to domestic and international NGO reports and condemnation of violent abuses of human rights .
It is also littered with personal diatribes , such as Nibras Bawa ’s recent outrageous post against a fellow and much loved blogger , which incensed many in the blogosphere and his subsequent ousting from the leading blog aggregator Kottu.org .
Pointing to three of the best known trolls and examples of their writing , London , Lanka and Drums once asked “ Why do all three of you choose to try to present your points , arguments and views in such confrontational and insulting demeanours ? ”
Yet , is a blogosphere more vibrant because of trolls ?
I have given up engagement with the most racist , insulting and violent elements online because it expends energies much better spent elsewhere .
This is not to say that one must always speak with the converted , but on the contrary , engage with dissenting views that are expressed clearly and with a view to engagement , even if the end result is that interlocutors agree to disagree .
Perhaps this too is based on a normative value – that non-insulting expression is the basis for conflict transformation .
It may be the case that expletives and verbal violence constitute another way of social intercourse .
But from the personal experience of framing and moderating debate on extremely contentious issues on the basis of civility and the failure of previous initiatives based on a free for all conversation , my bias is towards the belief that the Internet and web can and will be used for democracy and human progress and that more , not less , information in the hands of citizens strengthens democratic governance .
Hate and violence can only be effectively addressed with alternatives to what fuels both .
Youth in Sri Lanka use the Internet to download movies , play games and post photos of their holiday ’s on Facebook .
A smaller group of committed and influential youth also use it for far more serious purposes .
This is why I am engaged in practically engaging with the challenge Morozov poses at the end of his article ,
Figuring out how the Internet could benefit existing democratic forces and organizations — very few of which have exhibited much creativity on the Web — would not be a bad place to start .
Private stationed at Fort Meade on 9/11 gives astounding interview
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , April 8 , 2009
A woman who claims she was stationed at Fort Meade on September 11 , 2001 , has given an explosive interview about how she personally heard military commanders make the decision to shoot down United Airlines Flight 93 on 9/11 .
A person using the pseudonym Elizabeth Nelson told The Project Camelot website that she personally heard officials agree on the order to shoot down Flight 93 .
The decision was apparently made because the plane was flying in a no-fly zone near to Camp David and heading toward Site R , a military facility in known as the “ backup Pentagon ” .
Nelson stresses that at no time was there any talk of “ hijackers , ” and the plane was shot down purely because communication had been lost and standard operating procedure mandated that the plane be intercepted and destroyed .
Because the woman refuses to provide her real name , the authenticity of her story is very much up for debate , but in a 40 minute MP3 recording ( click here to listen ) of the interview , she relates what she witnessed in as sincere and genuine a way as one could expect .
This individual has seemingly little to gain from making up such a story , unless it ’s part of a deliberate disinformation campaign .
Nelson says that she was stationed at at Fort Meade under the Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center Hospital and was training as a radiologic technologist having finished basic training three weeks prior .
On 9/11 , her rank was Private First Class .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Nelson relates how 9/11 started as a routine day before a higher ranked soldier suddenly emerged from another room and exclaimed , “ Holy shit !
I just saw a plane crash into one of the Twin Towers . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Nelson and her colleagues then gathered around the TV in the hospital lobby before they saw the second plane hit the tower .
Despite the fact that the first plane strike was not broadcast on live television , Nelson was adamant that the soldier was referring to the first plane when he first spoke .
Nelson says that when she first saw the live TV pictures , only one tower was on fire , so the soldier could not have been referring to a replay of the second hit .
In the interview , Nelson speculates that the first hit could have been broadcast on an internal military channel .
President Bush once famously claimed that he had seen the first plane hit and thought that it was a case of pilot error , despite there being no live TV footage of the first plane strike .
While the majority of the personnel on the base scrambled to protect the facility as part of standard operating procedure , Nelson and a colleague were offered up by their First Sergeant to act as assistants to the Commander of the Base .
“ All the other departments of soldiers – the nursing department , the clerical , administrational department – everybody sent their base soldiers there and I did n’t see them anymore .
So basically the hospital was not fully active at that point .
Everything was on hold , ” said Nelson , adding , “ And so I remember the room that they took us into .
And they told us that we were in charge of , you know , getting coffees , any kind of snacks from the cafeteria – not cafeteria , like from the snack machines or from the place where you can get little snacks – in charge of making photocopies because she and I had the access codes for the rooms , to get in there . ”
Nelson and her colleague were sat at the far end of the room and told to face the wall as the meeting of top officials on the base commenced .
“ And there was probably six or seven men around this very large table , just like you would see in a big office somewhere .
And they had this funny phone .
It was like a conference - call phone .
And I remember them sitting there and they were talking through this phone .
And it seemed to me that they were talking to one or two other places , ” said Nelson , adding that she suspected the men were in contact with the West Point military base an hour north of New York City .
The men were trying to ascertain what was going on and quickly expressed concern about Camp David and “ Site R ” and stating words to the effect of , “ Protocol is that this is a no - fly zone .
We have to take this plane down .
Yes , it ’s a passenger plane .
It needs to be taken down .
It ’s a no - fly zone . ”
According to Wikipedia , Site R , otherwise known as The Raven Rock Mountain Complex ( RRMC ) or the Underground Pentagon , is a United States government facility on Raven Rock , a mountain in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania .
The facility houses the ANMCC ( Alternate National Military Command Center ) , JSSC ( Joint Staff Support Center ) , OSD / DHS ( Office of the Secretary of Defense / Department of Homeland Security ) , and the 114th Signal Battalion .
RRMC also houses the emergency operations centers for the Army , Navy and Air Force .
“ I did n’t hear a thing about hijackers , ” states Nelson , “ We just heard that this plane was flying in a no - fly zone and they could n’t make contact with the plane , or something like this .
There was no communication .
Protocol says it has to be taken out .
And so I was in this room when the decision was mutually made by the people talking on the phone in the room that I was in , to shoot this plane down . ”
“ It did n’t feel like anybody knew that there was anything with terrorists , ” added Nelson , saying that the officers mentioned the attack on the twin towers but only in the context that they did n’t know where Flight 93 was heading .
She got the impression that they were genuinely unaware of the wider 9/11 plot , as would be expected in a compartmentalized structure , and that they were simply following military protocol .
Nelson recalls how she later felt revulsion after she saw news reports about how Flight 93 had supposedly been taken down by brave passengers .
“ I remember the distinct feeling inside of me of when I saw on the news that there was this story that there were terrorists on this plane , and that the people overtook the pilot and crashed the plane , – I mean , overtook the terrorists and crashed the plane themselves .
And how this was leaking out as these people being heroes , ” she states .
“ And I remember the extreme moral frustration inside of me , of feeling : But that ’s not true !
That ’s not true at all !
We shot this down .
And a huge conflict inside of me , of knowing that the world is made to believe this story that ’s not true . ”
Nelson subsequently felt frustrated when anyone talked about the manufactured myth of the Flight 93 heroes .
“ I also remember the confronting feeling when I would be around … because there were civilians that worked in the hospital as well .
And then when they would talk about the heroes and these things , the conflict that I had inside of myself was wanting to bust out and say :
That ’s not true ! , ” she states .
“ They did n’t crash the plane .
If they would have crashed it , there would have been a skeleton of the plane .
There was no …
Nothing .
It was blown up . ”
Nelson speculated that the errant aircraft could have been originally heading for New York City ( Building 7 ? ) before the passengers retook control of the aircraft and started aimlessly flying it elsewhere .
“ The only thing I can think is if the third plane was also intended for somewhere in the city [ New York City ] as well , and that the people actually did take over the hijackers and divert the plane so that the plane ended up flying aimlessly someplace else .
And of course the people do n’t know how to talk over the radio or any of these things .
And that ’s maybe something that happened , ” she states .
The biggest argument against Nelson ’s claims is the hard to accept notion that she and another Private were allowed to sit within earshot of top military commanders making monumental decisions about national security .
If the commanders had needed people to make photocopies of documents and bring snacks and drinks as Nelson describes , then why not just have them on call in a different room ?
One would expect that a military complex have sophisticated communication connections that would have easily facilitated such a scenario .
Then again , if all the other active duty personnel were busy defending the base it could be argued that in the midst of the chaos , Nelson and her colleague were called upon .
Whether or not Nelson ’s story is true , the fact that Flight 93 was shot down is one of the most glaring holes in the official 9/11 story .
Footage of the crash site showed barely any debris whatsoever .
Compare this to any other plane crash in history and the contrast is astounding .
The debris field of Flight 93 was eight miles wide – investigators found a second debris field three miles away from the main crash site at Indian Lake , and a third debris field in New Baltimore , eight miles away .
This is entirely consistent with the plane having been shot down .
Several eyewitnesses described hearing explosions before Flight 93 crashed and others said they heard missiles .
The Flight93 Crash website has a compilation of eyewitness reports all attesting to the fact that the plane was shot down .
Donald Rumsfeld himself said that Flight 93 was “ shot down ” in an apparent slip of the tongue on December 24 , 2004 .

Comment on this article
Former CNET blogger Chris Soghoian has produced some of the best coverage on the issue of privacy for users of government websites .
His work on the use of YouTube cookies and other tracking technologies on whitehouse.gov brought public attention to the issue , and inspired EFF to get involved .
Beyond informing the public , Soghoian 's work in this area has arguably had positive effects on policy .
The Obama team has made several commendable adjustments to their privacy and video hosting policies including adding a prominent link to their privacy policy and using YouTube 's new " delayed cookies " functionality -- results that seem related , at least in time , to Soghoian 's sustained coverage of the issue .
It comes as a surprise , then , to hear that CNET will no longer carry Soghoian 's blog .
While Soghoian 's confrontational style and irreverent approach may have been factors , it appears the decision to drop his blog largely stems from a minor kerfuffle over a headline .
A Soghoian post initially titled " White House Ditches YouTube After Privacy Complaints " brought loud denials from the YouTube and the Obama team .
The Obama folks belatedly said that their use of non-YouTube video was only an experiment , a possibility that Soghoian mentioned in his article .
If companies like CNET want the energy and edginess of bloggers like Soghoian — who did real research and reporting instead of just republishing or commenting on the work of others — they need to be willing to support them when that same edge sparks a backlash from powerful forces .
Without such backbone , it 's hard to see how Internet news sources will ever be able to fill the shoes of the rapidly disappearing print media empires .
Meanwhile , the problem of cookies and other tracking technologies on government sites remains .
We 're looking forward to reading Soghoian 's continuing coverage of it on his new blog , Slight Paranoia — already he has blogged about his development of a Firefox add - on that installs opt - out cookies for most of the major targeted advertising networks .
And we hope that CNET , along with other media , will continue to cover the story and keep the pressure on YouTube and the White House to protect the privacy of those using government websites .
In a dramatic rewrite of the recipe for life , scientists from Florida are describing the design of a new type of DNA with 12 chemical letters instead of the usual four .
Presented in Salt Lake City , Utah , at the 237th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , this artificial genetic system already is helping to usher in the era of personalized medicine for millions of patients with HIV , hepatitis and other diseases .
The research may also shed light on how life arose on Earth , by producing a self - sustaining molecule capable of Darwinian evolution and reproduction , much like one that many scientists suggest arose at the dawn of life on Earth nearly four billion years ago .
Led by Steven Benner , Ph.D. , this team is rewriting the rulebook that Nobel laureates James Watson and Francis Crick started when they described DNA 's structure in 1953 .
One of the crowning discoveries of 20th century science , Watson and Crick 's discovery established how the four chemical " letters " of DNA — A , T , C and G — pair up .
" This is a man on the moon goal , " says Steven Benner , Ph.D .
" It has dragged us kicking and screaming into uncharted territory .
But we 've learned all sorts of reasons about how the Watson and Crick rules do n't enable technology to do useful things like highly parallel amplification of DNA or highly parallel diagnosis of human diseases .
These things are worth a lot of money . "
These pairing rules , for instance , make it very difficult for researchers to develop multiplexed diagnostic tests for viral diseases — tests that require identification and tagging of viral DNA .
Old methods used regular DNA to bind and tag foreign genetic material .
But natural DNA would often bind with non-disease DNA and generate confusing false positive and false negative results .
advertisement
Benner 's artificial genetic system does not operate under Watson - Crick rules , so the tagging gives accurate results .
Benner 's artificial alphabet already has been applied commercially .
It is the basis of a viral load detector , which helps personalize the health care of those 400,000 patients annually infected with hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and HIV , the cause of AIDS .
" This is a hundred million dollar product right now , " Benner noted .
" It 's used to manage cystic fibrosis , as well .
We can also use this technology to go into biological samples and extract known genes with cancer - causing mutations .
We can do all of this because we have an artificial DNA system .
For patients with HIV and hepatitis , the viral load detector can mean the difference between life and death .
Modern drug cocktails for these diseases are highly effective , reducing the viral load in the bloodstream to nearly zero .
But at some point , the virus mutates , enabling it to evade the drugs and repopulate .
As the viral tide rises , there are no outward symptoms in the patient , so the mutated strain is often discovered long after the virus has spread again .
The viral load detector , which relies on Benner 's 12 letter system to tag DNA , may change that .

" What we want to do with personalized care is to give you a cocktail , and then monitor you and discover when the virus becomes resistant to it , " explains Benner .
" Now we do n't want to do that too soon – that would waste a lifetime of good viral inhibitors — but not too late , of course .
The patient would go in once a month to get their viral load measured .
At some point the virus mutates and its viral load goes up .
Then you know you better change the cocktail . "
Benner says that the artificial DNA system is poised to become an essential tool in genomics research .
The 12 letter alphabet already underlies new work at the National Human Genome Research Institute to connect large quantities of genomic data with human medicine .
The 12 letter system might also shed light on one of most mysterious times in Earth 's history — the dawn of life nearly four billion years ago .
Many scientists believe that this might have occurred when DNA 's ancient cousin , RNA , began to act like a living organism .
" The idea has been that life originated on earth as RNA molecules assembled randomly and spontaneously in the prebiotic soup , " says Benner .
" Then , one of them found the ability to make copies of itself .
In doing so , it made those copies with imperfections , so that some of its ' kids ' were a bit better .
Most were worse , so the better ones took over more resources .
That started Darwinian processes .
The rest is history . "
Benner 's ultimate goal is to synthesize a similar life form in his lab at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution .
His 12 letter genetic system is capable of nearly all of the actions that define a living thing — reproduction , growth and response to its environment — all without the benefit of genes refined over billions of years of evolution .
" But it still is n't self - sustaining , " Benner explains .
" You need a graduate or post - doc to come in the morning and feed it .
It does n't look for its own food .
No one has gotten that first step to work .
If you start making estimates of how many molecules you have to look for in order to find one that does this , you 're talking about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules . "
While Benner continues to pursue a chemical system fully capable of Darwinian evolution , he emphasized the lessons already learned from the development of the 12 letter system .
" We have n't just taken things from nature , but we 've actually understood something about how chemical structure is related to genetic behavior .
With that , we 've been able to make new versions of it , " says Benner .

Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced that she has asked the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Rep. Barney Frank to explore the legal possibilities for taking AIG ’s $ 170 billion in federal bailout money back , after the company announced that they will be handing out $ 165 million in executive bonuses .
“ While American workers see their wages decline and face record job losses , it is unconscionable that AIG , which is receiving more than $ 170 billion in government assistance , would permit such extravagant executive compensation practices without any accountability to the taxpayer .
I have asked Chairman Barney Frank of the House Financial Services Committee to examine options that are legally available to recover taxpayer funds of companies that abuse the privilege of taxpayer assistance , ” Pelosi said .
She also urged AIG to change their minds and not hand out the bonuses , “ I call upon the executives at AIG to right the wrong they have done to American taxpayers , who are footing the bill for the most expensive government rescue in history .
They should renounce the bonuses and refuse the excessive retention pay they previously agreed to . ”

Everybody start the countdown until AIG puts out a statement saying that they will not take the bonuses .
Since they were stupid enough to try and take the bonuses in the first place , it is possible that they will wait to see what the House does to take the taxpayers money back before they change their minds .
A smart organization would have already put out a statement announcing that they will reverse course on the bonuses , an even smarter organization would have never tried to take the bonuses and retention pay in the first place .
The greed of these guys never stops .
Any executive at a company that almost goes broke and requires the government to bail them out is not worthy of a bonus .
I would not retain any of the people who almost ran the company into the group , so they should forget about the retention pay too .
The legislation for the TARP was so rushed , and poorly written by the White House that I do n’t know if the government has a mechanism to legally recover the taxpayer ’s money .
I suspect that the mountain of bad PR has just begun for AIG , and if nothing else , no one should be surprised if the government considers suing AIG on behalf of the taxpayers for recovery of their funds .

They are feeling very stressed or depressed and are more likely to go shopping to cheer themselves up and using it to regulate emotions . "

The Senate is gearing up to ratify a Nixon - era U.N. treaty meant to create universal laws to govern the seas — a treaty critics say will create a massive U.N. bureaucracy that could even claim powers over American waterways .
LOST — the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea , also called the Law of the Sea Treaty — regulates all things oceanic , from fishing rights , navigation lanes and environmental concerns to what lies beneath : the seabed ’s oil and mineral wealth that companies hope to explore and exploit in coming years .
[ efoods ]
But critics say the treaty , which declares the sea and its bounty the “ universal heritage of mankind , ” would redistribute American profits and have a reach extending into rivers and streams all the way up the mighty Mississippi .
The U.N. began working on LOST in 1973 , and 157 nations have signed on to the treaty since it was concluded in 1982 .
Yet it has been stuck in dry dock for nearly 30 years in the U.S. and never even been brought to a full vote before the Senate .
But swelling approval in the Senate and the combined support of the White House , State Department and U.S. Navy mean LOST may be ready to unfurl its sails again .
Sen .
John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said during a January confirmation hearing that he intends to push for ratification .
“ We are now laying the groundwork for and expect to try to take up the Law of the Sea Treaty .
So that will be one of the priorities of the committee , and the key here is just timing — how we proceed . ”

There has been a reasonable amount of speculation surrounding JavaScript speed improvements in iPhone 3.0 .
Testing carried out on the iPhone Simulator bundled with the SDK did n’t lead to a conclusive outcome , but benchmarking done by Wayne Pan would seem to suggest that iPhone 3.0 handles JavaScript 3x - 10 x faster than iPhone 2.1 .
Last year the WebKit development team released information about a new JavaScript engine , slated to have a dramatic improvement in performance .
Originally dubbed SquirrelFish ( now called ‘ Nitro ’ ) , to date it has not been included in any major release of the iPhone OS .
Expectations are that the performance enhancements found in iPhone 3.0 are due to the inclusion of the Squirrel Fish engine , leading to faster web site browsing and snappier web app performance .
The new Nitro engine has gradually been improved by the WebKit team over the past year , and is included in the latest Safari 4 Beta .
This new engine accounts for the dramatic performance improvement in Safari 4 , which Apple ( s appl ) states as enhancing both JavaScript and HTML rendering :
Using the new Nitro Engine , for example , Safari executes JavaScript up to 30 times faster than Internet Explorer 7 and more than 3 times faster than Firefox 3 based on performance in leading industry benchmark tests : iBench and SunSpider .
In addition to superior JavaScript performance , Safari offers top - flight HTML performance — the best on any platform — loading pages 3 times faster than Internet Explorer 7 and almost 3 times faster than Firefox 3 .
While Nitro is certainly responsible for the improved JavaScript performance , better HTML loading times may be due to other browser enhancements .
Hopefully these will also make the move to Mobile Safari , increasing performance and page loading speed .
This is even more important on a mobile device , where connection speed is far more limited than on most desktop machines .
Moving this new engine across to Mobile Safari on the iPhone is indeed the next logical step , and the 3.0 release of Apple ’s iPhone operating system would seem a reasonable point at which to integrate it .
John Gruber created a simple script to test whether a browser is likely to be running the Nitro engine — this tests positive in Safari 4 , and he confirmed yesterday that the test is also passed on the iPhone 3.0 .
All these pieces of an ongoing puzzle would seem to lead to a fairly strong conclusion that Mobile Safari on iPhone 3.0 will receive a completely new JavaScript engine , significant speed improvements , and better web application performance .
I ’m thoroughly looking forward to experiencing the same speed boost on my iPhone that Safari 4 brought to my desktop , and ca n’t wait to try out the new software .
Ground clearance looks like an issue , maybe 4 inches ?
Could use this to plow the roads here
Wheel size is impractical and expensive .
That nose looks HUGE .
So if this is the " concept " , then I would expect most of these " issues " to go away , and eventually the Ampera will be the same as the Volt .
Really , makes little sense to even do this , in my opinion .
GM should be in a money saving mode , and re-designing a car that is not even released in US , to be sold in Europe , under a different badge seems ludicrous .
Just port the exact Volt design to Europe , and save big money ( like Menards ! ) .
These are not the times to be spending time and money to put a different shade of lip stick on the pig .

There ’s been quite a bit of contention erupt over a bill being proposed in the House , the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009 , HR 875 :
This bill is purportedly to establish a ‘ Food Safety Administration ’ within the DHHS to regulate food safety , labelling , and regulating the processing , storing , and transport of food from ‘ food establishments ’ , promote food safety research by academic and State institutions .
On the face of it , after the recent poison peanut fiasco , that does n’t sound like such a bad idea , does it …?
… Except there ’s a few problems , as it is a very rare bill that can ever be accepted ‘ on the face of it ’ .
The first problem with this bill was that is was introduced by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro ( D – CT ) , whose husband , Stanley Greenburg , works for Monsanto .
This may not violate any specific legalities ( or maybe it does ) but this is the kind of ethical conflict of interest that stinks like a three day old dead genetically modified mackerel .
That alone has been enough to raise hackles and suspicions , generating accusations that this bill would in effect criminalize seed banking , impose prison sentences and fines on farmers , require GPS tracking of animals , warrantless government entry onto farm easements , and even allegations of a massive police state plot to incorporate farmland into the hands of industrial giants like Monsanto in a planned elimination of independent farmers altogether .
This bill , its detractors assert , would give the government the authority to monitor every family farm , ranch , vineyard , fishing hole , farmer ’s market veggie patch , kiddie lemonade stand on the sidewalk , and demand paperwork and records relating to food production under penalty of fine or imprisonment , even seizure of goods and property without warrants in violation of the Fourth Amendment .
That the term ‘ food establishment ’ could even conceivably mean your own kitchen or back yard garden , thus if you do n’t adhere to strict government standards ( strict only in enforcement , not in the vagueness of the language defining said standards ) , you risk being fined or imprisoned for that really dreadful home grown carrot and coriander soup you served up to the Church fundraising potluck last weekend .
Not everyone , however , is in lockstep with this ‘ first they came for the Jews ’ line of emotive reasoning , including a few organic farmers themselves .
But there are definitely a whole lot of things wrong with this bill , and it quite rightly should be kicked back to its designers immediately for a thorough rewrite , free of any involvement or influence by Monsanto or those married to its employees .
But beyond the accusations that Monsanto is manoeuvring to impose ‘ standardized ’ agricultural practices that would allow Monsanto and other GM agribusinesses to control and regulate seeds , pesticides and fertilizer that would , in effect , prohibit organic farming and open the way for unregulated GM food production , there is an underlying question :
Why are we so afraid of genetic modification ?
We on the left all cheered wildly when Obama lifted the Bush ban on embryonic stem cell research , and genetic modification in medicine has already offered thousands of patients genuine hope for treatment and cures for a variety of deadly illnesses .
So just what is it about the science of genetically modified food that makes us so wary ?
Why is one ‘ good science ’ and the other ‘ bad science ’ ?
It is n’t as if humans have n’t been practicing genetic modification for centuries – farm animals themselves are largely the most obvious result of ‘ natural ’ selection for certain traits .
A domestic pig bears as much resemblance to the wild boar it descended from as a Chihuahua resembles a wolf .
Is it ethical to breed pigs that put on meat weight so quickly that they must be slaughtered at eighteen months because beyond that age their bones simply are n’t strong enough to support their own weight and they end up crippled ?
That has nothing to do with scientists artificially slicing DNA in a test tube somewhere – it ’s been going on for the past 9,000 years , all quite ‘ naturally ’ .
Speaking of Chihuahuas , ever seen a Crufts dog show ?
This ‘ natural ’ genetic engineering has produced English bulldogs with heads so heavy and legs so short they ca n’t support their own weight or even breed and give birth without artificial assistance , Pekinese with deformed skulls flattening the face severely enough to cause breathing problems and require cooling pads to sit on in order not to overheat and die , Boxers suffering from epilepsy , Alsatians crippled by deformed hip joints , and King Charles Spaniels with painful and debilitating syringomylia ; too small skulls squeezing on the brain .
It has become so bad that this year , after a BBC expose on Kennel Club show dog breeding practices , Pedigree Dog Food and the RSPCA have withdrawn sponsorship , and the BBC has refused to air the annual show on television .
This expose has led to some changes to breed conformation , but it will still take at least three generations before the English bulldog even begins to resemble its original – and much healthier – ancestor .
But we ’re talking about agribusiness , meaning plants , not dogs and pigs .
In an age where famine , drought and starvation is rampant in the third world , and elsewhere , is n’t research into producing more and better harvests a good thing ?
Mexico established an agricultural research station to cultivate strains of wheat to feed its hungry population in the 1940’s , and within a dozen years was self - sufficient ; a dozen more , and the country was exporting half a million tonnes of wheat a year .
With all our modern technology and science , surely we should welcome a second ‘ Green Revolution ? ’
When I started researching for this post , I contacted Jill Richardson , founder of La Vida Locavore , and author of the upcoming Recipe for America : Why Our Food System is Broken and How We Can Fix It for some background material .
Instead of offering a bit of cursory advice , she was kind enough to send me the following detailed and erudite email , which is enough in itself as a post on its own :
I think there are a few issues at stake .
One is safety of course and to that I say we need to ask on a case by case basis :
Does benefit outweigh risk ?
And benefit to whom , and risk to whom ?
In most cases it seems like its benefit to Monsanto ( profit ) and risk to humanity and planet earth .
That 's not a good deal .
But in the case of a life saving pharmaceutical perhaps the benefit to the people who need that drug makes it worth the risk , especially if we 've done a good job testing up front .
As for the process of testing before a GMO is approved , it does n't seem they do a good job - they are on a mission to just fast track everything to legalization .
And nature has so many variables and things we do n't know or can't account for in the laboratory that there 's just no way to ensure 100 % something is safe .
Or safe for a human to eat for a lifetime without getting sick .
On some level the people who eat the food are going to be the guinea pigs no matter what .
If the only benefit is profit to Monsanto , then I 'm not for that .
That goes for all GMO companes - Syngenta , Bayer , etc , not just Monsanto .
The example people bring up for a GMO that is beneficial beyond just corporate profit is golden rice .
I 'd direct you to Greenpeace 's research on that - and a very good description of that can be found in Safe Food by Marion Nestle .
Golden rice is rice that was genetically modified to add in beta - carotene to help the developed world get enough vitamin A .
In short , someone would have to eat something like 12 lbs of rice PER DAY to get enough vitamin A from it .
So it 's not an actual solution - it was a PR stunt .
All that said , what truly changed my perspective on GMOs was reading a book called Teaming with Microbes : A Gardener 's Guide to the Soil Food Web ( and I 've since confirmed a lot of the info with the Rodale Institute ) .
About a year ago I visited a farmer on her farm in Austin , TX and I was absolutely blown away by what she told me about organics .
I did n't believe it , really .
I was kind of just withholding disbelief to be polite but I took what she said with a grain of salt until I could back it up with facts .
She said that organics did better compared to conventional in heat , drought , cold , flood , AND against pests .
She said it all had to do with soil microbiology .
She told me that an experiment had been done where you plant 2 tomato plants in pots - one in rich compost and one in regular potting soil .
You can intertwine the two plants and release aphids on them ( or some pest , I think aphids ) and the pests would all go for the tomato plant in potting soil .
I wrote up what I learned on DailyKos , but the short version is summed up in something I heard once " No one ever fertilized an old growth forest . "
If you think about some very rich environments where plants thrived , like forests or prairie , no one ever tilled the soil , fertilized , or used herbicide or pesticide there .
No one had to .
And the plants did n't get eaten up by bugs and die .
Obviously plants have some mechanism of their own to survive without human intervention .
Yet we have this idea that if we do n't spray the plants they are defenceless against pests .
And if you think of it that way , then creating GMO
Bt corn that makes its own pesticide makes quite a bit of sense .
But that entire mindset is wrong .
Now , just because I 'm saying that Bt corn is a bad idea is n't an indictment of all GMOs .
But it is a totally new idea to introduce when you are considering risk vs. benefit .
When you have living soil and sustainable farming you get a few things .
The soil stores water better and absorbs it better so plants are more tolerant of drought and floods .
The plants have better access to nutrients in the soil and are more able to fend off disease & pests .
The plants are also very good at using beneficial microorganisms against the pest species , surrounding themselves with those that are either helpful to the plant or neutral , and keeping away the ones that might harm the plant ( preying upon them or just competing for resources ) .
The same happens on a larger scale with bugs - yes you 'll have a few pests around but you 'll also have the species that compete with or prey on those pests so you are n't overwhelmed .
That brings me to where I was as I sat in the BIO 2008 convention last year .
They were talking about drought resistant plants that they were engineering ( which are now a reality ) .
And I thought : would n't it be more efficient to use the soil to help plants resist drought ?
Because it 's zero risk , free , time - tested , available without R&D expenses or the time it takes to invent it , and legal .
Plus there 's no risk to biodiversity .
The entire GMO model requires getting bang for your buck .
Ideally you 'd want to invent one variety that gets planted all over .
It 'd be much less efficient to put your R&D into 3000 varieties and sell a little bit of each of them .
It 's not about Monsanto being evil in this way , but about them wanting profit like any company would .
It 's no shock that 50 % of all U.S. crop land is in corn and soy and two of the few GMOs that are legally planted are corn & soy .
Monsanto is n't coming up with GMO drought resistant heirloom tomato varieties because the bang for the buck is n't there .
But if you use living soil to help plants resist drought instead of GMOs , you instantly have a solution that works for every single variety of every single plant - no R&D needed , and no loss of biodiversity too .
I mentioned Rodale Institute earlier and they 've done a farm systems trial study ( . pdf ) twenty years where they plant conventional crops side by side with two systems of organic ( one with manure , one without ) to compare yields .
In the first four years , conventional wins .
The soil for the organic is n't healthy enough yet at that point .
In year 5 they are equal .
In most years after that , organic gets better yields .
And the methods they used for doing this are n't inconsistent with large scale agriculture .
It 's a change we could make now .
The past few years they have compared organic vs. GMOs - they use corn and soy for these experiments .
When I visited , they had corn planted ( they alternate by year ) .
The GMO corn was shorter than the organic .
Much shorter – by a few feet .
When they picked an ear of each , the GMO corn was about 60 % of the size of the organic ear .
And they said from their research organic no - till farming used 2/3 less oil than conventional .
Obviously this is just saying that perhaps the risks of drought resistant GMOs or Bt GMOs or herbicide tolerant GMOs are not worth the benefits because better benefits are available at less risk .
Less profit to Monsanto too , but less risk and more benefit to humanity .
If they came up with a different type of GMO that was going to do something great that could n't be achieved with sustainable agriculture , then I 'd be willing to assess those risks against those benefits and perhaps I might fall on the side of GMOs .
But so far that has n't been the case .
Another interesting point that Rodale noted was about nitrogen .
There 's a standard equation used that an acre of corn requires X amount of nitrogen from petroleum - based fertilizers .
Rodale used cover crops to provide nitrogen and prevent weeds from growing .
They found that using their methods , they only needed about half as much nitrogen in the soil to grow their corn .
This shocked scientists whose first reaction was simply , " that 's not possible . "
It 'd be like saying you froze water at 50 degrees F .
You can't do it .
It 's breaking a known law of science .
But then they figured it out .
Using fertilizer , about half the nitrogen leaches out of the soil , into waterways , leading to dead zones like in the Gulf of Mexico or the Chesapeake .
Using cover crops , the nitrogen stays right near the roots of the plants and so the plants can use all of it .
Last , there 's an argument that Monsanto , etc , makes again and again that we need to feed the world and therefore we need new technology to boost yields .
They also threaten that if we do n't boost yields , we 'll need more land to grow enough food and that means cutting down forests .
This is a load of bull for five good reasons : 1 . As food productivity & food per capita has gone up , hunger has gone up .
2 . A recent study found that if we switched over to organic , using only currently cultivated land , we could feed the world even with a growing population .
3 . We feed a large percent of what we grow to livestock and then eat an unhealthy amount of meat .
If push comes to shove we'd be healthier and better off decreasing per capita meat consumption and using the extra food that used to go to livestock to feed people .
4 . It 's not about having enough food but having the desire to feed all people .
Right now we 'd rather feed cars with our corn than feed it to starving people .
We also have plastic made out of plants ( like potatoes or corn ) now too , yet we have hungry people .
5 . Right now we throw away a large percent of food - I 've heard numbers like 1/3 to 1/2 .
We grow about 3900 calories of food per person per day in the U.S. currently and there 's no way we eat that much .
It 's nearly twice what we need .
I ’d like to thank Jill for this information , and encourage C&L readers to buy her book .
And in the interest of journalistic fairness , I contacted Monsanto and offered them the opportunity to present their side of the issue .
At the present time of writing this post , no one has responded to my request .

Advertisement The Taleban say they are withdrawing from a Pakistani district where their consolidation of power this week has caused deep concern in the US .
A Taleban spokesman said commander Maulana Fazlullah had issued the order for fighters to pull back from Buner , just 100 km ( 62 miles ) from Islamabad .
The US has accused officials in Pakistan of abdicating to the Taleban .
The Taleban have agreed a peace deal bringing Sharia law to some districts in return for ending their insurgency .
The peace agreement covers six districts of Malakand division , including the troubled Swat region , in North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) .
See a map of the region The Taleban have almost full control of Swat and this week had strengthened operations in Buner .
Delegation Taleban spokesman Muslim Khan said : " Our leader has ordered that Taleban should immediately be called back from Buner . "
The move came after Maulana Fazlullah had met the commissioner of Malakand .
The Taleban should be gone by Saturday , their spokesman said Administration officials in NWFP have confirmed that Taleban fighters have started to leave .
A delegation from the Taleban and the cleric who negotiated the peace deal , Sufi Muhammad , is on its way to Buner to oversee the withdrawal .
Muslim Khan said the militants had just crossed from Swat into Buner as " a gesture of solidarity " with local comrades .
He said the Taleban would be gone by Saturday but denied that the militants were leaving due to pressure from the government or under any deal .
Those who went to Buner , they must get out from Buner
Iftikhar Hussain , NWFP spokesman
Disarray on Taleban
But the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says circumstances suggest the militants are now under pressure and that a national consensus is building among the public and political parties that they must be challenged with force .
Pakistan 's government has clearly stated that unless the Taleban lay down their arms , other options will be considered .
Pakistan 's chief of army staff Gen Ashfaq Kayani rejected criticism of army inaction in Malakand .
" The operational pause , meant to give the reconciliatory forces a chance , must not be taken for a concession to the militants , " he said .
Sympathy for the militant movement has been on the decline , our correspondent says , since the airing of footage showing a young girl being flogged as a punishment in Swat .
Although the Taleban denied ordering the punishment , their public standing has plummeted .

At least 10 more paramilitary platoons totalling about 200 men have now arrived in Buner to take control of government buildings .
The latest moves followed a meeting of government officials in North West Frontier Province to discuss the faltering peace deal .
Ahead of the meeting provincial spokesman Iftikhar Hussain had said : " Those who took arms must lay them down .
Those who went to Buner , they must get out from Buner .
" This is the only way , and we are asking them for the last time . "
The Taleban had been expected to lay down their arms under the peace deal and allow police and other officials to resume their duties .
However , the Taleban had further consolidated their hold on Buner .
On Wednesday they ambushed a paramilitary convoy at the border village of Totalai and prevented it from reaching Buner 's central town of Dagar .
The US had expressed deep concern over the developments .
On Wednesday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Pakistan posed a " mortal threat " to the world by abdicating to the Taleban .
On Thursday US Defence Secretary Robert Gates warned Pakistan that relations with the US would be threatened unless Islamabad combated the rise of the Taleban .

Space Images : The Best of Hubble ’s Shots
About the Hubble
The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by the Space Shuttle Discovery in April 1990 .
It is named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble .
Although not the first space telescope , the Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well - known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy .
The HST is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency , and is one of NASA ’s Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope .
During it ’s period of operation , the Hubble has recorded tons of fascinating images that never stop to amaze people .
You simply ca n’t stay untouched looking at these images .
To some these images represent beautiful natures work of arts , physicist may say that they provide us with an insight in our universe , mathematicians may be impressed by forms created by specific mathematical rules , architects look at the beauty of the expression , and you might even say that this is a definite sign that god has created the universe .
No matter which group you belong to , you ’ll be amazed by these out - of - this - world pictures .
The images that have not been seen by bare human eye , and there may pass many more decades before that happens , if ever .
Meanwhile , we have Hubble ’s electronic eye to keep us entertained .
Bush environmental chairman is now coal cheerleader Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009
Print This Email This
You cant teach an old dog new tricks .
That saying stands true for one former Bush official , who has tried to reinvent himself as an ally of clean , renewable energy proponents while still touting the virtues of clean coal . 
Even though the hurdles to achieving carbon emissions capture on a mass scale have been well documented and even though no new nuclear power plant has been built in the U.S. in 30 years , James Connaughton , former chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality is preaching the virtues of clean coal and nuclear power as the best solutions to domestic energy needs .
 Coal is clean now ,  proclaimed Connaughton , Tuesday night during the taping of the premier episode of PBSs  Planet Forward ,  where he was a guest panelist .
He argued in favor of a host of energy alternatives to foreign oil but advocated the most in favor of building new coal and nuclear power plants .
As chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality , Connaughton argued in favor of aspirational goals for industries to reduce their green house gas emissions rather than binding commitments .
A former lobbyist for utilities , mining and chemical companies , he has been criticized for weakening government standards on the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water and , more generally , for advising President Bush to ignore calls for government - mandated reductions in industrial greenhouse gas emissions .
Connaughton now works in the private sector as executive vice president of Constellation Energy , a Fortune 500 company that sells electricity and natural gas .
Pollution control improvements made to coal plants as a result of The Clean Air Act , have made coal much cleaner as an energy source , Connaughton said , adding we shouldnt give it up as an option in the countys energy future .
Writing on the clean coal myth , The Washington Posts Steve Mufson says ,  The phrase clean coal is polluting the energy debate .
The phrase is an oxymoron .
We can come up with ways to clean up after coal - many of them very expensive and , in the case of coal 's greenhouse gas emissions , untried .
And we can use coal more efficiently than in the past .
But coal itself is not clean and never will be .
That is a matter of chemistry and geology . 
Connaughtons promotion of coal during the shows filming did not go unchallenged .
His co-panelist , L. Hunter Lovins , president of the nonprofit sustainability group , Natural Capitalism Solutions , objected to his painting of coal as an environmentally - friendly energy source .
 I will never speak against research [ into carbon sequestration of coal plant emissions ] ,  Lovins said .
 I dont think there is a future is in the commercialization of it . 
Lovins said the U.S. would be best served by immediately putting resources into improving energy efficiency .
She applauded the decision to assign $ 3.2 billion from the 2009 stimulus bill towards energy efficiency and conservation projects .
Weatherizing preexisting buildings and reforming the nations energy grid should take precedence over developing new solar and wind technologies because the energy savings from efficiency gains will be more immediate , she said .
Connaughton , whose company does sell power produced from coal plants , said with half of the countrys electricity already being produced from coal , it is unavoidable that coal will play a long - term role in the U.S.  energy future .
When pressed , however , he did admit that no scientist has yet figured out a way to scale up carbon sequestration so it can be used to capture the emissions of coal plants .
 It s going to take at least 10 to 15 years ,  he said of where the technology stands now .
Lovins pointed out that one of the positives of coal energy , its low price , goes away when you add in carbon capture technology , which doubles the price of it .
Connaughton responded that Moores Law , which describes the exponential increases in computer technology efficiency over time , would eventually bring the price of carbon capture down as it is already bringing down the cost of solar technology .
He also argued in favor of building more nuclear power plants , saying that they are the cleanest of all energy technologies and that the U.S. could reuse nuclear material as is done in France .
The shows third panelist , Shai Agassi , founder and CEO of Better Place , a company that is building the first national electric vehicle network in Israel , said if nuclear power was turned to as the solution to the planets energy needs , it would require the construction of a new nuclear power plant every 18 hours .
While China has plans to build nuclear power plants , Agassi said the country had already decided to limit the number of plants to only 40 because of the countrys lack of uranium resources .
 That wont be the backbone of our strategy ,  Agassi said of nuclear powers future in America .
Agassi argued in favor of solar technology , saying it was the only energy source that could scale up to meet all of the energy needs of the developing and industrial world .
Planet Forward , which focuses on climate change and energy policy with a large emphasis on viewer interaction through the Web , will begin airing on PBS in mid-April .
It is filmed at the George Washington University and hosted by Frank Sesno , a professor of media affairs at the university .

C'est absolument incroyable , mais c'est la démocratie qui a gagné !
C'est vous , internautes , qui avez gagné .
Jeudi , l'Assemblée Nationale a refusé de ratifier ( par 21 voix contre 15 ) le projet de loi Création et Internet et la riposte graduée .
Le texte n'aura pas besoin d'être censuré au Conseil constitutionnel , il ne sera pas promulgué !
A moins que le gouvernement s'entête et exige une seconde lecture , ce que la Constitution lui permet .
Mise à jour : juridiquement , la gouvernement a la possibilité de demander une seconde lecture .
Selon nos informations , le secrétaire d’Etat chargé des relations avec le Parlement Roger Karoutchi est arrivé de toute urgence après le vote pour établir une stratégie .
Mais un tel rejet n’est a priori que deux fois dans l’histoire de la 5ème République , ce qui montre l’ampleur politique du coup porté ce matin .
Incroyable : Jeudi , à la surprise générale , les députés ont rejeté le texte de loi Création et Internet par 21 voix contre 15 !
Les lignes ont bougé , jeudi , lors du vote final de la loi Création et Internet .
Au point que Christine Albanel devait pousser un ouf de soulagement en se remémorant que la procédure d’urgence , encore une fois choisie par le gouvernement , devait éviter un deuxième tour de débat parlementaire .
Mais progressivement , les sénateurs et les députés ont révisé leur position en découvrant l’ampleur de l’usine à gaz qu’ils allaient créer , contre les principes républicains de respect de la présomption d’innocence .
Et la procédure d’urgence n’a plus suffit à empêcher la censure du texte .
Le Sénat , qui avait voté à l’unanimité des bancs le projet de loi en première lecture , à l’exception du groupe communiste qui s’était abstenu , s’est divisé ce jeudi matin .
Si les sénateurs UMP et Nouveau Centre ont maintenu leur vote favorable , les Verts ont voté contre et le PS a choisi de s’abstenir pour marquer son désaccord avec quelques points du texte , et faire un pas vers la position des députés .
A l’Assemblée Nationale , le député centriste Jean Dionis du Séjour n’a plus tenu .
Lui qui a dû concilier son opposition personnelle virulente contre le projet loi à la position de son groupe Nouveau Centre , favorable à la riposte graduée , a craqué .
Plutôt que de s’abstenir comme il l’avait annoncé pendant l’ensemble du débat , il a choisi à la dernière minute de franchir le Rubicon et de voter contre le projet de loi .
Un fait exceptionnel pour le groupe Nouveau Centre , qui fait partie de la majorité parlementaire .
Les députés PS , Verts , et Communistes ont bien sûr maintenu leur vote contre , tandis que les rangs UMP étaient clairsemés .
La ministre Christine Albanel a été victime d’un pêché d’orgueil .
Les députés n’ont pas goûté la méthode , et le durcissement du texte à la CMP , notamment par le rétablissement de la « double peine » ( le fait de payer l’abonnement pendant la suspension ) .
Ils n’ont pas dû apprécié , non plus , que la ministre ne réponde pas aux questions préalables et exception d’irrecevabilité défendues avec brio par l’opposition .
Au moment du vote , le nombre de mains levée pour voter pour le projet de loi était très maigre :
Ils ont voté pour :
Ils ont voté contre :
Sous les applaudissements , le texte a été rejeté .
Pour Numerama , ce sont des mois de combat et de démonstrations de la dangerosité juridique et technique du texte qui trouvent leurs fruits .
Des mois d’un combat souvent difficile que nous n’avons pu tenir que grâce à votre soutien , et au travail incroyablement précieux de la Quadrature du Net et des députés Martine Billard , Patrick Bloche , Christian Paul et Jean - Pierre Brard .
Merci à vous tous .
Ce matin , c’est la démocratie qui l ’a emportée sur les lobbys .
Soyez - en fiers .

About Thai Recipes
Most of the Thai recipes here are not elaborate but good useful everyday food that can be prepared with a reasonable expenditure of time and labor .
These recipes are mainly home - style i.e. not in the palace tradition .
Written for Westerners working with limited time and using ingredients available in the United States ( esp. if you use shop in our online Thai food market ) .
That said , the recipe should be a only a rough guideline .
Thai recipes are highly adaptable .
The characteristic flavors of Thai food come from the methods of cooking and ingredients used , not from precise quantities of the main seasonings .
This means you should adapt the quantities , especially of things like fish sauce , garlic , and chilies , to suit your own tastes .
Like all great cuisines , the foods in season should be the most important factor to determine what to cook .
If a certain ingredient is not available where you live , visit our online Thai food market , try a a substitute , or leave it out entirely .
With imagination , experimentation , and knowledge , with constant tasting , you can cook delicious Thai food in the West .
Basic knowledge of the balance of the five flavors is key .
There are many variations of any one Thai recipe , it depends on the cook , the season , the availability of ingredients , and the region .

For many years , each spring I taught the course Mathematics 109 / Music 109M , Mathematics & Music , a course I designed .
It was first taught in the spring of 2002 ( which was the first time such a course was offered at Washington University - click here to download the flyer that was used to advertise the course ) .
The notes from this course were developed into a book called Mathematics and Music , published by the American Mathematical Society in 2009 , which is now the textbook for the course .

When the New Left emerged in the 1960s , something else was born that would mark American elites for decades thereafter : the notion that social - democratic Western Europe was far superior to the capitalist United States .
Pity the poor American professor whose every junket to a European academic conference was marred by his continental colleagues ’ sneering over cocktails about his nation ’s shame du jour — Vietnam , Watergate , Iraq — or about American racism , capital punishment , or health care .
For much of the American Left , Western Europe was nothing less than an abstract symbol of progressive utopia .
This rosy view was never accurate , of course .
Europe ’s socialized health care was blighted by outrageous ( and sometimes deadly ) waiting lists and rationing , to name just one example .
To name another : Timbro , a Swedish think tank , found in 2004 that Sweden was poorer than all but five U.S. states and Denmark poorer than all but nine .
But in recent years , something has happened to complicate the Left ’s fanciful picture even further : Western European voters ’ widespread reaction against social democracy .
The shift has two principal , and related , causes .
The more significant one is that over the last three decades , social - democratic Europe ’s political , cultural , academic , and media elites have presided over , and vigorously defended , a vast wave of immigration from the Muslim world — the largest such influx in human history .
According to Foreign Affairs , Muslims in Western Europe numbered between 15 and 20 million in 2005 .
One source estimates that Britain ’s Muslim population rose from about 82,000 in 1961 to 553,000 in 1981 to 2 million in 2000 — a demographic change roughly representative of Western Europe as a whole during that period .
According to the London Times , the number of Muslims in the U.K. climbed by half a million between 2004 and 2008 alone — a rate of growth ten times that of the rest of that country ’s population .
Yet instead of encouraging these immigrants to integrate and become part of their new societies , Western Europe ’s governments have allowed them to form self - segregating parallel societies run more or less according to sharia .
Many of the residents of these patriarchal enclaves subsist on government benefits , speak the language of their adopted country poorly or not at all , despise pluralistic democracy , look forward to Europe ’s incorporation into the House of Islam , and support — at least in spirit — terrorism against the West .
A 2006 Sunday Telegraph poll , for example , showed that 40 percent of British Muslims wanted sharia in Britain , 14 percent approved of attacks on Danish embassies in retribution for the famous Mohammed cartoons , 13 percent supported violence against those who insulted Islam , and 20 percent sympathized with the July 2005 London bombers .
Too often , such attitudes find their way into practice .
Ubiquitous youth gangs , contemptuous of infidels , have made European cities increasingly dangerous for non-Muslims — especially women , Jews , and gays .
In 2001 , 65 percent of rapes in Norway were committed by what the country ’s police call “ non- Western ” men — a category consisting overwhelmingly of Muslims , who make up just 2 percent of that country ’s population .
In 2005 , 82 percent of crimes in Copenhagen were committed by members of immigrant groups , the majority of them Muslims .
Non-Muslims are n’t the only targets of Muslim violence .
A mountain of evidence suggests that the rates of domestic abuse in these enclaves are astronomical .
In Germany , reports Der Spiegel , “ a disproportionately high percentage of women who flee to women ’s shelters are Muslim ” ; in 2006 , 56 percent of the women at Norwegian shelters were of foreign origin ; Deborah Scroggins wrote in The Nation in 2005 that “ Muslims make up only 5.5 percent of the Dutch population , but they account for more than half the women in battered women ’s shelters . ”
Ayaan Hirsi Ali , the Somali - Dutch advocate for democracy and women ’s rights , would no doubt say far more than half : when she was working with women in Dutch shelters , she writes , “ there were hardly any white women ” in them , “ only women from Morocco , from Turkey , from Afghanistan — Muslim countries — alongside some Hindu women from Surinam . ”
When she and filmmaker Theo van Gogh tried to highlight the mistreatment of women under Islam in the 2004 film Submission : Part I , he was killed by a young Muslim extremist .
More and more Western Europeans , recognizing the threat to their safety and way of life , have turned their backs on the establishment , which has done little or nothing to address these problems , and begun voting for parties — some relatively new , and all considered right - wing — that have dared to speak up about them .
One measure of the dimensions of this shift : owing to the rise in gay - bashings by Muslim youths , Dutch gays — who ten years ago constituted a reliable left - wing voting bloc — now support conservative parties by a nearly two - to - one margin .
The other major reason for the turn against the Left is economic .
Western Europeans have long paid sky - high taxes for a social safety net that seems increasingly not worth the price .
These taxes have slowed economic growth .
Timbro ’s Johnny Munkhammar noted in 2005 that Sweden , for instance , which in the first half of the twentieth century had the world ’s second - highest growth rate , had since fallen to number 14 , owing to enormous tax hikes .
Government revenues in Western Europe go largely to support the unemployed , thus discouraging work .
Over the last decade or so , the overall unemployment rate in the EU 15 — that is , Western Europe — has hovered at about 2.5 to 3 points higher than in the United States .
In France and Germany , it has ascended into the double digits ( and that was before the global financial crisis that began in 2008 ) .
Western Europe ’s rate of long - term unemployment has consistently been several times higher than America ’s , denoting the presence of a sizable minority either permanently jobless or working off the books , often for family businesses , while collecting unemployment benefits .
These two factors — immigration and the economy — are intimately connected .
For while some immigrant groups in Europe , such as Hindus and East Asians , enjoy relatively low unemployment rates and healthy incomes , the largest immigrant group , Muslims , has become such a burden that governments have made extensive cutbacks in public services in order to keep up with welfare payments — closing clinics and emergency rooms , reducing staff in hospitals , cutting police and military spending , eliminating course offerings at public universities , and so on .
According to a report issued last year by the think tank Contribuables Associés , immigration reduces France ’s economic growth by two - thirds .
In 2002 , economist Lars Jansson estimated that immigration cost Swedish taxpayers about $ 27 billion annually and that fully 74 percent of immigrant - group members in Sweden lived off the taxpayers .
And in 2006 , the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise warned that Norway ’s petroleum fund — which contains the massive profits from North Sea oil that have made the nation rich — could wind up drained to cover outlays to immigrants .
( This in a country whose roads , as a report last year indicated , are in worse shape than Albania ’s . )
The last few decades in Europe have made three things crystal - clear .
First , social - democratic welfare systems work best , to the extent they do work , in ethnically and culturally homogeneous ( and preferably small ) nations whose citizens , viewing one another as members of an extended family , are loath to exploit government provisions for the needy .
Second , the best way to destroy such welfare systems is to take in large numbers of immigrants from poor , oppressive , and corruption - ridden societies , whose rule of the road is to grab everything you can get your hands on .
And third , the system will be wiped out even faster if many of those immigrants are fundamentalist Muslims who view bankrupting the West as a contribution to jihad .
Add to all this the growing power of an unelected European Union bureaucracy that has encouraged Muslim immigration and taken steps to punish criticism of it — criminalizing “ incitement of racism , xenophobia , or hatred against a racial , ethnic , or religious group ” in 2007 , for example — and you can start to understand why Western Europeans who prize their freedoms are resisting the so - called leadership of their see - no - evil elites .
The November 2001 general election in Denmark is the most decisive — and successful — rejection so far of a Western European left - wing establishment .
Alarmed by a widely publicized study showing that their country would have a Muslim majority within 60 years if immigration rates did n’t change , Danish voters sent the Social Democrats down to defeat for the first time since 1924 .
The new Liberal - Conservative governing coalition , which voters returned to power in 2005 , has introduced the continent ’s most sweeping immigration and integration reforms , including rules designed to thwart the near - universal practice in Europe ’s Muslim communities of marrying one ’s children off to cousins abroad so that they , too , may immigrate to the West .
As a result , the flow of new Muslim arrivals has decreased significantly , allowing the government to focus resources on the immense challenge of trying to integrate Muslims already living in Denmark .
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen also defended free speech strongly during the 2006 Mohammed cartoon crisis , standing firm while Muslims around the world raged against Denmark and Western leaders begged him to back down .
The rightward shifts in Europe most widely reported in the U.S. have been those in Germany , where Angela Merkel became chancellor in 2005 , and in France , where Nicolas Sarkozy took over the presidency in 2007 .
Those developments , as well as the third term that Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi won in 2008 , were grounded largely in public recognition of the need for economic liberalization .
By French standards , Sarkozy ’s campaign rhetoric was nothing less than stunning : arguing that “ the revolution of 1968 ” — a sacred event for the left - wing French establishment — had not liberated France but “ brought us into moral decline , ” Sarkozy insisted that if the French wanted growth , they needed to spend less time in cafés and more on the job .
In brave little Denmark ’s backyard , two more countries have moved to the right .
In Norway , the Progress Party — which the political and media establishment has smeared for a generation as racist and fiscally unserious — now rivals the Labor Party , architect of the country ’s welfare state , thanks to voter concerns about immigration and public services .
Though the financial crisis had caused support for the Progress Party to slip a bit , recent Muslim riots and debates about hijab have sent poll numbers skyward again , and the party seems a good bet to come out on top in next September ’s parliamentary elections — though it will be in trouble if , as appears likely , other right - of - center parties refuse to join a Progress Party–led coalition .
And in Sweden , perhaps the ultimate symbol of social democracy , voters motivated largely by concerns over unemployment and other economic issues unseated the long - powerful Social Democratic Party in 2006 .
In its place they installed a center - right coalition led by Fredrik Reinfeldt ’s Moderates , who promised to help businesses and lower taxes .
But demonstrating a distinctively European species of schizophrenia , many on both the right and the left , while acknowledging the need for welfare - state reorganization , have ultimately resisted it — as if the philosophical leap required were simply too great .
In Western Europe , after all , even the mainstream Right tends to be statist .
“ The concept of the cradle - to - grave welfare state is so deeply embedded in the Danish psyche that even the conservatives do n’t dare touch it , ” noted NPR correspondent Sylvia Poggioli in 2006 .
Ivo H. Daalder made the same point in a 2007 Brookings Institution report , writing that “ when one talks about the right in Europe , you are talking about a very state interventionist political class that still believes that the government has a fundamental role in guiding how the economy is supposed to be run . ”
It ’s no surprise , then , that Europe ’s new leaders have made relatively modest economic changes .
True , Sarkozy has raised state employees ’ retirement age ( precipitating a transport strike ) and ended France ’s 35 - hour workweek .
But from the start , Social Democrats in Germany , whom Merkel ’s slim margin of victory forced her to accept as coalition partners , have limited her ability to implement serious economic reforms .
In April 2008 , Judy Dempsey noted in the International Herald Tribune not only that the coalition had “ run its course ” but that Merkel herself had been “ forced to move leftward , ” hiking pensions and “ rolling back radical labor reforms , ironically introduced by her Social Democratic predecessor , Gerhard Schröder , which were designed to bring older people back to work by reducing social welfare payments . ”
And with the onset of the economic crisis , notes German author Henryk Broder , “ there is even an ongoing discussion about Enteignung [ expropriation ] and Verstaatlichung [ nationalization ] , which was unthinkable a year ago . ”
As for Sweden , shortly after the 2006 victory , BusinessWeek writers Stanley Reed and Ariane Sains paraphrased Reinfeldt as saying that his “ idea is n’t to dismantle the cherished Swedish welfare state .
. . .
That would be too controversial . ”
Reinfeldt ’s one major innovation has been a “ partially successful ” effort “ to force people off the welfare rolls and into the labor market , ” University of Lund social thinker Jonathan Friedman tells me .
Reinfeldt ’s economic plan has also involved increased privatization , somewhat lower taxes , and encouragement of entrepreneurship — all policies , as Friedman notes , “ that were started by the previous government . ”
Meanwhile , with the notable exception of Denmark , the new nonsocialist governments have left their predecessors ’ disastrous immigration and integration policies almost entirely intact .
Sarkozy ’s defiant campaign rhetoric about Muslim rioters in the suburbs raised hopes for major change .
But though he announced last July that illegal immigration would be a major focus during France ’s EU presidency , he has done little even about legal immigration , most of which , in Western Europe , involves the importation of new spouses in arranged , usually forced , marriages .
Sarkozy seems to believe that job creation and other economic measures will resolve France ’s colossal integration challenges .
Merkel , meanwhile , shone briefly when she insisted that the Deutsche Oper proceed with a 2006 production of Mozart ’s Idomeneo that Muslim leaders condemned as offensive .
But the heavily hyped “ national integration plan ” that she introduced the following year rested on such half - measures as an increase in the number of government - sponsored German classes , an effort to encourage immigrants to play sports , and ( incredibly ) a program that addressed wife - beating — permitted by the Koran and extremely common in Muslim communities — by offering advice on the Internet .
Merkel actually described these pathetic gestures as a “ milestone ” ; Broder , more accurately , calls them “ make - believe action , ” another way to avoid conflicts in her coalition .
In Sweden , says Friedman , Reinfeldt has pursued “ a variant of politics as usual ” on immigration and integration .
Lars Hedegaard , president of the International Free Press Society , insists that Swedish efforts to encourage employment “ will undoubtedly prove ineffective over the long haul ” because “ the fundamental problem is demographics .
Sweden remains Europe ’s main importer of Muslim immigrants who are unwilling to assimilate and whose imams order them to detest Swedish culture .
So long as the current government is unwilling to tackle this basic problem , everything else will be for naught . ”
Sarkozy has undertaken one high - profile initiative , which seems disastrously ill - conceived in a uniquely Gallic way : developing closer , more formal ties between France and the Arab countries from which it receives most of its immigrants .
At one point , he even spoke of a “ Mediterranean Union . ”
Haaretz writer Michalis Firillas summed up Sarkozy ’s plan tidily in January 2008 : “ For some , his Mediterranean Union is a containment policy .
For others it is neocolonial .
But there is also a sense that Sarkozy is betting on French grandeur , that aura of greatness , to bridge the disparate Mediterranean with a new and serious political body .
Unfortunately , he may find that there are others with similar visions of grandeur , from Ankara to Cairo , from Jerusalem to Tangiers , who have their own Mediterranean visions . ”
Indeed , Sarkozy ’s scheme appears to be a continuation of his left - wing predecessors ’ efforts to bring the Arab world under French influence — efforts that ended up subsidizing the colonization of French suburbs by Arabs who now consider them part of the House of Islam .
Not only has Europe ’s move to the right not always had concrete results ; it also has n’t been an across - the - board phenomenon .
In Britain , the Tories seem poised to resume power after Labour ’s long , slow decline .
Yet the ideological gap between the parties has narrowed so much in recent years , and the leadership vacuum is so pronounced , that it ’s difficult to imagine a Tory takeover ’s having an impact remotely comparable with that of Margaret Thatcher ’s 1979 election .
On the contrary , conservative columnist Peter Hitchens recently charged that nowadays “ you cannot become the government unless you bow to the views of the ‘ Centre - Left ’ media elite , especially the broadcast media elite . ”
That elite , alas — as vividly demonstrated last year by the archbishop of Canterbury ’s speech contemplating the legitimacy of sharia in parts of Britain — is bent on appeasing fundamentalist Islam .
And Spain , in a move widely seen as capitulating to Islamists , responded to the March 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid by voting for José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero ’s Socialist Party , which had vowed to withdraw troops from Iraq immediately .
Zapatero narrowly won reelection last year .
As libertarian columnist Antonio Golmar explains , the centrist consensus established after King Juan Carlos ’s introduction of democracy in the seventies has been shattered by Zapatero ’s hard - left initiatives .
These include the Historical Memory Law — which portrays leftist mass murderers during the Spanish civil war as heroic freedom fighters , while stigmatizing many of their innocent victims as fascists — and the introduction in all schools of “ citizenship ” classes that teach scorn for capitalism and representative democracy .
In response , some Spaniards have lurched rightward toward the national - Catholic , proto - fascist ideology of Franco ’s time and become increasingly vocal within the conservative Partido Popular .
Consequently , says Golmar , “ moderates in Spain are trapped between a far - left administration and their cronies and the revival of the extreme right disguised in conservative and even libertarian clothing . ”
While America struggles to move beyond the antagonisms of the 1960s , then , Spain has entered an ideological battlefield reminiscent of the years preceding its civil war of the late thirties .
There seems little room for those who loathe both the neo-Marxists and the neoreactionaries .
The situation in Spain is a reminder that not all “ right turns ” are created equal .
If the Danes have affirmed individual liberty , human rights , sexual equality , the rule of law , and freedom of speech and religion , some Western Europeans have reacted to the mindless multiculturalism of their socialist leaders by embracing alternatives that seem uncomfortably close to fascism .
Consider Austria ’s recently deceased Jörg Haider , who belittled the Holocaust , honored Waffen - SS veterans , and found things to praise about Nazism .
In 2000 , his Freedom Party became part of a coalition government , leading the rest of the EU to isolate Austria diplomatically for a time , and last September , his new party , the Alliance for the Future of Austria , won 11 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections .
Or take Jean - Marie Le Pen , who has called the Holocaust “ a detail in the history of World War II ” and advocated the forced quarantining of people who test HIV - positive — and whose far - right National Front came out on top in the first round of voting for the French presidency in 2002 .
The British National Party ( BNP ) , which has a whites - only membership policy and has flatly denied the Holocaust , won more than 5 percent of the vote in London ’s last mayoral election .
Then there ’s Vlaams Belang ( Flemish Interest ) , formerly Vlaams Bloc , whose leaders have a regrettable tendency to be caught on film singing Nazi songs and buying Nazi books .
In 2007 , it won five out of 40 seats in the Belgian Senate .
For establishment politicians , journalists , and academics , these parties serve an exceedingly useful purpose : their existence makes it easy to tar any nonsocialist party with the fascist brush — labeling it racist and xenophobic , equating its leaders with the likes of Le Pen and Haider , and stigmatizing its supporters .
No party in Europe has been subjected to more unfair attacks than Norway ’s Progress Party , whose extraordinary electoral successes have outraged that country ’s socialist elite .
Like other parties on what we may call Europe ’s respectable right , the Progress Party has expressly distanced itself from parties like the National Front and Vlaams Belang .
Yet despite these disavowals , American media have routinely echoed the leftist establishment ’s unjust calumnies .
A seminal example was a March 2002 New York Times article by Marlise Simons about Pim Fortuyn , the Dutch politician who , according to the article ’s headline , was proudly gay , and marching the dutch to the right .
Though Simons acknowledged that Fortuyn criticized Islam because it offered “ no equality for men and women and because . . . the imams here preach in offensive terms about gays , ” she nonetheless echoed the Dutch establishment ’s characterization of him as a menace to Dutch values , making sure to mention that he had been widely compared with Mussolini and Haider .
A few weeks later , Fortuyn was murdered by an environmental fanatic taken in by similar claptrap .
The same kind of incendiary rhetoric that Dutch journalists used against Fortuyn can now be seen in American left - wing coverage of any nonsocialist European party or politician .
Typical was Gary Younge ’s 2007 piece in The Nation : in europe , it ’s the old right that ’s full of hate .
According to Younge , “ the primary threat to democracy in Europe is not ‘ Islamofascism ’ . . . but plain old fascism .
The kind whereby mostly white Europeans take to the streets to terrorize minorities . ”
This was nonsense on a breathtaking scale : though the rise of parties like the BNP is indeed distressing , the truth remains that for every act of anti-Muslim violence in Europe , there are — to make an exceedingly conservative guess — 100 acts of Muslim - on - infidel violence .
Who will win the war for the soul of Western Europe ?
The Islamofascists and their multiculturalist appeasers , many of whom seem to believe that their job is not to defend democracy but to help make the transition to sharia as smooth as possible ?
The nativist cryptofascists ?
Or Pim Fortuyn ’s freedom - loving heirs ?
Interestingly , while Western Europeans have been heading in one direction , Americans have chosen to go the other way , replacing a president more loathed by the European elite than any in history with a man whom the same elite has celebrated to an unprecedented degree , often depicting his election as a mystical act of atonement for all of America ’s past sins , real or imagined .
The final question , then , is whether the Western European Left ’s condescension toward America , and the American Left ’s habit of holding Western Europe up as a socialist paradise , can survive the combination of Europe ’s right turn and the elevation of Barack Obama .
Stir in the international financial crisis , which will almost certainly cause a socioeconomic upheaval of untold dimensions in both hemispheres , and it seems reasonable to expect that the old pattern may be broken for good .
Meaning that American professors will have a far less stressful time of it at European cocktail parties — at least until sharia comes along and forbids cocktails entirely .

New Year 's
Eve proved disastrous for farmers , consumers and the environment .
That was the day Congress kicked the Farm Bill can down the road , failing to pass a new five - year law with much needed reforms and improvements — or even the reasonable short - term extension that was on the table .
Instead , legislators passed an awful nine - month extension as part of the " fiscal cliff " bargain .
The bill includes no reform of huge payments to the big commodity crops , no disaster assistance and no extension of funding for a range of important programs — from farmers markets to rural micro-enterprise to organic research .
The silver lining ?
We now have nine months to push for a decent Farm Bill that keeps what 's working and reforms what 's broken .
We 're rolling up our sleeves .
The list of hits to programs that support farmers is long in this short - term fix .
In addition to the programs mentioned above , there will be no funding for value - added agriculture , beginning farmers , minority farmers , organic agriculture or renewable energy .
In effect , the deal will also keep farmers from being able to improve soil and water conservation practices through the Conservation Stewardship Program — despite the many clear success stories this program has supported .
Missed opportunity for reforms
The horrible Farm Bill extension was passed despite the fact that Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) and House Agriculture Committee Chair Frank Lucas ( R - OK ) together wrote a responsible extension bill and presented it to the House on December 29 .
While not perfect , it was at least fair and comprehensive , and would have made very modest cuts in commodity crop payments to provide $ 472 million in support of 21 different programs including conservation , fruit and vegetable production , energy , and rural development — all now zeroed out .
Both House and Senate versions of the 2012 Farm Bill under consideration earlier in the year in fact eliminated direct payment subsidies for commodity production .
Yet the deal that was just struck locks those egregious subsidies in for another full year , at a $ 5 billion price tag — no reform there !
A glimmer of good in a very bad bill
On the positive side , the nine - month extension of the basic elements of the 2008 Farm Bill allows USDA to restart programs that still have baseline funding but were held up since the bill expired September 30 , 2012 .
This includes programs such as the Wetlands and Grassland Reserve Programs , the Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Program , and the Specialty Crop Block Grant program .
There 's good reason to believe that the agriculture committees in both the House and Senate will present new bills this spring .
Whether those bills will be more closely aligned than the summer 2012 versions , especially on the divisive commodity subsidy and food stamp spending provisions , remains to be seen .
Together with the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition ( NSAC ) we commend the Agriculture Committee leadership for trying to pass a more responsible extension measure .
And on behalf of our members and partner organizations across the country , we recommit ourselves to getting a true reform Farm Bill passed in 2013 .
We 'll be getting our message to our senators and representatives this spring , especially those on the Senate and House Agriculture Committees and those to whom they listen .

Chinese cyber spies have penetrated so deep into the US system — ranging from its secure defense network , banking system , electricity grid to putting spy chips into its defense planes — that it can cause serious damage to the US any time , a top US official on counter - intelligence has said .
“ Chinese penetrations of unclassified DoD networks have also been widely reported .
Those are more sophisticated , though hardly state of the art , ” said National Counterintelligence Executive , Joel Brenner , at the Austin University Texas last week , according to a transcript made available on Wednesday .
Listing out some of the examples of Chinese cyber spy penetration , he said : “ We ’re also seeing counterfeit routers and chips , and some of those chips have made their way into US military fighter aircraft ..
You do n’t sneak counterfeit chips into another nation ’s aircraft to steal data .
When it ’s done intentionally , it ’s done to degrade systems , or to have the ability to do so at a time of one ’s choosing . ”
Referring to the Chinese networks penetrating the cyber grids , he said : “ Do I worry about those grids , and about air traffic control systems , water supply systems , and so on ?
You bet I do .
America ’s networks are being mapped .
There has also been experience of both Chinese and criminal network operations in the networks of some of the banks ” .

Shadow President
If you have ever watched the news , you probably saw a report involving a president of the United States .
Maybe he was on a trip visiting world leaders , holding a press conference , or making a speech about some national or world event .
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be the president ?
Being America 's president is more than just public appearances ; it involves a lot of pressure and stress , and is often considered the most difficult job in the modern world .
Shadow President gives you the chance to be the President of the United States .
As Commander - in - Chief , you are responsible for foreign and domestic policy , and your ultimate goal is world peace and prosperity .
How will you run the country and influence the world ?
This simulator recreates events that have led up to the current state the world is in today , but gives you the opportunity to change future for the better -- or worse .
Shadow President starts you in June of 1990 , just before the fall of the Berlin Wall , and not long before the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Iraq is becoming more and more volatile , and threatens military action for dominance of the Middle East .
Tensions are rising in the Soviet Union as its days as a Communist super - power are coming to an end , and the threat of nuclear war seems very real .
People are living in poverty in South America and Africa , and cartels and warlords strip their people of their basic human rights .
You have two years until your next election campaign , and you must try to garner enough public support to be reelected .
You are given access to the Shadow President supercomputer , which is your command post for overseeing the world .
Every country in the world can be targeted to display more information about the current state of that nation -- everything from public opinion , to human rights violations , and even the likelihood of that country initiating military or other hostile actions against another country .
When you select a country , you can give commands in one of five categories ( social , economic , military , intelligence , or nuclear technology ) that may help or hurt that country , or you can send financial aid to the country in one of those categories .
Depending on your actions , the global community may follow your lead or oppose you , and certain actions improve or reduce the public 's opinion of you .
As president , you have your staff members to help and advise you as you go .
At your disposal are the White House Chief of Staff , the head of the CIA , press secretary , Economic Advisor , Secretary of Defense , National Security Advisor , and Secretary of State .
They will predict the results of your actions with or against another country , and tell you if they think your decision is a good one .
Also , when you have selected a country , they will brief you on that country 's status in the world and any information about the country that may affect America or the world .
Your advisors are not guaranteed to you ; they may resign their post if you do something really bad that they disagreed with , or they may even be killed .
Likewise , your Shadow President supercomputer is not invincible .
Your computer may slow down significantly if there are too many things going on in the world for it to monitor all at once .
Disasters , both natural and human - influenced , may also affect your computer 's capability .
When you issue orders for your country 's policies with other countries , you often have to wait up to a week to see the results in matters that involve negotiations , such as peace conferences or economic arrangements .
Some happen overnight , like political condemnation of another country , and others may occur almost immediately , such as blocking or restricting trade with a country .
When your orders are finished , you will see the results in statistical form ; these statistics determine the country 's attitude towards other countries and its own people .
As president , your responsibility is to find peaceful alternatives to war , whether America is directly involved or not .
However , there are times when you must decide to make a show of force in order to get the other countries to listen to you .
If a power - hungry country threatens to invade a peaceful country , you can put pressure on the aggressors by establishing a military presence in the victim and neighboring countries .
You can also dissuade the enemy country by cutting or eliminating trade , making it more difficult and expensive for the country to start a war .
Just because the country declares war does n't mean there will be bloodshed .
You can file complaints with the UN , demand global sanctions against that country , and try to form a coalition to oppose them .
You can even send the CIA to give arms to rebels in the country , initiate a coup d'etat to overthrow the government ( hopefully a better one will replace it ) , or assassinate the leader .
If all else fails , you 'll have to fight .
Hopefully , you can stop the country before it gains nuclear warhead capabilities and decides to try it out .
One factor that influences your actions is your popularity rating .
Your popularity is based on surveys completed by the American citizens , and reflects your actions .
Sometimes presidents need to make tough and unpopular decisions to protect the country and the world ; this may not be too much of a factor in the early stages of the game , but may drastically affect whether or not you act later on .
The rating is just an estimate , so having a 50.1 % rating may not always win you an election .
Also , if your rating gets too low , you could be impeached or even assassinated .
If you 're bored with the pre-Desert Storm era , you can also try different scenarios .
What if Iraq was allowed to invade Kuwait , and eventually conquered Jordan and Saudi Arabia , thus gaining control over most of the world 's oil ?
What if Germany and Japan became the world 's economic powerhouses and America 's quality of life dropped significantly ?
What if the world 's natural resources were depleted ?
If you do n't want to play one of the scenarios that come with the game , you can experiment leading your country in different ways ; you can even be a true " shadow president " and try to invade countries and do pretty much anything the president should n't do .
The major drawbacks in Shadow President are the lack of a US Senate to affect your decisions and the inability to visit other countries to try and strengthen ties with them .
Instead of actually living the life of a president , you lead your country from a computer screen , much like the one in Maelstrom .
Shadow President makes up for this with its strong gameplay and challenging AI .
Much of the dialogue from your advisors consists of sentences patched together , but it is enough to convey the information you need to know .
Though Shadow President is a complex game , the tutorial makes the game easy to learn .
Shadow President includes the 1990 CIA World Factbook in its entirety , and though the Factbook is only a reference and is unaffected by the game , you can get a good idea of what certain countries may do and what their past is .
The Factbook is only accurate in the beginning of the game , as your decisions and actions can and will change the course of history .
And always remember : the world is watching you .

Dell is suing a former licensed US reseller , TigerDirect.com , claiming " repeated and blatant violations " of its resale contract , including trademark infringement , misleading representation , unfair competition , and false advertising .
In an April 17 lawsuit filed by Dell in New York district court , Tiger is accused of - among many other things - selling old and out - of - date Dell computers it purchased from other resellers while claiming they were brand new and shuttled directly from Dell .
Tiger was also fingered for telling customers the antique boxes were covered by Dell warranties when the warranties had expired long ago .
Furthermore , the Round Rock PC giant accuses Tiger of using a modified Dell logo on its website that " mimics and bastardizes " the Dell trademark .
The complaint claims Dell 's attempts to contact Tiger with its grievances were partially or completely ignored .
In some cases , Dell says , Tiger would partially address a complaint " only to embark on other acts of infringement and false representations virtually immediately thereafter . "
Tiger Direct was an authorized reseller of Dell products until May 2007 .
But according to the complaint , while Tiger was bound by the terms and conditions of a Dell contract , it violated the agreement by calling itself a " Dell SuperStore , " a " Dell Monitor Shop , " and a " Dell representative . "
During that time , Tiger also allegedly advertised that it was selling " Brand New DELL PCs At Blowout Prices , " when the merchandise was actually " old , outdated and no longer sold by Dell . "
Dell claims it had received emails and telephone calls from customers asking how Tiger could possibly sell Dell computers at such a bargain and demanding their sales rep match Tiger 's prices .
Apparently , the final straw was Tiger falsely representing on its website that Dell would provide three months of support for any Dell product sold by Tiger , when the warranties for some of the products had expired .
After numerous complaints , the lawsuit alleges , Tiger revised the notification to indicate the systems were covered by a " limited warranty . "
But it was n't until the user clicked on the link for full information , Dell says , that Tiger actually explained the PC is covered by a third - party provider .
Dell 's more recent complaints involve Tiger using a logo that allegedly infringes on the Dell trademark .
Dell claims
Tiger uses a logo that 's entirely too reminiscent of the Dell logo , only without the company 's official slanting letter " E . "
Round Rock said it sent a cease and desist letter to Tiger on December 17 , 2008 regarding the logo — and five more in succession - but to no avail .
The complaint said the only reply Dell has received was on January 12 , 2009 from Tiger 's in - house lawyer saying , " I 'm sorry for the delay in responding .
We will review and get back to you shortly . "
Dell wants an injunction on Tiger using any of its materials , the destruction of all computers parts and accessories with Dell logos , unspecified damages , and recovery of three times the profits Tiger has made for its alleged wrongful actions .

Keep your clothes on - naked hiking forbidden in Switzerland !
Hikers can no longer let it all hang out in part of Switzerland after naked walking was made illegal .
The rule was introduced in the Swiss canton of Appenzell - Innerrhoden and it means walking in the bare is now forbidden , and nudist hikers will be punished with a fine of € 133 if they are caught .
A vote on Sunday passed the new rule in the tiny region , and it came about after hikers who were spotted in their birthday suits last autumn caused an outrage amongst local residents .
And a group of ramblers posted a note online that named the mountain region as the perfect spot for naked walking .
The new law is not just against naked hiking , but has also seen abusive behaviour , urinating in public , noise and littering banned .
A stark - naked wonderer was stopped by police in the region last year but received no fine because he was not breaking the law at the time .
There are still places , however , where you can strip down to your birthday suit completely at your leisure – but we are n't telling you where !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday said the Fed ’s buying of longer - dated U.S. Treasuries would “ taper off ” when the economy no longer needed help , allowing the Fed to cease its emergency support .

“ The time will come when the economy will be growing , the housing market will be recovering , that support will no longer be needed .
And we will of course at that point taper off that support , ” Bernanke told community bankers in Phoenix , Arizona .
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday surprised investors with plans to buy up to $ 300 billion of longer - term U.S. Treasury securities and an additional $ 850 billion of agency mortgage debt to ease a deepening U.S. recession .
It also confirmed it would hold interest rates near zero for “ an extended period ” .
“ We are very much aware that we do n’t want to be in the credit markets forever .
We need to help them now , but we want to have an exit strategy , and allow those markets to recover and become again fully private sector , ” Bernanke said in response to an audience question after delivering a speech .
It was the first time the Fed had bought longer - dated Treasuries since the 1960s .
The news sent yields sharply lower , while on the foreign exchange markets it inflicted the biggest decline in the dollar in 25 years .
Bernanke said the Fed had decided to expand its aid for the mortgage sector and buy Treasury securities to “ support the housing market , the broader economy . ”
Economists said the Fed was effectively printing money by buying debt issued by the U.S. government , and then recycling all proceeds from this investment back to the Treasury .
In terms of policy , it is equivalent to the quantitative easing strategies employed by Japan during the 1990s to end deflation and a decade of miserable economic performance .
Quantitative easing was needed , with rates already at zero and deflation a genuine threat , Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President James Bullard said in a presentation at a policy workshop at the Bank of France in Paris .
“ Moving to quantitative approaches to policy is feasible and is going on right now , ” Bullard told the workshop , according to his presentation on the St Louis Fed website .
He also emphasized the risks of deflation , citing the experience of Japan , where widespread declining prices following the collapse of a property and stock market bubble made the economic downturn much worse .
“ Deflation is a real possibility in the current environment important near - term goal for monetary policy is to prevent this outcome , ” said Bullard , who is not a voting member of the Fed ’s policy - setting committee this year .
FOR a glimpse of agriculture in a land of high - rise apartment buildings , busloads of New York City schoolchildren have come for years to the Queens County Farm Museum .
There they have petted Daisy the cow , walked through the cornfield maze , ridden the hay wagon and examined pens and fields that seemed just like those of a real farm .
But over the past year , the museum has become a real farm .
Since Michael Grady Robertson was hired as its director of agriculture a year ago , it has been raising more crops and animals , using sustainable methods , and plans to expand .
For the first time , the farm is running a stand at the Union Square Greenmarket .
Every Monday since November , the farm has been selling greenhouse produce  more than 15 pounds of salad greens each week  eggs , honey , frozen heirloom tomatoes from last summer ’s abundance , and pork from pasture - raised pigs .
Three blocks south of the Grand Central Parkway in Floral Park , the farm does n’t have the pastoral beauty of Westchester County ’s temple of sustainable agriculture , but it has a Queens - style terroir .
When I was in college I spent the spring semester of my sophomore year in Paris .
It was an amazing experience and has since led me to traveling out of the USA as much as possible ( aka , when I can afford it ) .
But as great as my semester abroad was , there were some things I wish I had known before arriving in the City of Lights .
For example , I wish I had known that though being a polite American will help you get around town , being an angry American who can yell at Parisians in their own language will get you even further .
There are just certain important facts that the travel books wo n’t tell you .
They do n’t tell you that refusing food in Taiwan is a grave insult , but burping loudly is considered a compliment to the chef .
So from my experiences overseas , here ’s a list of do ’s and do n’t when spending a semester abroad : * Do bang anything that moves .
Even if she ’s ugly , she ’s still foreign .
* Do not bang bareback .
Foreign girls tend to be skanks .
* Do take advantage of the lowered drinking age and the late night bars .
The beer tastes better and has a higher alcohol content .
* Do not do drugs ( Amsterdam excluded ) .
If you doubt me , go watch a little movie called “ Midnight Express ” .
* Do say that you are American .
Pick the closest big city and say you are from there .
* Do n’t pretend to be Canadian .
You will just get laughed at .
* If you go to Italy , do eat everything .
Nothing tastes bad in Italy .
* If you go to China , do n’t order the lobster .
They will bring it out slightly alive and moving and even though that ’s the freshest way to eat it , it ’s still creepy .
* Do go out and experience as much of the music , art and culture as you can .
* Do n’t think you have to like it .
Trust me , Europe has as much crap as America .
* If you are in Thailand , do get a massage .
They are cheap and awesome .
* If you are in Thailand , do not get a hand job after your massage .
More than likely your masseur is a dude .
* Do spend some time and learn the language of your host country .
Even if it ’s a couple of swear words – it will make you sound cool .
* Do not come back with a fucking accent .
Unless you want your friends to beat the shit out of you .
* If possible , do take a train to other countries .
They have sleeper coaches that are relatively inexpensive and pretty comfy .
* Do not share your sleeper coach with a German .
They smell and insist on keeping the window closed and you will have to battle them all night ( luckily you ’re American so you will win…again ) .
And the most important of all the do ’s and don’ts when traveling abroad : * Do make sure you get school credit before you leave .
Nothing ’s worse than having to repeat Freshman Comp .
* Do not skip classes .
Save that for when you return back to campus .
USA Buys Enough Guns in 3 Months to Outfit the Entire Chinese and Indian Army
Law abiding US citizens bought on average 3,177,256 guns every 3 months in 2008 .
EveryTown , USA – -( AmmoLand.com ) -
In just 3 months Americans bought enough guns to outfit the entire Chinese and Indian army 's combined .
“ You cannot invade the mainland United States .

You also bought 1,529,635,000 rounds of ammunition in just the month of December 2008 .
Yeah that is right , that is Billion with a “ B ” .
This number takes no accounting of reloading or reloaded ammunition .
This is an evaluation of overall firearms and ammunition purchases based on low end numbers per Federal NIC instacheck data base Statistics .
The numbers presented are only PART of the overall numbers of arms and ammunition that have been sold .
The actual numbers are much higher .
Follow Up :
As the Miami Herald reports :
A House council hurriedly passed a sweeping rewrite of Florida election laws Friday after shutting down debate and public comment , prompting an uproar and cries of " travesty " from opponents .
Like a similar Senate version , the House bill would ban two forms of voter ID at the polls now used mainly by older voters and require paid initiative - petition circulators to register with the state .
It also would require people whose address changed in the month before an election to cast provisional ballots , prohibit anyone from interacting with voters in a floating 100 - foot zone outside polling places and make it more difficult for third - party groups to register new voters .
While the bill places severe restrictions on voters and voter registration , it simultaneously loosens rules on out of state political action committees :
The bill allows political committees registered in other states to be active in Florida without complying with the Sunshine State 's campaign reporting requirements , which are stricter than other states .
Legislators would be allowed to create leadership funds to solicit large donations from special interests and lobbyists .
The House and Senate bills are also notable for what they do n't include :
For example , there are no provisions to expand early voting centers and hours , something Gov. Charlie Crist had to do by executive order last year after swamped voting sites had waits of up to six hours .
A St. Petersburg Times editorial labeled the massive package a " GOP power grab " :
Republican legislative leaders have lost all sense of shame with their 11th - hour bill to roll back voting rights in Florida .
The legislation is so disgraceful it is no wonder a Republican - led House committee debated the bill for all of 6 minutes Friday before silencing public comment and approving the bill along party lines .
This fast - moving train needs to be stopped cold .
Yesterday , the ACLU , NAACP and other civil rights groups held a press conference with Democrats to blast the bill :
" There is a chilling similarity between the way this bill was railroaded through committee and the provisions of the bill itself , " said Sen .
Nan Rich , D - Weston .
" Both are unabashed attempts to limit the ability of ordinary citizens to have a say in their government . "
She also singled out the bill 's sponsor for criticism , saying that Sen .
Alex Diaz de la Portilla , R - Miami , was unable to cite a single instance of voter fraud in the 2008 cycle that would justify the ban on two forms of ID used mainly by retirees .
Voting advocates have cause to be concerned .
With Republicans boasting strong majorities in both the Florida Senate ( a 26 - 14 advantage ) and House ( 76 - 44 ) , there 's no doubt they could pass the bill .
The wild card may be Gov. Charlie Crist ( R ) -- a self - described moderate with larger political ambitions , who may be reluctant to earn bad publicity with voters .
Yesterday , Crist hinted that he may veto the bill :
" It always seems to me that when there may be legislation that attempts to sort of make it harder for people to do something - the people that we work for -- generally that 's not good .
I do n't look on that in a favorable light and that is true of this particular part of this legislation . "
Crist 's statement about a " particular part " of the bill hints at one possible outcome : Republicans in the legislature will strip out some of the most controversial provisions to make it more palatable for Crist to sign , but still succeed in re-writing parts of the election code .
UPDATE : CREDO put out an action alert about this yesterday -- here 's the link .

Here 's what the leader of Fla PIRG says :
The normally mild - mannered Brad Ashwell with Florida Public Interest Research Group made the most out of his 15 seconds : " This is probably one of the worst pieces of elections legislation I ’ve ever seen . "
In a press release yesterday , the ACLU and PIRG itemized some of what the Senate bill would do :
The proposed changes to Florida ’s voting and elections laws would :
* Expand the " no-solicitation zone , " creating a constantly shifting zone that would be impossible to enforce and further restricts voters ’ ability to receive important nonpartisan voting rights information at the polling place ;
* Further limits acceptable IDs , without proposing acceptable alternatives , preventing eligible citizens from registering to vote , and properly registered voters from exercising their right to vote ;
* Force more voters to vote by provisional ballots , which have a higher rate of rejection ;
* Increase the frequency of " list maintenance programs " causing more validly registered voters to be removed from the voter rolls ;
* Extend the deadline for making accessible paper ( marksense ) ballots available for disabled Floridians , relegating voters with disabilities to four additional years of voting on second class touch screen voting systems ;
* Impose unnecessary and onerous restrictions on third - party voter registration groups .
This would have the direct effect of decreasing electoral participation by Floridians who are significantly more likely to register through these drives , especially eligible Black and Latino voters ;
* Impose unnecessary and onerous restrictions on groups that collect citizen petitions for ballot measures , making it harder for regular citizens – as compared to well - financed corporate interests – to get measures on the ballot .
* Pre-empt some powers granted to county supervisors of elections in favor of concentrating greater power in the hands of the Secretary of State .
UPDATE 2 : An important note : Four counties in Florida are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act : Collier , Hardee , Hendry and Hillsborough .
Insofar as these bills affect every county in Florida , they seem to fall under Section 5 , which requires that any voting change be " pre-cleared " by the DOJ .
See the DOJ 's website .
This would argue that the DOJ has clear grounds for getting involved before these bills could be implemented .
UPDATE 3 : For those interested in contacting Gov. Crist about this issue ( from the comments ) :
Just as a full voice mail box can’t accept new messages , a person preoccupied with too many thoughts can’t accept new ones .
For many people , an excessive workload is anything beyond what they can hold in their immediate memory .
That excess is experienced as stress , causing them to either overreact to all the things they have to do , or in extreme cases , to simply shut down to it all and drop out .
Another popular piece of advice on how to get things done is to limit the number of tasks to do on a given day to two or three , then ignore the rest .
The stress of heavy workloads does n’t come from having too many things to do .
We can all think of infinitely more worthy things to do that we ’re not doing than think of the few things we are doing .
If that was really the source of anxiety , every person on the planet would be in a permanent existential crisis .
On the contrary .
At any given moment , we have one of two choices : we can feel bad about all of the tasks we are n’t doing , or we can feel good about having made the right choice of the one task we are doing .
Workload induced stress comes from two sources : blurred priorities and overtaxed memory .
The first is obvious .
If you ’re unclear that what you ’re doing at the moment is the best use of your time and energy , you ’ll feel anxious about that misuse .
But attributing stress to overtaxed memory rather than too much work seems like a bit of a stretch .
The Limits of Mental RAM
Let ’s first look at the notion that having too much to do creates stress .
Do you get stressed about solving world hunger ?
Probably not .
It ’s clear that feeding the world is beyond your means , so you ’ve taken that project off the table as a legitimate option .
If you really have to much work , you ’ll make an executive decision to delete , delegate or defer the excess — but you do n’t stress out about it .
Stress comes from either explicitly accepting a commitment that you implicitly know is unrealistic , or implicitly accepting a commitment you have n’t made explicit .
Thinking , “ I should set up that Roth IRA ” is an implicit commitment that will eddy in the psyche indefinitely until the loop is closed with a specific next action that can be viewed objectively and retrieved conveniently .
If you ’re near a phone and you have a list of calls you have to make , and one of them is “ Bank Customer Service : request Roth IRA , ” it ’s far easier to manifest that intention .
The first step to relieving stress is to capture everything that has your attention .
That goes beyond just making a short list of the loudest or most recent claims on your attention ; it means everything — big or small , important or unimportant .
Most people resist going that far , then in stopping short of everything , they end up with a large but incomplete list that makes them more stressed than an absolutely total inventory of everything that ’s on their mind would .
Having everything out in front of you , and knowing that it ’s everything creates a sense of relief , even if you have n’t yet made a decision about what to do with anything on the list .
A long list that ’s finite is much less troubling than an incomplete list for the same reason that knowing you have $ 15,000 in debt is less troubling than wondering how much you owe .
Working memory can only hold about seven bits of information , give or take a few depending on your source .
It ’s clear that the mind was n’t designed to manage a large inventory of commitments .
But with tools , we can extend our storage capacity , which is where a system of externalized task management like Getting Things Done ( GTD ) comes in .
Outboard Memory
Think of GTD as a set of shelves for storing your stuff , rather than trying to carry it all in your arms .
If you had to do something with any one thing you were carrying yourself , you would risk dropping the rest of the load .
So you spend all of your energy keeping things close to the vest , hesitating to take action .
Without that shelf space available , you ’ll resist capturing new items , sometimes making premature judgements about whether or not those items are important enough to capture in the first place .
When you give yourself the freedom to capture everything that has your attention , and have a full array of placeholders to shelve it , you give yourself the discretion to evaluate it at a more appropriate time , when you can give it the full , objective attention it requires .
Total capture is n’t enough to keep things off your mind .
You still need to process , organize and review what you collect regularly enough to trust that your outboard memory .
But total capture is the necessary entry point .
Without a good capture protocol , having any systematic approach to task management will seem take more work than it saves , because you ’re working to systems in parallel : one of written notes , and another of mental notes .
The more you try to remember , the less inclined you ’ll be to write things down , and the more you ’ll overtax your working memory .
Barriers to Fluid Capturing
If writing things down when they first occur to us is so important , why do so many of us resist the process ?
A few reasons :
1. Lack of trusted system downstream .
If your processing skills are weak , your brain already knows that whatever you capture will just pile up for nought .
Being efficiently lazy , the brain will preempt the extra work by gradually short circuiting your motivation to write things down .
Likewise , if your habit of regularly looking at your calendar , project and action lists at least weekly loses momentum , the brain will again disengage from the preliminary work of capturing — after all , why create content that wo n’t be reviewed ?
If the problem lies downstream , so does the solution : become diligent about processing , organizing and reviewing what you ’ve captured .
Many people allocate too little time to processing their in - basket on the grounds that it does n’t seem to qualify as “ real ” work .
This is one of the areas where GTD contrasts sharply from traditional time management systems : it explicitly acknowledges defining work as an essential phase of work , over and above doing predefined work .
2. Lack of preestablished capture tools .
The time you need to capture something is not the time to decide what you ’re going to capture it with , or how .
In a moment where two decisions have to be made simultaneously — what to collect and how to collect it — the tendency will be to forgo the need to collect , and hope that whatever ’s important enough will be remembered .
Capture tools needs to be thought through ahead of time , so that they ’re available at a moment ’s notice .
Think through all situations throughout the day where you need to take notes :
When you ’re at you ’re desk
When you ’re in a meeting
When you wake up in the middle of the night with a great idea
When you ’re on your cell phone
Determine your preferred method and medium for dealing with each of these situations .
Would you rather type your notes or jot them down by hand ?
Do you type notes with a specific application or a generic text editor ?
Do you handwrite notes better on large or small pads of paper ?
Where is the most strategic place to put them ?
Do you carry a ubiquitous capture tool like index cards in the back of your pocket , a Moleskine or a Notetaker Wallet .
Five minutes spent on making decisions about how and where you ’ll capture notes will save you from those future split seconds of indecision that make the difference between writing things down and hoping you ’ll remember them .
3 . The seduction of busyness .
The act of capturing something demands hitting a pause button on whatever you were doing .
In effect , it ’s like a moment of instant meditation .
For Type - A workers driven by latest - and - loudest , taking a moment to note something that could possibly be more important than whatever they ’re doing ( though perhaps less urgent ) , is something to be resolutely resisted .
You ’re smarter than that .
You ’d rather be productive than busy .
The three seconds it takes to write something down is far more efficient than the 30 seconds it would take to remember what you did n’t capture , assuming it ’s remembered at all .
As always , the way things get done is one at a time .
4. Excessively formal notetaking .
“ Notetaking ” is probably a misnomer here .
Capturing needs to be agile : a few words or a few bullet points necessary to jog your memory when you process them .
For instance , when I was driving I came up with the idea for this post ; so I grabbed my voice recorder and said “ getting things dumped ” — and nothing else .
I did n’t need to elaborate on the idea , because I knew that I would put the voice recorder in my in - basket later , and figure out the project and next action when I processed the voice note .
Almost all of my voice notes last three to five seconds .
There are times when a lengthier capture process is preferable .
A few minutes spent creating a mind map or an outline might be necessary to get a project off of your mind to an extent that a few words would n’t .
But for general purpose capturing , shorter notes encourage more prolific collection .
5 . Thinking through projects and next actions rather than capturing stuff .
GTD users who get good at processing — looking at a note , deciding whether it ’s actionable , and determining the specific project and action — are often tempted to process any new input right on the spot , essentially replacing capturing with collecting and organizing .
That ’s often more efficient , but it ’s better to develop the skill of jotting raw notes rapidly so that you have the choice of whether to process now or later , depending on what ’s appropriate give the time and attention you have available .
I did n’t realize how much I was n’t capturing until I got a notetaker wallet .
Before that , I spent too much time trying to enter projects and next actions into my organizer instead of just capturing a short representative reminder .
You might , for instance , use a paper planner to manager your tasks .
Assuming you do n’t carry it with you at all times , it might make more sense to write a note like , “ Meeting with Earl 7/12 at 3:00 pm ” on an index card when Earl first proposes it .
Later , when you ’re processing the note from the card into your planner , you have the leisure to determine if there ’s a larger outcome involved that would go on your project list , any task to prepare for the meeting that would go on your next actions list , or any other considerations that might form a checklist .
It ’s generally a good idea to keep capturing and processing as a two - step process , but skip capturing when the project and next action are obvious .

On Wednesday , internet traffic in Sweden dipped by around 40 % percent as the country 's new anti-file sharing measures came into force .
Two days ago , the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) passed in Sweden .
Internet traffic at 4 pm on April 1st was 30 % lower than on the last day of March .
The figures come from Netnod , a company responsible for the operation of internet exchanges in five Swedish cities , while on government statistics showed a 33 % drop .
Sweden 's new policy poses a significant threat to illegal file - sharers .
Two Swedish men have been arrested for sharing copyrighted filee .
The arrests were part of an international operation headed by Europol , and the suspects are alleged to be part of an international network .
The new law based on the European Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) requires that Internet service providers turn over the IP addresses of file sharers to authorities in cases of suspected copyright infringement via a court order .
From the Crateman Crew :
“ The Adelaide Fringe Festival commissioned us to design a float for their opening night parade , based on some of the work we have been doing with milk crates , and in particular the idea of ‘ crateman ’ .
We were reluctant however to simply relocate our street based work into a radically different arena .
Instead we were interested in the idea of a parade as being a cross between performance art , sculpture , and audience participation .
The crate sphere was designed to be rolled down the street as the final act in the parade .
Comprising of 688 milk crates and being over 4.5 meters high , it had an estimated weight of over 700 kilograms .
It was hoped that upon seeing us struggle with the beast , members of the audience would join in , and help us roll the sphere to a glorious end !
Unfortunately the reality was somewhat different .
People in their curiosity came closer and closer to the ball - but were reluctant to get involved and help , or move out of its way when it threatened to crush them .
Our cries of distress were misinterpreted as part of the ‘ theatre ’ of the situation , as we struggled to maintain control .
After completing about a quarter of the parade route , the organizers and the police decided to pull the plug , and ordered us to stop the ball .
It was rolled to the side of the street , and left to sit in a ‘ no parking ’ zone .
Here it sat for a day or so , puzzling passers by , a strange visitor to the quaint streets of Adelaide . ”

The Metropolitan Police faced fresh allegations of brutality last night after it emerged that a man who died at the G20 protests may have been attacked by riot police three times .
Ian Tomlinson was walking home from work when he was hit and pushed over by an officer in an apparently unprovoked attack .
Minutes later the 47 - year - old lay dying on a London street .
Last night , as it was revealed that the police officer concerned had come forward one week after the events , shocking new claims emerged that the violence meted out to Mr Tomlinson was even more severe than first thought .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A video had already emerged showing the newspaper seller being shoved forcefully to the ground by police as he walked with his hands in his pockets .
But a photographer told The Independent that the incident was merely the third of a series of police attacks on Mr Tomlinson , before he died of a heart attack .
Anna Branthwaite said that he had appeared desperate to get away during an earlier " unprovoked " attack in which police lashed at him with a baton .
Last night , the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) announced it was taking over responsibility for a criminal investigation and was still trying to trace other officers involved .
Mr Tomlinson 's family said they were " shocked and sickened " by the video and would not rest until they had answers .
Ms Branthwaite told this newspaper how she witnessed two initial attacks further up the street as Scotland Yard 's riot police swarmed the area .
" The dog handlers [ believed to be City of London Police ] were just starting to sweep the street and form a police line when Ian Tomlinson arrived .
I saw a riot police officer charge him from behind and propel himself forward with his body weight , " she said .
" Mr Tomlinson was on the ground and I saw him [ the policeman ] stand over him with a baton , hitting him twice .
He was completely taken by surprise .
He did n't know what hit him . "
She added that he tried to get to his feet .
" His natural instinct was to get up to run .
The same riot police officer then grabbed him and ran with him for two strides and threw him forward . "
She then lost sight of Mr Tomlinson as she was hauled away by police .
She was adamant that the filmed attack occurred seconds after the ones she witnessed .
" He was not engaging with them [ the police ] .
He was not taunting them .
He was not shouting .
It was completely unprovoked . "
Ms Branthwaite has made a statement to the IPCC , which will now pursue the investigation independently .
The shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling described the revelations as " alarming " and said they left , " big questions to be answered by the police " .
The gravity of the situation facing Scotland Yard was reflected in a statement yesterday by its Commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson : " My thoughts are with Mr Tomlinson 's family at this time .
The images that have now been released raise obvious concerns and it is absolutely right and proper that there is a full investigation into this matter , which the Met will fully support . "

Last night the IPCC revealed that a number of the officers caught up in the incident had yet to come forward .
It is believed that the footage shows City of London Police dog handlers alongside members of the Metropolitan Police Tactical Support Group .
The IPCC also revealed that it had ordered a second post - mortem examination in an effort to determine if there was any external factor behind Mr Tomlinson 's fatal heart attack .
Last night the family issued a statement that thanked the media for , " bringing crucial evidence to light " .
Initially the Metropolitan Police spoke of how officers had on 1 April tried in vain to save Mr Tomlinson 's life , claiming they had even been pelted with missiles , after he collapsed outside the Royal Exchange Building in the City .
Investigators were told that there had been no contact with police before he collapsed .
But the story took on a very different turn when a New York fund manager passed film to The Guardian newspaper , which showed Mr Tomlinson being attacked from behind by an officer in riot gear as he walked away from them with his hands in his pockets .
Deborah Glass , of the IPCC , said the decision to take over the investigation from City of London Police was made after the video came to light .
She said : " People are rightly concerned about this tragic death and this footage is clearly disturbing .
" This is a criminal investigation and we will , of course , be discussing it with the Crown Prosecution Service .
At the moment the investigation is focused on identifying the officers in the footage .
Several have already come forward and all efforts are being made to trace those who have n't . "
The attack highlights concerns about police tactics during the demonstrations , during which 5,000 people gathered in the City to protest as the G20 political leaders prepared to meet .
Mr Tomlinson 's son , Paul King , 26 , said yesterday that the family were distraught .
" It is very important for the sake of the family here and his kids , we just want justice .
" Until everything comes out and we have the right evidence , we can not lay our father to rest . "
On the night he died , the 47 - year - old , known as Tommo to his friends , was on his way to the Lindsey Hotel , where he had lodged since October .
Friends of Mr Tomlinson , a father of nine originally from Matlock , Derbyshire , described him as a man who had lived an itinerant lifestyle .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , called for the IPCC inquiry to be completed " as quickly as possible " .
The Labour MP David Winnick , a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee , said questions will be asked about " misleading " police statements in the hours after Mr Tomlinson 's death .
Police response to Ian Tomlinson 's death
* 1 April – Statement from the Metropolitan Police
A member of the public went to a police officer on a cordon to say that there was a man who had collapsed round the corner .
The officer sent two police medics through the cordon line where they found a man who had stopped breathing .
They called for LAS [ London Ambulance Service ] support about 19.30 .
The officers gave him an initial check and cleared his airway before moving him back behind the cordon line to a clear area where they gave him CPR .
The officers took the decision to move him as during this time a number of missiles – believed to be bottles – were being thrown at them .
LAS took the man to hospital where he was pronounced dead .
* 4 April – Statement from the City of London Police
A post -mortem examination ... found he died of natural causes .
[ He ] suffered a sudden heart attack while on his way home from work .
The family thanked all the people who rushed to Ian 's aid when he collapsed and said how grateful they are for all the efforts made to help .
* 8 April – Statement Sir Paul Stephenson , Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police
My thoughts are with Mr Tomlinson 's family at this time .
The images that have now been released raise obvious concerns and it is absolutely right and proper that there is a full investigation into this matter , which the Met will fully support .
Protesters in Moldova stormed the country 's parliament today , smashing windows and hurling tables and chairs out onto the street , in a violent protest against Sunday 's elections which saw the ruling communists returned to power .
Anti-communist demonstrators poured into the building and heaped whatever they found onto the street .
They set fire to paper , computers , and furniture .
A small group also broke into the president 's office - as police using tear gas and water canons tried to drive them back .
At least 10,000 protesters gathered outside the parliament building in the capital , Chisinau .
The young crowd carried EU , Moldovan and Romanian flags and shouted slogans including : " Down with communism ! " " Freedom ! " and " We want Europe ! "
Others demanded the unification of Moldova and Romania .
Today 's protests came two days after an election commission confirmed that the Communist party under president Vladimir Voronin had comfortably won the elections .
According to official results , the party won about 49.9 per cent .
Opposition leaders in Moldova have dismissed the poll as fraudulent and are demanding a new vote .
" The protests are justified because people did not vote for the communists in such large numbers , " Chisinau 's mayor Dorin Chirtoaca told Realitatea TV .
He added : " The elections were fraudulent , there was multiple voting ...
These are people who do n't know what democracy is . "
" The election was controlled by the communists , they bought everyone off , " Alexei , a student , told Reuters .
" We will have no future under the communists because they just think of themselves . "
At least 30 people were hurt in today 's clashes , which also saw students hijack fire engines and drive them away .
Today 's demonstrations come amid growing tensions inside Moldova , a tiny post -Soviet micro-state wedged between Ukraine and Romania .
Despite some economic progress under the communists who have been in power since 2001 , Moldova remains the poorest country in Europe .
Some 600,000 Moldovans have left to find work in the EU .
The country 's provinces largely support the pro-Russian communists .
But the Chisinau strongly favours the more western - orientated opposition , who want free market polices and closer ties with the EU and Nato .
Today one analyst said the uprising in Moldova was similar to the 2004 pro-western Orange Revolution in next - door Ukraine .
He added , however , that the protests were unjustified since western observers had confirmed the communists as legitimate winners of Sunday 's election , and had certified the poll as fair .
" This is an active attempt by a small minority to take power , " Vladimir Zharikhin , deputy director of the Moscow Institute for the Study of Post - Soviet Countries said .
" The result was in line with exit polls and preliminary studies . "
He added : " The majority of Moldovans do n't see any alternative to the communists .
In reality the communists are not believers in Marxism - Leninism but are right - wing social democrats .
We now have a meeting of forces in Moldova . "
President Vladimir Voronin's office said the president would make a statement later this evening , the Associated Press reported .
It was not clear whether he was inside the presidential office when students burst in , pelting his workplace with eggs , stones and bottles .
Voronin is due to step down this month after serving the legal maximum of two terms in power .
But he has indicated he intends to play an influential role in politics and will take another government job , possibly as parliamentary speaker .
The opposition want him to leave the country .
The only foreign leader to congratulate Moldova after the elections was Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev .
The communists have enjoyed close relations with Russia and say they want to strengthen relations with the European Union .
New CA SoS report confirms findings of ' Humboldt Transparency Project , ' discovers even more egregious failures in widely - used Diebold voting counting system
One of the citizens who designed the software , responsible for the startling discoveries , offers his thoughts ...
Mitch Trachtenberg Byon 3/4/2009 , 1:40 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Mitch Trachtenberg of the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has released a remarkable 13 - page report [ PDF ] of her office 's investigation into how the Diebold / Premier GEMS software silently dropped all votes contained on 197 ballots from the Humboldt County , California , November 2008 general election .
The report shows that this version of GEMS not only deleted a batch of ballots without any request by --- or alert to --- the elections staff , but also failed to note the deletion in the system 's audit log .
The report also points to other startling deficiencies with Diebold / Premier 's software : " Key audit trail logs in GEMS version 1.18.19 do not record important operator interventions such as deletion of decks of ballots , assign inaccurate date and time stamps to events that are recorded , and can be deleted by the operator . "
That 's right .
The Diebold / Premier vote tabulation system in question not only fails to record all events accurately , and sometimes at all , it also allows anyone with access to the system to completely delete audit logs , covering the tracks of any tampering that may have occurred , at any time , on the system .
Any of these flaws , the report concludes , " appears to violate the 1990 Voting System Standards to an extent that would have warranted failure of the GEMS version 1.18.19 system had they been detected and reported by the [ federal ]
Independent Testing Authority [ ITA ] that tested the system . " ...
Discovering Diebold 's Failure ...
I 'm proud to be a member of the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project , the volunteer group that Humboldt County Clerk and Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich invited into her office to conduct an independent scan of all ballots cast .
The project , proposed by Humboldt commercial fisherman Kevin Collins , and founded by Collins and Crnich along with Tom Pinto , a tech staffer at the district attorney 's office , David Cobb , a former Green Party Presidential Candidate , and Parke Bostrom , a concerned citizen .
I was there when we ended up scanning more ballots than were counted in the official results .
I thought we 'd made a mistake ourselves .
I 'd developed an open - source vote counting program called Ballot Browser , and I ran it on our collection of scans the night we finished scanning , to try to hunt down our mistake .
The transparency project had also kept careful logs of our scanning .
With a few exceptions , those logs would also tell us how many ballots we 'd scanned for each precinct .
( The exceptions were a few mixed batches ; most of the ballots were batched by precinct , but not all . )
When I got Ballot Browser 's results and compared them with the official count , precinct by precinct , I was able to quickly point to precinct 1E45 as having 197 more ballots in Ballot Browser 's count than in the official count .
The discovery would lead to corrected , re-certified election results , the CA Secretary of State 's investigation and recent finding , the likely decertification of the Diebold software in question , and --- hopefully --- decertification in the approximately thirty other states which use the same software , or a version with the same bug , to count ballots cast in their elections .
When the apparent mistake in the Ballot Browser 's results orignally came to light , Carolyn Crnich was checking both the official Diebold scanning logs and our independent scanning logs and also narrowed in on precinct 1E45 .
It looked like , somehow , a batch of 197 vote - by - mail ballots from precinct 1E45 had been scanned but then deleted .
The deletion of this batch , not - so - coincidentally the very first deck of vote - by - mail ballots that the elections staff had scanned into its Diebold / Premier equipment , seemed to have taken place after the election night results , but before the official numbers were certified .
It turned out that the problem was not that the Transparency Project had mistakenly double - scanned a batch of ballots , and not that the elections staff had somehow missed a batch of ballots .
The problem was a bug in Diebold 's GEMS software : under fairly common circumstances , the first deck of ballots might be silently deleted , with no notice given to election officials overseeing the computerized tabulation .
Since this news broke last December , some have questioned why normal ballot reconciliation procedures did n't flag the dropped ballots .
The Secretary of State 's report makes this clear [ emphasis in original ] :
was performed on November 1 , the day Deck 0 was tallied , and no discrepancy was found .
GEMS reports generated on Election Day and on November 23 , 2008 , two and a half weeks after the election , continued to accurately reflect the 197 ballots in Deck 0 .
Whether the fact that ballots had been omitted from the tally could or should have been discovered through ballot reconciliation processes that are part of the standard canvass process misses what was at issue in Humboldt County .
No software error affecting the accuracy of election results should ever be excused based on claims that the effects of the error could or should be detected and corrected through adherence to sound election administration procedures .
In this particular case , a reconciliation of the Registrar 's count of vote - by - mail ballots returned by voters with the count reported by GEMSperformed on November 1 , the day Deck 0 was tallied , and no discrepancy was found .
GEMS reports generated on Election Day and on November 23 , 2008 , two and a half weeks after the election , continued to accurately reflect the 197 ballots in Deck 0 .
It was only later , after the GEMS Central Count Server was re-opened and new decks of vote - by - mail ballots that had been received on Election Day were tallied for the first time , that Deck 0 was deleted , without any warning or notification to the elections official , as a result of the software programming flaw .
Because the deletion of the votes from the 197 ballots in Deck 0 occurred long after they were counted and after repeated reports showed them properly accounted for , nothing indicated any need to recheck the earlier reconciliation for a third time .
It would be reasonable to think that the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project had discovered a previously unknown bug in GEMS .
Reasonable , but wrong .
The Secretary of State 's report confirms what The BRAD BLOG reported in one of its follow - ups last December : the error was long known by Diebold .
As the Secretary of State 's report now confirms :
Diebold knew of this serious software error no later than October 2004 .
The company , however , did not notify the Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) , the National Association of State Election Directors ( NASED ) or the California Secretary of State .
Instead , the company sent a vague email to elections officials in the 11 California counties using GEMS version 1.18.19 with the Central Count Server at the time .
( Six other counties used GEMS version 1.18.19 , but did not use it with the Central Count Server . )
The email ... advised the county officials to create and immediately delete an empty Deck 0 before scanning any real ballots , but did not explain why this new procedure was necessary .
The email and attachment did not inform the elections officials that failure to follow these instructions would likely result in deletion of tallied votes by GEMS without any warning or notice to the system operator .
The email and attachment also failed to inform counties that it was a programming flaw in the GEMS software that made the special instructions necessary .
The chief elections official for Humboldt County , Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich , states that she never saw the email or the attached instructions .
The former county elections officer apparently had received the email in 2004 , but left Humboldt County in 2007 to work in another county 's elections office .
That county elections officer did not , according to Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich , pass the information along to her or anyone else in her office .
This helps to explain why the Deck 0 software error manifested itself in the November 2008 election .
Diebold Audit Logs Also Found Useless , Gameable ...
It is stunning enough that the lost ballots flaw , known to Diebold / Premier since 2004 , has been allowed to remain in versions of GEMS still in use .
But there turn out to be more problems , arguably more serious than even dropping ballots , as noted in the SoS report :
A second set of serious problems related to electronic audit logs was discovered during the Secretary of State Office 's investigation of the Deck 0 software programming flaw .
First , GEMS version 1.18.19 fails to record in any log important system events such as the deletion of decks of optical scan ballots after they have been scanned and entered into the GEMS election results database .
Second , it records the wrong entry date and time for certain decks of ballots .
Third , it permits deletion of certain audit logs that contain - or should contain - records that would be essential to reconstruct operator actions during the vote tallying process .
The problems with the audit logs , apparently undetected during the federal certification of GEMS by EAC / NASED , call the entire certification process into question .
I do n't think it 's possible to overstate the importance of 100 % confidence in a voting system 's audit logs .
Without confidence that a voting system is providing what the Federal Election Commission 's 1990 voting system standards call " a concrete , indestructible archival record of all system activity related to the vote tally , " there can simply be no confidence in the reported results of an election .
That a " Clear " button was found in the software , capable of deleting an entire audit log , without even confirmation of the clear required by the system operative , is unimaginable in such a system , not to mention , in strict violation of the voting system standards under which this system had , several times , been certified by the federal so - called Independent Testing Authority ( ITA ) .
When election integrity advocates have criticized touch - screen voting , the touch - screen vendors have pointed to the audit logs , and how any tampering will show up in them .
And yet here is a system , federally certified , where the audit logs are not only undependable , but can be ( and have been ! ) inadvertently deleted by an elections staffer .
Any of the problems that have turned up , according to the Secretary of State 's report , " would warrant a finding by an Independent Testing Authority ( ITA ) of ' Total Failure ' " .
But that never happened despite multiple federal certifications of both this GEMS system , version 1.18.19 , but also " subsequent GEMS versions ( 1.18.20 , 1.18.21 , 1.18.22 and 1.18.23 ) that contain the same software error , " as the report notes .
Although the Secretary of State 's report is written in calm language , it is a bombshell .
In Humboldt County , nearly two hundred citizens were nearly disenfranchised by a four year old bug in a system that had passed federal certification .
Fortunately , Humboldt County still uses paper ballots , so a recount was possible .
Fortunately , Humboldt County Clerk and Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich was willing to stick her neck out and allow a group of volunteers to come in and conduct an independent recount .
Fortunately , once the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project turned up a four year old bug in GEMS , California 's Secretary of State Debra Bowen conducted a thorough investigation .
Fortunately , that investigation was able to discover what those who conducted federal certification did not : the lack of integrity of the GEMS audit logs .
Does this mean the system worked , or does it just mean that this time , we lucked out ?
In how many jurisdictions nationwide would the ballots have been recounted , even though no candidate questioned the results ?
In how many jurisdictions nationwide would there even have been paper ballots to recount ?
How many times has the system not worked ?
If the audit logs are n't rock solid , how can we ever know ?
Our votes are too important to be counted by secret software running on black box machines .

More than a dozen Wall Street trading firms systematically cheated their customers of millions of dollars by improperly slicing bits of profit from countless trades , federal regulators said on Wednesday .
The Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the allegations after negotiating settlements .
The firms did not admit or deny the charges but agreed to pay a total of more than $ 69 million in forfeited profits and penalties .
The 14 firms named in the complaints are all “ specialists , ” trading firms that have a specific duty to maintain orderly markets by matching buyers and sellers and standing ready to conduct trades when buyers or sellers are scarce .
They include units or subsidiaries of well - known Wall Street names , including E*Trade Capital Markets , Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing , Knight Financial Products and TD Options .
Regulators said the firms had engaged in various types of “ front - running , ” which involves trading ahead of customer orders or timing their own trades to seize profits .
For instance , specialists that had a big order to buy a stock would first buy it from a seller themselves and then illegally bid up the price moments before selling it to profit on the transaction .

Y’all might think I ’m really crazy for even thinking this , but you know how last week I mentioned that we were looking into moving into a different place ?
And how I was n’t sure about getting a starter house or a ‘ one - and - done ’ ?
Well , after running some numbers and scouting around our favorite part of Pittsburgh , we are now considering buying a house this year .
What .
In . The. World . ?!
The $ 8,000 tax credit has a big role in spurring this idea .
Since the government is handing out this money , it really might be to our advantage to taking it .
We would be in a house much sooner and be better off in our finances that much sooner .
Also , mortgage interest rates are extremely low right now .
We have excellent credit scores and we expect to qualify for a low interest rate .
It ’s looking like we’d be able to get a pretty decent house in a nice area for $ 80,000 .
There are a variety of houses for sale in the $ 60 k to $ 100 k range .
Property taxes and wage taxes are pretty high ( I think ) .
We ’re talking millage rates of 29 to 40 depending on the area .
That ’s $ 2,900 to $ 4,000 per year on a house assessed at $ 100k !
In our current municipality , we ’re paying a 1 % gross wage tax for the local schools .
In the places we ’re looking , it would be 1 to 3 % .
Spendy spendy .
The house would probably be ok as a 10 - 15 year house if we wanted it to be , but we might treat it as a starter house and live there for 3 - 5 .
So yeah , I dunno if we ’ll do it or not , but financially it could be a great thing for us .
Our next step is to meet with a lender to get an idea of what they ’d approve us for and to get a handle on what to expect from closing costs and upfront fees .
I ’m crunching numbers on things like a mortgage , property taxes , homeowners insurance , PMI ( I do n’t think we can swing a 20 % down payment without tapping all of our savings and I do n’t want to do that … but maybe we can avoid PMI in other ways ) , water / sewer , gas / electric , trash , maintenance , and all other new - to - us costs .
We would n’t want our total housing costs to be all that much more than we ’re paying now .
We ’d like to have plenty of wiggle room for saving money at the end of the month , you know ?
We ’ll just have to see where this road takes us .
At the very least , I do think we ’ll be moving to our new desired area this year , whether that ’s to rent or to buy , we have n’t yet decided .
Any other renters thinking about buying a house this year ?
As every self - respecting poker degenerate knows , there are 1,326 unique starting hands in the Texas Hold 'em universe .
When you peek at your hole cards at the beginning of a hand , all of the 1,326 combinations are equally likely .
Your chances of seeing [ AhAs ] are exactly the same as seeing [ 7d2c ] .
That is , the 1,326 starting hands are isometric with regard to probability : each has the same chance of occurring .
So when you stare down at the opaque patterned backing of your hole cards prior to peeking at their undersides , you 're not looking at a specific hand .
You 're looking at a probability cloud containing 1,326 possibilities , one of which will manifest when your hole cards are formally observed .
Prior to observation , a given player 's hand is n't a hand ; it 's a probability cloud containing N distinct possibilities .
We call this probability cloud a hand distribution or a hand range and far from being a recondite mathematical theory of interest only to statisticians and poker geeks , it 's one of the most powerful weapons we have in the battle against incomplete information .
Good players use this weapon all the time , consciously or unconsciously .
Every time a player deduces a piece of information , however vague , about an opponent 's hand , he 's creating a hand distribution .
My opponent has either Aces , Kings , Queens , or Ace - King .
Not sure which .
He 's strong , though .
My opponent has two cards ( any two cards ) of a particular suit , for the flush .
Or he might be bluffing the flush .
My opponent either has a set or an overpair .
My opponent has top pair with a good kicker .
Each of the above statements can be expressed precisely by assigning the opponent a distribution containing or more potential specific hands .
For example , if the preflop action convinces you that your opponent has Aces , Kings , Queens , or Ace - King , you 've assigned him a distribution — a probability cloud — containing 34 distinct possibilities , each of which is a specific two - card starting hand .
A distribution can be as small or as large as necessary to countenance all the possibilities .
If you know an opponent 's specific hole cards ( perhaps you caught a glimpse of them ) , that opponent has a hand distribution containing a single hand .
The probability of him having that hand is 1.0 or 100 % .
This is a truism , but a necessary one in order to normalize the underlying logic .
Everything is a distribution .
If everybody folds to you on the button and you 're considering whether to raise , the small blind and the big blind ( since their cards are completely unknown ) have a random distribution containing every possible 2 - card holding .
After you raise , of course , and the small blind re-raises , you 'll have to revise his distribution to take into account the new information .
But you 're always working in terms of distributions .
Every player 's hand at the table can and should be thought of as a distribution containing one or more hands .
Distributions have enormous utility because pinpointing an opponent 's exact hole cards is difficult .
Even when we 're 95 % certain our opponent has a given hand , there 's always that pesky 5 % chance he 's splashing around with something else .
And usually we wo n't be 95 % certain ; we 'll be 75 % certain , or 50 % certain , or an unqualifiable amount of certain .
And this is where one of the most common and egregious mistakes in poker is made , namely :
Playing in such a way as to maximize your value against the specific hand you believe your opponent has .
The thought process goes something like this :
Okay , I 'm pretty sure my opponent has such - and - such a hand here .
Yes .
He raised preflop , I bet into him on the flop , now he 's raising ... yep , he 's got such - and - such .
I might be wrong here , but I 'm gonna go with my read .
I 'm all - in / I fold / etc .
There 's nothing wrong with making a read and sticking to it ; the problem is that the above train of thought is usually indicative of a read that is too specific — far more specific than the available information warrants .
When we put all our eggs into one basket by making a very precise , possibly incorrect deduction about an opponent 's cards , and when we base our betting decisions on that deduction , we front - load the difficulty of poker onto our ( flawed ) ability to extract ( incomplete ) information from a ( loosely - wired ) poker situation .
In other words , we fall into the trap of deterministic strategy .
We play as if our opponent had a specific hand .
But until we actually observe an opponent 's hand for ourselves , it 's not a hand , it 's a probablistic distribution of potential hands .
Sometimes this distribution will coalesce , based on the available evidence , and we 'll be able to say with confidence that the opponent is holding such - and - such a specific hand .
But more often the distribution will contain a handful of possibilities .
Our job is to play in such a way as to maximize our EV not against the single most - likely hand , but against the range of plausible hands an opponent could hold .
And in order to maximize our EV in situations involving multiple opponents with hand distributions , we have to know how to calculate our EV in situations involving multiple opponents with hand distributions , using available tools such as PokerStove and , of course , by writing code in our language of choice .
Stay tuned .
Hackers : the China Syndrome

The appalling story of what happened to headteacher Erica Connor ( Life , 6 April ) when a small , unrepresentative group of Muslim activists tried to Islamicise her state primary school , will surely strike a chord with many teachers , parents and governors of schools with a high percentage of Muslim pupils .
It accords with my experience when I was a school governor .
Issues raised by extremists may include girls ' dress , mixed swimming lessons , segregation of the sexes at parents ' evenings , celebration of non-Islamic religions , particularly Hinduism , and special provisions for prayer and for children to rest during Ramadan .
Astonishingly , as the case of Ms Connor highlights , local education authority policies tend to support the Islamicisation process , rather than resisting it on the grounds of common sense , humanity and reason .
This is certainly the case with Ramadan , where the local authority – which is the child protection agency – may actually collude with dawn - to - dusk starvation of sometimes very young children .
It is very difficult for teachers , governors or anyone else to challenge the less acceptable face of Islam without inviting accusations of " Islamophobia " , a " you are a bad person " term that is being deployed to silence the slightest criticism of Islamic practices .

There are things the west can usefully learn from Islam – desisting from alcohol , giving to charity and respecting elders are three examples that spring to mind .
But some practices – not necessarily supported by the majority of Muslims – raise great concern , and this includes much of what is done to women and children in Islam 's name .

Fate of a passer - by at hands of police
The video evidence clearly shows that Ian Tomlinson was assaulted by a police officer .
It also shows that other officers witnessed the assault .
Why did those officers not arrest their colleague , as they would undoubtedly have done if they had witnessed a similar assault being committed by anyone other than a police officer ?
Clearly the officers do not believe that the law against assault applies to the police themselves .
No wonder the police want to make it illegal to take photographs of them .

I am a previously law - abiding citizen .
One day , I am irritated by the police officer walking slowly in front of me .
I shove him in the back with as much force as I can muster .
He falls heavily to the ground , but gets up and walks away , only to suffer a fatal heart attack a few minutes later .
Will the Crown Prosecution Service charge me with ( a ) murder ( b ) manslaughter ( c ) assault or ( d ) nothing .
I hope to discover the answer soon .

Section 76 of the Counter Terrorism
Act , which became law in February , allows for the arrest , and possible imprisonment , of anyone who takes pictures of police officers " likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism " .
Now that important film has emerged of a police officer assaulting a man prior to his tragic death at last week 's G20 protest , will this sinister law be reviewed ?

There have been well documented instances of police officers confiscating phone cameras from passers - by who have videoed incidents in the street , and deleting the footage .
In view of the new light members of the public with video and photographic evidence have put on the events that may have led up to the unfortunate death of Ian Tomlinson , it is imperative that this insidious police practice be made a serious criminal offence .
How many people that day were subject to harassment for photographing police misbehaviour and aggression ?
Andrew Calvert
Ruislip , Middlesex
It is Vaughan Thomas ( letter , 8 April ) , not Kristin Scott ( 6 April ) , who is naive about how the police saw their job at the G20 demonstration .
Far from containing any potential violence , the inflammatory comments from senior policemen before the event made it crystal clear that they were out to talk up and foment violence .
When violence came , possibly resulting in the tragic death of Ian Tomlinson , it was at the hands of a policeman pushing to the ground someone who was not even a protester but just wanted to go home .
Protest letters alone will not be sufficient to ensure a democratically controlled and accountable police force which neither makes unprovoked attacks on members of the public , nor seeks to disguise its unprofessional conduct through blatant mendacity .

I watched the video of Mr Tomlinson with resignation .
It shows clearly why the police need to be filmed constantly for their own good .
No doubt a rush of blood to the head will eventually cost a young officer his job , while his superiors rush for cover or point fingers .
Yet it was clear from their own briefings last week , that senior police officers were intending heavy - handedness at these demonstrations and their hapless junior colleague duly delivered .
The perpetrator of the push deserves to be disciplined , but not to lose his job .
His superiors deserve converse treatment .

I expect the IPCC inquiry into the death of the unfortunate newspaper seller will founder on the rock of an " inability " to identify the police officer concerned , as have other inquiries in the past .
Since police uniforms no longer include the old - fashioned tunic , perhaps the problem of identifying officers could be solved by emblazoning large football shirt style numbers on their outer clothing , rather than the minuscule digits on their shoulders .
Then CCTV ( or passers - by with a mobile phone ) could easily capture the information , and " those who are innocent " really might " have nothing to fear " .
I read in regard to another demostration recently that when protesters were advised to note the numbers of police officers who might be aggressive , the police present immediately covered their numbers , which indicates a certain view of the policing of demonstrations
D J Walker

It is inevitable and desirable that changes are made following the death of Ian Tomlinson .
No , do n't tell me , let me guess .
The police will investigate the matter themselves and decide there is no case to answer .
The officer involved will be retired on full pay to allow him to recover from the trauma of hitting a member of the public .
And civilians with cameras will be banned from demonstrations because they are a threat to national security .

Bad time to boost private pensions
This is probably the worst time in history for Jeremy Warner ( 8 April ) to be giving lectures about the need to consign public sector pensioners to the vagaries of the market .
Millions of prospective private - sector pensioners have found their anticipated pensions wiped out by the fall in the stock market .
Poor pensioners mean more liability for the taxpayer to shore up pensioners ' living standards .
Warner is proposing the transfer of public pension liabilities to public income support of pensioners .
Public - sector workers have always regarded the employer contribution to pensions as deferred pay .
Most are low paid .
Their pensions therefore reward them for their often selfless dedication in serving the public .
To hold up private sector pension providers , many of whom took extended pension holidays in good times only to abandon their commitments in bad times , as exemplars for those employers who continue to provide their employees with living pensions is grotesque .

Visa policy hits goodwill visits
Mary Dejevsky 's article " First impressions matter – that goes for visa offices too " and your correspondent Jan Hepburn ( letter , 7 April ) draw attention to the increasing difficulty people are facing in getting visas to enter the UK , and the attitude of staff in the visa offices .
My organisation encourages partnerships for mutual learning , understanding and benefit between towns , schools , hospitals , local authorities and other community - based organisations here in UK with counterparts in Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean in particular .
Our work is increasingly in jeopardy because of the difficulties our partners are facing getting into United Kingdom to share their lives , their faiths , their skills and their cultures with young people in our schools and with us in our homes and communities .
A major issue is the cost for many people in rural Africa having to travel at considerable expense to present themselves in person at the British High Commission in the capital city many miles away , only to be told later that their application has been rejected with no reason given .
We need an urgent , open debate with government to address the problem and , as Mary Dejevsky says , the appalling first impression that many people gain from their experiences at UK visa offices around the world .

The power of negative thinking
I read the entire article " Think yourself better " ( 7 April ) and was disappointed to find that absolutely no practical advice regarding actual ways to think positive were offered .
The article forged ahead with blithe declarations that thinking positively would improve almost every aspect of my life and so I hoped for a few pointers .
This was not to be .
As a fully paid up member of Curmugeons Anonymous I wondered how I might cheer myself up a bit and achieve an irritatingly chirpy persona that would enable me to live to a healthy , ripe old age .
After a quick flick through The Independent 's articles concerning world finances , corruption , doom and gloom , I wondered if my first step might be to cancel my order for your newspaper and switch to The Beano !

Not our beach
The picture with your story about litter - strewn beaches ( 8 April ) was not taken " between Brighton and Hove " as captioned .
Our guess is that it was taken some miles west , near an industrial estate at Shoreham docks .
And the photographer tells us it was taken in 2005 .
Brighton has a first - class blue - flag bathing beach that would not get the award if routinely strewn with litter .

Jade was no Diana
Janet Street - Porter ( 8 April ) quotes with approval pompous Parky 's comment on Jade Goody 's death : " It 's not the passing of a martyr or a saint , or , God help us , Princess Di . "
That 's true enough .
If Jade Goody had left her kids in England while living it up around Europe with her boyfriend , and had died in a car driven by a drunk , having not bothered to fasten her seat belt , I suspect that there would be little public sympathy for her .

International saint
Terence Blacker has a point ( Comment , 7 April ) , and we English are far too modest ( which is to say smug ) to have an England day .
But we do not have to treat St George himself as an embarrassment .
He is an international saint , whom we share with Catalonia , Ethiopia , and much of Eastern Europe .
He is much venerated by both Christians and Muslims in Palestine .
His intercessions are sought by both religious groups .
His patronage remains one of the few international connections we have not based on the former Empire .

Generous wrappings
Your correspondents comment on supermarkets charging for wrapping paper .
Back in the Netherlands , I was always asked in department stores if the item I bought " was a present " , in which case it would be wrapped in some fancy coloured paper .
A cheerful ribbon was then added automatically .
Many shops would have a separate wrapping - table where , after the purchase , you could wrap things yourself in freely available paper .

Name of a fish
Having read your article ( 6 April ) covering Sainsbury 's plan to rename the pollock because of the embarrassment to customers , I am now considering changing my name to save me future embarrassment .
Perhaps the Sainsbury 's " let 's have a silly idea " department could come up with some suggestions .

Michael Musto columnist for the Village Voice has come out with a bi-phobic , anti-scientific column titled Ever Meet a Real Bisexual ?
questioning the legitimacy of bisexuality .
" Everyone always says they 're bisexual , blabbing on and on about how " sexuality is fluid , and I do n't really like labels " -- but usually I find these are just gay men who are afraid to come out .
I know there are real bisexuals out there -- mainly because I 've heard that there are -- and I do think it 's a lovely idea to actually crave sex with people regardless of gender .
I 'm just wondering how real a phenomenon this is , as opposed to a smoke - and - mirrors coverup designed to keep antsy gays in the closet .
Most of the guys I know who say they 're bisexual end up doing Bette Davis impersonations after a few drinks , and when you invite them to an all - girl bar , they get excited , thinking you mean Splash .
But do you know anyone who REALLY is equally attracted to both men and women and effortlessly glides between those two dating pools without a second 's thought or self - consciousness ?
If so , do you ever suspect they 're full of shit ? "
Suggesting bisexuality is a phenomenon , or that bisexual men are closeted liars is offensive and outright wrong !
Contact Michael Musto and tell him biphobia has no place in the Village Voice .
The ship set sail from the Lebanese port of Tripoli Israel has expelled activists and journalists on a Lebanese ship carrying aid for Gaza , who were held on Thursday after Israel 's navy seized the ship .
Israeli forces beat and kicked some of those on board , said an al - Jazeera reporter on the ship , although Israel said no " acts of violence " occurred .
Israel also denied claims its gunboats had fired on the ship , the latest to try to break the blockade on Gaza .
Israel allowed blood products from the vessel to enter Gaza by road on Friday .
The Israeli military said no weapons had been found on the ship .
Earlier it had said the ship could be a security threat or be used for smuggling banned equipment .
Fifteen people - Syrian and Lebanese nationals - had been transferred to Lebanon and Syria , police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told the Associated Press news agency .
Another three , two Indians and one Briton , were in police custody pending deportation , he said .
The former Greek - Catholic archbishop of Jerusalem , 84 - year - old Monsignor Hilarion Capucci , was among those sent to Syria , reports said .
The former archbishop had served time in an Israeli jail in the 1970s for smuggling arms for the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
" The Israeli army confiscated all our videotapes ; we were separated from each other , we were blindfolded and handcuffed , " al - Jazeera reporter Salam Khader said on the Arab satellite television channel .
" They beat some of us ... the soldiers kicked Dr Hani Suleiman [ one of the co-ordinators of the ship 's mission ] , in the chest and back . "
" During the takeover of the ship , no acts of violence occurred and there was no need to use excessive force , " the Israeli military said in a statement .
Activists aboard Activists said the Togo - flagged Tali ship was carrying medical supplies , food , clothing and toys .
Under an Israeli - imposed blockade , only basic humanitarian items - mainly food and medicines - are allowed into the territory .
The flow of goods into Gaza has increased since the recent Israeli military campaign there , but aid agencies say more goods and a wider range of supplies are essential for the strip 's recovery .
An organiser of the shipment , Maen Bashur , said the ship had been confronted by an Israeli military boat 32 km ( 19 miles ) off the Gazan coast late on Wednesday .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said the Israeli navy had requested the ship head towards Egypt , and only boarded it after it headed back towards Gaza .
Israel pulled troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005 , but still controls the strips border crossings , airspace and coastal waters .
It initially allowed a number of similar ships to dock , but more recently has begun turning them back .
This was the first time Israeli troops had boarded a vessel seeking to reach Gaza .
Israel ended a three week military campaign in Gaza on 18 January .
About 1,300 Gazans were killed , about a third of them civilians .
During the fighting , 13 Israelis were killed , 10 of them soldiers .

Kevin Rudd's arrival in China on his first posting as a junior diplomat was very different .
" China in the mid-1980s was not easy , " he told the Herald when he was the shadow minister for foreign affairs .
" We had a ground - floor apartment .
It was invaded by rats from the piles of garbage outside .
So I had to sit on the edge of the bed with a club waiting for the rats to come out .
Therese sensibly took our baby daughter to an eighth - floor apartment till the problem was fixed .
So we liked China , but it was tinged with a basic realism . "
Rudd soon knew a great deal about China , and he knew what he did n't like .
Knowing China does not necessarily mean to love it .
Rudd's China expertise proved to be a political asset for Labor at the 2007 election .
In fact , Rudd 's Mandarin moment ranked with his drunken outing to a New York strip club in winning favour with the Australian public .
The first poll taken after the news broke in August 2007 of Rudd 's celebrated visit to Scores was a Newspoll that found his approval rating had jumped by a solid 6 percentage points to 66 per cent .
The next month he opened his mouth at a Sydney lunch feting China 's President Hu Jintao and fluent Mandarin Chinese flowed out .
Australians watching the TV news were impressed .
The first poll taken after this was a Nielsen sampling that discovered a bounce of 8 percentage points in Rudd 's approval rating to 67 per cent .
" While we should always be cautious about attributing movements to a single event , Kevin Rudd 's speaking in Mandarin at APEC also seems to have been a big hit with voters , " the Nielsen poll director , John Stirton , remarked at the time .
These two events - an unorthodox double whammy of lechery and linguistics - took Rudd 's popularity to a level without precedent for an Opposition leader in the 35 years of the Nielsen poll .
So how is that , today , Rudd is behaving as if his Sino skills are an embarrassment ?
And how could his timing be so bad , exactly as China emerges as an indispensable world power and Australia faces a test with the biggest foreign investment proposal China has ever made ?
Howard , after a searing first - year fiasco with China over Taiwan , recovered to conduct a strong relationship with China for the rest of his prime ministership .
Howard 's formula was simple : concentrate on trade .
Everything else - the sensitive issues of Taiwan , Tibet , defence , human rights , democracy , Falun Gong - was shut out .
The result ?
A trouble - free relationship and $ 25 billion worth of LNG contracts for Australia .
Rudd , by contrast , has arrived in a Manchu muddle .
Four events came together in the past week .
Rudd conducted in secrecy a meeting with Li Changchun , the Chinese Politbureau member responsible for propaganda , while the Chinese publicised it .
The Chinese Communist Party was conducting itself with greater transparency than was the Australian Prime Minister .
Then Rudd's Defence Minister , Joel Fitzgibbon , was alleged to be under covert and illegal investigation by his own department because of suspicions that he was too closely aligned with a Chinese - born Australian businesswoman , Helen Liu .
More damaging was the hurt Fitzgibbon inflicted on himself .
In breach of the ministerial code of conduct , he had failed to disclose that Ms Liu paid for him to travel to China three times .
The Opposition 's Joe Hockey tried to cast this as part of a sinister pattern of behaviour - Rudd and several of his ministers had accepted free trips to China over the years .
Then Rudd in London tried to avoid appearing on a TV set sitting next to Beijing 's ambassador to London , Madam Fu Yi , even though he'd known her for a decade .
Rudd asked instead to sit next to a white man , Britain 's Foreign Secretary , David Miliband .
It was " fear on the couch " , according to China analyst Professor David Goodman , of Sydney University .
It just so happened that Rudd in London , continuing a policy that had been pursued by Howard , was lobbying other countries to allow China more voting power in the International Monetary Fund .
Malcolm Turnbull had had a very bad week .
For the first time , one of the major opinion polls , the Nielsen , found he had entered the political twilight zone where more respondents disapproved of him than approved .
Turnbull attacked : he seemed to spend most of his time talking about China .
" Now he 's not a roving ambassador for the People 's Republic of China .
He 's the Prime Minister of Australia and he has to put our national interest first . "
Labor 's Lindsay Tanner accused the Opposition of racist yellow peril fearmongering .
Goodman rated Turnbull 's attack effective because of " a beat - up by Coalition - leaning journalists " , and Rudd 's fearfulness stoked by " the fact that there 's still a quiet racism , especially in the Labor Party " .
But a foreign policy expert and Rudd confidante , Griffith University 's Professor Michael Wesley , holds the PM responsible : " They might look like unfortunate coincidences but my view is that accidents tend to happen to people who are n't prepared for them .
If you have a clear statement of policy and clear sense of where you 're going then you can survive these things .
" But Rudd has been so spooked by the Manchurian candidate syndrome in Australia that he has purposely been uncreative in setting out a China policy , " Wesley said .
" If there was anything Howard did well in foreign policy it was that he stated his general policies very clearly and he stuck to them .
What strikes me about Rudd 's policy is there is n't one .
He makes it on the run .
I think he has to make a major statement on China and the region , founded on a very clear analysis of where China is now and where it is going . "
And where is that exactly ?
Kurt Campbell , about to be appointed leading official on East Asia in the Obama Administration 's State Department , wrote in a co-authored paper published by the Centre for a New American Security in June last year : " China 's ascent has arguably been one of the most rapid and consequential in history , in many ways rivalling or even surpassing the significance of America 's rise in stature during the first two decades of the last century . "
Since those words , China 's power has become more obvious .
As the vulnerability of the world 's biggest debtor , the US , has been exposed by the financial crisis , China 's strength as the world 's biggest creditor has emerged starkly .
And , strikingly , China has not hesitated to assert it .
Beijing has developed a strident new activism in investment strategy and diplomacy .
In 1989 , China 's great moderniser , Deng Xiaoping , issued a slogan to guide his country 's conduct in the world : " China should bide its time and hide its strength , and do what it can . "
There 's no hiding strength today .
With the unfolding financial crisis , China has displayed anger and impatience with the US ; it has blamed and threatened the US ; and it has actively advanced alternatives to the US - centric world economic system .
" China is adopting a more assertive foreign policy commensurate with its increasing power , " says Anne- Marie Brady , a China expert at Canterbury University , New Zealand .
" It 's flexing its muscles , and it has muscles to flex . "
Note this : Washington has met every Chinese demand made of the US in this crisis .
The next big test for China 's foreign investment policy will be Australia .
Specifically , it will be the application by China 's state - owned Chinalco to take its holding in Rio Tinto to 18 per cent , with bigger stakes in some prize Rio assets .
The Federal Government , particularly Treasurer Wayne Swan , is considering the application .
Valued at $ US19.5 billion ( $ 27.3 billion ) , the bid is the biggest single foreign direct investment proposal China has mounted .
The former treasurer Peter Costello this week gave the Herald six reasons why Swan needs to consider the Chinalco bid " extremely carefully " .
Costello was the first treasurer to block a foreign takeover under the current foreign investment laws when he denied Shell permission to take control of the giant North West Shelf gas producer Woodside .
" Rio 's assets in Australia are a huge strategic resource for Australia , " said Costello .
" In strategic terms , they are more important than North West Shelf gas .
We have plenty of gas deposits and some of the biggest ones have not even come into production yet .
" But I do n't think many more iron ore deposits on this scale will be opening up . "
The Federal Government needed to measure six factors , Costello said : " One , the strategic nature of the resource .
Two , the market is down .
Three , the Australian dollar is weak .
Four , the seller is in a position of financial exposure . "
In other words , Rio is a distressed seller .
" Five , the buyer is a state - owned enterprise .
Six , the buyer is a state - owned enterprise which will actually be a user of the resource " , raising potential conflicts of interest between its role as a customer of the company seeking cheap products and a shareholder seeking maximum return .
Costello has no illusions about China 's future value to Australia .
" China is extremely important .
It 's an emerging global superpower . "
However , " China is entitled to and will pursue its national interest , just as Australia is entitled to pursue its national interest " .
On the other hand , Australia is a country which , since Federation , has run a current account deficit .
It relies on foreigners to finance the deficit which last year was $ 50 billion , the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP .
As a small , successful , capital - importing , trading economy , it is strongly in Australia 's interests to operate an open and rules - based system of trade and investment .
Complicating the Chinalco decision is that Swan last week blocked a smaller Chinese takeover bid - the Minmetals offer for OZ Minerals .
The explanation ?
One of the Australian company 's mines was near a sensitive defence site , the Woomera weapons testing range .
" Blocking this transaction will have significant consequences , " says Stephen Joske , a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit and former Australian Treasury representative in Beijing .
" It will add a risk premium to investments , devalue Australian resources assets and raise the risk that China becomes less enthusiastic about the rules and processes of globalisation . "
Canterbury University 's Anne-Marie Brady , whose work has included groundbreaking exposures of the Chinese Communist Party 's detailed internal systems for managing foreigners , says of the Chinalco bid : " I think there has to be some caution .
For example , in last year 's milk poisoning case , which affected 290,000 Chinese kids , one of the reasons the milk company did n't release any information was that it was under party discipline .
It was a former state - owned corporation and they were under instructions not to release any negative news in the lead - up to the Olympics .
" It 's always a problem - it's a party - state economy . "
Loading China will continue to build impressive skylines in the future , and it will always have rats .
Deft statesmanship for foreign governments lies in the art of knowing China 's negatives and its positives , and navigating adroitly between them .

Plenty of drivers chafe at criticism from their backseat counterparts -- but Phoenix bus driver Michael Berry took his annoyance to a whole new level .
Berry , a driver with Valley Metro , responded to complaints from a 28 - year - old passenger last April by allegedly attacking him with his fists .
Witnesses told police that Berry slammed the bus into park , then punched the young man in the face .
When the man fell to the floor , witnesses say , Berry continued to pummel him .
The man , Richard Hicks , allegedly suffered a broken nose , a concussion , and " permanent disfigurement of his nose , " according to a lawsuit filed last week in Maricopa County Superior Court .
Hicks ' attorney , Ursula Gordwin , said that to the best of her knowledge , the bus driver has n't been prosecuted -- even though her client wanted to press charges .
The police report recommends a charge of assault be filed against Berry , but any decision to proceed would rest with the Phoenix City Prosecutor .
New Times could find no record of prosecution .
According to their report , police were called to the scene of a parked bus at 35th Avenue and Baseline at approximately 3 p.m. on April 8 , 2008 .
Berry , the bus driver , told police that Hicks had become angry when Berry drove right past a bus stop with people waiting .
Berry said Hicks called him an " ass " and threw his soda at him -- and that Berry had to punch the griping passenger in the face because he thought he " was going to be attacked , " according to the report .
But Hicks told a different story , one echoed by three of the four eye witnesses interviewed by the police .
He agreed that he 'd questioned Berry after the driver sped past some would - be passengers -- and , yes , he called him an ass .
But Hicks said the drink fell out of his hand when the driver slammed on the brakes , and that Berry began the attack by punching him in the back of the head .
" Hicks fell to the floor after being punched , " according to the police report .
" Berry then got out of his seat , approached Hicks , and began to punch him some more .
While punching Hicks , Berry said , ' You messed with the wrong driver . ' "
As one witness told police , " Berry stood over Hicks while he was on the floor and punched Hicks several times . "
Gordwin says the attack left her client with $ 12,000 in medical bills .
Police attempted to retrieve the bus ' video recording box later that afternoon and was told it had recorded no information , " possibly due to malfunction , " according to the report .
Hmmm .
Gordwin tells New Times that her client has since left Arizona .
He 's not looking for a big pay day , she says .
" We 're just looking for reasonable compensation , " she says .
" Something good enough to make him whole .
I just do n't understand why Risk Management would n't want to settle with me . "
Gordwin says she 's been told that driver Berry no longer works for Valley Metro .
The agency did n't respond to our request for comment by deadline ; we 'll update if we hear from them .

ASUS Eee Top ET1602 Touchscreen Nettop Review
At first glance , ASUS ’ Eee Top ET1602 is the epitome of a niche product .
Packing nettop - spec hardware in an all - in - one form factor , with a touchscreen and general design that seem to have stopped by HP ’s TouchSmart and the Apple iMac along the way , it ’s certainly tough to pin down .
Innovative new segment or just another Eee oddity : SlashGear set to finding out .
In the box , ASUS include a wired keyboard and mouse , stylus and a printed manual , together with recovery DVDs and a microfiber screen cleaning cloth .
Two color versions of the Eee Top are available , white and black , with otherwise identical hardware specs .
First impressions are positive .
Despite the relatively budget price for the Eee Top , ASUS have managed to eke out more than a little style from its plastic casing .
Held upright by a strong , spring - loaded metal leg , the body of the Eee Top is white gloss - finish plastic sitting in a transparent tray .
Stand ( and carry handle ) aside , the nettop is just 4 cm thick ; along the back run gigabit ethernet , four USB 2.0 , power , microphone , line - in and headphone ports , plus a Kensington lock hole .
On the left - hand side there are a further two USB 2.0 ports , plus a multiformat memory card reader .
Underneath the touchscreen there are buttons for brightness and volume on the left , while the power and screen toggle are on the right .
LEDs indicate WiFi and hard - drive activity , and in the bottom bezel there are stereo speakers .
A webcam and microphone are at the top above the screen .
The Eee Top has vents running across the top and in the center on the back .
Using the included peripherals and a WiFi internet connection , you can reduce cabling to just two wires : power and one USB for the keyboard .
The mouse , not entirely necessary if you ’re devoted to the touchscreen , can plug into a USB port on the keyboard ; on the opposite side there ’s a pop - out stylus in a spring - loaded bay .
ASUS ’ keyboard is surprisingly weighty and pleasant to type on .
It follows the same isolated keys as first seen on some Sony laptops , and although lacking a separate numeric keypad the rest of the keys are full - sized .
Several have Fn-triggered secondary features , including volume and music control , backlighting , sleep and WiFi , launching the webcam app , toggling through performance modes ( more on that later ) and changing the Eee Top ’s blue underlighting .
The mouse is less impressive , a lightweight blue LED model with scroll - wheel .
It ’s usable , and the design echoes the white & transparent plastic of the Eee Top ’s build , but nothing special .
As for the stylus , it ’s a basic 14 cm stick of plastic with a tapered nib ; the only thing worth noting is the strength of the bay spring , which is enough to launch the pen across the desk .
Despite looking a whole lot more grown up than any netbook ( and taking up more of your workspace ) , the guts of the Eee Top are in fact on a par with any of the company ’s more recent budget ultraportables .
That means a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 processor , 1GB of RAM and a 160 GB hard - drive .
WiFi is b/g/n , but the graphics still use Intel ’s GMA 950 onboard chipset and there ’s no optical drive .
Of course the primary difference is the 15.6 - inch touchscreen display , running at 1366 x 768 resolution .
The display uses a resistive touchscreen , rather than either a capacitive panel such as on recent Tablet PCs from HP and Dell , or an active digitizer as on most other Tablet PCs .
That means the screen responds to any touch , rather than requiring a finger or a special stylus , but only one point of contact rather than multitouch .
Responsiveness in the Eee Top ’s case is good , with only a light touch required , and it soon becomes second nature to stab at the screen rather than reach for the mouse .
Of course , the usefulness of finger - input depends largely on software , and here the Eee Top is a mixed bag .
ASUS preinstall Windows XP , the Home version rather than the Tablet PC edition , which is not known for its touchscreen - friendliness .
To solve that , you get Easy Mode , a large - icon launcher which runs automatically when you start the PC .
Four tabs – Communication , Fun , Work and Tools – give access to the preloaded apps , including StarSuite for office tasks , Skype for VoIP , and both Internet Explorer and Opera .
There are also a number of ASUS - specific apps , including games , and software for on - screen keyboards , handwriting recognition and other touchscreen - control .
Unfortunately there ’s no apparent way to add new apps to Easy Mode , nor to change which tab each shortcut is in .
Easy
Mode certainly makes loading software straightforward ; however the apps themselves vary in their usefulness with the touchscreen .
As is usually the case , the ASUS - specific titles are most user friendly , with large buttons and straightforward drag & drop usability .
Others , such as the calculator , drop you into XP ’s standard GUI : controls sized for mouse use .
There ’s a sense of ASUS stopping development when Easy Mode was just usable enough : the Eee Memo app , for instance , which lets you drag down virtual Post - It notes and write reminders and messages on them , would make far more sense if the notes were visible all the time .
As it is , leaving a message for someone relies on them starting up the Eee Memo app .
ASUS ’ could also do with making common tasks like screen calibration more straightforward .
There ’s a “ Touch Utility ” listed in the Tools tab , but users will have to guess that “ 9 points linearity ” actually means “ calibrate the screen for your finger ” .
An option underneath that , to test the touch panel , is cryptically labelled “ Please drawing ” .
Motorola ’s SoftStylus is preinstalled , for handwriting recognition and an on - screen keyboard .
The latter works as you ’d expect , with a resizeable , translucent window and shortcut keys for things like www . ; however the handwriting recognition is barely usable .
Only individual letters are recognized at a time , rather than full words , making for a painfully laborious experience .
We ’d much rather have seen XP Tablet Edition , with its surprisingly adept handwriting and voice recognition , though Microsoft licencing issues probably prevented that .
In use , the 1.6GHz Atom processor means the Eee Top is not going to threaten machines with similar form - factors , such as HP ’s TouchSmart or Apple ’s iMac .
Nonetheless , it ’s perfectly capable of sustaining a couple of web browser windows , each with multiple open tabs , without unduly slowing .
The absence of an optical drive means the ASUS is unlikely to be asked to do any serious media lifting ; however it happily played back a 720 p high - definition video from the hard - drive ( anything higher resolution caused stuttering ) .
Screen quality is fair , although the panel tends to look washed out when viewed from the top .
One point of concern was a pixel - width blue line that appeared down the left - hand side of the display after the Eee Top had been switched on for a while , and which only a reboot would dismiss .
It ’s unclear whether this is a graphics problem due to heat build up .
As on their netbooks , ASUS has given the Eee Top three different power modes : super performance , high performance and power saving .
These can be switched between either through the Easy Home interface or by the Fn + Space shortcut .
In practice , there ’s little noticeable difference between the three ; nothing can disguise the fact that the Eee Top is no media editing or 3D gaming machine .
As a media extender though , with a high - speed network connection , it comes into its own ; another of the ASUS apps is Eee Cinema , a media - center style GUI for accessing audio and video .
It ’s here you ’ll most miss an optical drive , as Eee Cinema even has an option to watch DVDs .
Still , sound quality from the built - in speakers is reasonable .
Also preloaded is a webcam app , that lets you record video and take photos using the Eee Top ’s 1.3 - megapixel camera .
Image quality is as mediocre as you might expect from an integrated webcam , but the app has a number of effects and animated overlays to brighten things up .
These range from frames and color - effects , such as sepia , through Batman - style “ Pow ! ” flashes , to being able to draw onto video and images .
In the end , though , we ’re surprisingly impressed by the Eee Top .
The display may be relatively small compared to what many people have on their desktop nowadays , but given you need to be sitting within comfortable prodding distance it ’s less of an issue .
It also makes the Eee Top more portable ; toting it between rooms is no hardship , and the next - generation model , tipped to have an internal battery , should make that even more straightforward .
Even sucking up your mains power , its frugal 27W demands mean the Eee Top is more economical than a standard desktop PC .
Similarly , as long as you ’re not looking for high graphics performance , the Eee Top handles web browsing , office chores and media playback with little complaint .
ASUS , incidentally , are planning a separate ATI Radeon HD 3450 video option in the next - gen machine .
The touchscreen implementation may not be perfect , but it ’s certainly usable and the price is far less than HP would ask for a TouchSmart PC .
For the same cost as the Eee Top you could obviously find a higher - spec standard desktop PC , but the ASUS ’ design charms , touchscreen and general usability still make it a tempting buy .
The ASUS Eee Top ET1602 is available now , priced at around £ 400 in the UK ; the US price is expected to be around $ 450 .

Just because someone does n't love you the way you want them to , does n't mean they do n't love you with all they have .
A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart .
Never frown , even when you are sad , because you never know who is falling in love with your smile .
To the world you may be one person , but to one person you may be the world .
Maybe
God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one , so that when we finally meet the person , we will know how to be grateful .
Do n't cry because it is over ; smile because it happened .
There 's always going to be people that hurt you , so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around .
You can not make someone love you .
All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in .
No matter how hard you try , you can't baptize cats .
When your Mom is mad at your Dad , do n't let her brush your hair .
If your sister hits you , do n't hit her back .
They always catch the second person .
Never ask your 3 year old brother to hold a tomato .
You can't trust dogs to watch your food .
Do n't sneeze when someone is cutting your hair .
Never hold a Dust Buster and a cat at the same time .
You can't hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of milk .
Do n't wear polka dot underwear under white shorts .
The best place to be when you 're sad is Grandma 's lap .
No matter how much I care , some people are just assholes .
It takes years to build up trust , and it only takes suspicion , not proof , to destroy it .
You can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes .
After that , you 'd better have a big weenie or huge boobs .
You should n't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think .
You can keep puking long after you think you 're finished .
We are responsible for what we do , unless we are celebrities .
Regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first , the passion fades , and there had better be a lot of money to take its place .
No matter how you try to protect your children , they will eventually get arrested and end up in the local paper .
The people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away .
Never , under ANY circumstances , take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night .
If you had to identify , in one word , the reason why the human race has not achieved ( and never will achieve ) its full potential , that word would be " meetings " .
There is a very fine line between " hobby " and " mental illness " .
People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them .
And when God , who created the entire universe with all of its glories , decides to deliver a message to humanity , HE WILL NOT use , as His messenger , a person on cable TV in a bad suit , with a bad hairstyle .
You should not confuse your career / job with your life .
No matter what happens , somebody will find a way to take it too seriously .
When trouble arises and things look bad , there is always one individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command .
Very often , that individual is crazy .
Nobody cares if you can't dance well .
Just get up and dance .
Never lick a steak knife .
Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie .
The most powerful force in the universe is gossip .
You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time .
The one thing that unites all human beings , regardless of age , gender , religion , economic status or ethnic background , is that , deep down inside , we ALL believe that we are above average drivers .
The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy people who are not in them .
A person who is nice to you , but rude to the waiter , is not a nice person .
Your family and true friends love you , no matter what .

This project somehow has the distinction of being both the longest and fastest portable electronics project I have ever done .
I originally started making a C64 laptop in the fall of 2006 , and kept pecking away at it every so often .
Finally , a few weeks ago , I said “ screw it ” and started over .
I redid everything in a week and a half – the shortest project ever .
( The previous record hold was the Wii portable at 2 weeks )
The goal this time was to make something that looked exactly like a computer from the early 80’s , yet in a new form .
Including the color beige and texture .
Luckily the blue in the logo matches the blue SD card .
Not to sound like a TLC host or anything , but that sort of stuff is important in design .
Anyway , about the project itself .
This is a fully functional Commodore 64 laptop using actual hardware , specifically the C64C motherboard which was one of the last and smallest revisions .
It uses a Gamecube power supply in place of the original power brick .
For storage there ’s a device called the 1541 - III DTV to “ emulate ” a floppy drive using an SD card .
( Click here for more info )
The SD card is formatted FAT - 32 so you can dump disk images on it using a PC , and read it with the C64 – pretty cool !
For more information , the making - of , pictures and video read the rest of the story below .
I am taking a break for a while because I am pretty tired and burned out from all the portable making this winter and spring .
If you are interested in projects , hit me up in a month or so .
As mentioned before this started with a C64C motherboard .
It ’s smaller than most , but I needed it to be even smaller .
I chopped off the power input / joystick end and also shaved off the cassette port tabs .
I ditched everything about the original case design except the size – I wanted to keep the whole thing at 15 ″ x 10.5 ″ , which is about the smallest it can get with the 15 ″ LCD screen involved .
The keyboard needed some hacking to make this size , specifically the function keys .
I lobbed them off , bypassed the traces and then rewired the keyboard plug so the whole thing was thinner .
I recycled the original connectors so there was one less thing to buy !
The keyboard … with the function part sawed off .
I opted to use the original keyboard because 80 ’s computers had such great keyboards , why ditch ’em ?
A close up of the keyboard and joystick area on the motherboard .
Some kind engineer put via ’s in for all the joystick connections , so even with the joystick ports cut off , it was easy to rewire .
The new function keys are wired directly to the keyboard pins on the motherboard as well .
Time to start the design !
Once again I did everything in Adobe Illustrator because that ’s how I roll .
I started the layout around noon on a Wednesday , with a goal of routing it Friday morning .
Side view of the design .
I used a lot of V - bits to give everything sharp angles and a very 80 ’s feel .
This includes the screen , which is “ recessed ” in the lid to allow room for the raised keys when closed .
This top deep bevel matches up to the bevels around the lower portion when closed .
The case is in 4 parts , 2 for the lid , 2 for the base .
Like the recent Xbox 360 laptops everything is curved , beveled , and slow to rout .
Color revision of the laptop design ( This was probably on a Thursday night just before The Office came on )
This shows me how the unit will look and simulates the shading on all of the surfaces .
I ended up going a darker beige when I painted it because light beige did n’t look quite right .
This consumes more cans of the not - that - cheap Krylon paint at Ace , but it ’s worth it to be right !
Want to check out the design file ?
Click here to download , AI 10 version .
If you want to see how the case was made , check out this story .
This case was done the exact same way .
Keyboard frame with parts inside .
This includes the SD disk drive thing , the sound amp , 2 speakers ( it ’s not stereo but I wanted a “ full ” sound ) , volume slider , LED indicators , function keys and the Nokia LCD screen you can attach to the 1541 - III - DTV for whatever reason .
As usual black plastic screen door material was used to cover the holes .
All of this connects via 1 cable header to the main motherboard so it ’s easy to take the unit apart when testing .
This is in contrast to say my Xbox 360 laptop where there are … let ’s see… 4 different things you have to connect when placing the lid .
Inside view of the base with components .
It ’s actually fairly simple overall , the complexity is in all the small parts and connections .
Like the newer Xbox 360 ’s I lay parts side - by - side instead of on top of each other , it gives me a lot more breathing room with wires and is less of a headache .
As mentioned earlier I used a Gamecube power supply for this project .
It plugs into the back , then goes to a big meaty PC power supply switch .
When switched this sends 12 volts to the LCD , 12 volts to the SID and a switching regulator creates 5 volts for the C64 logic , audio amp and 1541 - III - DTV .
( Note : The 1541 - III - DTV is cool but it really needs a new name .
Or just a shorter one )
Testing the SID chip .
I had a few laying around , needed to know they worked .
They all did , in fact !
The function keys were n’t wired up at this point so I had to stick the circuit board back on and use a screwdriver .
This is my life .
Now the unit is in what I like to call “ open working ” condition .
This is where I test that everything runs , more or less fits together , and that I have n’t once again used too small of a choke in my switching power supply and that it is n’t smoking .
Testing out the 1541 - III - DTV for the first time ( or at least the first time I got it on video )
Finally I install the hinges .
These are some nice friction hinges from McMaster - Carr that I had left over .
I ’m glad I put them to use since they ’re expensive .
Above we can see some spacers being glued to the keyboard frame , and held in place at a 90 degree angle while they dry by my laptop .
Very useful .
Finally the unit is screwed together and away we go !
As with the Xbox 360 , I countersunk all screw holes .
Since this unit is only 2.35 ″ thick I could use shorter ( ahem cheaper ) screws to lash together each half of the case .
There are also 2 completely useless “ decoration screws ” but I ’m not telling where !
Google Earth view of laptop .
The little LCD screen below the keyboard works with the SD card and displays some info .
It ’s not really necessary but was fun to add .
Also , along with the function keys , it fills in some empty space on the inside panel and helps with the symmetry .
Red LED ’s were used for the indicators because I am now officially sick of blue ones .
I thought about red and yellow just to shake things up , but I went for the all one color “ bank of indicators ” look .
This is a cool view of the unit , showing how thick it … is n’t .
Each half is made from .75 ″ and .5 ″ material sandwiched together .
The keyboard is raised from the main surface , which itself has different levels all beveled with a V - bit into each other .
You can also see how the LCD screen is sunk in to allow the keyboard to fit when closed .
Bottom of the unit .
It says “ Made in USA ” twice so nobody forgets .
Yeah !
Oh and yes there ’s a cartridge slot still .
( Is it just me or does the C64 has the stickiest , highest - friction cartridge slot of all time ? )
Front view .
Growing up I was an Atari kid , so I was quite impressed to see the stuff the C64 could pull off .
Arcade ports that were more ambitious than their Genesis counterparts in some ways .
During coats I dabbed the painted surfaces with a sponge to give it more texture .
The vent holes are basically pointless , but it gives me a good place to put the speakers .
I actually did put heatsinks on all the IC ’s inside the unit , not just the SID , for good measure .
Why not ?
Again , there was room , and any weight I could add to the bottom of the unit to balance out the top is a good thing ( because you know aluminum DIP 40 heatsinks are SO heavy )
Unit closed .
I redid a C64 logo from scratch .
Back when I was a graphic artist we always had people bringing in business cards or other crap artwork and wanting it “ blown up to a buildboard ” .
So vectorization of crap is one of my many talents – I even supplied my rebuilt “ Colecovision ” logo to the current IP holders .
The C64 loading a game .
Unlike the MyIDE interface on the Atari , the SD card thing suffers from the limitations of the C64’s IEC interface … oh well !!!
And YES , I know an expansion port disk system exists but for whatever reason we decided years ago that would n’t work for us , and I ’m not going back now !
Closer view of the keyboard .
I really struggled with what color to paint the volume slider , then figured some other parts were gray so why not .
But I only had silver metallic paint !
So , since the economy is “ in the dumpster ” ( thus explaining why there was a line of cars at Sonic yesterday and nowhere to park at the mall ) I did n’t buy a whole new can of paint , just used silver and said “ close enough ! ”
Unit closed , showing the precious friction hinges , video cable to screen and the power plug .
Finally here ’s a video of the main unit being used .
Looking back now , I think this is probably one of , if not my favorite project I have done .
It just looks so beautifully ugly it ’s great , like it came out of a time machine from an alternate reality 80 ’s where this existed .
Before you email , I am aware there was a portable C64 in the 80’s but I think we can agree it was n’t quite like this .
Now I am taking a break .
Building 5 Xbox 360 laptops , this , and some other stuff I ’ve yet to show in a span 4 months has worn me out .
However , next week as a special bonus , I will run a story on the C64 laptop that WASN ’T – a kind of cautionary tale of modding gone wrong .
Stay tuned !
LINK – A great clip with a C64 cameo .
For your own laptop , “ wireless internet broadband ” could be helpful when traveling .
Do n’t count on those disposable masks to completely protect you against the swine flu percolating around the globe .
Many people in Mexico City , as well as travelers to and from Los Angeles , have been seen wearing mouth and nose protection of one type or another in recent days .
Most were wearing face masks , which are loose - fitting and designed largely to help stop droplets from spreading from the person wearing the mask .
They also protect the wearer ’s mouth and nose from splashes .
They are not created to protect the wearer from breathing in very small particles .
Respirators , on the other hand , are made for just that .
They are similar in appearance to the relatively inexpensive face masks but are designed specifically to protect the wearer from breathing in such particles .
These masks , known as N95 for its filtering ability , fit more snugly on the face than face masks so that most air is breathed through the filter material .
They work best if they are fitted specifically to the person wearing the mask .
A respirator that fits snugly on the face can filter out small particles that can be inhaled around the edges of a face mask .
But it ’s easier to breathe through a face mask than a respirator over a long period of time , said experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Federal health officials said Monday that they , quite frankly , did n’t know how helpful either type of devices are in preventing swine flu infection .
If used correctly , masks and -- more likely -- respirators may indeed reduce the risk of getting influenza , according to information released from the CDC .
But for people who live in areas with confirmed cases , there is no single action that will provide complete protection .
It simply is n’t practical to wear a mask all the time , and they are not 100 % foolproof .
Face masks and respirators are most useful for people who are in crowded settings , such as classrooms or airplanes , where they will protect the mouth and nose from germs and reduce the likelihood of coughing or sneezing on other people .
Face masks and respirators are sometimes recommended for people who are in close contact with an infected person .
“ Close contact ” is defined as three feet or less by the World Health Organization and six feet or less by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
Face masks and respirators should be worn once , according to the World Health Organization .
( Look for face masks labeled for surgical , dental , medical procedure , isolation or laser use . )
Health experts note that face masks and respirators should be used along with other precautions , such as frequent hand - washing , covering coughs , staying at home if ill and avoiding crowds .

15 April 2009
US attack helicopters killed six civilians Monday in Afghanistan�s mountainous eastern Kunar province near the Pakistan border .
The attack follows by less than a week a raid by US troops in nearby Khost province that killed five innocent civilians , four of them relatives of an Afghan army officer .
While US military officials claimed that all those killed in Monday�s attack were " enemy fighters " and that the target had been picked based on " multiple intelligence sources , " Afghan officials on the ground told a very different story .
The governor of the Watapor district in Kunar Province , Zalmay Yousfzai , reported that the helicopters demolished one house and inflicted heavy damage on several others .
In addition to the six civilians killed in the raid , another 14 were wounded , four of them seriously , he said .
The district police chief also affirmed that all of those killed and wounded were civilians .
Among the dead were a three - year - old girl and a 10 - year - old boy .
The wounded included a one - year - old .
The Agence France - Presse news agency interviewed two of the wounded at the local hospital , including a 14 - year - old boy who said that four members of his family had died in the US air strike .
" We were asleep , and all of a sudden the roof collapsed , " the boy , who identified himself as Zakirullah , told AFP .
" I don�t remember anything .
I got to know here that my father , my mother , my brother and my younger sister have all been killed , and I am wounded . "
A woman , named Shahida , told the news agency : " We were asleep and heard a strange noise and then the roof and walls collapsed .
The people took me out of the rubble and there are many still there .
I was told nine people from my family were killed and wounded .
I do n't know who is dead , who is wounded and who is alive in my family . "
A spokesman for the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force said that it would investigate the reported civilian casualties .
The spokesman , Capt .
Mark Durkin , added that if there were deaths , the occupation forces would " provide assistance to support the law - abiding people affected . "
Such blood money does little to assuage the popular outrage provoked by the killing of innocent men , women and children by foreign occupiers .
Even President Hamid Karzai , whose corrupt and feeble regime remains in power solely thanks to the US troop presence , has felt compelled to repeatedly condemn such attacks and demand that the occupation force stop killing civilians .
The initial claims that only insurgents were killed , followed by the promise of an investigation is the standard response of the US military .
Just four days earlier , after making virtually identical statements , a spokesman for the US - led occupation was forced to acknowledge that those killed in the April 8 attack on the home of the Afghan officer , Col.
Awal Khan , had not been " enemy fighters . "
Among the dead were Khan�s wife , who was a local school teacher , two children , and his brother .
The wife of the Khan�s cousin , who lived next door , came out of her house during the raid .
The US troops shot the woman , who was nine months pregnant , five times in the abdomen .
" She survived but her child died .
The child was hit by bullets , " Khost province health director Abdul Majeed told AFP .
In a report released in February , the United Nations said that the civilian death toll in Afghanistan had risen to over 2,100 in 2008 , a 40 percent increase over the previous year .
It said that US and NATO troops were responsible for at least 828 of these deaths , the majority of them inflicted by air strikes .
According to data compiled by the Afghan Victims Memorial Project , between 156 and 160 civilians have been killed by the US - led occupation forces since President Barack Obama took office on January 21 .
Of these victims , 56 were children , 15 women , between 41 and 43 men and another 38 to 40 whose age and gender were unknown .
A similar steady escalation of the civilian death toll has been recorded across the border in Pakistan , which the Obama administration is now treating as part of a broader regional theater of war .
According to figures compiled by Pakistani authorities , in the course of 60 missile attacks by pilotless Predator drones carried out since 2006 , 701 people have been killed , 687 of them civilians .
At least 152 people have died in these attacks in the first 99 days of 2009 , according to the Pakistani authorities �only two of them linked to al Qaeda .
The most recent Predator attack was launched on April 8 , just hours after Pakistani military and civilian leaders met with Obama�s envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Michael Mullen and registered a formal protest over the missile strikes .
The killing of both Afghans and Pakistanis is only going to escalate as some 21,000 more US troops are deployed in Afghanistan in the coming weeks , the Pentagon�s top uniformed officer warned Tuesday .
Admiral Mullen told ABC television that the US escalation would mean a surge of violence .
" I look forward to a very active year , " said Mullen .
" I want to be clear that my expectations are as we add more troops , the violence level in Afghanistan is going to go up . "
The military chief said that 17,000 more US combat troops and 4,000 military trainers will soon be deployed in Afghanistan and would ultimately have " the right impact . "
There are already 38,000 US troops in the country .
Washington plans to boost that number to 68,000 by autumn , and the top US commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David McKiernan , has asked for 10,000 more .
Other NATO countries have approximately 32,000 troops in the country .
The US military escalation will serve to intensify resistance to the American occupation on both sides the border , while further destabilizing the government in Pakistan .
After more than seven years of military violence , the US is facing a rapidly disintegrating security and political situation in Afghanistan , where the Taliban , driven out of government by the October 2001 invasion , now controls large swaths of the country .
Across the border in western Pakistan �including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) , the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan , which , like southeastern Afghanistan , are inhabited largely by Pashtuns �the US presence has fueled a growing insurgency that has only been strengthened by popular anger over the drone attacks and Pakistani army repression , which in addition to killing civilians , have driven some 550,000 people from their homes .
While Washington has demanded that Pakistan take even more repressive measures to deny the Taliban " safe havens " from which they can launch attacks in neighboring Afghanistan , President Asif Ali Zardari is anxious to damp down the conflict for fear that it will threaten his government�s survival .
Thus , on Monday , to Washington�s consternation , Zardari signed legislation that imposes Islamic law in the Swat Valley , which had been the scene of protracted and bloody fighting between government forces and local Islamist militants .
The measure essentially amounts to a peace agreement with the local Taliban , whose ranks have reportedly doubled over the past year .
While the deal was supposed to secure the disarming of the Islamists , last week Taliban fighters advanced out of Swat and moved southeast into the Bruner district , defeating local police and militia in armed clashes and establishing their domination of the valley , which is barely 60 miles from the Pakistani capital .
The Obama administration is desperately attempting to salvage the war launched by President Bush in the name of fighting terrorism , but with the strategic objective of securing US hegemony in Central Asia , with its vast energy resources .
Its escalation and extension into Pakistan , however , will have the effect of spreading instability and armed conflict with potentially catastrophic results .
Anger as junior minister blames ' Hairy Angel ' Susan Boyle for swine flu pandemic
Thank goodness ministers are taking the swine flu outbreak so seriously .
Or at least some of them are .
Just as Gordon Brown was gravely announcing that two more Britons had been diagnosed with the virus , one government figure , I can disclose , decided that the potential pandemic was a great opportunity for a joke .
In a bizarre attempt at humour , junior minister Sion Simon suggested that unlikely Britain 's Got Talent singing sensation Susan Boyle is to blame .
Blog too far : The ' Hairy Angel ' Susan Boyle and Labour MP Sion Simon
The MP for Birmingham Erdington , 40 , posted his comment online on his Twitter page , writing : ' I 'm not saying Susan Boyle caused swine flu .
I 'm just saying that nobody had swine flu , she sang on TV , people got swine flu . '
Tories were horrified by what were seen as ' insensitive ' remarks .
Even fellow Labour MPs were aghast .
' It 's infantile , is n't it , ' one says .
' Has n't he got enough to do ? '
For Simon , the minister for further education , was posting what he thought was a witty aside on the crisis just as it was confirmed a 12 - year - old Devon girl had contracted the virus .
This is not the first time that grammar school - educated Simon , who read PPE at Oxford University , has made an online blunder .
In 2006 , he posted a spoof of David Cameron 's video blog on YouTube , in which , pretending to be Cameron , he offered people one of his children and the opportunity to sleep with his wife .
Both main parties condemned the stunt as ' tasteless ' , while an unrepentant Simon said Cameron 's attempts to reach out to youth culture was ' pathetic ' .
Simon was also part of a failed plot to force Tony Blair to resign .
Shortly after becoming Prime Minister , Brown appointed Simon vice - chair of the Labour Party .
Last night , after I contacted his office , a recalcitrant Simon removed the offensive comment from his Twitter page and made the following posting : ' Earlier I repeated a joke that was in poor taste , which I now regret .
' I apologise wholeheartedly for any distress or embarrassment caused . '
Meanwhile , Dan Snow , broadcaster son of former Newsnight presenter Peter Snow , is using Twitter to post bulletins about his stay in Mexico , where the virus started and where he is filming a documentary about the Aztecs . '
There 's no kissing and I 'm not allowed into bars , ' he wrote .
' It 's like being a teenager again . '
Sources say the BBC , which has removed all non-news teams from the region , has scrapped Snow 's plans for a live broadcast on The One Show , to conceal that he is still filming in dangerous territory .
Is Doodle Hirst 's new masterpiece ?
Sheep - pickling artist Damien
Hirst is never slow to fire off legal warnings to those who seek to profit from his multi-million - poundselling artworks , by copying or selling works without his permission .
But he was caught off guard when foxy Ukrainian TV star Olia Freimut asked him to draw a picture she could sell while she was interviewing him in Kiev , at the opening of his retrospective show Requiem .
Joke pays off : Ukranian TV star Olia Freimut
' As a joke , I asked Damien if he would be so kind as to paint me something that I could sell , ' explains Olia , 27 , who once worked at the BBC .
' I was amazed when he started drawing a picture of me on the back of a press release .
He put dollar signs in my eyes because I wanted to sell it for money .
He also included his signature butterflies .'
Then Hirst , 43 , who made £ 111 million in a two - day Sotheby 's auction of 223 pieces last September , added the flourish that could make the sketch worth thousands - his signature .
Adds Olia : ' I do n't think I am going to sell it .
I want to keep it as a memento and pass it on to my three - year - old
daughter Zlata .'
Says a spokesman for Hirst : ' He often does scribbles and doodles for people that ask him .
If I were her , I 'd hold on
to it .'
The politics of women
Embroiled in a nepotism row over her daughter Georgia Gould 's attempt to secure a Labour seat , publishing chief Gail Rebuck attempted to put the claims into context .
Row : Georgia Gould
The chief executive of Random House says : ' My mother went out to work at 13 , not because she wanted to , but because she had to . '
Collecting the Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year award , at the Saatchi Gallery , Ms Rebuck - wife of former New Labour pollster Lord Gould - suggested her daughter 's success was less an issue of nepotism and rather one of feminism .
' Only 19 per cent of MPs are women , ' she says .
There are still far too few women in politics . '
Sad news reaches me from Rome where Carla Powell , formidable wife of Margaret Thatcher 's adviser , Lord ( Charles ) Powell , is mourning the loss of her Yorkshire terrier , Douro .
The pup , named after the Duke of Wellington 's heir , was brutally kicked to death by a Romanian employee .
' I am so very sad - he was the love of my life , ' she tells me .
' He was a gift for my 60th birthday from Lady Palumbo and Lady de Rothschild .
I 've only just been able to bury him , as it took me seven days to find him .
' The awful man who killed him had lived under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu , but that 's no excuse .
' He has been fired , of course .
' Lady Powell is also not happy that her plans to escort Lady Thatcher to a meeting with the Pope have been leaked by her pal Paul Johnson in the New Statesman .
' Paul is a dear friend , but he is naughty for saying this , as it make things difficult for the security people . '
Why has writer Anthony Holden been lying low since disappearing from his Sunday newspaper slot last year ?
The answer lies in the unlikely setting of Lausanne , Switzerland , where he was named the first president of the International Federation of Poker .
A lifelong poker fan , who has written bestselling books on the subject and played for England , Holden , 61 , was head - hunted six months ago to set up a global governing body for poker , with the aim to win the game recognition as a skilful ' mind - sport ' .
' We plan to stage an international team poker tournament in London alongside the 2012 Olympics , ' he tells me .
' It 's time it was seen as a mind - sport of strategic skill , rather than lumped in , for legal purposes , with gambling '
Since spliting from his second wife , U.S. novelist Cindy Blake , Holden has earned something of a reputation as a ladies ' man .
He enjoyed a two - year fling with Lady Jane Wellesley , the Duke of Wellington 's daughter , who famously turned down a proposal from Prince Charles .
PS
As if Gordon Brown does n't have enough on his plate , he is now under attack from Tony Blair .
Blair impersonator , actor Michael Sheen , that is .
The Frost / Nixon star lambasts Brown over the use of Canadian black bears for Guardsmen 's caps .
In a letter to the Prime Minister , on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) , Sheen calls it : ' A deplorable waste of military funding .
It is also a waste of animals ' lives . '
Backing him are comedian Ricky Gervais , ex-007 Sir Roger Moore and actress Pamela Anderson .

This has been a staple of the healthcare debate for a long time , so it ’s not as if we have n’t been warned .
But today the Washington Post reports that in certain regions , waiting times to see a doctor in Canada are getting completely out of hand :
Just six months ago , the clinic delivered same - day care to most callers , the gold standard from a health perspective .
But in October the delays crept to four days , then 19 in November and 25 in December .
In January , HealthServe temporarily stopped accepting new patients , and almost immediately 380 people put their names on a waiting list for when the crunch eases .
Sorry .
Did I say Canada ?
I meant North Carolina , of course , where more than a quarter of adults now have no health insurance :
A steep rise in unemployment has fueled a commensurate increase in the number of people who do not have health insurance , including many middle - income families .
“ I used to be upper middle class , ” said Amy , who called HealthServe every morning for weeks before getting in to see Talbot … .
“ I have n’t told anyone I ’m coming here , ” she said , asking that her last name be withheld because she is embarrassed to be seeking discounted medical care .
Best healthcare in the world , baby !
SEOUL ( AP ) 
China 's top diplomat said his country wants to restart stalled international negotiations on North Korea 's nuclear disarmament and hinted that Beijing would welcome two - way talks between Pyongyang and Washington , a report said Friday .
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Beijing will work to continue the six-nation disarmament talks that North Korea announced it would boycott after the U.N. Security Council condemned its recent rocket launch , according to an interview in Japan 's Nihon Keizai newspaper .
North Korea says it launched a satellite but others have said it was actually testing ballistic missile technology .
China — which is North Korea 's only major ally but backed the U.N. rebuke — " hopes for the development of and improvement in relations between the United States and North Korea , " Yang said .
He said either bilateral or multilateral talks involving the two sides would " mutually promote " relations .
Japan 's Kyodo
News agency reported that the U.S. said it will not pursue direct talks with North Korea at the expense of the six - party talks .
Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg made the comment Thursday to Seiji Maehara , a top official in Japan 's main opposition Democratic Party , Kyodo reported from Washington .
Steinberg also told Maehara that the U.S. will call for talks with China , Japan , Russia and South Korea by the end of this month on how to deal with North Korea , it said .
Separately , Russia 's foreign minister plans to visit Pyongyang around April 24 to try to persuade North Korea to return to the six - party talks , South Korea 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported Friday .
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is likely to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il and deliver a letter from Russian President Dmitri Medvedev , it said , citing unidentified Russian officials .
North Korea , which claims the right to develop a space program , reacted furiously after the Security Council unanimously condemned its April 5 rocket launch as a violation of previous resolutions barring it from ballistic missile - related activity .
It vowed to boycott the disarmament talks and restart its nuclear program , and ordered U.N. and U.S. nuclear monitors to leave .
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency left its main nuclear site in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang on Thursday after removing all seals and switching off surveillance cameras , the IAEA said .
They arrived in Beijing on a flight later in the day , but declined to speak to reporters .
Four U.S. experts monitoring the nuclear plant in Yongbyon were also preparing to depart after North Korea ordered them out , the State Department said .
A small group of experts have been rotating into Yongbyon since November 2007 .
In his interview , China 's Yang did not appear to directly criticize North Korea over the launch , but said it should offer an explanation .
" North Korea announced a satellite launch , " he said .
" It is appropriate for North Korea to explain why it took the action . "
North Korea conducted a nuclear test in 2006 but later agreed to dismantle its nuclear program in return for shipments of fuel oil under a 2007 six -nation deal .
The process has been stalled since last year by a dispute over how to verify North Korea 's past nuclear activities .

Homeland Stupidity
June 24 , 2008
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators received a no-bid contract worth millions of dollars to implement a “ verification hub ” connecting state and federal databases under the REAL ID program .
AAMVA , which already maintains a database of commercial drivers in every state , was believed to be the company that would get the contract for the verification hub which , when completed , will allow states to electronically verify documents such as birth certificates and Social Security cards with other states and with the federal government .
The database begins with a $ 17 million REAL ID Demonstration Grant awarded to the state of Missouri , which will then pass on that cash to AAMVA to do the actual work of developing the system .
Four other states , Florida , Indiana , Nevada , and Wisconsin , received $ 1.2 million grants to be the first states to connect to the new database .
The grants were a portion of nearly $ 80 million in grants awarded to 48 states and territories to implement various parts of REAL ID in those states .
Every state and territory which applied for funding received at least $ 300,000 , according to DHS .
Only Alaska , Idaho , Louisiana , Montana , New Hampshire , Oklahoma and Washington state did not apply for funding .
Many of those states are not participating in REAL ID .
That $ 80 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated $ 11 billion price tag for REAL ID .
It ’s like getting two cents when you need $ 30 .
AAMVA calculates the final costs of building out the database would reach as high as $ 130 million .
AAMVA maintains its driver ’s license database through a contract with EDS Corp. of Plano , Texas .
Meanwhile , EDS currently charges AMMVA a maintenance fee for maintaining its commercial driver records .
That charge , according to sources , is $ 0.08334 per month for each record .
Under REAL ID , then , EDS could become responsible for maintaining up to 240 million driver records across the United States , potentially netting EDS as much as $ 240 million per year merely for maintaining commercial driver records .
— Homeland Security Today
Homeland Stupidity was the first to note that AAMVA would likely get the contract for the central database which linked the states together under REAL ID .
DHS has said the central verification hub will not diminish privacy or put people at risk .
And I have a million bushels of Iowa corn to sell you .
“ Personally identifiable information , beyond the minimum information necessary to appropriately route verification queries , will not be stored , ” reads a statement on the DHS web site regarding the verification hub .
Sounds good , right ?
Take a second look .
It ’s a carefully worded statement .
That “ minimum information necessary ” just happens to include , well , all your most important identity information : your name , birthdate , Social Security number , driver license number , address , and perhaps a few other things I ca n’t think of offhand .
That ’s more than enough to keep a corrupt employee or a hacker in stolen identities forever .
“ Americans overwhelmingly want secure identification , and this funding will help those states working to provide it , ” said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .
“ We ’ve made it more affordable for states to implement REAL ID by dramatically cutting costs and providing various and considerable funding options , and we ’re requesting additional funding next year . ”
If Americans overwhelmingly wanted REAL ID , why did n’t Congress just bring it up for a vote on its own merits , instead of sneaking it in the back door attached to an Iraq war funding bill ?
It seems to me that Americans overwhelmingly want to be safe .
But what threats do Americans really face ?
Terrorism does n’t even belong on the radar ; it ’s too rare an occurrence .
Accidents and crime certainly do belong on the radar .
But the biggest threat to any given American ’s security is his own government .
These are the people who can harm or kill you and get away with it .
When you consider privacy ( and by the way , privacy is a form of security ; by giving it up you make yourself more vulnerable ) you must consider that the government , the only institution which can get away with unjustly hurting or killing you — and which routinely does so — has all your information , and they can change the “ rules ” at any time .
This is just one more way in which the government is putting you in danger .

That hardy portion of the Lou Reed constituency that thrills to the kind of no-prisoners sonic terrorism practiced by their hero on albums like Metal Machine Music , and Velvet Underground tunes like “ Sister Ray ” ( And where would Sonic Youth and their ilk be without such milestones ? ) is in for a treat next week .
For a couple of evenings , specifically April 23 and 24 , Reed will be setting his legendary songbook aside for what ’s being billed as “ A Night of Deep Noise . ”
Reed will be performing with an ensemble dubbed — appropriately enough —
The Metal Machine Trio , with whom he ’ll be exploring the outer limits of sound in a manner not dissimilar to those aforementioned aural assaults .
Reed and company ’s attack on the senses will occur at the Blender Theater at Gramercy , and you can snatch up tickets for these all - improv events either there , at Irving Plaza , or here .

Die Sperre von WWW.
XS4ALL.NL Sabine Helmers im Gespräch mit Felipe Rodriquez
Sabine Helmers , Projektgruppe Kulturraum Internet , sprach mit Felipe Rodriquez über Internet - Traditionen , Toleranz , Zensur und die aktuelle Sperre von WWW.
XS4ALL.NL durch deutsche Internet - Provider .
1.10 .1996
Sabine Helmers , Projektgruppe Kulturraum Internet
Felipe , die Aktionen von Bundesanwaltschaft und einigen deutschen Internet - Providern gegen im World Wide Web bereitgestellte Texte der Zeitschrift Radikal durch einen eurer Kunden und die daraufhin erfolgten Blockadeversuche eures WWW - Servers , haben den Namen eurer Providerfirma hierzulande recht bekannt gemacht .
Vorher kannte man euch vor allem als Nährboden der digitalen Stadt Amsterdam .
Ist der Name eurer Firma , Access - for - All , zugleich auch euer Motto ?
Die Site xs4all wurde am 1 . Mai 1993 eröffnet .
Wir haben xs4all zu einer Zeit gegründet , als es in Holland noch keinen Internetzugang für Privatpersonen gab und nur Forschungseinrichtungen , Universitäten und Firmen im Internet waren .
Uns war und ist sehr daran gelegen , Netzzugang für alle zu einem erschwinglichen Preis zu ermöglichen .
Aus diesem Grund haben wir den Namen - Zugang für alle - gewählt .
Im Januar 1994 gründeten wir zusammen mit De Balie die Digitale Stadt Amsterdam .
Xs4 all stellte die Technik zur Verfügung und schuf das damalige erste Interface .
Ende des Jahres 1994 konnte die Digitale Stadt dann auf eigenen technischen und finanziellen Füßen stehen , und wir haben uns zurückgezogen .
Bietet Xs4all also jedem Interessierten Zugang zum Internet oder gibt es irgendwelche Auswahlkriterien bei euch ?
Wir haben keinerlei Auswahlprozesse .
Als wir unsere Pforten öffneten , haben wir aber zu unserem Glück all die Tech - Wizards für uns gewinnen können , und später sehr viele Künstler , Schriftsteller , Journalisten und andere kulturell engagierte Personen .
Wir unterstützen eine Menge Kunstprojekte , indem wir Infrastruktur zur Verfügung stellen .
Du bist Manager von Xs4all .
Sind deiner Ansicht nach die Provider verantwortlich für das , was ihre Kunden im Netz treiben und publizieren ?
Die Urheber sind verantwortlich für ihr Tun , während die Provider nur eine Mittlerfunktion haben , indem sie die Infrastruktur liefern .
Wenn ein Kunde Kriminelles begeht , beispielsweise Kinderpornographie veröffentlicht , dann macht sich der Kunde strafbar .
Der Provider trägt eine gewisse Mitverantwortung für seine Kunden , und er fungiert als Wegweiser zu deren realweltlicher Identität , die hinter einem Account - Namen steht .
Im Handlungsfalle benötigt die Polizei diese Personenangaben .
Wenn ein Provider in solch einem Fall seiner Pflicht zur Offenlegung der Kundennamen nicht nachkäme oder nachkommen könnte , dann würde die Verantwortlichkeit vom Urheber auf den Provider übergehen .
Überhaupt nicht verantwortlich hingegen ist ein Provider für Informationen , die von irgendwo in der Welt in das Internet gestellt werden .
Um das Beispiel Kinderpornographie hier wieder aufzugreifen :
Wenn irgendwo irgendwer solche illegalen Inhalte in das Netz gibt , kann ein Provider vor Ort nichts dagegen unternehmen - weder die Publikation verhindern , noch seinen Kunden das Abrufen solcher Publikation unmöglich machen .
Für diese außerhalb der Reichweite liegenden Dinge kann ein Provider nicht haften .
Habt ihr jemals einen eurer Kunden aufgefordert , über eure Site in das Internet gebrachte Inhalte zu entfernen ?
Ja , das ist bereits einige Male vorgekommen .
Im Falle von WWW - Seiten betrifft es meist Verletzungen des Copyright .
Unsere Politik bei solchen Copyrightproblemen besteht darin , daß wir Kontakt zwischen unserem Kunden und dem Inhaber des Copyrights herstellen , so daß sie ihr Problem miteinander lösen , möglicherweise auch vor Gericht .
Als Provider haben wir kein Interesse daran , uns zwischen die Beteiligten zu stellen .
Wenn unser Kunde allerdings das Gespräch mit dem Copyright - Inhaber verweigert , dann schließen wir die Webseiten des Kunden .
Wie gesagt , wir haben keinerlei Interesse , im Zentrum eines Konflikts zwischen einem unserer Kunden mit Dritten zu stehen .
Ein Copyright - Inhaber muß seine Rechte und den Verstoß hiergegen gegenüber dem Provider glaubhaft darlegen können , bevor dieser in Aktion tritt .
Die Scientology Kirche hat Xs4all verfolgt und verklagt , weil wir uns weigerten einige Seiten von unserem WWW - Server zu nehmen , denn sie konnten nicht beweisen , daß sie im Recht sind .
Es ging um zehn WWW - Dokumente .
In einem Gerichtsverfahren haben sie für zwei der zehn von ihnen beanspruchten Dokumente ihre Rechte daran belegen können , woraufhin etwa einhundert WWW - Autoren Zusammenfassungen der von der Scientology Kirche beanspruchten Dokumente völlig legal publizierten .
Am Ende haben wir diesen Fall vor Gericht gewonnen , weil wir keine Urheberrechte verletzt hatten .
Der Streit mit der Scientology Kirche hat für mich bestätigt , daß Provider sich zuerst über die Berechtigung von Ansprüchen Gewißheit verschaffen , bevor sie gegen ihre Kunden in Aktion treten .
Dasselbe gilt jetzt für die Radikalseiten , die über Xs4 all im Netz sind .
Wir haben keinerlei rechtliche Grundlage , unseren Kunden die Veröffentlichung zu untersagen .
Falls die Publikation der Radikal gegen holländische Gesetze verstoßen würde , dann hätten es uns die zuständigen Stellen in Holland bereits mitgeteilt .
Man kann die Zeitschrift hier in Buchhandlungen kaufen .
Unseres Wissens nach sind die Texte in Holland nicht verboten , und deshalb gibt es für uns keinen Grund , gegen die Veröffentlichung durch unseren Kunden vorzugehen .
Unser Kunde , die Solidaritätsgruppe für politische Gefangene , hat infolge der Blockadeaktion die Radikalseiten vorübergehend aus dem WWW genommen , um die deutsche Bundesanwaltschaft und den deutschen Verein Internet Content Task Force zu veranlassen , die Sperre von www.xs4all.nl zu beenden .
Danach haben sie die Seiten wieder in das Netz gestellt .
Es ist nicht die Angelegenheit von Xs4all als Provider zu bestimmen , was die Leute im Netz veröffentlichen sollen oder nicht .
Wenn sich Leute an Netzinhalten bei einem unserer Kunden stören , dann müssen sie auf Grundlage der holländischen Gesetze dagegen vorgehen .
Es gab auch einen Fall von Kinderpornographie durch Kunden von Xs4all .
Sie wurden angezeigt , und die Behörden haben uns um Unterstützung gebeten , was wir bei diesen zweifellos illegalen Netzaktivitäten natürlich getan haben .
Neulich hast du geschrieben , der alte Slogan " Information wants to be free " , den Bruce Sterling in seinem Buch über Hacker propagiert , sei Unfug , denn Informationen hätten keinen Willen .
Wohl aber die Netzbürger , die Netizen , von denen viele Informationsfreiheit wollen , weshalb es an ihnen ist , die Informationen zu befreien .
Siehst du dich selbst eigentlich als Netizen ?
Persönlich denke ich , daß politische Diskussionen im Netz eine wichtige Sache sind .
Alle sollten die Möglichkeit haben , ihren Staat zu kritisieren , wenn sie Anlaß dazu sehen .
Einige Regierungen können Kritik so wenig leiden , daß sie Kritiker verfolgen , einsperren und foltern .
Ich setze mich dafür ein , Informationen , die vielleicht in China oder Saudi Arabien illegal sind , zu befreien , das heißt ins Netz zu bringen .
Kinderpornographie sollte meiner Meinung nach nicht im Netz erhältlich sein .
Sie ist es , weil einige Leute das irgendwo hineingeben .
Solange nicht in allen Staaten die Rechtslage einheitlich Kinderpornographie verbietet , ist das Verbreiten solcher Inhalte leider kaum zu verhindern .
Der Kern meiner Bemerkung über die Netizens und die Befreiung von Informationen bezieht sich jedoch weniger auf meine persönliche Perspektive als Netizen , sondern auf die Struktur des Netzes , die lokale Zensurbestrebungen durch eine Person , eine Organisation oder einen Staat unmöglich macht .
Gesetze gelten innerhalb bestimmter Territorien .
Das Internet entstand als globales Netz ohne Kontrollzentren , das feindlichen Angriffen widerstehen sollte .
Heutzutage bedeutet das Fließen der Informationen ohne im Internet wirkende Kontrollzentren , daß der Datenstrom Staatsgrenzen ungehindert von herkömmlichen Kontrollzentren der Gesellschaften durchfließt .
Dies ist keine Meinung , sondern eine Feststellung .
Einige Menschen meinen , daß die " gute alte Zeit " des Internet Vergangenheit sei und daß Traditionen wie die Informationsfreiheit und Selbstregulierung in einem Massenmedium Internet nicht mehr bestehen bleiben können .
Wie denkst du hierüber ?
Internetzensur war bisher noch nie von Erfolg gekrönt .
Die von dir genannten alten Internettraditionen waren und sind bis heute gültig , weil nichts anderes machbar wäre .
Die im Netz existierende Freiheit der Rede besteht nicht als Wahlmöglichkeit , sondern als Tatsache , die durch die Technologie des Internet gestützt wird .
Du hast in Holland eine Hotline eingerichtet für Probleme , die durch Inhalte im Netz entstehen .
Wie funktioniert die Hotline ?
Um das Problem mit der Kinderpornographie im Netz in Holland anzugehen , habe ich diese Hotline als Koalition von Providern , Internetnutzern und Regierungseinrichtungen gegründet .
Eröffnet wurde die Hotline von der Justizministerin .
Es handelt sich um ein simples Warn - und Berichtsystem , wo Leute Fälle von Kinderpornographie bekanntgeben .
Wenn die Urheber Holländer sind , dann erhalten sie von uns einen Brief mit Informationen zur Strafbarkeit ihres Handelns und die Aufforderung , die Inhalte zu entfernen .
Sollten sie dies dann nicht tun , geben wir den Fall weiter an die zuständige Polizeistelle .
Die Hotline kann zur Bekämpfung international geächteter Kinderpornographie funktionieren , und ähnliche Hotlines werden jetzt auch in anderen Ländern eingerichtet .
In Zukunft wird man sehen , ob solche Hotlines wirklich erfolgreich sein können oder nicht .
Das Vorgehen der Bundesanwaltschaft und einiger deutscher Provider gegen jenseits ihrer Staatsgrenzen völlig legale Netzinhalte wird sicher ohne Erfolg bleiben .
Letztendlich werden sie die Publikation der Radikal im Internet hinnehmen müssen , denn es wird ihnen nichts anderes übrig bleiben .
Wenn sich die deutsche Regierung zu Eingriffsversuchen wie in Singapur , wo der Netzzugang und alle Netzveröffentlichungen strikter staatlicher Kontrolle unterstehen , entschließen sollte , dann hätte ich auch als Bürger von Singapur durch die Struktur des Netzes Zugang zu allen Internetinformationen .
Eine solcherart vorgehende Regierung könnte sich bestenfalls an der Illusion von Kontrolle erfreuen , aber tatsächlich ist Kontrolle nicht möglich .
Es gibt weltweit viele Sites , viele Einwählpunkte , anonyme Remailer , WWW Proxies und andere Techniken , die Kontrollversuchen entgegenstehen .
Welche Bedeutung hat deiner Ansicht nach die Elektronic Frontier Foundation ?
Und was kann der Global Action Alert gegen die Xs4all - Blockade bewirken ?
Jedes Land sollte eine eigene Electronic Frontier Foundation haben , eigene Gruppen von kritischen Individuen .
Die EFF und andere Gruppen leisten gute Arbeit , indem sie die Welt informieren und gegen unkluge Gesetzesinitiativen wie beispielsweise den Communications Decency
Act vorgehen .
Der Global Action Alert wird dazu beitragen , die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit für die Probleme , die wir infolge der Aktionen durch Bundesanwaltschaft und Provider haben , zu verstärken .
Hoffentlich versteht man bei den Urhebern , daß diese Aktionen weder unbemerkt von der internationalen Öffentlichkeit bleiben , noch zum gewünschten Ziel führen .
Inzwischen steht die Radikal auf vielen Mirror Sites im Netz zur Verfügung , während zuvor die meisten Netizens wohl noch nie von Radikal gehört hatten .
Zu den Internettraditionen gehören ebenfalls die lokale Problemlösung und der Glaube , daß sich für alle Arten von Problemen , einschließlich der sozialen und politischen Problemen , eine technische Lösung finden wird .
Was hältst du von Initiativen wie beispielsweise spezielle Webbrowser , die es Eltern ermöglichen , ihre Kinder per Software von nicht kindgemäßen WWW - Inhalten fernzuhalten ?
Nicht die Regierungen , sondern die Menschen sollen selbst entscheiden können , was sie im Netz anschauen wollen und was nicht .
Und es ist gut , wenn Software zur Verfügung steht , die Eltern und Kinder vor Ungutem schützen hilft .
Ich habe großes Zutrauen in die individuelle und kollektive Kreativität und Energie der Internetnutzer bei der Lösung von Problemen .
Und eine Menge Leute im Netz sehen in Problemen Herausforderungen , die es zu meistern gilt .
Gibt es noch etwas , was du den Leserinnen und Lesern in Deutschland mitteilen möchtest ?
Kommunikation in einem so immensen Ausmaß ist nur möglich durch Toleranz , durch Akzeptieren im globalen Rahmen .
Akzeptieren , daß es andere Kulturen , andere Glaubensrichtungen und andere Moralvorstellungen in der Welt gibt .
Toleranz gegenüber anderen ist die Basis für den Anspruch darauf , selbst toleriert zu werden .
Es gibt im Netz Dinge , wie zum Beispiel Kinderpornographie , da sind wir wahrscheinlich einer Meinung , bei anderen Inhalten werden die Meinungen geteilt sein , aber wir werden im Netz das Vorhandensein aller denkbaren Inhalte akzeptieren müssen und zur Toleranz gezwungen sein , denn etwas anderes ist nicht möglich .
( Sabine Helmers im Gespräch mit Felipe Rodriquez )
Washington , D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) called on Congress today to examine the Investigative Data Warehouse ( IDW ) -- a massive FBI data - mining project that includes a billion records , many of which contain personal information on American citizens .
Supporting its request , EFF provided Congress with its new report on IDW , published today with information obtained through Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) litigation .
EFF sued the FBI for information about the IDW under the FOIA in 2006 , but the agency has withheld important details about the collection , maintenance , and use of personal information contained in the huge database .
The Department of Justice recently told the court that no additional material will be disclosed , despite the Obama administration 's new policies on open government .
In a letter sent today to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , EFF says that Congress is the last avenue for accountability and oversight of this potentially dangerous program .
" Nearly two years ago , Senator Leahy noted that the IDW was a system that was ' ripe for abuse , ' " said EFF Senior Counsel David Sobel .
" We could not agree more .
The congressional judiciary committees should examine the IDW and provide the public with needed information about its impact on privacy rights . "
While the FBI is still withholding critical information , EFF 's lawsuit did uncover some key documents about the IDW .
Using these records , EFF has published a report surveying what is known about this massive data collection , and what questions are still unanswered .
The report notes that the FBI has identified only 38 of the 53 " data sources " that feed into the IDW .
The report also discusses the FBI 's efforts to avoid " raising congressional consciousness levels and expectations " about the IDW 's privacy impact .
" A data warehouse of the size and power of the IDW requires strict oversight from Congress and the public , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl , who authored the new report .
" The IDW includes more than four times as many documents as the Library of Congress , and the FBI has asked for millions of dollars to data - mine this warehouse , using unproven science in an attempt to predict future crimes from past behavior .
We need to know all of what 's in the IDW , and how our privacy will be protected . "

この Marshall Kirkpatrick のエントリにははっとさせられた。
音声とデータは別々のままにはできない 音声とウェブは不可分になる ウェブアクセスへの需要は遍在する
という彼の主張を突き詰めればそういう結論になるということか。
そうした意味で Android を組み込み機器全般に適用しようとする Open Embedded Software Foundation の方向性は正しいし、それどころか HP はネットブックに Android 搭載を検討してるんだからね 。
そういえばここでも何度も取り上げているオープンソース携帯電話

I must be naive .
I really thought the administration would welcome the return of bank bailout money .
Some $ 340 million in TARP cash flowed back this week from four small banks in Louisiana , New York , Indiana and California .
This is n't much when we routinely talk in trillions , but clearly that money has not been wasted or otherwise sunk down Wall Street 's black hole .
So why no cheering as the cash comes back ?
My answer :
The government wants to control the banks , just as it now controls GM and Chrysler , and will surely control ...
A bridegroom who sexually assaulted a stranger on his stag night because he wanted one final fling has been jailed for seven years .
Louis Palmer , 33 , stalked his 30 - year - old victim at the end of a drunken night out to celebrate his impending wedding .
He pushed the woman against a wall and indecently assaulted her .
When she tried to fight him off , he punched her in the face .
Jailed : Louis Palmer , and his wife Amanda , arriving at Bournemouth Crown Court
Despite his being arrested and charged with the attack , Palmer 's fiancee Amanda Conway went ahead with the wedding and married him three weeks later .
Mrs Palmer , who supported him in court , broke down in tears as her husband was found guilty of the assault and jailed .
Palmer was on his stag night in Bournemouth with a group of friends on July 5 last year .
At about 4 am the builder , from Brierley Hill , in the West Midlands , became separated from the group and went off to buy a kebab , Bournemouth Crown Court heard .
He was caught on CCTV cameras following the woman as she walked through the town centre alone .
The victim , who cannot be identified , told the court : ' I remember crossing the road , then just out of nowhere someone grabbed hold of me and threw me against a wall .
Despite Palmer being arrested and charged with the attack , his then - fiancée Amanda Conway married him three weeks later .
They are pictured here on their wedding day
' I was telling him " please stop " , then he punched me in the face .
The next thing I remember is being on the other side of the wall . '
The victim was left covered in cuts and bruises after the attack .
Palmer was arrested the next day in a bookmakers in Bournemouth ,
where he and his friends were picking up winnings from a bet they had made .
He claimed the woman had offered him ' one last fling ' after he stopped and asked her for directions .
He told police he had agreed to what he thought would be a ' five - second fumble ' .
Palmer said : ' I thought it was going to be like a five - second fumble and whatever , and I would go off into the night .
She was n't saying anything until she went berserk .
' When women become hysterical , it is necessary sometimes to slap them to bring them round . '
Assault : Palmer , circled in white , is captured on CCTV on his stag night in Bournemouth .
His victim is also spotted on camera , circled red below
Palmer had denied charges of sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm , but was found guilty following a trial .
Sentencing him , Judge Roger Jarvis said : '
This was , by any measure , an especially appalling attack .
Your unfortunate victim found herself separated from her friends .
She was alone and anxious .
The clear impression is that she felt very vulnerable .
' You saw her and stalked her in a predatory way and there you violently assaulted her .
This attack has had a devastating effect .
No one should suffer in this terrible way .
' A woman should feel safe to walk home whatever the circumstances - Detective Sergeant Phil Swanton , who investigated the case for Dorset Police , said : ' This was a despicable attack on a lone female and I am pleased with the verdict .
' Mr Palmer stalked the victim for just under a mile before attacking her and is clearly a very dangerous sexual predator . '
Palmer was told that his name would be added to the sex offenders ' register after his release from prison .
Mrs Palmer said she was too upset to comment on the sentence but it is understood she is standing by her husband .
Retail gasoline prices fell across much of the U.S. over the last week , the Energy Department said Monday , but analysts warned motorists to enjoy it while it lasted .
Prices were expected to rise to as high as $ 2.25 a gallon nationally and to $ 2.50 in California and the West Coast by the Memorial Day weekend .
The average cost of a gallon of self - serve regular gasoline in California fell 3.4 cents to $ 2.162 .
That was $ 1.442 a gallon below the year - earlier price .
Nationally , the average fell 3.1 cents to $ 1.910 a gallon , which was $ 1.347 less than the price at this time last year .
Crude prices rose despite some dour predictions about global oil demand .
The bump - up was also a surprise after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday declined to rein in production to prop up prices that remain $ 100 a barrel below the record high reached last July .
Crude oil futures for April delivery rose $ 1.10 to $ 47.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

At least one expert thought the increase in oil prices and OPEC ’s decision to forgo further production cuts may have had something to do with U.S. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu ’s visit to the OPEC meeting in Vienna .
“ Secretary Chu had to impress on the oil ministers the urgency of not lowering their oil shipments even more than their quotas , ” said Bob van der Valk , fuel - pricing analyst with 4 Refuel Inc. , fuel consultants in Lynnwood , Wash .
“ This had to be done in order to assist the U.S. and in turn the world economies in recovering from their current recession . ”
Van der Valk also said gasoline prices were bound to rise despite weak demand .

The switch from cheaper , winter - grade fuel to a more complex summer blend added to costs of refining a gallon of fuel , he said .

' In The Wrong Profession ' Bus Driver Fired for Saving Toad
A bus driver in the German city of Regensburg has lost her job after she stopped her vehicle to save a toad in the road and a passenger complained to her boss about the delay .
Animal rights activists have come out in support of the driver .
Gateway 2 - Homeworld
Ten years have passed since you saved the human race from certain doom , in Frederick Pohl 's Gateway .
You 're now retired , and with fifty million dollars in your bank account you have little to worry about .
But just as you 're busy enjoying your retirement a giant object appears out of nowhere and settles next to Pluto .
It 's promptly named the artifact as it's theorized that it 's a Heechee spaceship .
It 's too far away to say for certain , though , so the UN decides to dispatch a spaceship carrying an ambassador to investigate .
Guess what ; you 're not that ambassador , but you are called upon to brief the ambassador before departure .
Unfortunately a sect of terrorists attack you before the briefing can take place and you 're forced to escape into the ship assigned to take the ambassador to The Artifact .
Liftoff ... this is where your adventure begins .
Legend Entertainment 's Gateway 2 : Homeworld was released in 1993 and pretty much picks up the story where it ended in the first one , which is sure to please all fans of the original .
And not only does the quality of the storyline match that of the first game , it exceeds it by far .
As with the first game , Gateway 2 is based on Frederick Pohl 's Heechee Saga novels , but this time the story is much deeper , so if you felt a little empty after playing the first game and have been longing to find out more about the Heechee , you will definitely want to get your hands on this one .
The length of the game has also been increased ( which would be a necessity for making the story deeper , since the first game was fairly short ) , and if you 've played the first game , you might expect this one to end at any moment ... but it does n't .
It just keeps on going , sucking you deeper and deeper into the compelling storyline .
Obviously it does end at some point , but when it does you wo n't be complaining that it was too short , like many people did with the first game .
The interface is excactly the same as in the first Gateway , and is similar to that of a number of other Legend Ent. games , like Eric the Unready and the Spellcasting series .
This means that it 's basically a text game , but that you 're also presented with pictures of the location you 're currently in and a choice to use the mouse to combine words rather than typing them .
This time Legend has taken it a little further , though , as the graphics are no longer " unnecessary " .
In the first Gateway , you did n't actually need the graphics to play the game , but this one contains puzzles that involves the graphics , and when you talk to people you now get a fullscreen image of them along with some dialog options to choose between , much like in regular adventure games , rather than having to type your question .
Also , the graphics are now even better than in the first game , with plenty of beautiful cutscenes , which is sure to please people who would usually frown at the words " text based adventure " .
It all works very well , and helps to make this game even better than the first one .
The musical side of the game has also been improved immensely .
It 's no masterpiece , and fades a bit into the background , but still manages to set the mood of the game .
This may sound mediocre , but the fact that the music fades into the background , almost making you forget that it 's there , means that it does n't stand out in an annoying way .
This is the real test of game music ; will you leave it on , or turn it off in frustration , before it causes you to go insane ?
Gateway 2 passes that test .
Gateway did n't .
Enough said .
It should be clear by now that Gateway 2 : Homeworld has been improved in all the areas where Gateway was lacking , but what about Gateways strong points ?
Are they still there ?
Well , the story of the game is , as noted , even better than in the first one , but Gateways real strong point was its excellent puzzles , every single one with a very logical solution .
This has n't changed .
Gateway 2 does n't feature a single puzzle that does n't have a logical solution .
There are also hints for many of the puzzles , spread throughout the game if you 're observant .
This means that there are no ponts in the game where you have to start randomly using the objects you 're carrying with objects in the gameworld .
Granted , you could do that , but you 'd do better to start paying attention to your surroundings , and think rationally about the problem you 're facing .
As a consequence the game is n't overly difficult , as long as you pay attention and think about what you 're doing , but neither is it too easy .
Although Gateway 2 is a sequel , you do n't actually need to have played the first game before playing this one .
It is recommended , however , since you 'll have more background knowledge that way , and it'll add to the experience of the story .
And besides , the first one is damn good , too .
This one gets the score of five out of five possible , for being a more than excellent sequel , and improving on all aspects of the fist game .
Honestly , I 'm hard pressed to find a single flaw in the game .
If anything , it would be that it leaves you wanting more , and since Legend no longer exists it 's unlikely a third Gateway will ever be made .
The manual and a hintbook are included in the game archive .
It should be noted that this version is the full cd version of the game , including all cutscenes ( there 's no speech , and there never was ) .
AT&T ’s earnings report on Wednesday highlights the enormous stakes involved in the renewal of its exclusive contract to distribute Apple ’s iPhone in the United States .
Tony Cenicola / The New York Times
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week , Ivan Seidenberg , Verizon ’s chief executive , said the company was more likely to get access to the iPhone in the coming years as it converts to a fourth - generation technology , called L.T.E. , which will also be used by AT&T .
The two companies now use incompatible technology , and Apple has not wanted to make multiple versions of the iPhone .
AT&T is paying Apple an unusually high subsidy on top of the $ 199 and $ 299 paid by iPhone buyers .
But it appears to be getting quite a return on that investment .
In the first quarter , AT&T credited the iPhone for helping increase its wireless operating profit margin to 26 percent from 25 percent a year ago .
The company activated 1.6 million iPhones on its network in the quarter .
And more than 640,000 of those customers were new to AT&T ’s network .
That represents three - quarters of the net addition of 875,000 new postpaid consumer accounts in the quarter .
( AT&T added 325,000 more net business and prepaid wireless accounts in the quarter . )
IPhone customers , moreover , are particularly valuable , mainly because they also buy expensive data plans .
Their average bill is $ 94 a month , 60 percent higher than the company ’s overall customer base .
Data represented 27 percent of AT&T ’s $ 11.7 billion in wireless revenue in the quarter , up from 22 percent a year ago .
So let ’s do some very rough calculations .
If the average iPhone customer brings in $ 90 a month , or $ 1,080 a year in revenue , and the operating profit margin stays constant at 26 percent , that means an iPhone customer represents at least $ 561 in operating profit over a two - year contract .
That probably understates the impact because iPhone customers have higher - than - average profit margins .
Put another way , if the company gets 2.5 million new customers a year because of its iPhone exclusivity , the deal represents at least $ 700 million a year in operating profits — profits that it could lose if Verizon sold the iPhone , too .
These numbers may be low .
After all , some customers who renewed accounts with AT&T and bought iPhones might well have switched to Verizon instead if it too sold the iPhone .
Many people believe that Verizon has a better network , and it might gain share in a market where it and AT&T both offered the same phone .
But who knows whether that will still be true once the fourth - generation networks come online .
Also this analysis of the iPhone ’s impact comes from a period when there are not competing smartphones with quite the alluring set of features it has .
If customers begin to see a Palm or Android phone as the equivalent of an iPhone , the value of an exclusive deal goes down .
Still , with the sort of numbers AT&T reported this quarter , the company has every reason to make Apple an offer it ca n’t refuse to keep its exclusive deal for another few years .
Of course , the incentives for Verizon are presumably the mirror image .
While some of AT&T ’s new iPhone customers come from Sprint and T - Mobile , a good chunk of them might well move to or stay with Verizon if that company also offered the iPhone .
There also may be a group of Verizon customers who would upgrade to an iPhone if it were available , and in doing so move to a more expensive data plan .
So expect Mr. Seidenberg to come to Cupertino , checkbook in hand , to see what sort of deal he can make .
All things being equal , Apple has a modest incentive to expand the distribution of the iPhone as much as possible .
The greatest number of users means the greatest number of customers for its iPhone Apps store .
Moreover , the iPhone brings new people into the Apple ecosystem and makes them more likely to buy a Mac , an Apple TV or an iPod .
But as the numbers above show , all things are hardly equal .
And the benefit of somewhat more iPhone sales from wide distribution is likely to be swamped by a huge bid from AT&T to keep exclusivity , and an equally high bid from Verizon to win some ( or maybe even all ) of the business for itself .
In other words , no matter what happens , Apple wins .

After blocking ten thousand sites in Saudi Arabia , new security measures against Internet Cafes
Cairo , 19 April , 2009 .
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said today that the Saudi Ministry of Interior has imposed severe restrictions on the Saudi Internet Cafes , requiring owners of Internet Cafes to install censorship secret cameras inside cyber cafes , to register users names and identity numbers , in addition to limiting the use of Internet on the Café 's phone lines , as well as other measures to impose more restrictions on Internet users , in a country known for its restrictive repressive policy and its continuous hostility towards freedom of using this important tool .
It is worth mentioning that the Interior Ministry has issued 8 basic instructions to owners of Internet Cafes on 15 April , requiring them ;
To install censorship secret cameras .
To prepare electronic or manual registration of users and identities .
The prohibition of using prepaid Internet cards and Satellite dishes to access the Internet without authorization of the competent authorities .
Prohibition of using any Internet device unless indicated in the certificate issued by the service provider .
The supervisor in the Cyber Café must be Saudi .
Those under 18 must not be allowed to use the Internet .
The cafes opening hours must be the same as other commercial shops , therefore the Café must close at 00:00 .
All phones to be used in the Café must be under the Café 's name , " neither the owner nor any other person . "
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information affirmed that " These decisions do not go with the announcements of Saudi Arabia who claims it is thriving for reform , such decision is more like establishing a small prison inside each Internet café , and sadly , it indicates how the Saudi Interior Ministry perceives Internet users . "
It is to be noted that Internet users in Saudi Arabia , who actually exceed seven million users , most of them suffer from the tremendous expansion in the repressive policy adopted by the Communication and Information Technology Institution , who controls the use of the Internet In Saudi Arabia , and it now censors and blocks web sites in general , and also censors freedom of navigation , which proves that Saudi Arabia is one of the most suppressive countries with regard to freedom of Press and the Internet .

This is a guest post by Renee over at Womanist Musings :
The National Day of Silence is fast approaching .
On April 17th to support our TLBG members , spend the day in silence and let the world know that there is a cost to the violence that they are forced to endure because we refuse to believe in the equality of all bodies .
We need to realize that each day a life is snuffed out somewhere on this planet for the supposed crime of loving another or their gender identity .
It is far to easy to believe that because two marriage amendments were passed in one week that things are improving .
The truth is no matter how many states pass same sex marriage the issues of homophobia and transphobia extend far beyond that .
They include discrimination in housing , health care , education , employment , and in fact every sphere that you can possibly think of .
This is why I am a huge advocate of ENDA .
What I love most about this idea is that this is an action that we can all participate in to show our solidarity and raise awareness directly in our communities .
So many times people ask what can I do to show support .
Well now you have an answer .
On April 17 you can spend a day in silence reflecting on how are dissonance in worth and value wrongfully privileges certain bodies and allow your silence to speak the words that you may no be able to express .
As strange as it may sound , the ‘ Cosmic Muffin ’ is a boat made out of a rare and historic aircraft - the Boeing 307 Stratoliner dating back to 1939 .
The 307 was the first commercial pressurized aircraft and only ten 307s were built in the late - 1930 ’s .
Production of the aircraft was abruptly stopped when war broke out in Europe .
The airplane was originally bought by industrialist and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in 1939 as part of his purchase of Trans World Airlines ( TWA ) .
After that , the airplane changed hands numerous time .
At one point during 1963 or 1964 , the then owner , aircraft broker Joseph MacCaughtry took a $ 40,000 loan out to fix it , then defaulted , after which the bank removed everything of value from the plane including the engines .
From then until 1969 it was left derelict , abandoned , open , and unlocked .
Later that year the airplane was declared abandoned property and put up for auction .
Ken London , a private pilot , came in with the winning bid - a mere $ 62 .
It was Ken who turned the airplane into a motoryacht after removing the wings .
The airplane , now a boat , was again sold off and after changing owners a couple of times more , it was finally bought by David Drimmer in 1981 , who is the current owner of the boat .

" Killerspiele stehen auf einer Stufe mit Drogen und Kinderpornografie " Florian Rötzer
Der bayerische Innenminister fordert ein Verbot der Killerspiele , der Medienminister schließt sich an und will einen " medienführerschein " einführen .
Der bayerische Innenminister Joachim Herrmann forderte zur erstmaligen Verleihung des deutschen Computerspielpreises während der Veranstaltung Munich Gaming in München , dass auf Herstellung und Vertrieb von Killerspielen in Deutschland freiwillig verzichtet werden sollte .
Mit dieser „ Tötungstrainingssoftware , die zum Beispiel von der US - Army zur Vorbereitung von Soldaten auf Kampfeinsätze verwendet wird , dürfen in Deutschland keine Geschäfte mehr gemacht werden " .
Herrmann sieht es als wissenschaftlich erwiesen an , dass Computerspiele , in denen im Unterschied zu Filmen Gewalt aktiv ausgeübt werde , die Gewaltbereitschaft gefördert werde , während die Fähigkeit , Mitleid zu empfinden , verkümmert .
Bei Jugendgewalt und Amokläufen würden „ Szenen aus Killerspielen in die Realität übertragen " .
Dazu kommt noch , dass solche Spiele nach Herrmann süchtig machen .
In der Mitteilung des Innenministeriums heißt es : „ Killerspiele widersprechen dem Wertekonsens unserer auf einem friedlichen Miteinander beruhenden Gesellschaft und gehören geächtet .
In ihren schädlichen Auswirkungen stehen sie auf einer Stufe mit Drogen und Kinderpornografie , deren Verbot zurecht niemand in Frage stellt . “
Medienminister Siegfried Schneider schloss sich heute der Kritik an .
Computerspiele „ dürfen keine Vorbilder liefern für Gewaltverherrlichung und Menschenverachtung .
Wir brauchen eine intensive Qualitätsdebatte für Computerspiele und ein konsequentes Vorgehen gegen menschenverachtende Gewaltdarstellungen . "
Die bestehenden Verbotsmöglichkeiten müssten voll ausgeschöpft werden , auch strafrechtlich müsse gegen „ exzessive Gewaltdarstellungen “ vorgegangen und im Internet der Jugendschutz verstärkt werden .
Neben Verboten setzt Schneider auf die Förderung von Spielen „ mit kulturellen Inhalten oder pädagogischem Anspruch “ auf der einen Seite und die Entwicklung von Medienkompetenz bei Kindern , Jugendlichen und Eltern .
Dazu soll es einen „ Medienführerschein “ geben , „ der Basiswissen vermittelt , Sicherheit im Umgang mit neuen Medien und Spielen verschafft und dies auch dokumentiert " .

BOSTON 
An eviction notice hangs on Philip Markoff ’s door at the apartment complex where he lived with his fiancée , and the medical school where he took the Hippocratic oath has suspended him indefinitely .
Mr. Markoff ’s wedding is now officially delayed , too : his fiancée ’s family canceled the B - Street Band , hired to play Bruce Springsteen hits at the beachfront reception on Aug. 14 , its lead singer said Monday .
But while Mr. Markoff ’s seemingly normal life has crumbled in the week since his arrest on charges of killing one woman and robbing another at gunpoint after meeting them through Craigslist , hints have been slow to emerge as to why he might have committed the crimes .

In essence , assess your needs and compare them with the capabilities of the machine .
Go for the one that best meets your needs .
You should always ensure that your new sewing machine comes with the necessary attachments and would not need a separate purchase for them .
The attachments would be dependent upon the task you are planning to perform with the machine .

The consumer 's organisation Which ?
found that in 2007 - 08 councils in England rejected almost 229,400 tonnes of recycling waste because materials had been damaged or put in the wrong bin .
Hertsmere Borough Council in Hertfordshire had the worst record , rejecting 22 per cent of doorstep material .
In the report , The Truth About Recycling , Which ?
claims that £ 12 m a year could be saved if councils and residents recycled more efficiently .
The Government 's Waste Resources and Action Programme ( Wrap ) says that overall only about 5 per cent of all material that is left for recycling is sent to landfill .

Using freedom of information legislation , Which ?
found that some councils were wasting money by rejecting more than was necessary .
Manchester City Council rejected 16 per cent of household material , and Newcastle - under - Lyme and Watford Borough Council rejected 12 per cent .
Hertsmere Borough Council blamed its high rate on a temporary problem with composting materials .
Recycling rates have trebled in the past decade , from 11 per cent of all household waste being recycled in 2001 to 35 per cent in 2008 , as Britons become used to dividing out recycling waste into separate bins or crates .
Councils receive £ 50 per tonne for paper waste and £ 425 per tonne for aluminium waste from recycling companies .
To dump rubbish in a landfill , on the other hand , costs them £ 53 for each tonne dumped .
Experts told Which ?
there was no truth to newspaper reports that councils were stockpiling or " secretly dumping " recycling material .
However it said councils should give better information on what can be recycled .
Councils accused Which ? of distorting the facts .
" They appear to be counting dead cats and dirty nappies amongst the waste they think councils should be recycling , " said Paul Bettison , who chairs the Local Government Association 's environment board .
Wrap chief executive Dr Liz Goodwin said , " Almost 10 million tonnes of waste was put out for recycling in the UK last year .
The 230,000 tonnes which is rejected is a fraction of the overall total . "
That figure could be reduced " by making recycling collections simpler , and going the extra mile to explain how they work , " she added .
Former Cheney chief of staff can't find a job John Byrne
Published : Monday March 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Prominent Bush Administration officials who helped the former president propagate dubious legal opinions justifying the alleged torture of US prisoners continue to be punished by prospective employers .
While those who left before their so - called torture opinions came to light have managed to snag positions in the private sector , those who began their search afterward are still looking for jobs .
Including the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney .
David Addington , perhaps the most prominent member of Cheney 's inner circle after Scooter Libby -- Cheney 's top staffer until he was indicted on perjury charges in the CIA leak case -- Addington is seen as one of the chief architects of Bush 's " torture doctrine . "
In a July 2006 New Yorker piece , veteran reporter Jane Mayer put Addington at the core of controversial Bush policies -- and sketchy Administration attempts to avoid constitutional law .
Addington played " a central role in shaping the Administration 's legal strategy for the war on terror , " Mayer wrote .
" Known as the New Paradigm , this strategy rests on a reading of the Constitution that few legal scholars sharenamely , that the President , as Commander - in - Chief , has the authority to disregard virtually all previously known legal boundaries , if national security demands it .
" Under this framework , statutes prohibiting torture , secret detention , and warrantless surveillance have been set aside .
A former high - ranking Administration lawyer who worked extensively on national - security issues said that the Administration 's legal positions were , to a remarkable degree , ' all Addington . '
Another lawyer , Richard L. Shiffrin , who until 2003 was the Pentagon 's deputy general counsel for intelligence , said that Addington was ' an unopposable force . ' "
In the same article , former Secretary of State Colin Powell was quoted as saying , " He does n't care about the Constitution . "
Powell saw Addington as being at the center of the Bush Administration 's warrantless wiretapping program , which most legal scholars argue should have gone through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court .
Addington is n't the only senior Bush official who can't find a job .
Alberto Gonzales , Bush 's onetime Attorney General , is also looking for work .
Gonzales resigned after revelations that his department had fired US Attorneys for apparent political reasons .
Gonzales , who approved a 2002 memo that gave CIA interrogators the government 's blessing to conduct techniques previously to be torture , told the Wall Street Journal last month that he was one of the many casualties of the war on terror . 
Gonzales also chaired meetings on the issue .
Ex -Pentagon general counsel William
Heyes also could n't find a job for nearly a year after leaving office , and eventually took a post with Chevron , the Times said .
Others , who left before details of their participation in the Administration 's attempts to justify torture , had better luck .
John Yoo , a Bush lawyer , returned to his tenured professorship at Berkeley Law School in 2003 ; his ex-boss at the Justice Department was confirmed to a federal appeals court seat -- for life -- the same year .
An estimated 70 percent of former Bush officials who are looking for full - time work still have n't found new jobs , according to an article published in February by the Wall St. Journal .
" That 'is much , much worse ' than when Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton left the White House , " Carlos M. Gutierrez , who served as Bush 's commerce secretary , told the paper .
For many , the traditional refuge of conservative think tanks in Washington , D.C. has become a Fort Knox , with almost no positions available , and certainly not for lower - rung Bush officials .
The think tanks " lack interest in hiring high - profile Republicans when Democrats control the White House and Congress , " said the Journal .
" Mr. Bush 's low approval ratings at the end of his term do n't help , said Leonard Pfeiffer IV , a Washington recruiter for nonprofits . "
" A handful of Bush cabinet officers have accepted academic appointments , " the paper said .
" Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson joined Johns Hopkins University 's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies as a fellow .
Condoleezza Rice , previously secretary of state , resumed her Stanford University roles as a political - science professor and senior fellow at its Hoover Institution think tank . "

Amnesty says a high number of complaints are closed without a trial
The human rights group Amnesty International has accused the French authorities of failing to investigate alleged violence by security forces .
Allegations of beatings , and even unlawful killings , were rarely looked into and those responsible seldom brought to justice , Amnesty said .
In a report , it cited cases of abuse , many involving ethnic minorities and foreign nationals living in France .
French officials denied that any degree of police violence was being condoned .
David Diaz - Jogeix , the deputy director of Amnesty International 's Europe and Central Asia programme said : " In a climate where police abuse can go unchecked , the de facto impunity of law enforcement officials in France is unacceptable . "
" Victims , many of whom are French citizens from an ethnic minority or foreign nationals , are all too often left without justice . "
No police officer is above the law
French Interior Ministry Amnesty acknowledged that " not every complaint made against the police has merit " , but added that the discrepancy between the number of complaints made and the number of disciplinary sanctions " raises questions about the thoroughness and impartiality of the investigations " .
Amnesty said French officials had not acted on recommendations the human rights group had made in a 2005 report into abuse .
Amnesty said in its latest report that " according to limited information " in 2005 , there were 663 complaints resulting in 16 dismissals .
The following year 639 allegations were made and eight police officers dismissed as a result of investigations .
A high number of complaints against law enforcement officials were closed by the prosecutor without reaching trial , the report said .
' No tolerance '
It recommended that an independent police complaints commission be established .
Guillaume Didier , a spokesperson for the French justice ministry , rejected the accusation .
" There is no tolerance for police violence , " he told the AFP news agency .
" There are systematic criminal inquiries .
Police officers have neither more nor fewer rights than other defendants . "
The interior ministry said : " No police officer is above the law . "
The National Union of Police Officers defended its members , saying : " There is no unlawful violence ... we obey the rules of ethics and those of the code of criminal procedure . "

The impressive news last week that Microsoft Corp. posted its “ first ever ” decline in year - over - year quarterly sales and that revenues fell 6 percent , has set many tongues wagging in the tech world .
“ Microsoft ’s model is not working anymore , ” thundered trade journal InformationWeek .
“ Netbooks hammer Windows revenues for second straight quarter , ” declared Greg Keizer of ComputerWorld , another respected trade weekly .
The netbook phenomenon is interesting :
The tiny portable computers , with screens as small as 8 inches , run either a low - cost version of Microsoft ’s Windows XP operating system ( lower in licensing price than any of the Windows Vista configurations ) or some flavor of the open - source Linux operating system , which is either free or much , much cheaper than even Windows XP .
Either way , a lower - cost or no-cost operating system on a netbook siphons money from Microsoft ’s revenue stream .
Other consequences flow from that .
If you have a tiny portable with , say , limited RAM and a smallish hard disc drive of 120 gigabytes or so , you ’re not as likely to fill it up with some of the “ bloatware ” typically found on notebook and desktop PCs , some of which may bear the Microsoft name .
Instead of the Office 2007 “ suite , ” you might go for Microsoft Works , which includes an older version of Microsoft Word , a simpler spreadsheet , and so on .
Or , you ’ll jump to OpenOffice.org ’s office suite , which is free .
There ’s no tech support number to call , but you can find answers online .
Another scenario involves using Web - based tools such as Google ’s Documents suite to create word processing and spreadsheet files , or Adobe ’s Buzzword , or ThinkFree Office , all online tools , of which there are a growing number .
Do your computing “ in the cloud , ” and you ’re not buying Microsoft ’s software , either .
While such scenarios may not be attractive in many large enterprise settings , consumers are finding them more and more attractive , it seems ; otherwise why would there be a drop in Microsoft ’s sales and revenues ?
The more important question is what can Microsoft do to change things ?
I ’m no insider , but I have a couple of decades ’ experience with the company and its products .
Some educated guesses and ideas follow .
First , the company needs to get Windows 7 out there as soon as possible .
This has been discussed here twice in the past month ; suffice it to say there ’s a lot of enthusiasm for a Windows operating system that is n’t prone to crashing .
Second , move Office online , and soon .
There have been some elementary moves toward this : Microsoft Exchange users can access a version of the Outlook e-mail client online via a Web browser , and what used to be Microsoft Publisher is essentially an online service .
What I ’d like to see , however — and what I might pay for — is a feature - rich , full - spectrum office suite online , and , while we ’re at it , let ’s make it browser independent , please .
Example : if you use Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer to access Outlook / Exchange via the Web , you get more - or - less the “ complete ” desktop Outlook experience .
Use Mozilla ’s Firefox or Apple ’s Safari , and you get a “ light ” version .
Microsoft does this , I ’m guessing , to drive users toward Internet Explorer .
Fair enough , but as we ’ve seen with Vista vs. netbooks , it ’s a losing strategy .
Better still to engineer a robust Web - based experience and charge a little more than to cut corners and upset your customer base .
By contrast , Kerio Mail Server , which runs on Windows , Mac and Linux servers , offers what seems to be a rather consistent user experience across platforms :
It looks , and acts , the same in any Web browser , on Mac or Windows .
The final thing Microsoft should do is buy something , and quick : Outbid Oracle for Sun Microsystems and Microsoft would get an entree into open - source markets ; buy Adobe and , after dodging antitrust concerns , they could beef up Office into an unstoppable force .
I ’m not a Microsoft insider , but I ’m guessing there ’s hard work going on at the company ’s Redmond , Wash . , headquarters seeking ways to avoid oblivion .
It ’s been a great ride for Microsoft , and I do n’t think they want to stop just yet .

Barack Obama is being hailed as the most tech - savvy U.S. president - elect to date , based on his heavy use of new media and social networking .
His digital campaign , however , was far from a one - man show .
One of the people working behind the scenes was Rahaf Harfoush , a Canadian self - proclaimed innovation and new media strategist .
She recently completed a three - month assignment as part of Barack Obama 's new media team , working on mybarackobama.com at his headquarters in Chicago .
Harfoush , 24 , did her business degree at the University of Western Ontario .
Already , her clients span a list of impressive names , ranging from British Telecom , Unilever , and InnoSpa to the McMichael Art Gallery of Ontario .
Last week , we caught up with Harfoush during a Rotman School of Management session in Toronto , entitled Applying Barack Obama 's Social Media Strategy to Your Brand 's Communications Needs .
Here are some excerpts from an interview before the session .
Rahaf Harfoush , new media strategist and a member of Barack Obama 's digital campaign team .
Rahaf Harfoush :
Well , the funny thing about social media is that it 's so new that there are all these crazy titles out there .
I 've come across " social media ninja , " " programming herder , " " community evangelist . "
There are all types of nicknames .
I guess it was the easiest way to describe what I did — which is not just the tactical , which is part of it , but also to reflect the strategy involved in terms of incorporating social media within a company 's communication strategy or branding strategy or recruitment or retention strategy .
I find that a lot of times the strategist part is overlooked in favour of people who have a particular knowledge of an application like , " I really know Facebook . "
But not a lot of thought goes into how this ( Facebook ) is going to fit into the corporate vision and messaging and positioning .
CBCnews.ca :
How were you involved in the Obama campaign ?
Harfoush : I went down as a volunteer for the campaign for three months .
It was unbelievable to be right there at national headquarters in Chicago .
CBCnews.ca : Explain more about mybarackobama.com .
Harfoush :
It was the social network that we built , and that was the main tool that the grassroots organizers used to mobilize and blog and share information with each other .
I did a lot of things in that space — everything from language auditing , making sure the instructions were easy to understand , making sure that the tools were working , monitoring the community and conversations , you know , because there were some people that would go on and say vile things .
CBCnews.ca :
So you moderated then ?
Harfoush :
It was self - moderated , so if any members of our community saw something that was offensive they flagged it .
And we were pretty laid back about it , the only things that were ever removed were racist remarks .
Other than that , it was if you had an opinion [ then ] as long as you were respectful you could pretty much say whatever you want .
CBCnews.ca :
What do you say to people who complain that online users are mostly angry and post a lot of negative comments .
The internet 's a microcosm of the population around the world .
You 're going to have your jerks that are jerks offline and online , so , yes , you 're always going to have the hecklers and the people that just want to cause trouble .
That 's fine , but to say that we 're not going to go down this road because of the small minority of people seems a little bit ridiculous to me when the benefits are so much .
For every one angry person there are 10 or 15 genuine people that actually want to help , because , " surprise , " they care about your brand and they want you to make a better product .
CBCnews.ca :
But do you think those 10 or 15 genuine people talk as much as the heckler ?
It depends on the situation .
They [ jerks ] can be more vocal , but it does n't negate the value that those certain communities have .
You can tell right away if someone is making a point that 's constructive criticism or if someone 's just being a troll .
If you 're being a troll , you might make a lot of noise , but most people that read your comments are going to be , like , you 're just spewing nonsense .
If you have constructive criticism and you 're saying , " This is my experience with brand X , this is what they could have done better , this is how I felt about it , " that to me is a point of discussion that then you can use to come back and fix that .
CBCnews.ca : Could Obama have been as successful without the site ?
Harfoush :
It was n't about new media ; it was about the fact that the campaign gave new media the opportunity to become an integrated part of the communications campaign of a political campaign .
I think it helped us to access a lot of people by giving them to tools to organize , to create events , to connect with each others and giving them everything that they needed , so that when they went off - line they were fully equipped — be it canvassing to talk[ ing ] to their neighbours .
[ Through the site ] they had talking points to pass onto their families , videos , events in their area that were happening , community outreach programs in their state .
Everything that we did was to connect people , because it was a movement that was fundamentally about people .
And so I think that site was a very powerful conduit for channeling all that energy .
But the other part of that is that he [ Obama ] is an incredible speaker , he is an incredible person , and that energy and vision , and his personality and calmness , drew a lot of people in as well .…
You could have had all the same things in place and if it would have been someone else I 'm not sure how it would have been .
CBCnews.ca :
Is it viable that a Canadian politician could do the same thing ?
Harfoush : I 'm not sure .
Barack Obama was a community organizer , he knew how to motivate people , he had experience going out and connecting .
And if a politician wants to do the same type of thing , he 's going to have to go and build those relationships .
The technology did n't negate the fact that those relationships were being built based on the efforts of volunteers and people that were coming together .
It helped , it was easy , it was convenient you could exchange information at the speed of light .
CBCnews.ca :
So , it 's vision first , technology second .
Harfoush : Absolutely .
Once you have that [ vision ] , then social media can be used as a tool to execute .
Without that , it 's just a website .
I mean , in the last Canadian election a lot of the politicians were on Twitter , but very few of them were using it correctly .
CBCnews.ca :
How do you use Twitter correctly ?
Harfoush :
There 's no off - the - shelf solution .
Are you going to use Twitter to just blast one - way messages or are you going to talk to them , are you going to answer their questions .
What are you trying to do ?
A wrong way would be to come online and not really spend the time having conversations with people , just to continually blast one way messages all the time and then not be a part of the community .
Only talk about messages that relate to you , never submit interesting information , never help anybody out , never answer anybody 's questions , just be all about you all the time .
Which is kind of funny , because it takes a new medium [ Twitter ] and it uses an old strategy , which is a one - way communication broadcast .
Twitter is all about conversations —
I 've met friends on Twitter ; I 've had incredible conversations .
I 've gotten help on Twitter , because the community is willing to nurture and to support you .
If you come online and you 're just like yapping , yapping , yapping , yapping , well no one is going to want to hear what you want to say .
It 's about authentic conversations , really .
CBCnews.ca :
Whether you 're a politician , marketer or a journalist , would you say being involved in the conversation is a common theme in social media across the board ?
Harfoush : Absolutely .
I think social media is by its definition social .
It 's about people talking ; it 's all about conversation , sharing our vision .
Seeing what other people have to say about it and talking about it and creating something new .
As a journalist , I think it 's an incredible resource .
I know I get most of my news from Twitter now .
I heard about the terror attack in India on Twitter first , I heard about the propane explosion in Toronto on Twitter first .…
It would be helpful as a politician — what are people talking about , what do Canadians care about .
As a company , [ it would be helpful ] to be able to do reputation management and customer service , like Comcast is doing customer service and Starbucks is doing customer service on Twitter now .
CBCnews.ca : Obviously , there are some that resist the idea of an online conversation .
What needs to be in place for these things to be accepted and used ?
Harfoush : Just a sense of curiosity .
I do n't want to say that it 's a generational thing , because I 've come across a lot of people both old and young who have been very open to trying these new ways .
I think it 's being able to adapt , it 's being open to new possibilities .
The funny thing is it 's a defensive mechanism now , saying , " I do n't want to know what people are saying about my brand because it 's bad . "
The thing is that those conversations are happening whether or not you 're there or not .
So is n't it better to at least know what people are saying and be able to engage them and talk to them and create valuable relationships , than it is to just close your mind and have something explode in your face that you could have easily prevented ?
CBCnews.ca : A lot of content sites are giving readers a place to comment now .
Do all brands and sites have the same rules in terms of asking for feedback ?
Feedback is great .
Again it depends on the strategy behind it .
So are people commenting , and their comments are going to get posted , and no one 's reading them or moderating .
And not just moderating in terms of seeing what people can and can't say , but moderating in terms of guiding the discussion along .
So , what 's the purpose ?
If there 's a conversation , there 's certain message boards that have really good discussions that happen on them and people keep coming back for those discussions and then there are message boards that are just really static and the comments do n't really add any value .
It depends on the type of conversation you want , what you want to do with that audience .
And also look at whether or not a message board is the best way of soliciting feedback .
Maybe it 's best to blog a post in response or record a short video and then you get all the videos and play feedback .
It all depends on how you want to communicate and how you want people to interact with your brand , so it takes effort .
And I feel like every strategy needs to be unique , because every brand is unique .
CBCnews.ca : Going back to the journalism space , you have also done work on Now Public and other citizen journalism sites .
What about delivering so - called real facts ?
Is it jeopardized when using social media and have a lot of contributors ?
What I 've noticed is that people 's relationship with information has changed .
On the internet , you do n't need to get it from one source .…
I do n't ever get a news story from one source anymore .
Harfoush : Video response — Rahaf Harfoush on triangulating the truth .
CBCnews.ca :
At just 24 , how does your age affect what you do and what you know ?
Harfoush : A lot of times , I 'm dealing with people that are a lot older .
I come in [ to a company ] and I 'm asked to go in at a pretty high level , and a lot of them are from a different generation — a lot of boomers and older gen-Xers .
The ones who bring me in are very open , but when you are young I feel you have to work doubly as hard in terms of building a track record of implementation , of really knowing what you 're talking about and presenting the type of image that build confidence .…
With technology .
you can be very young and have a lot of experience , so it 's a matter of projecting a certain image .
My title [ social media strategist ] helped carve a niche .
I did n't want to have something that 's too wacky , where it would seem like I 'm crazy and do weird internet things [ laughs ] .
CBCNews.ca : Getting back to Obama , share some more stories .
Harfoush : People were amazing , they did a lot with it .
There was an Obama pumpkin carving group [ they carved Obama ’s face in pumpkins or one of the campaign messages such as HOPE ] and a Dungeons and Dragons group .
People would get together in their basements and call voters .
[ Note : Undecided voters lists and question forms were provided on mybarackobama.com ] .
All the campaign issues and stances could be downloaded to your iPod so that you could carry it with you .
And with the click of a button you could donate .
[ The majority of Obama 's campaign funding came from small , individual donors . ]
[ Many supporters also made video .

Western NC GOP Calls Youth Voters “ bunch of easily led , useful idiots ”
The Western North Carolina Republican
Party sent out a tweet this morning sharing an article about how students are indoctrinated by America - hating terrorist - loving radical left teachers and professors .
If this is how the Republican Party is planning on winning the youth vote , they are as dumb as I thought :
So , this is why the youth vote went to Obama … because they ’re a bunch of easily led , useful idiots .
Makes sense .
http://bit.ly/b6Jm
Someone needs to tell the Republicans in North Carolina that voters do n’t like to be pissed on .
I would n’t just post this without a call to action , so here it is :
E-mail the NC GOP Chair Linda Daves LCDaves@aol.com and Executive Director Chris McClure mcclure@ncgop.org telling them that they need to respect young voters .
If you live in North Carolina write a letter to the editor of the Raleigh News & Observer .
Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe , from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you 're out or at home .
A chat with Chris Cornell , Chris Cornell interview , Soundgarden , Scream , Timbaland
Music Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Chris Cornell came roaring out of the Seattle grunge scene as the frontman for Soundgarden , a band with a legacy which extends far beyond “ Black Hole Sun , ” but after five albums , the group came to a conclusion , and Cornell began his career as a solo artist .
Soon , however , he found himself fronting another band : Audioslave , where he worked with Tom Morello , Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk , late of Rage Against the Machine .
Fast - forward a couple more years , and Cornell was on his own again , but now he ’s completely blowing people ’s minds by having teamed up with Timbaland .
Bullz - Eye spoke with Cornell about his experiences in recording his new album , Scream , what kind of commercial expectations he has for such a unique collaboration , and whether or not the long - rumored Soundgarden box set will ever come to pass .
Bullz - Eye : Hey , Chris , how are you doing ?
Chris Cornell : Pretty good .
BE : Well , I ’ve been a fan of Soundgarden ever since I heard you guys cover Spinal Tap ’s “ Big Bottom , ” so I ’ve been one for awhile .
CC : Oh , yeah ?
I did an interview at a recording studio today , and they had the names of the members of Spinal Tap spray - painted on the parking spaces .
BE : Nice .
Which spot did you take ?
On the collaborative process : " You have to be on point .
You ’re showing up to write and record your album more or less simultaneously , so you have to be committed to the fact that , when you sit down that day , you ’re going to write a song and record it .
You might not want to put it on your album tomorrow , but that ’s still what you ’re doing to do today . "
CC : Well , I did n’t take any of them , because I did n’t get much sleep last night , so I just saw the names , thought they looked vaguely familiar , and thought , ‘ Oh , wow , those dudes must record here . ’
And then as I was parking , I thought , ‘ Now , wait a minute , something ’s wrong with that …’
And then I realized after I woke up a little bit .
( Laughs ) I think it was seeing Nigel Tufnel ’s spot that finally got me .
BE : Well , I ’ve got Scream , and I love it …
CC : Great !
BE : … and , in fact , my four - star review is going to run tomorrow …
CC : Excellent !
BE : … but here ’s my question : why did you decide to make it ?
Because it ’s jaw - droppingly different from anything you ’ve done before .
CC : Really , for fun .
I mean , I had been kind of thinking of doing different collaborations , even like in the electronic and hip - hop world , and I was coincidentally looking for re-mixers at a time when Timbaland ’s name came up as someone who was interested in working with somebody from the world of rock , kind of .
And I did n’t really know what that meant , but without actually speaking to him , I heard back that he was n’t really interested in doing remixes , but he was a fan , and he was interested in maybe doing some original songs .
So that got me kind of wanting to talk to him about it , at least , and see where he was at .
And right away , he recited a line from “ Disappearing One , ” from Euphoria Morning , which I was kind of shocked by .
I mean , it took me a second to realize what song he was reciting lyrics from !
I just sort of expected something like , “ Yeah , I ’ve heard of you , I remember you from ‘ Black Hole Sun , ’ ” that kind of thing .
Or maybe he’d be familiar with Audioslave .
But that kind of sparked my interest , so we were talking about doing original material , and he mentioned doing two or three songs .
I ’d heard that he does albums really quickly … like , in two or three weeks , like the Justin Timberlake record .
Suddenly this light bulb went off , and I thought , “ Would n’t it be an interesting experiment to just go in and make an album , the whole thing , with him ? ”
Because I would n’t really know what to do with , like , three songs .
There ’s that new pop method where you record with three or four different producers and put it out on one album , but that just feels like throwing darts to me , like someone ’s just trying a bunch of different producers to see if one of them strikes gold and have a hit song .
You know what I mean ?
BE : Absolutely .
On meeting with Timbaland : " He recited a line from ‘ Disappearing One , ’ from Euphoria Morning , which I was kind of shocked by .
I mean , it took me a second to realize what song he was reciting lyrics from !
I just sort of expected something like , ‘ Yeah , I ’ve heard of you , I remember you from “ Black Hole Sun . "
CC : But the concept of a whole album to me …
I could already tell that this would be completely different from anything I ’d ever done if I ’d just let him be him and I could be me .
It ’d be an exciting thing and a challenging thing .
And I ’d been doing a lot of stuff that ’d been unusual .
I ’d written a song with Brian House .
I was going to be doing a “ Storytellers ” - like kind of thing , and I ’d wanted a new song , so I worked with him just based on somebody saying that he ’d wanted to write a song or two with me .
And it turned out really great .
I did n’t do the “ Storytellers ” thing , because I ended up doing this Timbaland project , and that did n’t really fit – I ’ll do that some other day – but I wrote the song with him , and it was the first time I ’d ever really sat down with someone I ’d never met before to write a song .
Well , except for the members of Audioslave … ( Laughs ) … who I ’d met , but , y’know , I did n’t really know them .
And then I did “ You Know My Name ” for “ Casino Royale ” with David Arnold , who became a really good friend of mine , and I had a really great experience with him .
And I just thought that , rather than use a producer in the normal producer capacity , like I did with Carry On with Steve Lillywrite , this would be different .
This would be kind of like a collaborator , and in a musical world that would be completely different .
And I was kind of interested in that , especially with the writing and recording process being pretty much … I mean , you have to be on point .
You ’re showing up to write and record your album more or less simultaneously , so you have to be committed to the fact that , when you sit down that day , you ’re going to write a song and record it .
You might not want to put it on your album tomorrow , but that ’s still what you ’re doing to do today .
And there ’s something about that that I really like .
But it ’s a little bit terrifying .
You have to believe in yourself and the person you ’re working with enough to make that commitment , and there is n’t ’ really any second guessing happening while you ’re doing it .
And that ’s something that , frankly , is one of the reasons why I like not being in a band .
I loved being in a band when I was in a band at the different times that I was , but one of things that any member of any band will tell you is that there ’s the pausing to get a committee to vote on something , pausing to get someone else ’s reaction , pausing to try and read someone else ’s reaction , even if you do n’t believe what they ’re saying .
This is sort of the opposite .
There ’s no concern about reaction , and , really , there ’s not even a real concern about the outcome as much as there is the process .
You make the decision later as to what it means and if you like it or not .
But making a commitment to completely work with someone you do n’t know , even if maybe you ’re working in a way that ’s unusual , all of that really appealed to me .
BE : So did either of you come in with sketches of songs , or did you literally build it from the ground up ?
CC : No , I actually had planned on a week or two weeks of just kind of sitting around and coming up with ideas of my own – riffs or parts or lyrical ideas , that kind of thing – but about a week before we started , I just abandoned that idea , because I already was n’t having as much fun as I wanted to have .
I was trying to be prepared for something that was unpredictable , and it just seemed so stupid all of a sudden .
So when we went in , neither of us brought anything in …and I sat there for two days waiting for Timbaland to bring in the first beat idea .
We had a conversation on Day 1 about where to go , and how we should proceed , and we just both decided that the best thing to do was that he ’d do what he normally does , and then I ’d do what I normally do over it .
Keep it simple .
( Laughs )
And with that , we did n’t really discuss any musical direction , any genre direction , or have any concern about genre , period .
The only discussions we ever had about the directions of songs were the ones you ’d normally have with any producer in any situation , which is , y’know , “ This song seems to do the same job as that song , in terms of its overall feel , ” and that kind of thing .
Otherwise , we really just wrote and recorded .
BE : So what are your commercial expectations for the album ?
Because people who listen to dance music … and this is certainly easy to dance to …are generally pretty accepting of anyone who tries something different , but at the same time , I ’d have to guess that there are Audioslave and Soundgarden fans who are weeping even as we have this conversation .
CC : Well , the thing is , there is n’t anything to gauge it by , so I do n’t really have any expectations .
It ’s not really like anything else .
Even the collaboration as a whole is n’t like anything else .
This is n’t like other hard rock bands having cameos from hip - hop guys or hip - hop guys co-writing or producing hard rock guys .
Generally , what that sounds like and what it looks like on paper is an aggressive drum loop with a lot of fuzzy guitars , and then a guy is sort of screaming vocals over it , and then there ’s a 16 - bar breakdown with a rap in it .
None of my record is like that .
Not to mention the fact that it then became this one hour of continuous music … ( Laughs ) … which happened after the songs were written .
And the influences seemed to come from a lot of different places .
So I ca n’t really compare it to anything , nor can anyone else , as far as holding it up to someone else ’s album and their commercial performance .
So with that , I really do n’t have any specific expectations .
I do n’t know what it will do .
I think it ’s very similar to any album that anybody releases , in that if it strikes a chord , people will buy it .
And how and when that happens is always kind of unpredictable .
BE : The album actually ends with “ Two Drink Minimum , ” which is a bluesy rock number that ’s unlike anything else before it .
Should that be taken as a hope that the next album will not necessarily follow the same mold , that you ’re just trying something different ?
CC : It should be taken that all hope should be dashed that I will repeat the same sound of this album .
BE : I know we ’re on a schedule here , so I ’ve got some random questions about various moments from your career .
First off , did you breathe a sigh of relief when Matt Cameron permanently replaced you as Soundgarden ’s drummer ?
CC : Well , the first guy that replaced me was Scott Sundquist .
That was about a year before Matt , and in that year , I definitely was replaced , y’know ?
It was clear that , when Scott was n’t going to be in the band anymore , we were going to get another drummer .
So , yeah , I was definitely having a much better time , and the live shows immediately took a turn .
That ’s when we really started getting a bigger audience , because Seattle , at the time , had these really stringent liquor laws and minor musicians laws , and you could n’t do all - ages shows where alcohol was served in any way .
You could n’t do all - ages shows , period , because of insurance issues .
So , basically , we were doing bar gigs or illegal shows , and it was really hard to get an audience to form that would follow you in that scene , anyway .
So once we became a four - piece , we already had a bit of a following , but that was when we really started to play in front of real numbers in our own town , because the show took a turn and became something else completely .
And I was never very good at singing or drumming when I was doing both at the same time .
It was hard .
BE : Did you just take on drumming duties by default ?
CC : Actually , I started as a drummer , so I sort of took on singing duties by default !
( Laughs ) I had sung backgrounds and some lead vocals from behind the drums in different bands that I ’d been in , and I ’d gotten great responses for the songs I would sing .
I really started pursuing the possibility of being a lead singer based on the fact that I was working a full - time restaurant job and then playing gigs at night , hauling drums around .
One day , it just dawned on me that , “ Hey , I could be in a band and be the singer , and it would be a lot easier ! ”
I literally started imagining myself with my own SM57 in a little case , taking it out of my glove box , instead of unloading a trunk full of hardware from my four - door ’ 69 Toyota Corona .
( Laughs ) I really enjoyed playing drums , and the original Soundgarden songs … the ones that we refer to as The First Fifteen , ‘ cause they were the first songs that we wrote … a lot of those songs were kind of based on jams surrounding these drum beats and jungle rhythms that I would come up with .
And I really enjoyed that .
When it came time to sort of become a four - piece band versus a three - piece , I was open to being replaced as the singer equally to being replaced as the drummer , as long as it was somebody who was great .
And there just was n’t anybody .
It turned out to be six years later when all of a sudden all of these great singers started emerging from bands from different areas in the Northwest ; at that time , though , there was just nobody we could find .
We kind of knew everybody in the scene , and nobody could sing … well , y’know , better than me , at least .
( Laughs )
So it was kind of by default .
And a pretty short period of time after we started , I grew a lot as a singer , too , just from on - the - job training and a lot of rehearsals , experimenting with my voice .
A lot of the experimentation came from being a fan of post - punk indie music , where everybody that was a singer in that world was expressive .
It was a cool time .
BE : What ’s the oldest song in your sets nowadays ?
CC : Probably something from 1989 or 1990 .
I do things from Louder Than Love , and …the songs that I do , I do n’t really remember exactly when I wrote them , so it could ’ve been ’ 89 or it could ’ve been ’ 90 .
But that ’s about as far back as it goes .
BE : How was Steve Lillywhite to work with as a producer ?
Because I always think of him as the master of ‘ 80s bombast , but how was he with a current sound ?
On Soundgarden : " When I was a kid , I discovered bands that had been broken up but that I ’d been turned on to by my older brothers .
I think it ’s important that a ( Soundgarden ) box set come out , and that a B - sides album comes out , and that we have an active website , where people can be active fans of the band . "
CC : Well , with me , there was no bombast .
( Laughs )
As a person , he was this guy who…well , you look at just the scope of his career and how many records the guy has sold with his name on them , but he had no personal assistants , and he did n’t have a Blackberry blowing up all the time .
He just drove himself to the studio in a little Mini that he rented , and he had a little backpack , and he was just super down to earth and really easy - going .
BE : How did Jason Falkner come to play on Euphoria Morning ?
CC : To be honest , I do n’t remember who recommended him , but I ’m pretty sure that he was friends with Alain Johannes .
I ’m not sure if it came from him first or who brought up the idea , but he was somebody to use .
( Writer ’s note :
On a whim , I decided to drop a line to Falkner on Facebook to see if his memory was any better , and he confirmed that it was indeed Johannes – along with Natasha Schneider – who brought him into the mix .
“ I did n't really hang too much with Chris , ” recalled Falkner , “ but I think he wanted me to be in the touring band for that record .
But I was busy with my own stuff .
I do remember that Chris and I went to a Starbucks ; I have never been so invisible to the opposite sex or so eclipsed by another human .
Funny , that . ” )
BE : I ’m sure you ’ve been asked about the possibility of a Soundgarden reunion a thousand times , but I ’m just as curious if there ’s been any forward movement with the possible Soundgarden box set – including B - sides and rarities – that Kim ( Thayil ) has brought up in interviews .
CC : Well , no , but we ’ve met a few times recently to talk about that kind of stuff , and we all seem to be motivated enough to at least in a room and talk about it more than we have been in a long time .
And I think it ’s one of those things where it ’s probably kind of overdue .
I think that we made a huge contribution to our generation of rock music , and when it comes to the business representatives of Soundgarden , I think they kind of let Soundgarden down as far as keeping our legacy out there and active .
We need to kind of go back in , I think , and get some things going to , y’know , get stuff out there to our fans …and to new fans , because new fans are being made .
Like , when I was a kid , I discovered bands that had been broken up but that I ’d been turned on to by my older brothers .
I think it ’s important that a box set come out , and that a B - sides album comes out , and that we have an active website , where people can be active fans of the band , and merchandising and things like that .
I think we were an important band .
BE : And I know I ’m up against the wall with my time , but I promised one of my best friends … the first one who introduced me to Soundgarden , actually … that I ’d ask this : what would it take for you to sing “ Beyond the Wheel ” at her 40th birthday party , preferably shirtless ?
CC : A hundred million dollars .
BE : Is that with or without a shirt ?
CC : Without a shirt .
BE : Okay , I ’ll quote her the figure .
CC : Okay .
( Laughs )
BE : Well , it ’s been good talking with you , and good luck with Scream .
CC : Thank you , I appreciate it .
Take care .
LOS ANGELES  Kelly Peña , or “ the kid whisperer , ” as some Hollywood producers call her , was digging through a 12 - year - old boy ’s dresser drawer here on a recent afternoon .
Her undercover mission : to unearth what makes him tick and use the findings to help the Walt Disney Company reassert itself as a cultural force among boys .
Ms. Peña , a Disney researcher with a background in the casino industry , zeroed in on a ratty rock ’ n ’ roll T - shirt .
Black Sabbath ?
“ Wearing it makes me feel like I ’m going to an R - rated movie , ” said Dean , a shy redhead whose parents asked that he be identified only by first name .
Jackpot .
Ms. Peña and her team of anthropologists have spent 18 months peering inside the heads of incommunicative boys in search of just that kind of psychological nugget .
Disney is relying on her insights to create new entertainment for boys 6 to 14 , a group that Disney used to own way back in the days of “ Davy Crockett ” but that has wandered in the age of more girl - friendly Disney fare like “ Hannah Montana . ”
( CNN ) -- Adam Wilson posted two messages on Twitter on April 15 .
The first one , " GO BADGERS , " might have been sent by any University of Wisconsin - Madison student cheering for the school team .
The brain - computer interface allows people to compose a tweet by focusing on the desired letter .
His second post , 20 minutes later , was a little more unusual : " SPELLING WITH MY BRAIN . "
Wilson , a doctoral student in biomedical engineering , was confirming an announcement he had made two weeks earlier -- his lab had developed a way to post messages on Twitter using electrical impulses generated by thought .
That 's right , no keyboards , just a red cap fitted with electrodes that monitor brain activity , hooked up to a computer flashing letters on a screen .
Wilson sent the messages by concentrating on the letters he wanted to " type , " then focusing on the word " twit " at the bottom of the screen to post the message .
The development could be a lifeline for people with " locked - in syndrome " -- whose brains function normally but who cannot speak or move because of injury or disease .
Wilson and his supervisor , Justin Williams , made the breakthrough last month after hearing a question posed on the radio .
Watch a demonstration of the technology »
" Would n't it be great if you could Twitter just by thinking about it ? "
That query sparked what Williams called the " a - ha moment . "
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .
See more from the show »
" We can do that , " said Williams , an assistant professor and the principal investigator at the lab in Madison , Wisconsin .
" We can do that tomorrow . "
In the end , it was n't quite " tomorrow , " Williams said , but Wilson had written the software to link existing technology with Twitter " within a couple of days " of starting on the project in March .
He sent Williams his first " tweet " -- or message -- from the brain - computer interface on March 31 .
Watch Dr. Gupta explain how it works »
" I had set up my phone to get Twitter updates , and I walked in my door and got this message , and I knew it was really possible , " he told CNN by phone .
" My wife was sitting there , and I showed her the message and she immediately got excited about it -- and it's rare that I come home from work and she gets excited about what I have been doing . "
That 's because using the brain to post Twitter messages is potentially much more than an academic exercise or a party trick -- it could help paralyzed people communicate .
" These are people who have ALS , like Stephen Hawking , or they have a brainstem stroke , or a high spinal - cord injury , " Williams explained .
" There is nothing wrong with these people 's brains .
It 's a normal person , locked into a lifeless , useless body . "
( The British physicist Hawking has ALS , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which is also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease . )
Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from locked - in syndrome , Williams estimated .
Many of them want just the kind of ability the brain - Twitter project seems to offer , said Kevin Otto , an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Purdue University in Indiana .
" The interesting thing about this project is they are directly addressing some of the patient desires , " he said .
" A lot of people think [ locked - in patients ] want to walk and want fancy prosthetics , but a lot of times what they want are bladder control and basic communication skills . "
Otto , who was not involved in the University of Wisconsin project , called it " a very important incremental step to take two existing technologies and marry them together like this . "
Williams had been working on brain - computer interface technology " for many years , " he told CNN , before the idea to use Twitter .
" The technology we were developing was 10 or more years down the line , so we started wondering , ' Is there something we can do now ? ' "
His lab at the University of Wisconsin -- like those at Brown University , Purdue and the Wadsworth Center in Albany , New York , among others -- is developing ways for locked - in people to communicate .
Projects range from manipulating a cursor on a computer screen to operating a robotic arm , and they can include devices physically implanted into a brain .
But the Twitter project has a lot of advantages , Williams said .
" Twitter fits so many of our needs and patients ' capabilities , " he said .
" Their first interest is in being able to communicate in a normal fashion , and at a distance . "
Twitter is simpler than e-mail , he said .
" If I am locked in and I want to e-mail someone , the format is all wrong .
You have to be able to select recipients and group them , copy , paste , send .
...
We do n't think about that much as normal people , but it can become unmanageable .
" Twitter takes care of all those things .
They just have to get [ the message ] to a location where people can come and find it , " he said .
Locked - in people communicating by tweet might have followers who do n't even realize they are disabled , Williams said .
" Nobody 's going to notice that the person at the other end is disabled .
They might not have any idea .
And that might be very empowering for people , " he said .
The interface is not unlike the method the French journalist Jean - Dominique Bauby used to dictate his novel " The Diving Bell and the Butterfly " -- later turned into a movie -- after a massive stroke left him paralyzed except for his left eyelid .
Bauby 's caregivers recited letters of the alphabet ; he blinked when he heard the one he wanted and they wrote them down .
The brain - Twitter application flashes letters on a screen while the user , wearing a cap fitted with electrodes , concentrates on a letter .
" When the letter that you are concentrating on flashes , we can pick that up , " Williams said .
Williams declined to say how soon the interface could be available commercially , noting it has not yet been used by anyone with locked - in syndrome .
" I 'd hate to speculate about things being on the market , " he said .
" Adam [ Wilson ] is going to graduate in May , and his next role is to start preclinical trials with subjects in New York and Germany . "
But Williams said he is excited about the development .
" We were interested in seeing what we could do right now to help people , " he said .
" The field has come far enough that we need to start getting to people in their homes . "
CNN senior medical producer Shahreen Abedin contributed to this report .

Mahatma Gandhi led a non-violent campaign against British rule Mahatma Gandhi 's iconic spectacles , which he once said gave him " the vision to free India " , are to be sold at an auction in New York .
A pair of the Indian independence leader 's sandals and his pocket watch also form part of the sale next month .
Auctioneers have put an estimate of £ 30,000 ( $ 42,000 ) on the items but expect the winning bid to be higher .
Because Gandhi had so few possessions , the sale is expected to attract huge attention from across the world .
Gandhi presented the spectacles to Indian army Colonel H A Shiri Diwan Nawabin in the 1930s , after he had asked the great leader for inspiration .
" Gandhi gave him the glasses and said : ' These gave me the vision to free India ' , " said Michelle Halpern , from Antiquorum Auctioneers in New York which will stage the sale on 4 - 5 March .
Peaceful resistance Gandhi's modest lifestyle - epitomised by his simple white robe and few possessions - helped to inspire a generation of Indians to peaceful resistance against British rule in the 1930s .
The glasses , sandals and watch , along with a bowl and plate , are owned by an unnamed collector and all have letters of authenticity .
The Zenith pocket watch , made in about 1910 , was given to Gandhi 's grand - niece , Abha Gandhi , who was his assistant for some years .
Gandhi was pictured wearing the pocket watch and it is expected to be the highlight of the auction .
All of Gandhi's things should be ideally placed in a museum or place where the public has access to it
Ramachandra Rahi , Gandhi Memorial Foundation
The bowl and plate were also gifts to his grand - niece .
The sandals were given to a British army officer in 1931 before talks in London about Indian self - rule .
" He did n't have much , so anything of his that comes up for sale is worth that much more , " Ms Halpern told The Telegraph , in London .
" He 's a hero not just in India but across the world for his peaceful methods and the changes he made .
" The items were put together by a collector who is now selling them and there has already been a great deal of interest .
I am sure the items will sell for more than the estimate . "
However , in India some followers of Gandhi have said they hope that the buyers will put the objects into the public domain .
" All of Gandhi 's things should be ideally placed in a museum or place where the public has access to it .
It should be available to future generations to see and draw inspiration from , " Ramachandra Rahi , secretary of the Gandhi Memorial Foundation in Delhi , told the Indo - Asian News Service .
Gandhi - called Mahatma or " Great Soul " - spearheaded a non-violent campaign against the British Empire .
He was assassinated in 1948 , aged 78 , by a Hindu radical .

MUNICH , Germany , April 16 ( UPI ) -- German - led scientists say they have discovered an important element of DNA that creates good night vision in nocturnal mammals .
Ludwig - Maximilians University researchers in Munich said they discovered the DNA within the photoreceptor rod cells responsible for low light vision turns the rod cell nuclei themselves into tiny light - collecting lenses , with millions of them in every nocturnal eye .

" The conventional architecture seen in almost all nuclei is invariably present in the rod cells of diurnal mammals , including primates , pigs and squirrels , " said researcher Boris Joffe .
" On the other hand , the unique inverted architecture is universally present in nocturnal mammals . "
That architecture has important ramifications for the optical properties of those cells , said Jochen Guck of the University of Cambridge .
" Diurnal nuclei are basically scattering obstacles , " he said .
" In nocturnal animals , they are little lenses .
In one case , light is scattered in all directions and in the other it is focused in the forward direction , " meaning that even at night , what little light there is can travel deeper into the eye where it can be perceived .
The research is detailed in the journal Cell .
